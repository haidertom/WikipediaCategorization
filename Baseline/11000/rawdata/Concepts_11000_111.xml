      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13772">The '''2R hypothesis''' or '''Ohno's hypothesis''', first proposed by [[Susumu Ohno]] in 1970,&lt;ref name=Ohno70&gt;Ohno, Susumu (1970). ''Evolution by Gene Duplication.'' London: Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-575015-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[hypothesis]] that the genomes of the early [[vertebrate]] lineage underwent two complete [[genome duplication]]s, and thus modern vertebrate genomes reflect [[paleopolyploidy]].  The name derives from the '''''2 r'''ounds'' of duplication originally hypothesized by Ohno, but refined in a 1994 version, and the term ''2R hypothesis'' was probably coined in 1999. Variations in the number and timings of genome duplications typically still are referred to as examples of the 2R hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Hokamp&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hokamp | first1 = K | last2 = McLysaght | first2 = A | last3 = Wolfe | first3 = KH|authorlink3=Kenneth H. Wolfe|authorlink2=Aoife McLysaght | title = The 2R hypothesis and the human genome sequence | journal = Journal of Structural and Functional Genomics | volume = 3 | issue = 1–4 | pages = 95–110 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12836689 | doi = 10.1023/A:1022661917301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2R hypothesis has been the subject of much research and controversy; however, with growing support from genome data, including the [[human genome]], the balance of opinion has shifted strongly in favour of support for the hypothesis. According to Karsten Hokamp, [[Aoife McLysaght]] and [[Kenneth H. Wolfe]],&lt;ref name=Hokamp/&gt; the version of the genome duplication hypothesis from which 2R hypothesis takes its name appears in Holland ''et al.''&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Holland | first1 = PW | last2 = Garcia-Fernàndez | first2 = J | last3 = Williams | first3 = NA | last4 = Sidow | first4 = A | title = Gene duplications and the origins of vertebrate development | journal = Development. Supplement | pages = 125–33 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7579513 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was coined by Austin L. Hughes.&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = Austin L. | title = Phylogenies of developmentally important proteins do not support the hypothesis of two rounds of genome duplication early in vertebrate history | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Evolution]] | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 565–76 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10198122 | doi = 10.1007/PL00006499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohno's argument==
Ohno presented the first version of the 2R hypothesis as part of his larger argument for the general importance of [[gene duplication]] in [[evolution]].  Based on relative genome sizes and [[isozyme]] analysis, he suggested that ancestral fish or amphibians had undergone at least one and possibly more cases of "tetraploid evolution". He later added to this argument the evidence that most [[paralogous genes]] in vertebrates do not demonstrate [[genetic linkage]].  Ohno argued that linkage should be expected in the case of individual [[tandem duplications]] (in which a duplicate gene is added adjacent to the original gene on the same chromosome), but not in the case of chromosome duplications.&lt;ref name=Makalowski&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Makalowski | first1 = Wojciech | title = Are we polyploids? A brief history of one hypothesis | journal = [[Genome Research]] | volume = 11 | issue = 5 | pages = 667–70 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11337465 | doi = 10.1101/gr.188801 }} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later evidence==
In 1977, Schmidtke and colleagues showed that [[isozyme]] complexity is similar in [[lancelet]]s and [[tunicates]], contradicting a prediction of Ohno's hypothesis that [[genome duplication]] occurred in the common ancestor of lancets and [[vertebrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidtke|first=Jörg|last2=Weiler |first2=Conrad |last3=Kunz |first3=Brigitte |last4=Engel |first4=Wolfgang|title=Isozymes of a tunicate and a cephalochordate as a test of polyploidisation in chordate evolution|journal=Nature|year=1977|volume=266|issue=5602|pages=532–533|doi=10.1038/266532a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this analysis did not examine vertebrates, so could say nothing about later duplication events.&lt;ref name="Holland 2003 75–84"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=PW|title=More genes in vertebrates?|journal=Journal of structural and functional genomics|year=2003|volume=3|issue=1-4|pages=75–84|pmid=12836687|doi=10.1023/a:1022656931587}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Furthermore, much later [[molecular phylogenetics]] has shown that vertebrates are more closely related to tunicates than to lancelets, thus negating the logic of this analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delsuc|first=F|author2=Brinkmann, H |author3=Chourrout, D |author4=Philippe, H|title=Tunicates and not cephalochordates are the closest living relatives of vertebrates.|journal=Nature|year=2006|volume=439|issue=7079|pages=965–8|pmid=16495997|doi=10.1038/nature04336}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The 2R hypothesis saw a resurgence of interest in the 1990s for two reasons. First, gene mapping data in humans and mice revealed extensive [[paralogy regions]] - sets of genes on one chromosome related to sets of genes on another chromosome in the same species, indicative of duplication events in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lundin|first=LG|title=Evolution of the vertebrate genome as reflected in paralogous chromosomal regions in man and the house mouse.|journal=Genomics|date=April 1993|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–19|pmid=8486346|doi=10.1006/geno.1993.1133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paralogy regions were generally in sets of four. Second, cloning of [[Hox gene]]s in lancelet revealed presence of a single [[Hox gene cluster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garcia-Fernández|first=J|author2=Holland, PW|title=Archetypal organization of the amphioxus Hox gene cluster.|journal=Nature|date=Aug 18, 1994|volume=370|issue=6490|pages=563–6|pmid=7914353|doi=10.1038/370563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to the four clusters in humans and mice. Data from additional [[gene families]] revealed a common one-to-many rule when lancelet and vertebrate genes were compared.&lt;ref name="Holland 2003 75–84"/&gt; Taken together, these two lines of evidence suggest that two genome duplications occurred in the ancestry of vertebrates, after it had diverged from the [[cephalochordate]] evolutionary lineage.

[[File:Patró de gens - Hipòtesi 2R.png|thumb|300px|right|Pattern predicted for the relative locations of paralogous genes from two genome duplications&lt;ref name="Dehal e314"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehal|first=Paramvir|author2=Boore, Jeffrey L.|title=Two Rounds of Whole Genome Duplication in the Ancestral Vertebrate|journal=[[PLOS Biology]]|year= 2005|volume=3|issue=10|pages=e314|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030314|pmid= 16128622 |pmc=1197285 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Controversy about the 2R hypothesis hinged on the nature of [[paralogy regions]]. It is not disputed that human [[chromosomes]] bear sets of genes related to sets of genes on other chromosomes; the controversy centres on whether they were generated by large-scale duplications that doubled all the genes at the same time, or whether a series of individual [[gene duplication]]s occurred followed by [[chromosomal rearrangement]] to shuffle sets of genes together. Hughes and colleagues found that [[phylogenetic trees]] built from different [[gene families]] within [[paralogy regions]] had different shapes, suggesting that the gene families had different evolutionary histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=AL|title=Phylogenies of developmentally important proteins do not support the hypothesis of two rounds of genome duplication early in vertebrate history|journal=Journal of Molecular Evolution|date=May 1999|volume=48|issue=5|pages=565–76|pmid=10198122|doi=10.1007/PL00006499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Austin L.|author2=Friedman, Robert|title=2R or not 2R: Testing hypotheses of [[genome duplication]] in early vertebrates|journal=Journal of Structural and Functional Genomics|year= 2003|volume=3|issue=1/4|pages=85–93|doi=10.1023/A:1022681600462}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was suggested to be inconsistent with the 2R hypothesis. However, other researchers have argued that such 'topology tests' do not test 2R rigorously, because [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] could have occurred between the closely related chromosomes generated by [[polyploidy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlong|first=RF|author2=Holland, PW|title=Were vertebrates octoploid?|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|year=2002|volume=357|issue=1420|pages=531–44|pmid=12028790|doi=10.1098/rstb.2001.1035|pmc=1692965}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=VJ|author2=Wagner, GP|title=Multiple chromosomal rearrangements structured the ancestral vertebrate Hox-bearing protochromosomes.|journal=[[PLOS Genetics]]|year=2009|volume=5|issue=1|pages=e1000349|pmid=19165336|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000349|pmc=2622764}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; because inappropriate genes had been compared&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larhammar|first=D.|author2=Josephson, M|title=The Human Hox-bearing Chromosome Regions Did Arise by Block or Chromosome (or Even Genome) Duplications|journal=[[Genome Research]]|year= 2002|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1910–1920|doi=10.1101/gr.445702|pmc=187569|pmid=12466295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because different predictions are made if genome duplication occurred through [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spring|first=Jürg|title=Vertebrate evolution by interspecific hybridisation – are we polyploid?|journal=FEBS Letters|year= 1997|volume=400|issue=1|pages=2–8|doi=10.1016/S0014-5793(96)01351-8}} {{free access}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several researchers were able to date duplications of gene families within [[paralogy regions]] consistently to the early evolution of vertebrates, after divergence from amphioxus, consistent with the 2R hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abi-Rached|first=L|author2=Gilles, A |author3=Shiina, T |author4=Pontarotti, P |author5=Inoko, H |title=Evidence of en bloc duplication in vertebrate genomes.|journal=[[Nature Genetics]]|year=2002|volume=31|issue=1|pages=100–5|pmid=11967531|doi=10.1038/ng855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=LF|author2=Holland, PW|title=Chromosomal mapping of ANTP class homeobox genes in amphioxus: piecing together ancestral genomes.|journal=[[Evolution &amp; Development]]|date=Sep–Oct 2003|volume=5|issue=5|pages=459–65|pmid=12950625|doi=10.1046/j.1525-142x.2003.03052.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When complete [[genome sequences]] became available for vertebrates, ''[[Ciona intestinalis]]'' and lancelets, it was found that much of the [[human genome]] was arranged in [[paralogy regions]] that could be traced to large-scale duplications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLysaght|first=Aoife|authorlink1=Aoife McLysaght|author2=Hokamp, Karsten |author3=Wolfe, Kenneth H.|authorlink3=Kenneth H.

The controversy raging in the late 1990s was summarized in a 2001 review of the subject by Wojciech Makałowski, who stated that "the hypothesis of whole genome duplications in the early stages of vertebrate evolution has as many adherents as opponents".&lt;ref name=Makalowski/&gt;

In contrast, a more recent review in 2007 by Masanori Kasahara states that there is now "incontrovertible evidence supporting the 2R hypothesis" and that "a long-standing debate on the 2R hypothesis is approaching the end".&lt;ref name=Kasahara&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kasahara | first1 = Masanori | title = The 2R hypothesis: an update | journal = Current Opinion in Immunology | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 547–52 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17707623 | doi = 10.1016/j.coi.2007.07.009 }} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Benton]], in the 2014 edition of ''[[Vertebrate Palaeontology (Benton)|Vertebrate Palaeontology]]'', states, "It turns out that, in places where [[amphioxus]] has a single gene, vertebrates often have two, three, or four equivalent genes as a result of two intervening whole-genome duplication events."&lt;ref name="Benton2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Benton|title=Vertebrate Palaeontology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qak-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT92|accessdate=19 December 2015|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-40764-6|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexis Dworsky''' (born May 14, 1976, in [[Freising]]) is an [[conceptual art]]ist and [[Cultural studies|cultural scientist]] from Germany. He performs artistic research that combine practical and theoretical approaches.

== Biography ==
Dworsky initially studied landscape architecture at the Technical University of Munich, followed by studies at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts in Munich]] with [[Res Ingold]]. Dworsky received his doctorate in 2011 from [[Bazon Brock]] in [[aesthetics]] at the [[University of Wuppertal]] on the cultural history of the dinosaur. From 2001 to 2007, Dworsky was curator in the art space Lothringer13, Munich. From 2012 to 2018, he was a teacher at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich.

Dworsky works as a freelance artist, cultural scientist, and curator. In particular, Dworsky works in and about the [[public space]].  A peculiarity of Dworsky's approach is to also regard the digital-media space as a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexisdworsky.de/|title=Alexis Dworsky|last=Dworsky|first=Alexis|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Algorithm characterizations''' are attempts to formalize the word [[algorithm]]. Algorithm does not have a generally accepted formal definition. Researchers&lt;ref&gt;cf [164] Andreas Blass and Yuri Gurevich "Algorithms: A Quest for Absolute Definitions" Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science Number 81 (October 2003), pages 195–225. Reprinted in Chapter on Logic in Computer Science Current Trends in Theoretical Computer Science World Scientific, 2004, pages 283–311 Reprinted in Church's Thesis After 70 Years Ontos Verlag, 2006, 24–57}, or http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/FutureOfLogic/paper.pdf (cited in a 2007 Dershowitz–Gurevich paper): Samual R. Buss, [[Alexander S. Kechris]], Anand Pillay, and Richard A. Shore, “The Prospects for Mathematical Logic in the Twenty-first Century”.&lt;/ref&gt; are actively working on this problem. This article will present some of the "characterizations" of the notion of "algorithm" in more detail.

== The problem of definition ==
Over the last 200 years the definition of algorithm has become more complicated and detailed as researchers have tried to pin down the term. Indeed, there may be more than one type of "algorithm". But most agree that algorithm has something to do with defining generalized processes for the creation of "output" integers from other "input" integers – "input parameters" arbitrary and infinite in extent, or limited in extent but still variable—by the manipulation of distinguishable symbols (counting numbers) with finite collections of rules that a person can perform with paper and pencil.

The most common number-manipulation schemes—both in formal mathematics and in routine life—are: (1) the [[computable function|recursive functions]] calculated by a person with paper and pencil, and (2) the [[Turing machine]] or its Turing equivalents—the primitive [[register machine]] or "counter machine" model, the [[Random Access Machine]] model (RAM), the [[Random access stored program machine]] model (RASP) and its functional equivalent "the [[computer]]".

When we are doing "arithmetic" we are really calculating by the use of "recursive functions" in the shorthand algorithms we learned in grade-school, for example, adding and subtracting.

The proofs that every "recursive function" we can ''calculate by hand'' we can ''compute by machine'' and vice versa—note the usage of the words ''calculate'' versus ''compute''—is remarkable. But this equivalence together with the ''thesis'' (unproven assertion) that this includes ''every'' calculation/computation indicates why so much emphasis has been placed upon the use of [[Turing machine equivalents|Turing-equivalent]] machines in the definition of specific algorithms, and why the definition of "algorithm" itself often refers back to "the [[Turing machine]]". This is discussed in more detail under '''Stephen Kleene's characterization'''.

The following are summaries of the more famous characterizations (Kleene, Markov, Knuth) together with those that introduce novel elements—elements that further expand the definition or contribute to a more precise definition.

[
&lt;small&gt;A mathematical problem and its result can be considered as two points in a space, and the solution consists of a sequence of steps or a path linking them. Quality of the solution is a function of the path. There might be more than one attribute defined for the path, e.g. length, complexity of shape, an ease of generalizing, difficulty, and so on&lt;/small&gt;.

== Chomsky hierarchy == &lt;!-- at 1956 --&gt;
There is more consensus on the "characterization" of the notion of "simple algorithm".

All algorithms need to be specified in a formal language, and the "simplicity notion" arises from the simplicity of the language. The [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky (1956) hierarchy]] is a [[containment hierarchy]] of classes of [[formal grammar]]s that generate [[formal language]]s. It is used for [[Taxonomy (general)|classifying]] of [[programming language]]s and [[abstract machine]]s.

From the ''Chomsky hierarchy'' perspective, if the algorithm can be specified on a simpler language (than  unrestricted), it can be  characterized by this kind of language, else it is a typical "unrestricted algorithm".

Examples: a "general purpose" macro language, like [[M4 (computer language)|M4]] is unrestricted ([[Turing complete]]), but the [[C preprocessor|C preprocessor macro language]] is not, so any algorithm expressed in ''C preprocessor'' is a "simple algorithm".

== Features of a Good Algorithm == 

{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}

The following are the features of a good algorithm.
1. Precision: a good algorithm must have a certain outlined steps. The steps should be exact enough, and not varying.
2. Uniqueness: each step taken in the algorithm should give a definite result as stated by the writer of the algorithm. The results should not fluctuate by any means.
3. Feasibility: the algorithm should be possible and practicable in real life. It should not be abstract or imaginary.
4. Input: a good algorithm must be able to accept a set of defined input.
5. Output: a good algorithm should be able to produce results as output, preferably solutions.
6. Finiteness: the algorithm should have a stop after a certain number of instructions.
7. Generality: the algorithm must apply to a set of defined inputs.

== 1881 John Venn's negative reaction to W. Stanley Jevons's Logical Machine of 1870 ==
In early 1870 [[W. Stanley Jevons]] presented a "Logical Machine" (Jevons 1880:200) for analyzing a [[syllogism]] or other [[logical form]] e.g. an argument reduced to a [[Boolean equation]]. By means of what Couturat (1914) called a "sort of ''logical piano'' [,] ... the equalities which represent the premises ... are "played" on a keyboard like that of a typewriter. ... When all the premises have been "played", the panel shows only those constituents whose sum is equal to 1, that is, ... its logical whole. This mechanical method has the advantage over VENN's geometrical method..." (Couturat 1914:75).

For his part [[John Venn]], a logician contemporary to Jevons, was less than thrilled, opining that "it does not seem to me that any contrivances at present known ''or likely to be discovered'' really deserve the name of logical machines" (italics added, Venn 1881:120). But of historical use to the developing notion of "algorithm" is his explanation for his negative reaction with respect to a machine that "may subserve a really valuable purpose by enabling us to avoid otherwise inevitable labor":
: (1) "There is, first, the statement of our data in accurate logical language",
: (2) "Then secondly, we have to throw these statements into a form fit for the engine to work with – in this case the reduction of each proposition to its elementary denials",
: (3) "Thirdly, there is the combination or further treatment of our premises after such reduction,"
: (4) "Finally, the results have to be interpreted or read off. This last generally gives rise to much opening for skill and sagacity."
He concludes that "I cannot see that any machine can hope to help us except in the third of these steps; so that it seems very doubtful whether any thing of this sort really deserves the name of a logical engine."(Venn 1881:119–121).

== 1943, 1952 Stephen Kleene's characterization ==
This section is longer and more detailed than the others because of its importance to the topic: Kleene was the first to propose that ''all'' calculations/computations—of ''every'' sort, the ''totality'' of—can ''equivalently'' be (i) ''calculated'' by use of five "[[primitive recursive]] operators" plus one special operator called the [[mu-operator]], or be (ii) ''computed'' by the actions of a Turing machine or an equivalent model.

Furthermore, he opined that either of these would stand as a definition of '''algorithm'''.

A reader first confronting the words that follow may well be confused, so a brief explanation is in order. ''Calculation'' means done by hand, ''computation'' means done by Turing machine (or equivalent).  (Sometimes an author slips and interchanges the words). A "function" can be thought of as an "input-output box" into which a person puts natural numbers called "arguments" or "parameters" (but only the counting numbers including 0—the nonnegative integers) and gets out a single nonnegative integer (conventionally called "the answer"). Think of the "function-box" as a little man either calculating by hand using "general recursion" or computing by Turing machine (or an equivalent machine).

"Effectively calculable/computable" is more generic and means "calculable/computable by ''some'' procedure, method, technique ... whatever...".  "General recursive" was Kleene's way of writing what today is called just "recursion"; however, "primitive recursion"—calculation by use of the five recursive operators—is a lesser form of recursion that lacks access to the sixth, additional, mu-operator that is needed only in rare instances. Thus most of life goes on requiring only the "primitive recursive functions."

=== 1943 "Thesis I", 1952 "Church's Thesis" ===
In 1943 Kleene proposed what has come to be known as [[Church's thesis]]:
: "''Thesis I''. Every effectively calculable function (effectively decidable predicate) is general recursive" (First stated by Kleene in 1943 (reprinted page 274 in Davis, ed. ''The Undecidable''; appears also verbatim in Kleene (1952) p.300)

In a nutshell: to calculate ''any'' function the only operations a person needs (technically, formally) are the 6 primitive operators of "general" recursion (nowadays called the operators of the [[mu recursive function]]s).

Kleene's first statement of this was under the section title "'''12. Algorithmic theories'''". He would later amplify it in his text (1952) as follows:
: "Thesis I and its converse provide the exact definition of the notion of a calculation (decision) procedure or '''algorithm''', for the case of a function (predicate) of natural numbers" (p. 301, boldface added for emphasis)

(His use of the word "decision" and "predicate" extends the notion of calculability to the more general manipulation of symbols such as occurs in mathematical "proofs".)

This is not as daunting as it may sound – "general" recursion is just a way of making our everyday arithmetic operations from the five "operators" of the [[primitive recursive function]]s together with the additional [[mu-operator]] as needed. Indeed, Kleene gives 13 examples of primitive recursive functions and Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey add some more, most of which will be familiar to the reader—e.g. addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, exponentiation, the CASE function, concatenation, etc., etc.; for a list see [[primitive recursive function|Some common primitive recursive functions]].
&lt;!--'''Some functions definable by primitive recursion''' (Kleene (1952) pp. 223ff; Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey 2002 pp. 63ff)

In the following we observe that primitive recursive functions can be four types (1) numerical in nature – "number-theoretic" or just "functions" { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { 0, 1, 2, ...}, (2) predicates { 0, 1, 2, ...} to { t, f }, (3) truth-value or propositional connectives { t, f } to { t, f }, and "representing functions" { t, f } to { 0, 1 }. A predicate requires a "representing function" to convert { t, f } to { 0, 1 }: by definition a function φ('''x''') is a "representing function" of the predicate P('''x''') if φ takes only values o and 1 and produces ''0'' when P is true".

'So, in a sense the knowledge of the value NOT-φ(y; '''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt; ) of the course-of-values function is equivalent to the knowledge of the sequence of values φ(0,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., φ(y − 1,'''x'''&lt;sub&gt;2 to n&lt;/sub&gt;) of the original function." (Kleene (1952) p. 231)--&gt;

'''Why general-recursive functions rather than primitive-recursive functions?'''

Kleene et al. (cf §55 General recursive functions p.&amp;nbsp;270 in Kleene 1952) had to add a sixth recursion operator called the minimization-operator (written as μ-operator or [[mu-operator]]) because [[Wilhelm Ackermann|Ackermann]] (1925) produced a hugely growing function—the [[Ackermann function]]—and [[Rózsa Péter]] (1935) produced a general method of creating recursive functions using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]], neither of which could be described by the 5 primitive-recursive-function operators. With respect to the Ackermann function:
: "...in a certain sense, the length of the computation '''algorithm''' of a recursive function which is not also primitive recursive grows faster with the arguments than the value of any primitive recursive function" (Kleene (1935) reprinted p. 246 in ''The Undecidable'', plus footnote 13 with regards to the need for an additional operator, boldface added).
&lt;!-- Kleene gives a second example using Péter's demonstration that "leads to ... predicates which are not primitive recursive". Specifically:
::All primitive recursive functions of one variable are [[enumerable]]: countable, can be placed one-to-one with the integers. But by the method of [[Cantor]]'s [[diagonal method]] this means that other functions of one variable exist but cannot be generated by primitive recursion. For example, we just add the number 1 to the diagonal number, i.e. φ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;(a)+1, and thereby we see a single-variable function exists that cannot be created by primitive recursion alone. --&gt;

But the need for the mu-operator is a rarity. As indicated above by Kleene's list of common calculations, a person goes about their life happily computing primitive recursive functions without fear of encountering the monster numbers created by Ackermann's function (e.g. [[super-exponentiation]] ).

=== 1952 "Turing's thesis" ===
[[Turing's Thesis]] hypothesizes the computability of "all computable functions" by the Turing machine model and its equivalents.

To do this in an effective manner, Kleene extended the notion of "computable" by casting the net wider—by allowing into the notion of "functions" both "total functions" and "partial functions". A ''total function'' is one that is defined ''for '''all''' natural numbers'' (positive integers including 0). A partial function is defined for ''some'' natural numbers but not all—the specification of "some" has to come "up front". Thus the inclusion of "partial function" extends the notion of function to "less-perfect" functions. Total- and partial-functions may either be calculated by hand or computed by machine.
: Examples:
:: "Functions": include "common subtraction ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''" and "addition ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n''"

:: "Partial function": "Common subtraction" ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n'' is undefined when only natural numbers (positive integers and zero) are allowed as input – e.g. 6&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;7 is undefined

:: Total function: "Addition" ''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''n'' is defined for all positive integers and zero.

&lt;!-- A partial function is restricted to use only an "''n''-tuple" (a list of input "parameters") defined at the outset:
: Definition: "A partial function is a function which for each ''n''-tuple ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of natural numbers as arguments takes at most one natural number ''φ''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) as value" (p.325).
::When an ''n''-tuple produces a value we say its function ''φ'' is defined for that ''n''-tuple; otherwise we say ''φ'' is undefined for that ''n''-tuple.

: Definition: "A partial function of positive integers is one whose domain [i.e. the list of possible "input" positive integers] is something less than the whole set P [of positive integers]" (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) p. 7) --&gt;

We now observe Kleene's definition of "computable" in a formal sense:
: Definition: "A partial function φ is ''computable'', if there is a machine M which computes it" (Kleene (1952) p. 360)

: "Definition 2.5. An ''n''-ary function ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is '''partially computable''' if there exists a Turing machine Z such that
:: ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = Ψ&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(''n'')&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., [''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)
: In this case we say that [machine] Z computes ''f''. If, in addition, ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) is a total function, then it is called '''computable'''" (Davis (1958) p. 10)

Thus we have arrived at ''Turing's Thesis'':
: "Every function which would naturally be regarded as computable is computable ... by one of his machines..." (Kleene (1952) p.376)

Although Kleene did not give examples of "computable functions" others have. For example, Davis (1958) gives Turing tables for the Constant, Successor and Identity functions, three of the five operators of the [[primitive recursive functions]]:
: Computable by Turing machine:
:: Addition (also is the Constant function if one operand is 0)
:: Increment (Successor function)
:: Common subtraction (defined only if ''x'' ≥ ''y''). Thus "''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''y''" is an example of a partially computable function.

:: Multiplication

Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002) give the following as prose descriptions of Turing machines for:
:: Doubling: 2''p''
:: Parity
:: Addition
:: Multiplication

With regards to the [[counter machine]], an [[abstract machine]] model equivalent to the Turing machine:
: Examples Computable by Abacus machine (cf Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002))
:: Addition
:: Multiplication
:: Exponention: (a flow-chart/block diagram description of the algorithm)

Demonstrations of computability by abacus machine (Boolos–Burgess–Jeffrey (2002)) and by counter machine (Minsky 1967):
: The six recursive function operators:
::# Zero function
::# Successor function
::# Identity function
::# Composition function
::# Primitive recursion (induction)
::# Minimization

The fact that the abacus/[[counter machine models]] can simulate the recursive functions provides the proof that: If a function is "machine computable" then it is "hand-calculable by partial recursion". Kleene's Theorem XXIX :
: "''Theorem XXIX: "Every computable partial function φ is partial recursive...''" (italics in original, p. 374).

The converse appears as his Theorem XXVIII. Together these form the proof of their equivalence, Kleene's Theorem XXX.

=== 1952 Church–Turing Thesis ===
With his Theorem XXX Kleene '''proves''' the ''equivalence'' of the two "Theses"—the Church Thesis and the Turing Thesis. (Kleene can only hypothesize (conjecture) the truth of both thesis – ''these he has not proven''):
: ''THEOREM XXX: The following classes of partial functions ... have the same members: (a) the partial recursive functions, (b) the computable functions ..."''(p. 376)

:: Definition of "partial recursive function": "A partial function φ is partial recursive in [the partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; if there is a system of equations E which defines φ recursively from [partial functions] ψ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ψ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;" (p. 326)

Thus by Kleene's Theorem XXX: either method of making numbers from input-numbers—recursive functions calculated by hand or computated by Turing-machine or equivalent—results in an "''effectively calculable/computable'' function". If we accept the hypothesis that ''every'' calculation/computation can be done by either method equivalently we have accepted both Kleene's Theorem XXX (the equivalence) and the [[Church–Turing Thesis]] (the hypothesis of "every").

=== A note of dissent: "There's more to algorithm..." Blass and Gurevich (2003) ===
The notion of separating out Church's and Turing's theses from the "Church–Turing thesis" appears not only in Kleene (1952) but in Blass-Gurevich (2003) as well. But while there are agreements, there are disagreements too:
: "...we disagree with Kleene that the notion of '''algorithm''' is that well understood. In fact the notion of algorithm is richer these days than it was in Turing's days. And there are algorithms, of modern and classical varieties, not covered directly by Turing's analysis, for example, algorithms that interact with their environments, algorithms whose inputs are abstract structures, and geometric or, more generally, non-discrete algorithms" (Blass-Gurevich (2003) p. 8, boldface added)

== 1954 A. A. Markov's characterization ==

[[A. A. Markov]] (1954) provided the following definition of algorithm:

: "1. In mathematics, "algorithm" is commonly understood to be an exact prescription, defining a computational process, leading from various initial data to the desired result...."

: "The following three features are characteristic of algorithms and determine their role in mathematics:
:: "a) the precision of the prescription, leaving no place to arbitrariness, and its universal comprehensibility -- the definiteness of the algorithm;
:: "b) the possibility of starting out with initial data, which may vary within given limits -- the generality of the algorithm;
:: "c) the orientation of the algorithm toward obtaining some desired result, which is indeed obtained in the end with proper initial data -- the conclusiveness of the algorithm." (p.1)

He admitted that this definition "does not pretend to mathematical precision" (p.&amp;nbsp;1). His 1954 monograph was his attempt to define algorithm more accurately; he saw his resulting definition—his "normal" algorithm—as "equivalent to the concept of a [[recursion|recursive function]]" (p.&amp;nbsp;3). His definition included four major components (Chapter II.3 pp.&amp;nbsp;63ff):

: "1. Separate  elementary steps, each of which will be performed according to one of [the substitution] rules... [rules given at the outset]

: "2. ... steps of local nature ... [Thus the algorithm won't change more than a certain number of symbols to the left or right of the observed word/symbol]

: "3. Rules for the substitution formulas ... [he called the list of these "the scheme" of the algorithm]

: "4. ...a means to distinguish a "concluding substitution" [i.e. a distinguishable "terminal/final" state or states]

In his Introduction Markov observed that "the entire significance for mathematics" of efforts to define algorithm more precisely would be "in connection with the problem of a constructive foundation for mathematics" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). [[Ian Stewart (mathematician)|Ian Stewart]] (cf Encyclopædia Britannica) shares a similar belief: "...constructive analysis is very much in the same algorithmic spirit as computer science...". For more see [[constructive mathematics]] and [[Intuitionism]].

'''Distinguishability and Locality''': Both notions first appeared with Turing (1936–1937) --
: "The new observed squares must be immediately recognizable by the computer [''sic'': a computer was a person in 1936]. I think it reasonable to suppose that they can only be squares whose distance from the closest of the immediately observed squares does not exceed a certain fixed amount. Let us stay that each of the new observed squares is within L squares of one of the previously observed squares." (Turing (1936) p. 136 in Davis ed. ''Undecidable'')

Locality appears prominently in the work of Gurevich and Gandy (1980) (whom Gurevich cites). Gandy's "Fourth Principle for Mechanisms" is "The Principle of Local Causality":
: "We now come to the most important of our principles. In Turing's analysis the requirement that the action depend only on a bounded portion of the record was based on a human limitiation. We replace this by a physical limitation which we call the ''principle of local causation.'' Its justification lies in the finite velocity of propagation of effects and signals: contemporary physics rejects the possibility of instantaneous action at a distance." (Gandy (1980) p. 135 in J. Barwise et al.)

== 1936, 1963, 1964 Gödel's characterization ==
'''1936''': A rather famous quote from [[Kurt Gödel]] appears in a "Remark added in proof [of the original German publication] in his paper "On the Length of Proofs" translated by [[Martin Davis]] appearing on pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83 of ''The Undecidable''. A number of authors—Kleene, Gurevich, Gandy etc. -- have quoted the following:
: "Thus, the concept of "computable" is in a certain definite sense "absolute," while practically all other familiar metamathematical concepts (e.g. provable, definable, etc.) depend quite essentially on the system with respect to which they are defined." (p. 83)

'''1963''': In a "Note" dated 28 August 1963 added to his famous paper ''On Formally Undecidable Propositions'' (1931) Gödel states (in a footnote) his belief that "[[formal system]]s" have "the characteristic property that reasoning in them, in principle, can be completely replaced by mechanical devices" (p.&amp;nbsp;616 in van Heijenoort). ". . . due to "A. M. Turing's work a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general notion of formal system can now be given [and] a completely general version of Theorems VI and XI is now possible." (p.&amp;nbsp;616). In a 1964 note to another work he expresses the same opinion more strongly and in more detail.

'''1964''': In a Postscriptum, dated 1964, to a paper presented to the Institute for Advanced Study in spring 1934, Gödel amplified his conviction that "formal systems" are those that can be mechanized:
: "In consequence of later advances, in particular of the fact that, due to A. M. Turing's work, a precise and unquestionably adequate definition of the general concept of formal system can now be given . . . Turing's work gives an analysis of the concept of "mechanical procedure" (alias "algorithm" or "computational procedure" or "finite combinatorial procedure"). This concept is shown to be equivalent with that of a "Turing machine".* A formal system can simply be defined to be any mechanical procedure for producing formulas, called provable formulas . . . ." (p. 72 in [[Martin Davis]] ed. ''The Undecidable'': "Postscriptum" to "On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems" appearing on p. 39, loc. cit.)

The * indicates a footnote in which Gödel cites the papers by [[Alan Turing]] (1937) and [[Emil Post]] (1936) and then goes on to make the following intriguing statement:
: "As for previous equivalent definitions of computability, which however, are much less suitable for our purpose, see [[Alonzo Church]], Am. J. Math., vol. 58 (1936) [appearing in ''The Undecidable'' pp. 100-102]).

Church's definitions encompass so-called "[[recursion]]" and the "[[lambda calculus]]" (i.e. the λ-definable functions). His footnote 18 says that he discussed the relationship of "effective calculatibility" and "recursiveness" with Gödel but that he independently questioned "effectively calculability" and "λ-definability":
: "We now define the notion . . . of an effectively calculable function of positive integers by identifying it with the notion of a recursive function of positive integers&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; (or of a λ-definable function of positive integers.
: "It has already been pointed out that, for every function of positive integers which is effectively calculable in the sense just defined, there exists an algorithm for the calculation of its value.
: "Conversely it is true . . ." (p. 100, The Undecidable).

It would appear from this, and the following, that far as Gödel was concerned, the Turing machine was sufficient and the lambda calculus was "much less suitable." He goes on to make the point that, with regards to limitations on human reason, the jury is still out:
: ("Note that the question of whether there exist finite non-mechanical procedures** not equivalent with any algorithm, has nothing whatsoever to do with the adequacy of the definition of "formal system" and of "mechanical procedure.") (p. 72, loc. cit.)

: "(For theories and procedures in the more general sense indicated in footnote ** the situation may be different. Note that the results mentioned in the postscript do not establish any bounds for the powers of human reason, but rather for the potentialities of pure formalism in mathematics.) (p. 73 loc. cit.)

: Footnote **: "I.e., such as involve the use of abstract terms on the basis of their meaning. See my paper in Dial. 12(1958), p. 280." (this footnote appears on p. 72, loc. cit).

== 1967 Minsky's characterization ==
Minsky (1967) baldly asserts that "an algorithm is "an effective procedure" and declines to use the word "algorithm" further in his text; in fact his index makes it clear what he feels about "Algorithm, ''synonym'' for Effective procedure"(p.&amp;nbsp;311):
:: "We will use the latter term [an ''effective procedure''] in the sequel. The terms are roughly synonymous, but there are a number of shades of meaning used in different contexts, especially for 'algorithm'" (italics in original, p. 105)

Other writers (see Knuth below) use the word "effective procedure". This leads one to wonder: What is Minsky's notion of "an effective procedure"? He starts off with:
: "...a set of rules which tell us, from moment to moment, precisely how to behave" (p. 106)

But he recognizes that this is subject to a criticism:
: "... the criticism that the interpretation of the rules is left to depend on some person or agent" (p. 106)

His refinement? To "specify, along with the statement of the rules, ''the details of the mechanism that is to interpret them''". To avoid the "cumbersome" process of "having to do this over again for each individual procedure" he hopes to identify a "reasonably ''uniform'' family of rule-obeying mechanisms". His "formulation":
:: "(1) a ''language'' in which sets of behavioral rules are to be expressed, and

:: "(2) a ''single'' machine which can interpret statements in the language and thus carry out the steps of each specified process." (italics in original, all quotes this para. p. 107)

In the end, though, he still worries that "there remains a subjective aspect to the matter. Different people may not agree on whether a certain procedure should be called effective" (p.&amp;nbsp;107)

But Minsky is undeterred. He immediately introduces "Turing's Analysis of Computation Process" (his chapter 5.2). He quotes what he calls "Turing's ''thesis''"
: "Any process which could naturally be called an effective procedure can be realized by a Turing machine" (p. 108. (Minsky comments that in a more general form this is called "''Church's thesis''").

After an analysis of "Turing's Argument" (his chapter 5.3)
he observes that "equivalence of many intuitive formulations" of Turing, Church, Kleene, Post, and Smullyan "...leads us to suppose that there is really here an 'objective' or 'absolute' notion. As Rogers [1959] put it:
:: "In this sense, the notion of effectively computable function is one of the few 'absolute' concepts produced by modern work in the foundations of mathematics'" (Minsky p. 111 quoting Rogers, Hartley Jr (1959) ''The present theory of Turing machine computability'', J. SIAM 7, 114-130.)

== 1967 Rogers' characterization ==
In his 1967 ''Theory of Recursive Functions and Effective Computability'' Hartley Rogers' characterizes "algorithm" roughly as "a clerical (i.e., deterministic, bookkeeping) procedure . . . applied to . . . symbolic ''inputs'' and which will eventually yield, for each such input, a corresponding symbolic ''output''"(p.&amp;nbsp;1). He then goes on to describe the notion "in approximate and intuitive terms" as having 10 "features", 5 of which he asserts that "virtually all mathematicians would agree [to]" (p.&amp;nbsp;2). The remaining 5 he asserts "are less obvious than *1 to *5 and about which we might find less general agreement" (p.&amp;nbsp;3).

The 5 "obvious" are:
* 1 An algorithm is a set of instructions of finite size,
* 2 There is a capable computing agent,
* 3 "There are facilities for making, storing, and retrieving steps in a computation"
* 4 Given #1 and #2 the agent computes in "discrete stepwise fashion" without use of continuous methods or analogue devices",
* 5 The computing agent carries the computation forward "without resort to random methods or devices, e.g. , dice" (in a footnote Rogers wonders if #4 and #5 are really the same)

The remaining 5 that he opens to debate, are:
* 6 No fixed bound on the size of the inputs,
* 7 No fixed bound on the size of the set of instructions,
* 8 No fixed bound on the amount of memory storage available,
* 9 A fixed finite bound on the capacity or ability of the computing agent (Rogers illustrates with example simple mechanisms similar to a [[Post–Turing machine]] or a [[counter machine]]),
* 10 A bound on the length of the computation -- "should we have some idea, 'ahead of time', how long the computationwill take?" (p.&amp;nbsp;5). Rogers requires "only that a computation terminate after ''some'' finite number of steps; we do not insist on an a priori ability to estimate this number." (p.&amp;nbsp;5).

== 1968, 1973 Knuth's characterization ==
[[Donald Knuth|Knuth]] (1968, 1973) has given a list of five properties that are widely accepted as requirements for an algorithm:

# '''Finiteness''': "An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps ... a ''very'' finite number, a reasonable number"
# '''Definiteness''': "Each step of an algorithm must be precisely defined; the actions to be carried out must be rigorously and unambiguously specified for each case"
# '''Input''': "...quantities which are given to it initially before the algorithm begins. These inputs are taken from specified sets of objects"
# '''Output''': "...quantities which have a specified relation to the inputs"
# '''Effectiveness''': "... all of the operations to be performed in the algorithm must be sufficiently basic that they can in principle be done exactly and in a finite length of time by a man using paper and pencil"

Knuth offers as an example the [[Euclidean algorithm]] for determining the [[greatest common divisor]] of two [[natural number]]s (cf. Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;2).

Knuth admits that, while his description of an algorithm may be intuitively clear, it lacks formal rigor, since it is not exactly clear what "precisely defined" means, or "rigorously and unambiguously specified" means, or "sufficiently basic", and so forth. He makes an effort in this direction in his first volume where he defines ''in detail'' what he calls the "[[machine language]]" for his "mythical [[MIX]]...the world's first polyunsaturated computer" (pp.&amp;nbsp;120ff). Many of the algorithms in his books are written in the MIX language. He also uses [[Decision tree|tree diagrams]], [[Data flow diagram|flow diagram]]s and [[state diagram]]s.

'''"Goodness" of an algorithm, "best" algorithms''': Knuth states that "In practice, we not only want algorithms, we want ''good'' algorithms...." He suggests that some criteria of an algorithm's goodness are the number of steps to perform the algorithm, its "adaptability to computers, its simplicity and elegance, etc." Given a number of algorithms to perform the same computation, which one is "best"? He calls this sort of inquiry "algorithmic analysis: given an algorithm, to determine its performance characteristcis" (all quotes this paragraph: Knuth Vol. 1 p.&amp;nbsp;7)

== 1972 Stone's characterization ==
Stone (1972) and Knuth (1968, 1973) were professors at Stanford University at the same time so it is not surprising if there are similarities in their definitions (boldface added for emphasis):

: "To summarize ... we define an algorithm to be a '''set of rules''' that precisely defines '''a sequence of operations''' such that each rule is '''effective''' and '''definite''' and such that the '''sequence terminates''' in a finite time." (boldface added, p. 8)

Stone is noteworthy because of  his detailed discussion of what constitutes an “effective” rule – his '''robot''', or person-acting-as-robot, must have some '''information and abilities within''' them, and if not '''the information and the ability must be provided''' in "the algorithm":

: "For people to follow the rules of an algorithm, the '''rules''' must be formulated so that they can be '''followed in a robot-like manner''', that is, without the need for thought... however, if the instructions [to solve the quadratic equation, his example] are to be obeyed by someone who knows how to perform arithmetic operations but does not know how to extract a square root, then we must also provide a set of rules for extracting a square root in order to satisfy the definition of algorithm" (p. 4-5)

Furthermore, "...'''not all instructions are acceptable''', because they may require the robot to have '''abilities beyond those that we consider reasonable'''.” He gives the example of a robot confronted with the question is “Henry VIII a King of England?” and to print 1 if yes and 0 if no, but the robot has not been previously provided with this information. And worse, if the robot is asked if Aristotle was a King of England and the robot only had been provided with five names, it would not know how to answer. Thus:
: “an intuitive definition of an acceptable sequence of instructions is one in which '''each instruction is precisely defined''' so that the '''robot is guaranteed to be able to obey it'''” (p. 6)

After providing us with his definition, Stone introduces the [[Turing machine]] model and states that the set of five-tuples that are the machine’s instructions are “an algorithm ... known as a Turing machine program” (p.&amp;nbsp;9). Immediately thereafter he goes on say that a “''computation'' of a Turing machine is ''described'' by stating:
: "1. The tape alphabet
: "2. The '''form''' in which the '''[input] parameters''' are presented on the tape
: "3. The initial state of the Turing machine
: "4. The '''form''' in which '''answers [output]''' will be represented on the tape when the Turing machine halts
: "5. The machine program" (italics added, p. 10)

This precise prescription of what is required for "a computation" is in the spirit of what will follow in the work of Blass and Gurevich.

== 1995 Soare's characterization ==

: "A ''computation'' is a process whereby we proceed from initially given objects, called ''inputs'', according to a fixed set of rules, called a ''program, procedure,'' or '''''algorithm''''', through a series of ''steps'' and arrive at the end of these steps with a final result, called the ''output''. The '''algorithm''', as a set of rules proceeding from inputs to output, must be precise and definite with each successive step clearly determined. The concept of ''computability'' concerns those objects which may be specified in principle by computations . . ."(italics in original, boldface added p. 3)

== 2000 Berlinski's characterization ==

While a student at Princeton in the mid-1960s, David Berlinski was a student of Alonzo Church (cf p.&amp;nbsp;160). His year-2000 book ''The Advent of the Algorithm: The 300-year Journey from an Idea to the Computer'' contains the following definition of '''algorithm''':

: "'''''In the logician's voice:
::: "''an algorithm is
::: ''a finite procedure,
::: ''written in a fixed symbolic vocabulary,
::: ''governed by precise instructions,
::: ''moving in discrete steps, 1, 2, 3, . . .,
::: ''whose execution requires no insight, cleverness,
::: ''intuition, intelligence, or perspicuity,
::: ''and that sooner or later comes to an end.'''" (boldface and italics in the original, p. xviii)

== 2000, 2002 Gurevich's characterization ==
A careful reading of Gurevich 2000 leads one to conclude (infer?) that he believes that "an algorithm" is actually "a Turing machine" or "a [[pointer machine]]" doing a computation. An "algorithm" is not just the symbol-table that guides the behavior of the machine, nor is it just one instance of a machine doing a computation given a particular set of input parameters, nor is it a suitably programmed machine with the power off; rather ''an algorithm is the machine actually doing any computation of which it is capable''. Gurevich does not come right out and say this, so as worded above this conclusion (inference?) is certainly open to debate:

: " . . . every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine . . . a program can be simulated and therefore given a precise meaning by a Turing machine." (p. 1)
&lt;!--:"Can one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine very closely and faithfully?" (italics in original, p. 2)--&gt;

: " It is often thought that the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm was solved by Church [1936] and Turing [1936]. For example, according to Savage [1987], an algorithm is a computational ''process'' defined by a Turing machine. Church and Turing did not solve the problem of formalizing the notion of sequential algorithm. Instead they gave (different but equivalent) formalizations of the notion of computable function, and there is more to an algorithm than the function it computes. (italics added p. 3)

: "Of course, the notions of algorithm and computable function are intimately related: by definition, a computable function is a function computable by an algorithm. . . . (p. 4)

&lt;!--:"While Turing analyzed a human computer, Kolmogorov and Uspensky [1958] arrived at their machine model (KU machines) [cf [[Pointer machine]] ] by analyzing cmoputations from the point of view of physics. . . . I attempted to [formulate a thesis for them]: "every computation performing only one restricted local action at a time, can be viewed as (not only being simulated by, but actually being) the computation of an appropriate KU machine" [Gureviceh 1988]. Uspensky [1992, p. 396] agreed". (p. 4; Kolmogorov had died by this time)--&gt;

In Blass and Gurevich 2002 the authors invoke a dialog between "Quisani" ("Q") and "Authors" (A), using Yiannis Moshovakis as a foil, where they come right out and flatly state:
: "'''A:''' To localize the disagreement, let's first mention two points of agreement. First, there are some things that are obviously algorithms by anyone's definition -- Turing machines , sequential-time ASMs [Abstract State Machines], and the like. . . .Second, at the other extreme are specifications that would not be regarded as algorithms under anyone's definition, since they give no indication of how to compute anything . . . The issue is how detailed the information has to be in order to count as an algorithm. . . . Moshovakis allows some things that we would call only declarative specifications, and he would probably use the word "implementation" for things that we call algorithms." (paragraphs joined for ease of readability, 2002:22)

This use of the word "implementation" cuts straight to the heart of the question. Early in the paper, Q states his reading of Moshovakis:
: "...[H]e would probably think that your practical work [Gurevich works for Microsoft] forces you to think of implementations more than of algorithms. He is quite willing to identify implementations with machines, but he says that algorithms are something more general. What it boils down to is that you say an algorithm is a machine and Moschovakis says it is not." (2002:3)

But the authors waffle here, saying "[L]et's stick to "algorithm" and "machine", and the reader is left, again, confused. We have to wait until Dershowitz and Gurevich 2007 to get the following footnote comment:
: " . . . Nevertheless, if one accepts Moshovakis's point of view, then it is the "implementation" of algorithms that we have set out to characterize."(cf Footnote 9 2007:6)

== 2003 Blass and Gurevich's characterization ==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Blass and Gurevich describe their work as evolved from consideration of [[Turing machines]] and [[pointer machine]]s, specifically Kolmogorov-Uspensky machines (KU machines), Schönhage Storage Modification Machines (SMM), and linking automata as defined by Knuth. The work of Gandy and Markov are also described as influential precursors.

Gurevich offers a 'strong' definition of an algorithm (boldface added):

: "...Turing's informal argument in favor of his thesis justifies a stronger thesis: '''every algorithm can be simulated by a Turing machine'''....In practice, it would be ridiculous...[Nevertheless,] [c]an one generalize Turing machines so that any algorithm, never mind how abstract, can be modeled by a generalized machine?...But suppose such generalized Turing machines exist. What would their states be?...a '''first-order structure''' ... a particular '''small instruction set''' suffices in all cases ... '''computation as an evolution of the state''' ... could be nondeterministic... can interact with their environment ... [could be] parallel and multi-agent ... [could have] [[dynamic semantics]] ... [the two underpinings of their work are:] Turing's thesis ...[and] the notion of (first order) structure of [Tarski 1933]" (Gurevich 2000, p. 1-2)

The above phrase '''computation as an evolution of the state''' differs markedly from the definition of Knuth and Stone—the "algorithm" as a Turing machine program. Rather, it corresponds to what Turing called ''the complete configuration'' (cf Turing's definition in Undecidable, p.&amp;nbsp;118) -- and includes ''both'' the current instruction (state) ''and'' the status of the tape. [cf Kleene (1952) p.&amp;nbsp;375 where he shows an example of a tape with 6 symbols on it—all other squares are blank—and how to Gödelize its combined table-tape status].

In [[Algorithm examples]] we see the '''evolution of the state''' first-hand.

== 1995 – Daniel Dennett: evolution as an algorithmic process==
Philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] analyses the importance of evolution as an algorithmic process in his 1995 book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. Dennett identifies three key features of an algorithm:
* '''Substrate neutrality''': an algorithm relies on its ''logical'' structure. Thus, the particular form in which an algorithm is manifested is not important (Dennett's example is long division: it works equally well on paper, on parchment, on a computer screen, or using neon lights or in skywriting). (p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Underlying mindlessness''': no matter how complicated the end-product of the algorithmic process may be, each step in the algorithm is sufficiently simple to be performed by a non-sentient, mechanical device. The algorithm does not require a "brain" to maintain or operate it. "The standard textbook analogy notes that algorithms are ''recipes'' of sorts, designed to be followed by ''novice'' cooks."(p.&amp;nbsp;51)
* '''Guaranteed results''': If the algorithm is executed correctly, it will always produce the same results. "An algorithm is a foolproof recipe." (p.&amp;nbsp;51)

It is on the basis of this analysis that Dennett concludes that "According to Darwin, evolution is an algorithmic process". (p.&amp;nbsp;60).

However, in the previous page he has gone out on a much-further limb.{{According to whom|date=February 2013}} In the context of his chapter titled "Processes as Algorithms", he states:
: "But then . . are there any limits at all on what may be considered an algorithmic process? I guess the answer is NO; if you wanted to, you can treat any process at the abstract level as an algorithmic process. . . If what strikes you as puzzling is the uniformity of the [ocean's] sand grains or the strength of the [tempered-steel] blade, an algorithmic explanation is what will satisfy your curiosity -- and it will be the truth. . . .

: "No matter how impressive the products of an algorithm, the underlying process always consists of nothing but a set of {{sic|individualy}} mindless steps succeeding each other without the help of any intelligent supervision; they are 'automatic' by definition: the workings of an automaton." (p. 59)

It is unclear from the above whether Dennett is stating that the physical world by itself and without observers is [[intrinsic]]ally algorithmic (computational) or whether a symbol-processing observer is what is adding "meaning" to the observations.

== 2002 John Searle adds a clarifying caveat to Dennett's characterization ==
[[Daniel Dennett]] is a proponent of [[Computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]]: the idea that the logical structure of an algorithm is sufficient to explain [[mind]]. [[John Searle]], the creator of the [[Chinese room]] thought experiment, claims that "[[syntax]] [that is, logical structure] is by itself not sufficient for [[semantic]] content [that is, meaning]" {{harv|Searle|2002|p=16}}. In other words, the "meaning" of symbols is relative to the mind that is using them; an algorithm—a logical construct—by itself is insufficient for a mind.

Searle cautions those who claim that algorithmic (computational) processes are [[intrinsic]] to nature (for example, cosmologists, physicists, chemists, etc.):
{{quote
| text=Computation [...] is observer-relative, and this is because computation is defined in terms of symbol manipulation, but the notion of a 'symbol' is not a notion of physics or chemistry. Something is a symbol only if it is used, treated or regarded as a symbol. The Chinese room argument showed that semantics is not intrinsic to syntax. But what this shows is that syntax is not intrinsic to physics. [...] Something is a symbol only relative to some observer, user or agent who assigns a symbolic interpretation to it [...] you can assign a computational interpretation to anything. But if the question asks, "Is consciousness intrinsically computational?" the answer is: ''nothing is intrinsically computational'' [italics added for emphasis]. Computation exists only relative to some agent or observer who imposes a computational interpretation on some phenomenon. This is an obvious point. I should have seen it ten years ago but I did not.

== 2002: Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey specification of Turing machine calculation ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

An example in Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey (2002) (pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32) demonstrates the precision required in a complete specification of an algorithm, in this case to add two numbers: m+n. It is similar to the Stone requirements above.

(i) They have discussed the role of "number format" in the computation and selected the "tally notation" to represent numbers:
:: "Certainly computation can be harder in practice with some notations than others... But... it is possible in principle to do in any other notation, simply by translating the data... For purposes of framing a rigorously defined notion of computability, it is convenient to use monadic or tally notation" (p. 25-26)

(ii) At the outset of their example they specify the machine to be used in the computation as a [[Turing machine]]. They have previously specified (p.&amp;nbsp;26) that the Turing-machine will be of the 4-tuple, rather than 5-tuple, variety. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]].

(iii) Previously the authors have specified that the tape-head's position will be indicated by a subscript to the ''right'' of the scanned symbol. For more on this convention see [[Turing machine]]. (In the following, boldface is added for emphasis):

: "We have not given an official definition of what it is for a numerical function to be computable by a '''Turing machine''', specifying how '''inputs''' or arguments are to be represented on the machine, and how '''outputs''' or values represented. Our specifications for a k-place function from positive integers to positive integers are as follows:
: "(a) ['''Initial number format:'''] The arguments m&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;,  ... will be represented in monadic [unary] notation by blocks of those numbers of strokes, each block separated from the next by a single blank, on an otherwise blank tape.
:: Example: 3+2, 111B11
: "(b) ['''Initial head location, initial state:'''] Initially, the machine will be scanning the leftmost 1 on the tape, and will be in its initial state, state 1.
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;111B11
: "(c) ['''Successful computation -- number format at Halt:'''] If the function to be computed assigns a value n to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine will eventually halt on a tape containing a block of strokes, and otherwise blank...
:: Example: 3+2, 11111
: "(d) ['''Successful computation -- head location at Halt:'''] In this case [c] the machine will halt scanning the left-most 1 on the tape...
:: Example: 3+2, 1&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;1111
: "(e) ['''Unsuccessful computation -- failure to Halt or Halt with non-standard number format:'''] If the function that is to be computed assigns no value to the arguments that are represented initially on the tape, then the machine either will never halt, or will halt in some nonstandard configuration..."(ibid)
:: Example: B&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;11111 or B11&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;111 or B11111&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;

This specification is incomplete: it requires the location of where the instructions are to be placed and their format in the machine--
: (iv) in the finite state machine's TABLE or, in the case of a [[Universal Turing machine]] on the tape, and
: (v) the Table of instructions in a specified format

This later point is important. Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey give a demonstration (p.&amp;nbsp;36) that the predictability of the entries in the table allow one to "shrink" the table by putting the entries in sequence and omitting the input state and the symbol. Indeed, the example Turing machine computation required only the 4 columns as shown in the table below (but note: these were presented to the machine in ''rows''):

== 2006: Sipser's assertion and his three levels of description ==
: ''For examples of this specification-method applied to the addition algorithm "m+n" see [[Algorithm examples]].''

Sipser begins by defining '"algorithm" as follows:
: "Informally speaking, an ''algorithm'' is a collection of simple instructions for carrying out some task. Commonplace in everyday life, algorithms sometimes are called ''procedures'' or ''recipes'' (italics in original, p. 154)

: "...our real focus from now on is on algorithms. That is, the Turing machine merely serves as a precise model for the definition of algorithm .... we need only to be comfortable enough with Turing machines to believe that they capture all algorithms" ( p. 156)

Does Sipser mean that "algorithm" is just "instructions" for a Turing machine, or is the combination of "instructions + a (specific variety of) Turing machine"? For example, he defines the two standard variants (multi-tape and non-deterministic) of his particular variant (not the same as Turing's original) and goes on, in his Problems (pages 160-161), to describes four more variants (write-once, doubly infinite tape (i.e. left- and right-infinite), left reset, and "stay put instead of left). In addition, he imposes some constraints. First, the input must be encoded as a string (p. 157) and says of numeric encodings in the context of complexity theory:
: "But note that unary notation for encoding numbers (as in the number 17 encoded by the uary string 11111111111111111) isn't reasonable because it is exponentially larger than truly reasonable encodings, such as base ''k'' notation for any ''k'' ≥ 2."(p. 259)

van Emde Boas comments on a similar problem with respect to the [[random access machine]] (RAM) abstract model of computation sometimes used in place of the Turing machine when doing "analysis of algorithms":
"The absence or presence of multiplicative and parallel bit manipulation operations is of relevance for the correct understanding of some results in the analysis of algorithms.

". . . [T]here hardly exists such as a thing as an "innocent" extension of the standard RAM model in the uniform time measures; either one only has additive arithmetic or one might as well include all reasonable multiplicative and/or bitwise Boolean instructions on small operands." (van Emde Boas, 1990:26)

With regards to a "description language" for algorithms Sipser finishes the job that Stone and Boolos-Burgess-Jeffrey started (boldface added). He offers us three levels of description of Turing machine algorithms (p.&amp;nbsp;157):
: '''High-level description''': "wherein we use ... prose to describe an algorithm, ignoring the implementation details. At this level we do not need to mention how the machine manages its tape or head."

: '''Implementation description''': "in which we use ... prose to describe the way that the Turing machine moves its head and the way that it stores data on its tape. At this level we do not give details of states or transition function."

: '''Formal description''': "... the lowest, most detailed, level of description... that spells out in full the Turing machine's states, transition function, and so on."

The '''buttered cat paradox''' is a common joke based on the [[tongue-in-cheek]] combination of two [[adage]]s:

* [[Cat righting reflex|Cats always land on their feet]].
* Buttered toast always lands [[Buttered toast phenomenon|buttered side down]].

The [[paradox]] arises when one considers what would happen if one attached a piece of buttered toast (butter side up) to the back of a cat, then dropped the cat from a large height. The buttered cat paradox, submitted by artist [[John Frazee]] of [[Kingston, New York]], won a 1993 ''[[Omni (magazine)|OMNI]]'' magazine competition about paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Scot |date=July 1993 |title=I have a theory... |magazine=Omni |url=http://www.housevampyr.com/training/library/books/omni/OMNI_1993_07.pdf |page=96 |volume=15 |issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Verley |first=Jason C. |date=November 2001 |title=Letters: More on Alternate Theories |magazine=APS News |publisher=[[American Physical Society]] |url=http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200111/letters.cfm |volume=10 |issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic premise, stating the conditions of the cat and bread and posed as a question, was presented in a routine by comic and juggler [[Michael Davis (juggler)|Michael Davis]], appearing on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]'', July 22, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uq0YjR11bx8 ''The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson'', July 22, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thought experiments ==
Some people jokingly maintain that the experiment will produce an [[anti-gravity]] effect.  They propose that as the cat falls towards the ground, it will slow down and start to rotate, eventually reaching a [[steady state]] of hovering a short distance from the ground while rotating at high speed as both the buttered side of the toast and the cat’s feet attempt to land on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/fmd/newsletter/Newsletter_No14.pdf |title=UoWaikato newsletter |format=PDF |date=August 2003 |publisher=University of Waikato |accessdate=2012-06-20 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2003, Kimberly Miner won a [[Student Academy Award]] for her film ''Perpetual Motion''.&lt;ref&gt;Available at http://www.kminer.net/2011/07/perpetual-motion/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202085129/http://www.kminer.net/2011/07/perpetual-motion/# |date=2015-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifidimensions.com/Apr04/oscaranimation.htm |title=Oscar Nominated Animated Shorts 2003 |publisher=Scifidimensions.com |date=2004 |first=John C. |last=Snider |accessdate=2012-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204063041/http://www.scifidimensions.com/Apr04/oscaranimation.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Miner based her film on a paper written by a high-school friend that explored the potential implications of the cat and buttered toast idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=PG |last=Klein |website=[[University of Leeds]], School of Physics &amp; Astronomy |url=http://www.physics.leeds.ac.uk/pages/PerpetualMotion |title=Perpetual Motion |date=2002-12-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022204806/http://www.physics.leeds.ac.uk/pages/PerpetualMotion |archivedate=2008-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rit.edu/success.php?s=43 |title=Student wins Academy Award for animated film |website=[[Rochester Institute of Technology]] |date=Spring 2004 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In humor ==
The faux paradox has captured the imagination of science-oriented [[humorist]]s.  In May 1992, the [[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] Digest #441 included a question from a supplicant asking about the paradox.&lt;ref name=oracle&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Internet Oracle|Usenet Oracle]] |url=http://internetoracle.org/digest.cgi?N=441#441-07 |title=Usenet Oracularities #441 |date=1992-05-04 |editor-first1=Steve |editor-last=Kinzler |editor-link=Steve Kinzler |author=Usenet Oracle}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Testing the theory is the main theme in an episode of the [[comic book]] strip ''[[Jack B. Quick]]'', the title character seeks to test this theory, leading to the cat hovering above the ground, with the cat's wagging tail providing propulsion.  The March 31, 2005, strip of the [[webcomic]] ''[[Bunny (webcomic)|Bunny]]'' also explored the idea in the guise of a plan for a "Perpetual Motion MoggieToast 5k Power Generator", based on [[Sod's law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bunny-comic.com/211.html |title=Feline cunning and sods law |work=[[Bunny (webcomic)]] |first=Huw "Lem" |last=Davies |number=211 |date=2005-03-31 |accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Science Askew'', Donald E. Simanek comments on this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="SimanekHolden2002"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Simanek |first1=Donald E. |last2=Holden |first2=John C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Science Askew: A Light-hearted Look at the Scientific World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC&amp;pg=PA201 |accessdate=2010-06-30 |year=2002 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-7503-0714-7 |page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea appeared on the British [[panel game]] ''[[QI]]'', where the idea was discussed. As well as talking about the idea, they also brought up other questions regarding the paradox. These included:
*"Would it still work if you used [[margarine]]?",
*"Would it still work if you used [[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter]]?", and
*"What if the toast was covered in something that was not butter, but the cat thought it was butter?" (the idea being that it would act like a [[placebo]]).&lt;ref name="QI"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Hypothetical |url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/qi/episodes/8/8/ |series=QI |serieslink=QI |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |location=London |airdate=2010-11-05 |seriesno=H |number=8 |first1=Sandi |last1=Toksvig |first2=Johnny |last2=Vegas |first3=John |last3=Lloyd |last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox also appeared in the episode "Gravitational Anarchy" of the scientific podcast ''[[Radiolab]]''.&lt;ref name="Radiolab"&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/102525-vertigo/ |title=Gravitational Anarchy |series=[[Radiolab]] |network=[[NPR]] |time=20:48 |date=2010-11-29 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |first1=Robert |last1=Krulwich |authorlink1=Robert Krulwich |first2=Jad |last2=Abumrad |authorlink2=Jad Abumrad |first3=David (guest) |last3=Quammen |authorlink3=David Quammen |first4=Neil (guest) |last4=deGrasse Tyson |authorlink4=Neil deGrasse Tyson |last-author-amp=yes}} [https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/wnycs-radiolab/id152249110 Alternate link] via [[iTunes]].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, a humoristic explainer animation&lt;ref name="The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment"&gt;{{cite web |author=[http://www.barqvideo.com barqvideo] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7Is22CmY_Y |title=The Cat and Jelly Toast Experiment aka the Buttered Cat Paradox explainer |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2012-04-25 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; was put together by the animated production company Barq, based on an extracted audio clip from the ''Radiolab'' episode.

Brazilian [[energy drink]] brand [[Flying Horse (energy drink)|Flying Horse]] has released an award-winning commercial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adforum.com/award/showcase/6653604/2012/ad/34474939 |title=2012 Young Director Award CFP-Europe |website=[[AdForum]] |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; that simulates the recreation of this phenomenon, which is then used to create [[perpetual motion|perpetual energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=vibeFlyingHorse |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8yW5cyXXRc |title=Flying Horse - Gatorrada (Cat-Toast) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2014-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/energy-drink-makes-most-buttered-cat-paradox-140523 |title=Energy Drink Makes the Most of the Buttered-Cat Paradox Age-old physics law inspires Ogilvy ad |first=Gabriel |last=Beltrone |date=2012-05-14 |work=[[Adweek]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also appeared in a comics series called ''[[Kid Paddle]]'' where Kid tells the story to his gullible friend Horace while at the dinner table. The comic is fairly popular in France and Belgium.

== In reality ==
In reality, cats possess the ability to turn themselves right side up in mid-air if they should fall upside-down, known as the [[cat righting reflex]]. This enables them to land on their feet if dropped from sufficient height, about {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |title=How does a Cat always land on its feet? |first=Huy D. |last=Nguyen |date=1998 |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology, School of Medical Engineering |accessdate=2014-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010410235503/http://helix.gatech.edu/Classes/ME3760/1998Q3/Projects/Nguyen/ |archivedate=2001-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toast, being an inanimate object, lacks both the ability and the desire to right itself. A study at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]] involving dropping 100 slices under laboratory conditions established that toast typically lands on the floor butter-side-down as a result of the manner in which it is typically dropped from a table, and the aerodynamic drag caused by the air pockets within the bread. The toast is typically butter-side-up when dropped. As it falls, it rotates; given the typical speed of rotation and the typical height of a table, a slice of toast that began butter-side-up on the table will land butter-side-down on the floor in 81% of cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/-rav--r-manchester-boffins-5842879 |title=(-Rav)/ t = R: Manchester boffins find formula for why toast lands butter side down |first=Chris |last=Slater|newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=2013-09-05 |accessdate=2017-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Codework''' is the mixing of [[Alan Sondheim]]'s writing with the code of various [[computer languages]]. The word 'codework' was originally created and given its name by Sondheim,&lt;ref&gt;Sondheim, A. 2001, ABR, Vol 22, Issue 6.&lt;/ref&gt; but also popularized by other Internet artists such as [[Mez Breeze]].&lt;ref&gt;Raley, Rita 2009, Interferences: [Net.Writing] and the Practice of Codework&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes referred to as net.writing. It is said&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electronicbookreview.com/thread/electropoetics/net.writing |title= Code|accessdate=2007-01-25 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to have been inspired by the eclectic poetry of [[e.e.cummings]].

Codework has been used for many forms of writing, mostly [[poetry]] and [[fiction]]. Duc Thuan's  [http://www.ducthuan.com/JavaMoon/moon.htm Days of the Java Moon] is an example of fiction in the codework style. For example:
&lt;!-- should it be &lt;source&gt;--&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
    //Feeling.
   if(ashamed++ == losing self-esteem.S_____ wasn't on diet) [re]solution =
   would stop eating lunch next time;

   //Result.
   after all = S_____ couldn't resist to eat when see[sniff]ing food
   ("ate();", felt defeated &amp; self-disgusted x 1000);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <comment>Changed "sum" with "combined effects", because by reading "sum" some actually believe that it means "convection = diffusive transfer + advective transfer", therefore believing that you have convection even if you ONLY have brownian motion (diffusive transfer). If you find a better way to phrase it than mine then it would be great.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37744">[[File:Convection-snapshot.png|thumb|400px|right|This figure shows a calculation for thermal convection in the [[Mantle (geology)|Earth's mantle]]. Colors closer to red are hot areas and colors closer to blue are in warm and cold areas. A hot, less-dense lower boundary layer sends plumes of hot material upwards, and likewise, cold material from the top moves downwards.]]
'''Convection''' is the heat transfer due to bulk movement of [[molecule]]s within [[fluid]]s such as [[gas]]es and [[liquid]]s, including molten rock ([[rheid]]). Convection takes place through [[advection]], [[diffusion]] or both.
[[File:Ghillie Kettle Thermal.jpg|thumb|Thermal image of a newly lit [[Kelly Kettle|Ghillie kettle]]. The plume of hot air resulting from the convection current is visible.]]
Convection cannot take place in most solids because neither bulk current flows nor significant diffusion of matter can take place. Diffusion of heat takes place in rigid solids, but that is called [[Thermal conduction|heat conduction]]. Convection, however, can take place in soft solids or mixtures where solid particles can move past each other.

Thermal convection can be demonstrated by placing a heat source (e.g. a [[Bunsen burner]]) at the side of a glass filled with a liquid, and observing the changes in temperature in the glass caused by the warmer fluid circulating into cooler areas.

[[Convective heat transfer]] is one of the major types of [[heat transfer]], and convection is also a major mode of [[mass transfer]] in fluids. Convective heat and mass transfer takes place both by [[diffusion]] – the random [[Brownian motion]] of individual particles in the fluid – and by [[advection]], in which matter or heat is transported by the larger-scale motion of currents in the fluid. In the context of heat and mass transfer, the term "convection" is used to refer to the combined effects of [[wikt: advective|advective]] and diffusive transfer.&lt;ref name="Interop"&gt;{{cite book

However, in mechanics the correct use of the word "convection" is the general sense, and different types of convection should be qualified for clarity.

Convection can be qualified in terms of being natural, forced, gravitational, granular, or [[thermomagnetic convection|thermomagnetic]]. It may also be said to be due to [[combustion]], [[capillary action]], or [[Marangoni effect|Marangoni]] and [[Weissenberg effect]]s. Heat transfer by natural convection plays a role in the structure of [[Earth's atmosphere]], its oceans, and its mantle. Discrete convective cells in the atmosphere can be seen as clouds, with stronger convection resulting in [[thunderstorm]]s. Natural convection also plays a role in stellar physics.

==Terminology==
The word ''convection'' may have slightly different but related usages in different scientific or engineering contexts or applications. The broader sense is in [[fluid mechanics]], where ''convection'' refers to the motion of fluid regardless of cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics| first= Bruce R. |last=Munson |isbn= 0-471-85526-X |publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falkovich|first=G.|title=Fluid Mechanics, a short course for physicists|url=http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-107-00575-4|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120034443/http://www.weizmann.ac.il/complex/falkovich/fluid-mechanics|archivedate=2012-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[thermodynamics]] "convection" often refers specifically to heat transfer by convection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics:An Engineering Approach|first= Yunus A. |last=Çengel |first2= Michael A. |last2 = Boles |isbn=0-07-121688-X |publisher =[[McGraw-Hill Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, convection includes fluid movement both by bulk motion ([[advection]]) and by the motion of individual particles ([[diffusion]]).  However, in some cases, convection is taken to mean only advective phenomena.  For instance, in the [[generic scalar transport equation|transport equation]], which describes a number of different transport phenomena, terms are separated into "convective" and "diffusive" effects, with "convective" meaning purely advective in context.

==Examples and applications of convection==
Convection occurs on a large scale in [[Earth atmosphere|atmosphere]]s, oceans, [[planet]]ary [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]s, and it provides the mechanism of heat transfer for a large fraction of the outermost interiors of our sun and all stars. Fluid movement during convection may be invisibly slow, or it may be obvious and rapid, as in a [[hurricane]]. On astronomical scales, convection of gas and dust is thought to occur in the accretion disks of [[black hole]]s, at speeds which may closely approach that of light.

===Heat transfer===
{{Main|Convective heat transfer}}

'''Convective heat transfer''' is a mechanism of [[heat transfer]] occurring because of bulk motion (observable movement) of fluids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Yunus A. |last=Çengel | date = 2003 | title = Heat transfer-A Practical Approach | edition = 2nd | publisher = McGraw Hill Professional | page = 26 | isbn = 978-0-07-245893-0 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heat]] is the entity of interest being advected (carried), and diffused (dispersed). This can be contrasted with [[Heat conduction|conductive]] heat transfer, which is the transfer of energy by vibrations at a molecular level through a solid or fluid, and [[radiative heat transfer]], the transfer of energy through [[electromagnetic waves]].

Heat is transferred by convection in numerous examples of naturally occurring fluid flow, such as wind, oceanic currents, and movements within the Earth's mantle. Convection is also used in engineering practices of homes, industrial processes, cooling of equipment, etc.

The rate of convective heat transfer may be improved by the use of a [[heat sink]], often in conjunction with a fan. For instance, a typical computer [[CPU]] will have a purpose-made [[CPU fan|fan]] to ensure its [[operating temperature]] is kept within tolerable limits.

===Convection cells===
{{main|Convection cell}}
[[File:ConvectionCells.svg|thumb|right|300px|Convection cells in a gravity field]]

A '''convection cell''', also known as a '''[[Bénard cell]]''' is a characteristic fluid flow pattern in many convection systems. A rising body of fluid typically loses heat because it encounters a cold surface. In liquid, this occurs because it exchanges heat with colder liquid through direct exchange. In the example of the Earth's atmosphere, this occurs because it radiates heat. Because of this heat loss the fluid becomes denser than the fluid underneath it, which is still rising. Since it cannot descend through the rising fluid, it moves to one side. At some distance, its downward force overcomes the rising force beneath it, and the fluid begins to descend. As it descends, it warms again and the cycle repeats itself.

===Atmospheric circulation===
{{main|Atmospheric circulation}}
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Idealised depiction of the global circulation on Earth]]

'''Atmospheric circulation''' is the large-scale movement of air, and is a means by which thermal energy is distributed on the surface of the Earth, together with the much slower (lagged) ocean circulation system. The large-scale structure of the atmospheric circulation varies from year to year, but the basic climatological structure remains fairly constant.

Latitudinal circulation occurs because incident solar radiation per unit area is highest at the [[heat equator]], and decreases as the [[latitude]] increases, reaching minima at the poles. It consists of two primary convection cells, the [[Hadley cell]] and the [[polar vortex]], with the [[Hadley cell]] experiencing stronger convection due to the release of [[latent heat]] energy by [[condensation]] of [[water vapor]] at higher altitudes during cloud formation.

Longitudinal circulation, on the other hand, comes about because the ocean has a higher specific heat capacity than land (and also thermal conductivity, allowing the heat to penetrate further beneath the surface ) and thereby absorbs and releases more heat, but the temperature changes less than land. This brings the sea breeze, air cooled by the water, ashore in the day, and carries the land breeze, air cooled by contact with the ground, out to sea during the night. Longitudinal circulation consists of two cells, the [[Walker circulation]] and [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño / Southern Oscillation]].

===Weather===

[[File:foehn1.svg|right|thumb|300px|How Foehn is produced]]

Some more localized phenomena than global atmospheric movement are also due to convection, including wind and some of the [[hydrologic cycle]]. For example, a [[foehn wind]] is a down-slope wind which occurs on the downwind side of a mountain range. It results from the [[adiabatic]] warming of air which has dropped most of its moisture on windward slopes.&lt;ref name="MT"&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael|last=Pidwirny|year=2008|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8e.html|title=CHAPTER 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere (e).

A [[thermal column]] (or thermal) is a vertical section of rising air in the lower altitudes of the Earth's atmosphere. Thermals are created by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface from solar radiation. The Sun warms the ground, which in turn warms the air directly above it. The warmer air expands, becoming less dense than the surrounding air mass, and creating a [[thermal low]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|agency=National Weather Service Forecast Office in [[Tucson, Arizona]]|year=2008|url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon_whatis.php|title=What is a monsoon?|publisher=National Weather Service Western Region Headquarters|accessdate=2009-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68bsAJPPa?url=http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/twc/monsoon/monsoon_whatis.php|archivedate=2012-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1 = Douglas G. | last1 = Hahn | author2-link = Syukuro Manabe | first2 = Syukuro | last2 = Manabe |year=1975|bibcode=1975JAtS...32.1515H|title=The Role of Mountains in the South Asian Monsoon Circulation|journal=[[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences]]|volume=32|issue=8|pages=1515–1541|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1975)032&lt;1515:TROMIT&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0469}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass of lighter air rises, and as it does, it cools by expansion at lower air pressures.

As it travels poleward, warm water transported by strong warm water current undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind driven: wind moving over water cools the water and also causes [[evaporation]], leaving a saltier brine.

The Earth's surface is divided into a number of [[tectonic]] plates that are continuously being created and consumed at their opposite plate boundaries. Creation ([[Accretion (geology)|accretion]]) occurs as mantle is added to the growing edges of a plate. This hot added material cools down by conduction and convection of heat. At the consumption edges of the plate, the material has thermally contracted to become dense, and it sinks under its own weight in the process of subduction at an ocean trench. This subducted material sinks to some depth in the Earth's interior where it is prohibited from sinking further. The subducted oceanic crust triggers volcanism.

===Stack effect===
{{Main|Stack effect}}
The '''Stack effect''' or '''chimney effect''' is the movement of air into and out of buildings, chimneys, flue gas stacks, or other containers due to buoyancy. Buoyancy occurs due to a difference in indoor-to-outdoor air density resulting from temperature and moisture differences. The greater the thermal difference and the height of the structure, the greater the buoyancy force, and thus the stack effect. The stack effect helps drive natural ventilation and infiltration. Some [[cooling tower]]s operate on this principle; similarly the [[solar updraft tower]] is a proposed device to generate electricity based on the stack effect.

The convection zone of a star is the range of radii in which energy is transported primarily by convection.

Granules on the [[photosphere]] of the Sun are the visible tops of convection cells in the photosphere, caused by convection of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] in the photosphere. The rising part of the granules is located in the center where the plasma is hotter. The outer edge of the granules is darker due to the cooler descending plasma. A typical granule has a diameter on the order of 1,000 kilometers and each lasts 8 to 20 minutes before dissipating. Below the photosphere is a layer of much larger "supergranules" up to 30,000 kilometers in diameter, with lifespans of up to 24 hours.

==Convection mechanisms==
Convection may happen in [[fluids]] at all scales larger than a few atoms. There are a variety of circumstances in which the forces required for natural and forced convection arise, leading to different types of convection, described below. In broad terms, convection arises because of [[body force]]s acting within the fluid, such as gravity.

The causes of convection are generally described as one of either "natural" ("free") or "forced", although other mechanisms also exist (discussed below).  However, the distinction between natural and forced convection is particularly important for [[convective heat transfer]].

===Natural convection===
{{main|Natural convection}}
[[File:Thermal-plume-from-human-hand.jpg|thumb|This color [[schlieren]] image reveals [[thermal convection]] from a human hand (in silhouette) to the surrounding still atmosphere.]]

'''Natural convection''', or '''free convection''', occurs due to temperature differences which affect the density, and thus relative buoyancy, of the fluid. Heavier (denser) components will fall, while lighter (less dense) components rise, leading to bulk fluid movement.  Natural convection can only occur, therefore, in a gravitational field. A common example of natural convection is the rise of smoke from a fire. It can be seen in a pot of boiling water in which the hot and less-dense water on the bottom layer moves upwards in plumes, and the cool and more dense water near the top of the pot likewise sinks.

Natural convection will be more likely and more rapid with a greater variation in density between the two fluids, a larger acceleration due to gravity that drives the convection or a larger distance through the convecting medium. Natural convection will be less likely and less rapid with more rapid diffusion (thereby diffusing away the thermal gradient that is causing the convection) or a more viscous (sticky) fluid.

The onset of natural convection can be determined by the [[Rayleigh number]] ('''Ra''').

Note that differences in buoyancy within a fluid can arise for reasons other than temperature variations, in which case the fluid motion is called '''gravitational convection''' (see below). However, all types of buoyant convection, including natural convection, do not occur in [[microgravity]] environments. All require the presence of an environment which experiences [[g-force]] ([[proper acceleration]]).

===Forced convection===
{{main|Forced convection}}

In '''forced convection''', also called '''heat advection''', fluid movement results from external [[surface forces]] such as a fan or pump. Forced convection is typically used to increase the rate of heat exchange. Many types of [[Mixing (process engineering)|mixing]] also utilize forced convection to distribute one substance within another. Forced convection also occurs as a by-product to other processes, such as the action of a propeller in a fluid or [[aerodynamic heating]]. Fluid radiator systems, and also heating and cooling of parts of the body by blood circulation, are other familiar examples of forced convection.

Forced convection may happen by natural means, such as when the heat of a fire causes expansion of air and bulk air flow by this means. In microgravity, such flow (which happens in all directions) along with diffusion is the only means by which fires are able to draw in fresh oxygen to maintain themselves. The shock wave that transfers heat and mass out of explosions is also a type of forced convection.

Although forced convection from thermal gas expansion in [[zero-g]] does not fuel a fire as well as natural convection in a gravity field, some types of artificial forced convection are far more efficient than free convection, as they are not limited by natural mechanisms. For instance, a [[convection oven]] works by forced convection, as a fan which rapidly circulates hot air forces heat into food faster than would naturally happen due to simple heating without the fan.

===Gravitational or buoyant convection===
'''Gravitational convection''' is a type of natural convection induced by buoyancy variations resulting from material properties other than temperature.  Typically this is caused by a variable composition of the fluid.  If the varying property is a concentration gradient, it is known as '''solutal convection'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.15.8288 |title=Pattern Formation in Solutal Convection: Vermiculated Rolls and Isolated Cells }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, gravitational convection can be seen in the diffusion of a source of dry salt downward into wet soil due to the buoyancy of fresh water in saline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raats|first= P. A. C.  |year=1969 |title=Steady Gravitational Convection Induced by a Line Source of Salt in a Soil|journal = [[Soil Science Society of America]] Proceedings |volume = 33 |pages = 483 | doi=10.2136/sssaj1969.03615995003300040005x |issue=4|bibcode=1969SSASJ..33..483R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variable [[salinity]] in water and variable water content in air masses are frequent causes of convection in the oceans and atmosphere which do not involve heat, or else involve additional compositional density factors other than the density changes from thermal expansion (see ''[[thermohaline circulation]]''). Similarly, variable composition within the Earth's interior which has not yet achieved maximal stability and minimal energy (in other words, with densest parts deepest) continues to cause a fraction of the convection of fluid rock and molten metal within the Earth's interior (see below).

Gravitational convection, like natural thermal convection, also requires a [[g-force]] environment in order to occur.

===Granular convection===
{{main|Granular convection}}

Vibration-induced convection occurs in powders and granulated materials in containers subject to vibration where an axis of vibration is parallel to the force of gravity.  When the container accelerates upward, the bottom of the container pushes the entire contents upward. In contrast, when the container accelerates downward, the sides of the container push the adjacent material downward by friction, but the material more remote from the sides is less affected.  The net result is a slow circulation of particles downward at the sides, and upward in the middle.

If the container contains particles of different sizes, the downward-moving region at the sides is often narrower than the largest particles. Thus, larger particles tend to become sorted to the top of such a mixture.  This is one possible explanation of the [[Brazil nut effect]].

'''Thermomagnetic convection''' can occur when an external magnetic field is imposed on a [[ferrofluid]] with varying [[magnetic susceptibility]].  In the presence of a temperature gradient this results in a nonuniform magnetic body force, which leads to fluid movement. A ferrofluid is a liquid which becomes strongly magnetized in the presence of a [[magnetic field]].

This form of heat transfer can be useful for cases where conventional convection fails to provide adequate heat transfer, e.g., in miniature microscale devices or under reduced gravity conditions.

===Capillary action===
{{main|Capillary action}}

'''Capillary action''' is a phenomenon where liquid spontaneously rises in a narrow space such as a thin tube, or in porous materials. This effect can cause liquids to flow against the force of gravity. It occurs because of inter-molecular attractive forces between the liquid and solid surrounding surfaces; If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension and forces of adhesion between the liquid and container act to lift the liquid.

===Marangoni effect===
{{main|Marangoni effect}}
The '''Marangoni effect''' is the convection of fluid along an interface between dissimilar substances because of variations in surface tension.  Surface tension can vary because of inhomogeneous composition of the substances or the temperature-dependence of surface tension forces. In the latter case the effect is known as '''thermo-capillary convection'''.

A well-known phenomenon exhibiting this type of convection is the "[[tears of wine]]".

===Weissenberg effect===
{{Main|Weissenberg effect}}
{{see also|Reptation}}
The '''Weissenberg effect''' is a phenomenon that occurs when a spinning rod is placed into a solution of liquid [[polymer]]. Entanglements cause the polymer chains to be drawn towards the rod instead of being thrown outward as would happen with an ordinary fluid (i.e., water).{{Citation needed|reason=This explanation does not match with the main article nor the referenced text in the main article|date=July 2017}}

===Combustion===
In a [[zero-gravity]] environment, there can be '''no'''  buoyancy forces, and thus no natural (free) convection possible, so flames in many circumstances without gravity smother in their own waste gases. However, flames may be maintained with any type of forced convection (breeze); or (in high oxygen environments in "still" gas environments) entirely from the minimal forced convection that occurs as heat-induced ''expansion'' (not buoyancy) of gases allows for ventilation of the flame, as waste gases move outward and cool, and fresh high-oxygen gas moves in to take up the low pressure zones created when flame-exhaust water condenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_360.html Does a candle burn in zero-g?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317151841/http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a3_360.html |date=2008-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical models of convection==
Mathematically, convection can be described by the [[convection–diffusion equation]], also known as the [[generic scalar transport equation]].

===Quantifying natural versus forced convection===
In cases of mixed convection (natural and forced occurring together) one would often like to know how much of the convection is due to external constraints, such as the fluid velocity in the pump, and how much is due to natural convection occurring in the system.

The relative magnitudes of the [[Grashof number]] and the square of the [[Reynolds number]] determine which form of convection dominates. If &lt;math&gt;\rm Gr/Re^2 \gg 1 &lt;/math&gt;, forced convection may be neglected, whereas if &lt;math&gt;\rm Gr/Re^2 \ll 1 &lt;/math&gt;, natural convection may be neglected. If the ratio, known as the [[Richardson number#Thermal convection|Richardson number]], is approximately one, then both forced and natural convection need to be taken into account.

A '''cosmology episode''' is a sudden loss of meaning, followed eventually by a transformative pivot, which creates the conditions for revised meaning.

In the wake of the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]], the [[Vietnam War]], the 1977 [[Tenerife airport disaster]], the 1984 [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal chemical disaster]], and the relatively sudden insertion of [[personal computers]] into the workplace, organizational scholar [[Karl E. Weick]] coined the term "cosmology episode," as follows, in 1985:

"Representations of events normally hang together sensibly within the set of assumptions that give them life and constitute a 'cosmos' rather than its opposite, a 'chaos.'  Sudden losses of meaning that can occur when an event is represented electronically in an incomplete, cryptic form are what I call a 'cosmology episode.'  Representations in the electronic world can become chaotic for at least two reasons:  The data in these representations are flawed, and the people who manage those flawed data have limited processing capacity.  These two problems interact in a potentially deadly vicious circle."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1985.  Cosmos vs. Chaos:  Sense and Nonsense in Electronic Contexts.  Organizational Dynamics, 14 (Autumn): 50-64&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cosmology episodes evolved significantly between 1985 and 1993, when Weick published his now-classic reanalysis of [[Norman Maclean]]'s study of the [[Mann Gulch fire|Mann Gulch wildland firefighting disaster]] in 1949.  In the 1993 article, Weick positions cosmology episodes within a [[constructivism (psychological school)|constructivist]] [[ontology]], he links the term to a variety of similar concepts, and he provides a better-developed definition than he was able to provide in 1985.

First, Weick makes it clear that cosmology episodes occur within a constructivist ontology of the world, rather than the more familiar [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivist]] and [[subjectivist]] ontologies:

"The basic idea of [[sensemaking]] is that reality is an ongoing accomplishment that emerges from efforts to create order and make retrospective sense of what occurs....  Sensemaking emphasizes that people try to make things rationally accountable to themselves and others.  Thus, in the words of Morgan, Frost, and Pondy (1983: 24), "individuals are not seen as living in, and acting out their lives in relations ''to'', a wider reality, so much as creating and sustaining images of a wider reality, in part to rationalize what they are doing.  They realize their reality by 'reading into' their situation patterns of significant meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, Weick clarifies the key phrase "sudden loss of meaning" by linking it to related ideas described by other organizational scholars:

"Minimal organizations, such as we find in the crew at Mann Gulch, are susceptible to sudden losses of meaning, which have been variably described as fundamental surprises (Reason, 1990) or as events that are inconceivable (Lanir, 1989), hidden (Westrum, 1982), or incomprehensible (Perrow, 1984).  Each of these labels points to the low probability that the event could occur, which is why it is meaningless.  But these explanations say less about the astonishment of the perceiver, and even less about the perceiver's inability to rebuild some sense of what is happening."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, Weick expands his 1985 definition -- "sudden losses of meaning"—to a more nuanced description:

"Cosmology refers to a branch of philosophy often subsumed under metaphysics that combines rational speculation and scientific evidence to understand the universe as a totality of phenomena.  Cosmology is the ultimate macro perspective, directed at issues of time, space, change, and contingency as they relate to the origin and structure of the universe.  Integrations of these issues, however, are not just the handiwork of philosophers.  Others also must make their peace with these issues, as reflected in what they take for granted.  People, including those who are smokejumpers, act as if events cohere in time and space and that change unfolds in an orderly manner.  These everyday cosmologies are subject to disruption.  And when they are severely disrupted, I call this a cosmology episode (Weick, 1985: 51-52).  A cosmology episode occurs when people suddenly and deeply feel that the universe is no longer a rational, orderly system."&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Weick.  1993.  The Collapse of Sensemaking in Organizations:  The Mann Gulch Disaster.  Administrative Science Quarterly, 38: 628-652.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catastrophic Cosmology Episodes ==
Building on Weick's 1993 definition of cosmology episodes, Weick, his colleagues, and other researchers have advanced knowledge of best practices during cosmology episodes at four levels of analysis:  (1) catastrophic cosmology episodes, such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001 and the Haitian earthquake of 2010; (2) disastrous cosmology episodes, such as the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina; (3) contextualized cosmology episodes occurring within specific domains, such as the 1976 Three Mile Island nuclear system incident and the 1970 [[Apollo 13]] space system incident; and (4) everyday cosmology episodes, such as transition of leaders at the top of an organization and the introduction of new technologies throughout an organization.

The study of cosmology episodes is distinct from the study of high-reliability organizations because the concept directs explicit attention to the integral role of human spirituality during catastrophic events—as the threatened entity (what now is my role in the universe?), the source of inspiration/improvisation (what now am I able to do to respond to the event?), and the re-established entity (what now is my different role in the universe?).  Consequently, the topic of cosmology episodes lends itself to study by researchers within two small academic organizations—the American Psychological Association's Division 36 (Psychology of Religion and Spirituality) and the Academy of Management's MSR Division (Management, Spirituality, and Religion).

== Disastrous Cosmology Episodes ==
A 2016 article titled "Cosmology Episodes:  A Reconceptualization," Doug Orton and Kari O'Grady identified three taxonomies that they found helpful in studying 164 citations of the term "cosmology episode" on Google Scholar.  One taxonomy was based on level of analysis (nation, community, organization, team, and individual).  One taxonomy was based on five resilience processes (anticipating, sense-losing, improvising, sense-remaking, and renewing).  The third taxonomy -- of interest here -- is level of intensity of the cosmology episode (catastrophe, disaster, crisis, ancillary, and metaphorical).  Communications researchers tend to be more present in the study of community disasters; management researchers tend to be more present in the study of organizational crises.  Importantly, though, it is possible for a community-level cosmology episode to be catastrophic (e.g. Hurrican Katrina), disastrous (e.g the Red River floods of 1997), a crisis (e.g. the 22 July 2005 Stockwell Subway Shooting), ancillary (e.g. an e coli epidemic for a food company), and metaphorical (e.g. the introduction of new technology in an Italian courtroom).

'''Dangerous play in rugby union''' is dealt with under the foul play [[Rugby union gameplay|law]] (Law 10) in the official [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB) [[rugby union]] law book. It defines foul play as "anything a player does within the playing enclosure that is against the letter and spirit of the Laws of the Game".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/91/during-the-match/foul-play/definitions/#clause_91|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10 Definitions|publisher = ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under these laws dangerous play includes; [[Punch (combat)|punching]] or striking, [[Stomp (strike)|stamping]] or trampling, and [[Kick|kicking.]]&lt;ref name ="10.4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/95/method-of-playing-the-match/foul-play/dangerous-play-and-misconduct/#clause_95|title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.4 Dangerous Play and Misconduct|publisher = ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate = 2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

If a [[Rugby union match officials|referee]] observes dangerous play they are obliged to penalise and admonish the perpetrator. This can result in a "temporary suspension" ([[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]) of 10 minutes or even a "sending off" ([[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/96/during-the-match/foul-play/sanctions/#clause_96 |title=Laws of the Game Rugby Union 2010, Law 10.5 Sanctions |publisher=''[[International Rugby Board]]'' |accessdate=2010-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725075145/http://www.irblaws.com/EN/laws/3/10/96/during-the-match/foul-play/sanctions/ |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the offence is serious enough further action can be taken after the game, including bans from playing rugby and [[Indictment|criminal charges]]. In some high-profile matches a [[citing commissioner]] is appointed, who can cite any player for dangerous play, whether they have been detected by the referee or not.&lt;ref name="REG17"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|title= REGULATION 17. ILLEGAL AND/OR FOUL PLAY AND MISCONDUCT|publisher= ''[[International Rugby Board]]''|accessdate= 2010-04-29|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609160719/http://www.irb.com/mm/document/lawsregs/0/regulation17090730_8711.pdf|archivedate= 2012-06-09|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In matches where there is no appointed citing commissioner the Unions involved can cite players for dangerous play.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; During the judicial process the severity of the incident is considered. This is assessed by judging if the offending was intentional, reckless, provoked or premeditated as well as what body part was used (fist, knee, boot etc.), how vulnerable the victim was, the effect of the actions had on the victim and disciplinary record of the offender.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; When handing out match suspensions for dangerous play the IRB recommends suspension periods based on the type and severity of the offence. For most incidences of dangerous play (punching, stamping, dangerous tackles etc.) they recommend suspensions starting from two weeks, up to a maximum of one year.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; The more serious offences include striking with the head (up to two years), making contact with the eyes (up to three years), testicle grabbing (up to four years) and biting (up to four years).&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt;

==Misconduct==

The law that deals with dangerous play also applies to misconduct.&lt;ref name ="10.4"/&gt; Misconduct is any conduct (excluding foul play during a match) that is unsporting, unruly, ill-disciplined or that brings the sport of rugby union into disrepute.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Misconduct deals with violence or intimidation that occurs within the venue (i.e. changing rooms, tunnel, warmup area), abuse of match officials or spectators, discriminatory statements, [[bribery]], [[betting]] on involved games or lying about past disciplinary records.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; The penalty handed down for misconduct cases could be a caution, [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], suspension (for a number of matches or time period), exclusion from Rugby Unions or grounds, suspension from Rugby officiating or a combination of the above.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Verbal abuse of match officials can be punished by up to a year suspension, while threatening could result in five years and physical abuse of an official could see the offender banned for life.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt; Racial or other discriminatory abuse could see a player banned for up to a year. if the player is banned he or she can go to the crown kings general court so that they can get the time on their ban reduced.&lt;ref name="REG17"/&gt;

==History==

Early [[Rugby Football|Rugby]] games were played under a code of conduct that varied between each school or club.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=13}} As the popularity and number of clubs increased a set of standardised rules were developed. On the 24 November 1863 a set of rules were developed by [[the Football Association]] (FA) that included the first law involving dangerous play. Law 10 stated that: "If any player with the ball should run towards his advisories' goal, any player in the opposition side should be at liberty to charge, hold, trip, or hack him, or wrest the ball from him; but no player shall be held or hacked at the same time".{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=14}} Hacking (tripping an opponent and kicking his shins) and carrying the ball were the most contested rules and they were soon scrapped by the FA. This caused some clubs to leave the Association and soon more games were played that involved hacking and carrying the ball than those that followed the FA's "official" laws.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=15}} Concerns over hacking came to a head in 1870 when a surgeon published a letter in the times complaining about the number of rugby injuries he had dealt with that involved hacking, and chastised the schools for letting it continue.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=19}}

==Punching and fighting==

During the 1974 Lions tour to South Africa, Lions captain [[Willie McBride (rugby union)|Willie McBride]] devised a plan where on [[99 call|a set call]] every player would attack a South African player, reasoning that this would prevent the referee form penalising any one individual, as he could not send the whole team off.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt;
After French fullback [[Serge Blanco]] was bumped after taking a mark by Englishman [[Nigel Heslop]] during the 1991 Rugby World Cup quarter-final, flanker [[Éric Champ]] knocked Heslop out with a punch.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; In 1990 English lock [[Paul Ackford]] was unexpectedly hit by a haymaker from Argentine prop [[Federico Mendez]] after being mistaken for another player who made contact with Mendez's head.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; During the [[British and Irish Lions]] 2001 tour match against Australian state side the [[New South Wales Waratahs]], fullback [[Duncan McRae (rugby)|Duncan McRae]] punched Lions [[Fly half]] [[Ronan O'Gara]] multiple times as he lay prone on the ground.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; He received a red card and subsequent seven week ban for the offence, although as it occurred during the Australian [[off-season]] he didn't miss any games. In 2009 at a rugby derby involving two of Romania's top teams a mass brawl broke out involving most of the players and reportedly a few spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mass Romanian rugby brawl caught a big hit on film|newspaper=Herald Sun|date=April 14, 2009|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/mass-rugby-brawl-caught-on-film/story-e6frf7jo-1225697244711|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two players received a red card at the time and nine players were later suspended by the Romanian Rugby Federation.

==Stamping and kicking==

In a 1927 match involving [[US Quillan|Quillan]], the strongest team in France at the time, and [[USA Perpignan|Perpignan]], the Quillan hooker Gaston Riviere received such a kicking that he died from his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby-union-how-the-imperial-settlers-carried-an-oval-ball-from-the-pampas-to-pacific-1123272.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Sean | last=Smith | title=Rugby Union: How the imperial settlers carried an oval ball from the Pampas to Pacific | date=30 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welsh fullback [[JPR Williams]] was the victim of stamping by touring New Zealand prop [[John Ashworth (rugby union)|John Ashworth]] in 1978.&lt;ref name = "Hew"/&gt; After receiving 30 stitches from his father he returned to the game. A player for Welsh club [[Pontycymmer RFC|Pontycymmer]] was jailed for 15 months after stomping on an opposition player's head during a rugby game in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 November 2007|title=Rugby player jailed for stamping|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7090654.stm|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 a South African rugby player from the Western Cape died after allegedly being kicked in the head during a rugby match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=History of violence emerges after rugby death|date=June 27, 2006|author=Ben Maclennan|newspaper=Iol Sport|url=http://www.iol.co.za/sport/history-of-violence-emerges-after-rugby-death-1.283327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biting==

South African prop [[Johan Le Roux]] bit New Zealand hooker [[Sean Fitzpatrick]]'s ear during a scrum during a test in 1994, receiving an 18-month ban.&lt;ref name = "Hew"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blood, punch-ups and biting|author=Huw Baines|date=March 11, 2009|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/scrum/rugby/story/93244.html|publisher=ESPN Scrum}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the disciplinary hearing he stated that "For an 18-month suspension, I feel I probably should have torn it off".

==Eye-gouging==
{{details|Eye-gouging (rugby union)}}
Eye-gouging is a serious offence  where a player uses hands or fingers to inflict pain in an opponent's eyes. The game's laws refer to it as "contact with eyes or the eye area of an opponent" but such incidents are usually referred to as "eye-gouging" among players and in the media.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |title=Eye gouging: war is declared on rugby's ‘ultimate sin’ |first=Mark |last=Souster |newspaper=The Times (London) |date=2010-01-11 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/rugby_union/article6982910.ece }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRB has made special mention of eye gouging, describing it as "particularly heinous".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"&gt;{{cite news |title=IRB review signals intent to get tough on gouging |first=Andrew |last=Baldock |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=2 July 2009 |url=http://sport.scotsman.com/rugby/IRB-review-signals-intent-to.5421507.jp }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two high-profile test match incidents, involving [[Schalk Burger]] and [[Sergio Parisse]], during the same week in June 2009, the IRB stated that it would review the sanction structure for this type of offence "in order to send out the strongest possible message that such acts will not be tolerated".&lt;ref name="Scotsman"/&gt;

On 2 October 2010, [[Gavin Quinnell]] of the Welsh regional team [[Scarlets]] suffered an eye injury 30 minutes into a game between Scarlets feeder club [[Llanelli RFC|Llanelli]] and [[Cross Keys RFC|Cross Keys]].

'''Sustainability education''' ('''SE'''), '''Education for Sustainability''' ('''EfS'''), and '''Education for Sustainable Development''' ('''ESD''') are often used interchangeably to describe the practice of teaching for [[sustainability]]. ESD is the term most used internationally and by the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esdtoolkit.org/|title=Untitled Document|website=Esdtoolkit.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agenda 21]] was the first international document that identified education as an essential tool for achieving sustainable development and highlighted areas of action for education.

== Concept and origin ==
One definition of Education for Sustainable Development is an “interdisciplinary learning methodology covering the integrated social, economic, and environmental aspects of formal and informal curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heacademy.ac.uk/knowledge-hub/education-sustainable-development-0|title=Education for sustainable development {{!}} Higher Education Academy|website=www.heacademy.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This academic approach can help graduates nurture their knowledge, talents, and experience to play a role in environmental development and become responsible members of society. The Brundtland Commission defined sustainable development as meeting the needs of the present generation without putting at risk the capacity of generations to come in meeting their own requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org/AdvocacyToolkit/index.php/earth-summit-history/past-earth-summits/58-the-brundtland-commission|title=The Brundtland Commission|website=www.sustainabledevelopment2015.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Agency used to be the World Commission on Environment and Development created in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.reset.org/knowledge/advancing-sustainable-development-through-education-india|title=Education for Sustainable Development {{!}} Development|website=RESET.to|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of sustainable development originated from the United Nations Conference on Human Environment in Stockholm (Sweden 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/milestones/humanenvironment|title=UN Conference on the Human Environment .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were two more global activities since then. These were the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development 1987 (Our Common Future Report)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environmentandsociety.org/mml/un-world-commission-environment-and-development-ed-report-world-commission-environment-and|title=UN World Commission on Environment and Development, ed., Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future {{!}} Environment &amp; Society Portal|website=www.environmentandsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 1992 (Rio Earth Summit).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp317-e.htm|title=The Rio Earth Summit: summary of the United Nations conference on Environment and Development (BP-317E)|website=publications.gc.ca|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[UNESCO]], education for sustainable development involves:

{{quote|integrating key sustainable development issues into teaching and learning. This may include, for example, instruction about [[climate change]], [[disaster risk reduction]], [[biodiversity]], and [[poverty reduction]] and [[sustainable consumption]]. It also requires participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviours and take action for sustainable development. ESD consequently promotes competencies like critical thinking, imagining future scenarios and making decisions in a collaborative way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/education/themes/leading-the-international-agenda/education-for-sustainable-development|title=Education for Sustainable Development|website=UNESCO|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;}}

The aspiration of sustainable development requires us to resolve common problems and tensions and to recognize new horizons. Economic growth and the creation of wealth have reduced global poverty rates, but vulnerability, inequality, exclusion and violence have increased within and across societies throughout the world. Unsustainable patterns of economic production and consumption contribute to global warming, [[environmental degradation]] and an upsurge in natural disasters. Moreover, while international human rights frameworks have been strengthened over the past several decades, the implementation and protection of these norms remain a challenge. For example, despite the progressive empowerment of women through greater access to education, they continue to face discrimination in public life and in employment. Violence against women and children, particularly girls, continues to undermine their rights. Again, while technological development contributes to greater interconnectedness and offers new avenues for exchange, cooperation and solidarity, we also see an increase in cultural and religious intolerance, identity-based political mobilization and conflict.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100088-1|location=|pages=9–10, 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education must find ways of responding to such challenges, taking into account multiple worldviews and alternative knowledge systems, as well as new frontiers in science and technology such as the advances in neurosciences and the developments in digital technology. Rethinking the purpose of education and the organization of learning has never been more urgent.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Background==
Groundwork has been laid for sustainability education worldwide. Recent changes in [[service learning]], a focus on literacies and skills, standards that support interdisciplinary thinking, and the role of [[systems thinking]] have all increased the visibility of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Dernback, J.C. (2002) ''Stumbling toward sustainability.'' Environmental Law Institute. p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; Various approaches to ESD encourage people to understand the complexities of, and synergies between, the issues threatening planetary sustainability and understand and, specifically through EfS, assess their own values and those of the society in which they live in the context of sustainability. ESD seeks to engage people in negotiating a sustainable future, making decisions and acting on them. It is generally agreed on that sustainability education must be customized for individual learners,&lt;ref&gt;Huckle, J. and Sterling, S.R. (2006) ''Education for sustainability.'' Earthscan. p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Education for Sustainability (EfS), in particular, focuses not on the environmental, social and economic loci of education but on the human skills that are needed for any environmental education to succeed. These thinking and relational skills are thus fundamental, not just to ESD, but to education in general. &lt;ref&gt; Bedi, G. and Germein, S. (2015)Simply Good Teaching: Supporting Transformation and Change Through Education for Sustainability.[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292073996_Simply_Good_Teaching_Supporting_Transformation_and_Change_Through_Education_for_Sustainability] &lt;/ref&gt;  The following skills are seen as integral to Education for Sustainability (EfS):&lt;ref&gt;Tilbury, D. and Wortman, D. (2004). Engaging People in Sustainability. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Envisioning&amp;nbsp;– being able to imagine a better future. The premise is that if we know where we want to go, we will be better able to work out how to get there.
* [[Critical thinking]] and reflection&amp;nbsp;– learning to question our current belief systems and to recognize the assumptions underlying our knowledge, perspective and opinions. Critical thinking skills help people learn to examine economic, environmental, social and cultural structures in the context of sustainable development.
* [[Systems thinking|Systemic thinking]]&amp;nbsp;– acknowledging complexities and looking for links and synergies when trying to find solutions to problems.
* Building partnerships&amp;nbsp;– promoting dialogue and negotiation, learning to work together.
* Participation in decision-making&amp;nbsp;– empowering people.

==United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD)==
In recognition of the importance of ESD, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly declared 2005–2014 the UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=961|title=The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005&amp;nbsp;– 2014|work=UNESCO|accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] leads the Decade and has developed an International Implementation Scheme&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/index.php?id=990|title=UNESCO Office in Bangkok: International Implementation Scheme|website=Unescobkk.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Decade. The goals of the decade are to provide an opportunity for refining and promoting the vision of, and transition to, sustainable development&amp;nbsp;– through all forms of education, public awareness and training; and to give an enhanced profile to the important role of education and learning in sustainable development. Education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prescott.edu/learn/phd-sustainability-education/|title=Academics at Prescott College|website=Prescott.edu|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; for sustainability is the practice of learning how to achieve global and local sustainable communities.

The objectives of the DESD are to:
* facilitate networking linkages, exchange and interaction among stakeholders in ESD;
* foster increased quality of teaching and learning in ESD;
* help countries make progress towards and attain the Millennium Development Goals through ESD efforts;
* provide countries with new opportunities to incorporate ESD into education reform efforts.
The end of the Decade was marked by the [[UNESCO World Conference on Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD). Made during the conference was the 2014 [[Aichi-Nagoya Declaration on Education for Sustainable Development]], which invites governments ‘to reinforce the integration of ESD into education, training, and sustainable development policies.’&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Where UNESCO serves as the lead agency to integrate the principles of sustainable development into all aspects of education to address the economic, social, cultural and environmental problems of the 21st century.

a-The United Nations Program on Education for Sustainable Development aims to
1- cultivate in every human being the knowledge and skills necessary to reach  more sustainable future.
2– Include any child in the world to the educational edifice and provide access to school.
3- Improve the quality of education.
4- Promote the concept of global citizenship.
In the future UNESCO will support its Education for All (EFA) plan and will continue to support its education line with the cooperation of other partner organizations such as UNICEF, the World Bank, the OECD,education international and NGOs.

b-UNESCO's role in education for sustainable development.
1-UNESCO Prize "Education for Sustainable Development".
UNESCO invited governments and non-governmental organizations with official partnerships with UNESCO to nominate 3 individuals, institutions or organizations working in the field of education for sustainable development In order to be part of the UNESCO award, provided that it participates in one or more of the five areas of work of the program of education for sustainable development.Where the value of the prize $150000 is divided among 3 winners.
UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova awarded the UNESCO / Japan Prize for Education for Sustainable Development to SERES from Guatemala and El Salvador, JAYAGIRL from Indonesia and ROOTABILITY from Germany at a ceremony held at UNESCO headquarters in Paris.
This award is the first to be presented since its inception in the field of education for sustainable development. This award is being funded by the Government of Japan.

==UNESCO and climate change education for sustainable development==
Education is a key component of the global response to climate change in relation to UNESCO and its partners in the United Nations. Article 6 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change states that "States should facilitate education programs for awareness on climate change".

Education in climate change for sustainable development aims to improve understanding of the key concepts of sustainability and the blood of these four directions:
:1– Provide basic education because drought, floods, high temperatures and others affect the rates of :attendance of students in basic education.
:2– Redirecting education towards critical thinking that reaches local and global solutions to climate change such as ozone hole.
:3– increase educational awareness in order to rationalize energy consumption.
UNESCO and the United Nations Convention on the Use of Climate Change Education rely not only on schools but also on online courses and More than 14 million students and 2.1 million teachers in 58 countries have been involved in such education.

On the other hand, NGOs as a partner of the government contribute to sustainable development as a real contribution, and have succeeded in building development awareness, stability and employment through a real and effective participation in the development process.  It also has a role in finding a balance between the ecosystem and the economy to conserve natural resources. Organizations are the right arm of governments in the process of sustainable development.

==Global Action Programme on Education for Sustainable Development (GAP on ESD)==
The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development took place from 2005 to 2014, with the goal of emphasizing education in all its forms (formal, non-formal and informal) as an indispensable element for achieving sustainable development. In November 2014, as the official follow-up to the DESD, UNESCO launched the Global Action Programme (GAP) for ESD with the overall objective to scale up action on ESD worldwide. Two basic and very important objectives of GAP on ESD are:
* Reorienting education and learning so that everyone has the opportunity to acquire the values, skills and knowledge that empower them to contribute to sustainable development; and
* Enhancing the role of education and learning in all relevant agendas, programmes and activities that promote sustainable development.
The GAP focuses on generating and scaling-up action in five Priority Action Areas: 1. Advancing policy; 2. Transforming learning and training environments; 3. Building capacities of educators and trainers; 4. Empowering and mobilizing youth; 5. Accelerating sustainable solutions at local level. Due to its strong linkages with sustainable development, the GAP on ESD provides an excellent framework for understanding the types of education, training and public awareness initiatives conducive to enabling people of all ages to understand and implement solutions for solving the complex problems presented by climate change.&lt;ref name=":06"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002464/246435e.pdf|title=Action for climate empowerment: Guidelines for accelerating solutions through education, training and public|publisher=UNESCO and UNFCCC|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3100-182-6|location=|pages=16–17, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO’s work on [[Climate change education (CCE)|Climate Change Education]] (CCE) within the framework of its GAP on ESD aims to make education a more central and visible part of the international response to climate change; to support countries to integrate CCE into their education and training systems; and to support countries in achieving a smooth transition to green economies and resilient societies through education and training.&lt;ref name=":06" /&gt;

==Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)==
''See main article: [[Sustainable Development Goals]]''
ESD is explicitly recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education, together with [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED), which UNESCO promotes as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives |publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2015|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Target 4.7 of the SDGs states:&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite book |url= http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf |title= Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|publisher= UNESCO|location= Paris |year=2017|isbn= 978-92-3-100209-0 |pages=7, 48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;By 2030, ensure that all learners acquire knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others,In August 2015, 193 countries agreed on the following 17 goals: [4]

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015|url=http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s crucial importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs, enabling individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behaviour. ESD can produce specific cognitive, socio-emotional and behavioural learning outcomes that enable individuals to deal with the particular challenges of each SDG, thus facilitating its achievement. In short, ESD enables all individuals to contribute to achieving the SDGs by equipping them with the knowledge and competencies they need, not only to understand what the SDGs are about, but to engage as informed citizens in bringing about the necessary transformation.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

==U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development==
The U.S. Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development (USPESD)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uspartnership.org/view_archive_path/1|title=U.S. Partnership|website=Uspartnership.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of individuals, organizations and institutions in the United States dedicated to education for sustainable development (ESD). It acts as a convener, catalyst, and communicator working across all sectors of American society.

The U.S. Partnership was conceived at a November 2003 "Open Space" gathering held in Washington, DC that included almost 100 participants from a diverse range of sectors including K-12 and higher education, science and research organizations, conservation and environmental NGOs, faith communities, living institutions, youth advocacy organizations, government agencies and others.  Convened by the National Council on Science and the Environment and University Leaders for a Sustainable Future, the group met to respond to the call by the UN General Assembly for a Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (2005 through 2014) and to consider specifically:
# How the Decade could be leveraged to advance education for sustainable development (ESD) in the United States;
# What were the opportunities for collaboration within and across sectors; and
# How could widespread engagement in the Decade by U.S. organizations be facilitated.

A subsequent strategic planning retreat on the campus of Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania gave shape to the emerging Partnership.  Hosted by the International Center for Leadership Results and facilitated by Group Jazz, participants agreed upon the Partnership's Vision&amp;nbsp;– "sustainable development integrated into education and learning in the United States;" and Mission&amp;nbsp;– to "leverage the UN Decade to foster education for sustainable development in the United States". They also conceived of an operating structure for the Partnership, including Action Teams (Marketing, Outreach, Funding, ICT, Youth etc.) and Sector Teams (K-12, Higher Education, Faith Communities, Business, and Communities.), whose volunteer leadership would comprise an Executive Team.  An "Interim Steward" would provide ongoing facilitation and leadership.

Participants decided that the Partnership would not design or implement programs of its own. Rather, it would serve as a clearing house&amp;nbsp;– helping to connect, highlight, and foster collaboration among partners&amp;nbsp;– and serving as a catalyst to convene groups and build community to support existing and emerging initiatives.

The Partnership supports its vision and mission through periodic conference calls, in-person meetings and events, and its website.  Action and Sector Teams remain key operational components of the Partnership, carrying out a range of activities in support of its mission and vision. Action Teams are responsible for planning and carrying out joint activities that support the entire partnership (e.g. Funding, ICT, Marketing). Sector Teams focus on the needs of their own sector (e.g. Higher Ed., K-12, Faith Communities). The Sector Teams have compiled ESD tools and resources and worked together to advance ESD through initiatives held "in collaboration with the U.S. Partnership". The Disciplinary Associations Network for Sustainability and the Higher Education Associations Sustainability Consortium are networks of national higher education associations integrating information about our urgent sustainability challenges and solutions into education. The Decade and the U.S. Partnership provide international and national context for such efforts, helping to promote and strengthen education for sustainable development in the United States.Education and sustainable development are two sides of a single coin.
Their human goal is to build human beings and develop their capacities to achieve sustainable development in an efficient and equitable manner in which life choices are available to people.
Therefore, education is the heart of development and its solidity and that the success of development in any society depends very much on the success of the educational system in this society.
Education is therefore the key to progress, the instrument of renaissance and the source of strength in societies.Therefore, there is a close relationship between education and sustainable development so that development can not achieve any step unless qualified manpower is available and therefore the process of education is the basis of the process of sustainable development.
Hence, the learning process is closely related to sustainable development, namely, investment in human beings and human beings. This has led to a radical shift in educational development thinking, which focuses on the development of human capacities and the importance of education as the focus of real development and human capacity development.
Where Chinese wisdom says: If you want to invest for one year and the wheat flour and if you want to invest for ten years tree sap and if you want to invest life and flourish in people.
Therefore, education is the one that pushed man to the heart of the development process and the slogan of no development without human beings and therefore the comprehensive sustainable development is no longer dependent on physical capital onlyBut the most important need is the presence of a trained and qualified workforce capable of producing more and more.

==Sustainable development in Canada==
Sustainable Development Strategy for organizations in Canada is about the Government of Canada finding ways to develop social, financial, and environmental resources that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs in Canada. A Sustainable Development Strategy for the organization needs to be developed that establishes the Sustainable Development goals and objectives set by the Auditor General Act of Canada and provides the written policies and procedures to achieve them. Sustainable Development is based on responsible decision-making, which considers not only the economic benefits of development, but also the short-term and long-term, Canadian environment and environmental impacts.

== Sustainability education by private industry  ==
The private sector plays an increasingly important role in environmental and sustainability education. In recent years, as the seriousness of problems such as climate change and hazards to the environment have received more emphasis, corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and sustainability education has been discussed more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ju|first=Eunjeong|last2=Jang|first2=Shinho|date=2017-07-30|title=How can Corporations Contribute to the Community through Environmental Education? : Focusing on Partnerships between Corporations and Universities in Korea|url=http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ies/article/view/58454|journal=International Education Studies|language=en|volume=10|issue=8|pages=116|doi=10.5539/ies.v10n8p116|issn=1913-9039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to recent survey research conducted by GreenBiz in partnership with National Environmental Education Foundation (NEEF) and PwC, 73% of respondents indicated that their company is educating employees across the organization about its corporate sustainability goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neefusa.org/employee-engagement|title=Employee Engagement|work=NEEF|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies are anticipating that the value of Environment &amp; Sustainability education (E&amp;S) knowledge will increase and many are already providing some education to their employees. Nearly half of respondents to the GreenBiz survey whose companies have no current program believe their company will begin educating employees in the next two years.&lt;ref name="NEEF"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neefusa.org/resource/engaged-organization-corporate-employee-environmental-education-survey-and-case-study|title=The Engaged Organization: Corporate Employee Environmental Education Survey and Case Study Findings|work=NEEF|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of organizational models for employee environment and sustainability education programs. For example, Cisco employees live and work in a Web 2.0 world and are comfortable collaborating online while Wal-Mart  finds a person-to-person approach the most effective.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

Some companies aim to raise environmental literacy among their employees so they can contribute to environmental improvements both at work and in the community. Other companies, seek to leverage employees’ knowledge and expertise to transform the company and its products and services to meet a sustainability vision. Organizations use a varied, creative set of methods to reach and influence employees including multi-departmental leadership, employee-led “green” teams, awards, online training, mixed-media communications and performance incentives Several companies also with external partners including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to create successful E&amp;S education programs.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

Through its Business Sustainability Educational Roundtable, NEEF engaged leading companies, including Kimberly-Clark, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Intel and others, to share and develop best practices on employee engagement &lt;nowiki&gt;http://64.130.52.13/business/member_resources.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;. A number of other reports have been published by the NEEF detailing the benefits of sustainability education in corporations and provide some examples and case studies of how corporations embed sustainability education into their operations.&lt;ref name="NEEF"/&gt;

==Sustainable development and education in Uganda==
From a political point of view you can say that the idea of sustainability comes from two different trends developed after the Second World War, which can be related to when colonial powers ended their occupation. Within the first trend, it was noticed that the former colonies suffered from social and economical problems like poverty and lack of food.  The United Nations therefore arranged several conferences where solutions to these problems were outlined. Several international organs were established, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WBG). The second trend stars out from the alarming reports that began to appear during the 1960s, which warned for humans’ way of using nature resources. The resources would come to an end because of the future economical growth and increase in population. A first attempt to discuss these trends could be seen during the United nations Conference on the Environment in Stockholm 1972. As a result, [[United Nations]] development Program (UNDP) was founded.

The first conference concerning environmental education (EE) was held in [[Tbilisi]] in 1977 and it resulted in the Tbilisi declaration. The document focuses on EE and maintains among others that it should be interdisciplinary, be  a  lifelong  process and develop critical thinking and problem&amp;nbsp;– solving skills. The declaration has had a large effect on curriculums, for example in  the Uganda strategy to implementing education for sustainable development The term SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT got an international breakthrough in 1987 with the Bruntland Commissions final report. Our Common Future. The definition of sustainable development was stated in this report and it is still ubiquitous.“Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”
Sustainable development is about a global responsibility and solidarity between generations, between women and men and between different cultures and countries. It is about safeguarding and efficient use of existing nature resources. Investment in management of human, social and physiological resources is also crucial parts of sustainable development. Democratic values permeate the society and the citizens feel that they can influence the development, and that they have the will of taking that responsibility for doing so.

The principles underlying sustainable  can be separated into a social, economic, and ecological dimension. The economic growth is used to be seen as a requirement for development. No country can achieve a sustainable economic growth if the environment is worsened, if the prosperity is not fairly distributed and if growth of the human resources has not taken place. Therefore, the economical dimension means that economical growth shall carry on with: first, respect taken to the environment, second, growth of the people’s health and education and third, a fair distribution of prosperity. The social dimension points out the importance resources, power and influence are fairly distributed and that people can feel security and can participate. The social dimension is therefore a requirement for economic growth. The environment dimension means that considerations are taken for the social and economical development. These three dimensions are integrated with each other as they are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. The implication of this is that sustainable development to a large extent is about politics
In 1992 a UN conference, also known as Earth Summit, was held in Rio de Janeiro. The most famous agreement from that meeting is the Agenda 21, a plan of action for sustainable development. Two major differences from earlier conferences were:
*(a) the large number of participating voluntary organizations and
*(b) the emphasis of the plan of action of the regional, national and local cooperation to reach a sustainable development. Chapter 36 in Agenda 21 brings up educational issues and it emphasizes the importance of orienting the education to achieve sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.org|title=WWF&amp;nbsp;– Find your local WWF office|website=Wwf.org|accessdate=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is critical for promoting sustainable development and improving the capacity of the people to address environment and development issues. Both formal and non-formal education are indispensable to changing people’s attitudes so that they have the capacity to assess and address their sustainable development concerns. It is also critical for achieving environmental and ethical awareness, values and attitudes, skills and behavior consistent with sustainable development and for effective public participation in decision making.
In the year 2000 the United Nations Millennium Declaration was adopted, which emphasizes that a global development demands a comprehensive view. The declaration formed the basis of time&amp;nbsp;–bound and measurable goals for development. It contained eight goals that should promote a global development. Among them were goals for reduction of poverty, reduction of infant mortality, reduction of the HIV/AIDS, malaria spreading and a sustainable development until 2015.

==Education for Sustainable Development in Germany==
Within the Decade of Education for Sustainable Development the field of ESD in Germany has expanded a lot. There are broad school-networks and strong relationships between schools and out-of-school-education. Nevertheless, estimations{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} say that the concept only has reached about 10% of the schools and many individual teachers all over the country. ESD and Global Education&amp;nbsp;– which in the past were two different concepts&amp;nbsp;– now work under the same headline. Global Education (in Germany "Global Learning") is a special entry to ESD which emphasises the relationships between north and south in a globalized world and discusses injustices between the different parts of the world, partly with reference to the postcolonial discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb05/fileadmin/datas/fb05/FG_Politikwissenschaften/FG_DidaktikderpolitischenBildung/Overwien_CORR-1-Christoforatou_01.pdf|format=PDF|author=Overwien, Bernd|title=Education for Sustainable Development and Global Learning&amp;nbsp;– References to Teaching Right Livelihood.

==Climate-friendly schools==
{{Main|Climate-friendly school}}
A climate-friendly school is a school that uses education for sustainable development (ESD) to promote a culture of sustainability in which students, staff and families hold shared values and beliefs about the importance of taking action for a more sustainable society. Taking care of the environment and contributing to reducing [[climate change]] is an integral part of this. [[Climate action]] means different things to different schools. Some schools see climate action as key to “doing their part” to take care of the planet. For other schools, it is about addressing issues directly affecting them.&lt;ref name=":05"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002467/246740e.pdf|title=Getting Climate-Ready: A Guide for Schools on Climate Action|last=Gibb|first=Natalie|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100193-2|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The connection of ESD and TVET==
{{Main|TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)}}
TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|website=Unevoc.unesco.org|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainabile development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=9, 23, 25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TVET systems are progressively expected to provide education for sustainability as part of their core curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curriculum.edu.au/leader/environmental_education_for_a_sustainable_future:_,4695.html|title=Environmental Education for a sustainable future: formal schooling|first=|last=Woods|date=1 January 2003|website=Curriculum.edu.au|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; TVET prepares people for work in a range of sectors, e.g construction, waste management and agriculture, industries that consume enormous amounts of energy, raw materials and water.  Sustainability requires that those working in these sectors have the requisite technical knowledge to make these industries more sustainable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=2012|title=Shanghai Consensus.

TVET systems often have a regional or international variations along with language skills needed for labour mobility. TVET systems are able to provide education for sustainable development and global citizenship, and for meeting the demand for an integrated approach to skill types and diverse fields of study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==The connection of ESD and Global Citizenship Education (GCED)==
{{Main|Global citizenship education|l1=Global Citizenship Education}}
GCED and ESD pursue the same vision: It is all about empowering learners of all ages to become proactive contributors to a more just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive and sustainable world. Both GCED and ESD:
* focus not only on the content and outcome of what is learned, but also on the process of how it is learned and in what type of environment it is learned.
* emphasize action, change and transformation.
* place importance on acquiring values and attitudes relevant to addressing global challenges.

==The connection of ESD and Climate Change Education (CCE)==
{{Main|Climate change education (CCE)|l1=Climate Change Education (CCE)}}
Climate Change Education (CCE) is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":07"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrating ESD in curricula and textbooks==
ESD concerns the core of teaching and learning and should not be considered as an add-on to the existing curriculum. Mainstreaming ESD requires integrating sustainability topics into the curricula, but also sustainability-related intended learning outcomes.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Curricula need to ensure that all children and young people learn not just foundation skills, but also transferable skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, advocacy and con ict resolution, to help them become responsible global citizens” (UNESCO, 2014c: 36). From the development of sustainability curricula it is expected to “improve the capacity of our education systems to prepare people to pursue sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[United Nations]]|date=2012|title=The future we want.

===Examples===
====Mauritius&amp;nbsp;– National Curriculum Framework====
The Maurice Ile Durable policy was introduced in 2008 with the objective of making [[Mauritius]] a world model of sustainable development by 2020. Education is one of its five pillars, with a multi-stakeholder working group put in place to integrate ESD into all levels of education. The goal is to reorient the education system towards sustainability, build capacity at all levels and strengthen awareness of key issues. As Mauritius reports, ESD is now ‘part of the National Curriculum Framework and because of the Maurice Ile Durable societal project, ESD is being addressed by many formal and nonformal institutions/organizations’.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Togo&amp;nbsp;– Quality Education for a Sustainable Future====
In [[Togo]], the educational policy framework (Lakalaka) is grounded in national culture and includes a new, ESD-oriented curriculum entitled Quality Education for a Sustainable Future.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Finland&amp;nbsp;– Reforming the national core curricula for pre-school and basic education====
[[Finland]] is reforming the national core curricula for pre-school and basic education to support and promote sustainable development and well-being following the value basis of education, where the necessity of a sustainable way of living and eco-social understanding is emphasized. The aim is to support all students in developing the knowledge, skills, values and attitudes that promote their ability to understand the importance of a sustainable future.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;

====Manitoba, Canada&amp;nbsp;– Profile of successful leadership====
In [[Manitoba]], ESD is a priority action area of the government and has been embedded in the overall purpose of primary and secondary education. It is now government policy ‘to ensure that all Manitoba’s children and youth have access to an array of educational opportunities such that every learner experiences success through relevant, engaging and high quality education that prepares them for [[lifelong learning]] and citizenship in a democratic, socially just and sustainable society’. This statement is included in the mission of the provincial Ministry of Education and Advanced Learning. In response to this policy commitment, ESD has been integrated into the curriculum from kindergarten up to 12th grade with specific learning outcomes identified in science, social studies, health and physical education.

[[File:GapChart-Top14-2013-2014.png|thumb|example of gapChart used for Top14 championship]]
In [[information visualization]] and [[computing]], '''GapChart''' is a [[chart]] for displaying [[time series]] data by using non overlapped thick curves. It was invented in 2013 by Fred. Vernier (LIMSI labs at Univ. Paris Sud) and Charles Perin (LIMSI labs at Univ. Paris Sud and AVIZ-INRIA). Jeremy Boy (AVIZ-INRIA) helped them to improve the original design to its current form.

== Main idea ==
GapChart display one thick curve by time series data. At each time step curves display a flat part and a transition part. Flat parts are separated by gaps proportional to data difference. When two or more time series have same value at the same time step they are distinguished by an external method and represented side by side. Transition steps are represented by straight or S shaped link. They can partially overlap but never totally since star
Labels can fit inside thick curves where i't not too steep and different colors ca be used to better distinguish elements.
----
[[File:ComparizonGapChart.png|comparison of GapChart with RankChart and SlopeGraph]]
* GapChart can be compared to RankChart with additional space between curves to represent value difference behind the ranking
* GapChart can be compared to SlopeGraph where curve thickness is removed from the layout and equal values are distinguished with an external method 
* GapChart can be compared to table of numbers which are commonly available for many rankings

== Visual attributes ==
* Curves can be shaded (top to bottom) to better distinguish multiple elements with the same number of points.
* Space between curves can be decorated with tick lines (i.e. marking every block of 3, 5 or 10 points according to the application domain) to better visually evaluate gaps 
* Labels can be added on curves if thick enough and only where not too steep
* Consistent well chosen colors can help to follow elements of interest
* Top Right and/or Top Left labels can help drawing a full list of elements or initial/final scores
* Inspectors can be used on mouse hover in interactive gapChart to display quantitative ranks and scores (or any relevant information like match in championships)

== Application domains ==
* [[Sport]]: GapChart perfectly apply to all [[Championship]] with points and rankings. Colors can be used to highlight qualified teams or relegated ones. 
* [[Finance]]: GapChart can be used to compare stocks, index or fund yields along time while ranking them when is pertinent 
* [[Economy]]: GapChart is useful to compare a list of countries/states in different indexes (for instance NRI) or companies (i.e. Fortune 500)
* [[Academic]]: GapChart can be used to follow different rankings (i.e. Shanghai ranking, h-indexes, impact factors, ...)

{{Nihongo|'''Giri'''|[[wikt:義理|義理]]}}&lt;ref name=davies /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruth Benedict]], [[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]],1946&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Japanese values|Japanese value]] roughly corresponding to "[[duty]]", "[[obligation]]", or even "burden of obligation" in English. It is defined as "to serve one's superiors with a self-sacrificing devotion" by [[Namiko Abe]]. This value is so integral to Japanese culture that the conflict between ''giri'' and ''[[ninjō]]'', or "human feeling", is said to have been the primary topic of Japanese drama since earlier periods in history.

==In behavior==
Giri may be seen in many different aspects of modern Japanese behavior:

# Japanese gift-giving is marked by an unwritten but no less real perceived balance of "giri", whereupon unusually large gifts must be reciprocated.  "[[Giri choco]]" is a specific term referring to the obligation of close colleagues or associates to provide [[Valentine's Day]] or [[White Day]] chocolates to each other even if they feel no romantic feelings (although Valentine's Day is a Western tradition that wasn't imported to Japan until relatively recently and White Day is a holiday invented in 1978 by the National Confectionery Industry Association in order to sell twice as many confections each year).
# Japanese corporations fire or lay off their employees at one of the lowest rates of any industrialized nation, and employees reciprocate this loyalty through their personal habits.  Whereas in the West engineers from different companies might be friends, this is far more rare in Japan.  Employees' sense of obligation may be so strong that they consume only the beer and other products produced by their conglomerate's affiliates. [[Part time]] workers, however, are not so particular.
# Japanese abroad often complain about the poor service to be found in non-Japanese countries.  While some modern Westerners might prize individuality and the right of a serviceperson to be an assertive social equal with opinions, Japanese generally value carrying out one's work obligations (giri) to the best of one's ability, including what might seem to those from less formal social environments like excessive, mawkish, or even hypocritical or contrived formality and servility.

Some social historians believe the pervasiveness of this concept in Japanese culture is a reflection of the static feudal order that defined Japanese society for centuries.  "Giri books", or village registers that included all the unpaid obligations of one family or individual to another, were a cultural phenomenon that could only exist in a static agricultural culture, as opposed to a migrant or hunter/gatherer tradition.&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{citation |title= The Japanese mind: understanding contemporary Japanese culture |chapter= Giri: japanese social obligations |author= Roger J. Davies, Osamu Ikeno |publisher= [[Tuttle Publishing]] |year= 2002 |isbn= 0-8048-3295-1 |pages= 95–101 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TW7lHYwXhS4C&amp;dq=japan+valentine's+day&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=opera&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* In the film ''[[The Yakuza]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]), the concept of giri is a major factor in the story. The character Tanaka Ken ([[Ken Takakura|Takakura Ken]]) owes Harry Kilmer ([[Robert Mitchum]]) a "debt that can never be repaid" for saving the life of his 'sister' (actually Tanaka Ken's wife) and her young daughter during the post-war occupation of Japan. In the film, he describes giri to a Westerner as "the burden hardest to bear".
* In ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'' [[animated series]] episode "[[The Burden Hardest to Bear]]", the [[Autobot]] [[List of Autobots#Cars|Kup]] uses the concept of giri to describe the burden of leadership facing [[Rodimus Prime]].  Much of the episode is set in Japan, and deals with Rodimus Prime's reluctance to be a leader, only to eventually come to grips with his responsibility.&lt;ref name="Transformers: Generation One"&gt;{{cite episode |series=The Transformers |season=3 |number=91 |title=The Burden Hardest to Bear }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[William Gibson|William Gibson's]] semi-dystopian [[Sprawl trilogy]], Eastern themes, including giri, often play a role. Loyalty to one's company, or in this case international corporate mega-entities, is taken to the extreme to include surgically implanted monitoring devices and employees living almost exclusively within the regimented confines of the company. It is also seen at an individual level, the term mentioned several times in the novel ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]''. Most notable is the exchange between the console cowboy "Tick" and the [[Yakuza]] authority Yanaka.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5700">'''Global Map''' is a set of digital maps that accurately cover the whole globe to express the status of global environment. It is developed through the cooperation of [[National mapping agency|National Geospatial Information Authorities]] (NGIAs) in the world. An initiative to develop Global Map under [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], the Global Mapping Project, was advocated in 1992 by Ministry of Construction, Japan (MOC) at the time (the current [[Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (Japan)|Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, Japan]]-MLIT).

Global Map is digital [[geospatial information]] in 1&amp;nbsp;km [[Optical resolution|resolution]] which satisfies the following conditions:
# Covering the whole land area of the [[globe]]
# In consistent specifications
# Easily accessible by anyone in marginal cost
The global geospatial information developed as Global Map mainly consists of the following thematic layers:
* [[Transportation]] 
* [[Border|Boundary]] 
* [[Drainage]] 
* Population Centers 
* [[Elevation]] 
* [[Vegetation]] （Percent Tree Cover） 
* [[Land Cover]] 
* [[Land Use]]

== History of the Global Mapping Project ==
Since the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in 1972, global environmental challenges have been recognized as an issue which is common to humankind. “The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the [[Earth Summit]])” in Brazil in 1992 adopted “An action plan of humankind for sustainable development: [[Agenda 21]].” Agenda 21 describes in many parts the importance of information for decision-making to appropriately cope with global environmental challenges. Especially geospatial information is regarded to be critical.

In response to the objectives of Agenda 21 and in recognition of the need for further contribution to the development of geospatial information, the MOC at the time (the current MLIT) advocated, in the same year, the Global Mapping Project, an international cooperation initiative to develop global geospatial information to understand the present status and changes of global environment. This concept was presented at the Fifth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for the Americas in New York in 1993. At the same time, resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=United Nations Economic and Social Council
|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
calling for the promotion of the development of global geospatial data was adopted at this conference. Following this conference, a similar resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2012-03-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was adopted at Thirteenth United Nations Regional Cartographic Conference for Asia and the Pacific in Beijing in 1994.
 
In 1996, International Steering Committee for Global Mapping (ISCGM), which consists of heads or its equivalents of NGIAs, was established to promote the Global Mapping Project. Thus the mechanism for the international promotion was formed. The [[Geospatial Information Authority of Japan]] (GSI) has been serving as the secretariat of the ISCGM. In the following year, in 1997, which was five years after the Earth Summit, the nineteenth [[United Nations General Assembly#Special sessions|special session of the United Nations General Assembly]] (19th UNGASS) was held. At the paragraph 112 of the resolution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21

|accessdate=2012-02-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted by the 19th UNGASS, importance of a supportive environment to enhance national capacities and capabilities for information collection and processing, especially in developing countries, to facilitate public access to information on global environmental issues was mentioned along with the description mentioning the significance of international cooperation, including global mapping, as a means to develop the supportive environment.

As a result of such movement, In 1998, a recommendatory letter to participate in the Global Mapping Project was sent from the [[United Nations]] to NGIAs of respective countries in the world.

Further, at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Johannesburg Summit) held in 2002, global mapping was included in the Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In mathematics, especially ([[Higher category theory|higher]]) [[category theory]], '''higher-dimensional algebra''' is the study of [[Categorification|categorified]] structures. It has applications in nonabelian [[algebraic topology]], and generalizes [[abstract algebra]].

==Higher-dimensional categories==

{{main article|Category theory#Higher-dimensional categories}}

A first step towards defining [[higher dimensional]] algebras is the concept of [[2-category]] of [[higher category theory]], followed by the more 'geometric' concept of   [http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~fiore/1/fiorefolding.pdf double category].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A higher level concept is thus defined as a [[Category (mathematics)|category]] of categories, or super-category, which generalises to higher dimensions the notion of [[Category (mathematics)|category]] &amp;ndash; regarded as any structure which is an interpretation of [[Lawvere]]'s axioms of the ''[[elementary theory of abstract categories]]'' (ETAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawvere | first1 = F.

Supercategories were first introduced in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/Supercategories3.html  Supercategory theory @ PlanetMath]&lt;/ref&gt; and were subsequently developed for applications in [[theoretical physics]] (especially [[quantum field theory]] and [[topological quantum field theory]]) and [[mathematical biology]] or [[mathematical biology|mathematical biophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/MathematicalBiologyAndTheoreticalBiophysics.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Other pathways in HDA involve: [[bicategories]], homomorphisms of bicategories, [[variable categories]] (''aka'', indexed, or [[parametrized categories]]), [[topoi]], effective descent, and enriched and [[internal categories]].

==Double groupoids==
{{Main|double groupoid}}
In '''higher-dimensional algebra''' ('''HDA'''), a double groupoid is a generalisation of a one-dimensional [[groupoid]] to two dimensions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=C.B. |last2=Spencer
 |title=Double groupoids and crossed modules
 |journal=Cahiers Top. Géom. Diff.
 |volume=17 |pages=343–362
 |year=1976
 |doi=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter groupoid can be considered as a special case of a category with all invertible arrows, or [[morphism]]s.

[[Double groupoid]]s are often used to capture information about [[geometrical]] objects such as [[n-dimensional space|higher-dimensional manifolds]] (or [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifolds]]).&lt;ref name="bangor"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, an [[List of manifolds|''n''-dimensional manifold]] is a space that locally looks like an [[n-dimensional Euclidean space|''n''-dimensional Euclidean space]], but whose global structure may be [[non-Euclidean]].

Double groupoids were first introduced by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]] in 1976, in ref.&lt;ref name="bangor" /&gt; and were further developed towards applications in [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] [[algebraic topology]].&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/encyclopedia/NAAT.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html ''Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology'' book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |date=2009-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=249 Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Higher homotopy groupoids of filtered spaces]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Nonabelian algebraic topology==
Many of the higher dimensional algebraic structures are [[noncommutative]] and, therefore, their study is a very significant part of nonabelian [[category theory]], and also of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT)&lt;ref name="bangor_a"&gt;*{{cite book |first=R. |last=Brown |first2=P.J. |last2=Higgins |first3=R. |last3=Sivera |title=Non-Abelian Algebraic Topology |url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |publisher= |volume=1 |year=2008 |isbn= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604050453/http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-a-t.html |archivedate=2009-06-04 |df= }} ([http://www.bangor.ac.uk/~mas010/nonab-t/partI010604.pdf Downloadable PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ems-ph.org/pdf/catalog.pdf Ronald Brown, Philip Higgins, Rafael Sivera, ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered spaces, crossed complexes, cubical homotopy groupoids'', in '''Tracts in Mathematics''' vol. '''15''' (2010), European Mathematical Society, 670 pages, {{ISBN|978-3-03719-083-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the [[fundamental group]].&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407275 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' by Ronald Brown. 15 Jul 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Such algebraic structures in dimensions greater than 1 develop the nonabelian character of the fundamental group, and they are in a precise sense ''‘more nonabelian than the groups' ''.&lt;ref name="bangor_a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/06/nonabelian_algebraic_topology.html ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology'' posted by John Baez&lt;/ref&gt; These noncommutative, or more specifically, [[Non-abelian group|nonabelian]] structures reflect more accurately the geometrical complications of higher dimensions than the known homology and [[homotopy groups]] commonly encountered in classical [[algebraic topology]].
An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of [[homotopy group]]oids and [[filtered space]]s. Noncommutative [[double groupoid]]s and double [[Lie algebroid|algebroid]]s are only the first examples of such higher dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) ''``can be applied to determine [[homotopy invariant]]s of spaces, and [[homotopy classification]] of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods"''.&lt;ref&gt;http://planetphysics.org/?op=getobj&amp;from=books&amp;id=374 ''Nonabelian Algebraic Topology: Filtered Spaces, Crossed Complexes and Cubical Homotopy groupoids'', by Ronald Brown, Bangor University, UK, Philip J. Higgins, Durham University, UK Rafael Sivera, University of Valencia, Spain&lt;/ref&gt; Cubical omega-groupoids, higher [[homotopy group]]oids, [[crossed module]]s, [[Timeline of category theory and related mathematics|crossed complexes]] and [[Galois group]]oids are key concepts in developing applications related to homotopy of filtered spaces, higher dimensional space structures, the construction of the [[fundamental group]]oid of a topos E in the general theory of topoi, and also in their physical applications in nonabelian quantum theories, and recent developments in [[quantum gravity]], as well as categorical and [[topological dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/92r13230n3381746/ | doi=10.1007/s10516-007-9012-1 | volume=17 | title=A Non-Abelian, Categorical Ontology of Spacetimes and Quantum Gravity | year=2007 | journal=Axiomathes | pages=353–408 | last1 = Baianu | first1 = I. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of [[noncommutative geometry]] formalizations of the [[noncommutative standard model]]s ''via'' fundamental double groupoids and [[spacetime]] structures even more general than [[topos|topoi]] or the lower-dimensional [[noncommutative spacetime]]s encountered in several [[topological quantum field theories]] and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity.

A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy [[van Kampen theorem]] proven by R. Brown which states that ``''the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable [[colimit]] or [[homotopy colimit]] over homotopy types of its pieces''''. A related example is that of van Kampen theorems for categories of [[covering morphism]]s in [[lextensive categories]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Brown and George Janelidze, van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, ''J. Pure Appl. Algebra''. '''119''':255–263, (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports of generalisations of the van Kampen theorem include statements for [[2-category|2-categories]]&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050720094804/http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz [[Marta Bunge]] and Stephen Lack. Van Kampen theorems for 2-categories and toposes&lt;/ref&gt; and a topos of topoi [http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz].
Important results in HDA are also the extensions of the [[Galois theory]] in categories and [[variable categories]], or indexed/`parametrized' categories.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/gug14u1141214743/ | doi=10.1007/BF00872989 | volume=1 | title=Galois theory in variable categories | year=1993 | journal=Applied Categorical Structures | pages=103–110 | last1 = Janelidze | first1 = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt; The [[Joyal–Tierney representation theorem]] for topoi is also a generalisation of the Galois theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Joyal | first1 = Andres | last2 = Tierney | first2 = Myles | year = 1984| title = An extension of the Galois theory of Grothendieck | url = | isbn=0-8218-2312-4 |publisher=American Mathematical Society | volume = 309 | issue = | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, indexing by bicategories in the sense of Benabou one also includes here the [[Joyal–Tierney theory]].&lt;ref&gt;'''MSC'''(1991): 18D30,11R32,18D35,18D05&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Theoretical physics===
In [[quantum field theory]], there exist [[quantum category|quantum categories]].&lt;ref name="planetmath"&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/QuantumCategory.html Quantum Categories of Quantum Groupoids&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/AssociativityIsomorphism.html Rigid Monoidal Categories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quantum double groupoid]]s.&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress"&gt;http://theoreticalatlas.wordpress.com/2009/03/18/a-note-on-quantum-groupoids/ March 18, 2009. A Note on Quantum Groupoids, posted by Jeffrey Morton under C*-algebras, deformation theory, groupoids, noncommutative geometry, quantization&lt;/ref&gt;/ One can consider [[quantum double groupoids]] to be [[fundamental group]]oids defined via a [[2-functor]], which allows one to think about the physically interesting case of [[quantum fundamental groupoid]]s (QFGs) in terms of the [[bicategory]] '''Span(Groupoids)''', and then constructing 2-[[Hilbert space]]s and 2-[[linear map]]s for manifolds and [[cobordism]]s. At the next step, one obtains [[cobordism]]s with corners via [[natural transformation]]s of such 2-functors. A claim was then made that, with the [[gauge group]] [[SU(2)]], "''the extended [[TQFT]], or ETQFT,  gives a theory equivalent to the [[Ponzano–Regge model]] of [[quantum gravity]]''";&lt;ref name="theoreticalatlas.wordpress" /&gt; similarly, the [[Turaev–Viro model]] would be then obtained with [[representation (mathematics)|representation]]s of SU&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(2). Therefore, one can describe the [[state space]] of a gauge theory – or many kinds of [[quantum field theories]] (QFTs) and local quantum physics, in terms of the [[transformation groupoid]]s given by symmetries, as for example in the case of a gauge theory, by the [[gauge transformation]]s acting on states that are, in this case, connections. In the case of symmetries related to [[quantum group]]s, one would obtain structures that are representation categories of [[quantum groupoid]]s,&lt;ref name="planetmath" /&gt; instead of the 2-[[vector space]]s that are representation categories of groupoids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15841">The '''Huzita–Hatori axioms''' or '''Huzita–Justin axioms''' are a set of rules related to the [[Mathematics of paper folding|mathematical principles of paper folding]], describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The axioms assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.

The axioms were first discovered by Jacques Justin in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Justin|first=Jacques|date=1986|title=Résolution par le pliage de l’équation du troisième degré et applications géométriques|url=https://mathinfo.unistra.fr/fileadmin/upload/IREM/Publications/L_Ouvert/n042/o_42_9-19.pdf|journal=L’Ouvert - Journal de l’APMEP d’Alsace et de l’IREM de Strasbourg|language=French|volume=42|issue=|pages=9–19|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axioms 1 through 6 were rediscovered by [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Italy|Italian]] mathematician [[Humiaki Huzita]] and reported at ''the First International Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy'' in 1991. Axioms 1 though 5 were rediscovered by Auckly and Cleveland in 1995. Axiom 7 was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2001; [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7.

==The seven axioms==
The first 6 axioms are known as Huzita's axioms. Axiom 7 was discovered by Koshiro Hatori. Jacques Justin and [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7. The axioms are as follows:

# Given two distinct points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.
# Given two distinct points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Axiom 5 may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, while Axiom 6 may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 solutions. In this way, the resulting geometries of origami are stronger than the geometries of [[compass and straightedge]], where the maximum number of solutions an axiom has is 2. Thus compass and straightedge geometry solves second-degree equations, while origami geometry, or origametry, can solve third-degree equations, and solve problems such as [[angle trisection]] and [[doubling of the cube]]. The construction of the fold guaranteed by Axiom 6 requires "sliding" the paper, or [[neusis]], which is not allowed in classical compass and straightedge constructions. Use of neusis together with a compass and straightedge does allow trisection of an arbitrary angle.

==Details==

===Axiom 1===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 1.png|Folding a line through two points]]

In parametric form, the equation for the line that passes through the two points is :

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_1 +s(p_2 - p_1).&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 2===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 2.png|Folding a line putting one point on another]]

This is equivalent to finding the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be done in four steps:

* Use '''Axiom 1''' to find the line through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;P(s)=p_1+s(p_2-p_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* Find the [[midpoint]] of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;mid&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P''(''s'')
* Find the vector '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;perp&lt;/sup&gt; perpendicular to ''P''(''s'')
* The [[parametric equation]] of the fold is then:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_\mathrm{mid} + s\cdot\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{perp}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 3===
Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 3.png|Folding a line putting one line on another]]

This is equivalent to finding a bisector of the angle between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, let '''u''' and '''v''' be the unit direction vectors of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively; that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (p_2-p_1) / \left|(p_2-p_1)\right|&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (q_2-q_1) / \left|(q_2-q_1)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

If the two lines are not parallel, their point of intersection is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{int} = p_1+s_\mathrm{int}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_{int} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot (p_1 - q_1)} {\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot \mathbf{u}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of one of the bisectors is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} = \frac{
\left|\mathbf{u}\right| \mathbf{v} +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right| \mathbf{u}}
{\left|\mathbf{u}\right| +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

And the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_\mathrm{int} + s\cdot\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt;

A second bisector also exists, perpendicular to the first and passing through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;. Folding along this second bisector will also achieve the desired result of placing ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It may not be possible to perform one or the other of these folds, depending on the location of the intersection point.

If the two lines are parallel, they have no point of intersection. The fold must be the line midway between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and parallel to them.

===Axiom 4===
Given a point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 4.png|Folding through a point perpendicular to a line]]

This is equivalent to finding a perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If we find some vector '''v''' that is perpendicular to the line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_1 + s\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 5===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 5.png|Folding a point onto a line through another point]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding the intersection of a line with a circle, so it may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. The line is defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the circle has its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius equal to the distance from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the line does not intersect the circle, there are no solutions. If the line is tangent to the circle, there is one solution, and if the line intersects the circle in two places, there are two solutions.

If we know two points on the line, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the line can be expressed parametrically as:

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_1 + s(x_2 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

Let the circle be defined by its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(''x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), with radius &lt;math&gt;r = \left|p_1 - p_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. Then the circle can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to determine the points of intersection of the line with the circle, we substitute the ''x'' and ''y'' components of the equations for the line into the equation for the circle, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + s(x_2-x_1) - x_c)^2 + (y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1) - y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;as^2 + bs + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;a = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = 2(x_2 - x_1)(x_1 - x_c) + 2(y_2 - y_1)(y_1 - y_c)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2 - 2(x_c x_1 + y_c y_1)-r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we simply solve the quadratic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the discriminant ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''ac'' &amp;lt; 0, there are no solutions. The circle does not intersect or touch the line. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then there is a single solution, where the line is tangent to the circle. And if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two solutions, representing the two points of intersection. Let us call the solutions ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if they exist. We have 0, 1, or 2 line segments:

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 = \overline{p_1 d_1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_2 = \overline{p_1 d_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

A fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, a fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of Axiom 2 easily accomplishes this. The parametric equations of the folds are thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_1(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_1-p_1)+s(d_1-p_1)^\perp \\[8pt]
F_2(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_2-p_1)+s(d_2-p_1)^\perp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 6===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 6.png]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two parabolas, and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two parabolas have foci at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, with directrices defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

This fold is called the Beloch fold after [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch | Margharita P. Beloch]], who in 1936 showed using it that origami can be used to solve general cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solving Cubics With Creases: The Work of Beloch and Lill |author=Thomas C. Hull |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/papers/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307-hull.pdf |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=April 2011 |pages=307–315|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiom 7===
Given one point ''p'' and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p'' onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita-Hatori axiom 7.png]]

This axiom was originally discovered by Jacques Justin in 1989 but was overlooked and was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=One-, Two-, and Multi-Fold Origami Axioms |url=http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~alperin/AlperinLang.pdf |author1=Roger C. Alperin |author2=Robert J. Lang |journal=4OSME |publisher=A K Peters |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert J. Lang]] has proven that this list of axioms completes the axioms of origami.

==Constructibility==
Subsets of the axioms  can be used to construct different sets of numbers. The first three can be used with three given points not on a line to do what Alperin calls Thalian constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Mathematical Theory of Origami Constructions and Numbers |first1=Roger C |last1=Alperin |journal=New York Journal of Mathematics |year=2000 |volume=6 |pages=119–133 |url=http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four axioms with two given points define a system weaker than [[compass and straightedge constructions]]: every shape that can be folded with those axioms can be constructed with compass and straightedge, but some things can be constructed by compass and straightedge that cannot be folded with those axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=D. Auckly and J. Cleveland|title=Totally real origami and impossible paperfolding|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=102|pages=215–226|arxiv=math/0407174|doi=10.2307/2975008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers that can be constructed are called the origami or pythagorean numbers, if the distance between the two given points is 1 then the constructible points are all of the form &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are Pythagorean numbers. The Pythagorean numbers are given by the smallest field containing the rational numbers and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is such a number.

Adding the fifth axiom gives the [[Euclidean number]]s, that is the points constructible by [[Compass-and-straightedge_construction|compass and straightedge construction]].

Adding the [[Neusis construction|neusis]] axiom 6, all compass-straightedge constructions, and more, can be made.  In particular, the [[Constructible polygon|constructible]] regular polygons with these axioms are those with &lt;math&gt;2^a3^b\rho\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Pierpont prime]]s.  Compass-straightedge constructions allow only those with  &lt;math&gt;2^a\phi\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s.  (Fermat primes are a [[subset]] of Pierpont primes.)

The seventh axiom does not allow construction of further axioms. The seven axioms give all the single-fold constructions that can be done rather than being a minimal set of axioms.

== An eighth axiom ==
The existence of an eighth axiom was claimed by Lucero in 2017, which may be stated as: there is a fold along a given line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucero|first=Jorge C.|date=2017|title=On the Elementary Single-Fold Operations of Origami: Reflections and Incidence Constraints on the Plane|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2017volume17/FG201725.pdf|journal=Forum Geometricorum|volume=17|pages=207-221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new axiom was found after enumerating all possible incidences between constructible points and lines on a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/lee_hwa-young_201712_ma.pdf|title=Origami-Constructible Numbers|last=Lee|first=Hwa Y.|publisher=University of Georgia|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=64|type=Master's Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it does not create a new line, it is nevertheless needed in actual paper folding when it is required to fold a layer of paper along a line marked on the layer immediately below.

'''Infant clothing''' or '''baby clothing''' is [[clothing]] for [[infant]]s. '''Baby fashion''' is a social-cultural consumerist practice that encodes in children's fashion the representation of many social features and depicts a system characterized by differences in social class, richness, gender or ethnicity.

==Size==
Infant and toddler clothing size is typically based on age.{{sfn|Consumer Reports}} These are usually ''preemie'' for a [[preterm birth]] baby, 0 to 3 months, 3 to 6 months, 6 to 9 months, 9 to 12 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 24 months, though there is no industry standard definition for those sizes.{{sfn|Consumer Reports}} Most retailers provide sizing charts based on a child's [[weight]], [[height]], or both, and the child's [[weight and height percentile]] may also be used for properly sizing clothing for the infant.{{sfn|Consumer Reports}}

In an article in the October 1945 issue of ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]'', [[B. F. Skinner]] stated that clothing and bedding "interfere with normal exercise and growth and keep the baby from taking comfortable postures or changing posture during sleep".{{sfn|Skinner|1945}} An infant may [[Stretching|stretch]], necessitating clothing that is sufficiently loose to allow movement.{{sfn|Beegum|2005|p=18}}

==Fashion==
[[File:Marie Antoinette and her Children by Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|right|Marie Antoinette and her Children by Élisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]]
[[File:Franklin-Roosevelt-1884.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1884, illustrating typical gender-neutral baby clothing at the time.]]
In the past centuries Baby Fashion assumed distinctive features between [[social classes]]. Dresses had a powerful potential in displaying social distinction. In general Baby Fashion was exploited by the high classes, or the so-called elite, to traduce symbols of power, wealth, richness. Children's appearance was useful to represent the family's position in the society. While, on the other side, the [[working classes]] were not involved in this kind of practice, since clothes should have been practical and not expensive. It must be remembered that in the feudal society, as in the [[industrial society]], children worked as well as adults. 
The symbolic value of Baby Fashion between high classes and the nobility was not only a western peculiarity. For example, in some African or oriental countries colors and shapes took a particular importance, while Western elites concentrated on fabrics and precious materials. But probably Western European Fashion put a stronger stress on the representation of social position through clothing; in fact, this practice became customary already in the late 13th century. Family paintings and portraits were very common between the European high classes, so today we have plenty of examples of ancient Baby Fashion features. A particular characteristic of ancient Baby Fashion is the absence of marked gender distinctions between young children. After a certain age, girls were painted in big gowns, and boys in trousers, or commonly military uniforms. But before they reached ten years of age, usually, children were represented wearing gowns, no matter if they are boys or girls. The symbols of wealth and power are translated by these rich dresses, with huge gowns full of trims, ornaments, and embroidered details. This kind of style developed in the Spanish Court in the 14th century and became common also in other Catholic Countries as Italy or France. This rich style makes very difficult, almost for a modern observer, to recognize boys from girls. Many examples come from 17th and 18th century European Court, where family paintings where very important expressions of power. In France Elizabeth Vigée-Lebrun's paintings represented young [[Marie Antoinette|Mary Antoinette]]'s children, and the younger Queen's son is dressed in a white, soft, traditional gown and coif.

In the United States, before the 1890s children predominantly wore clothing made by their parents.{{sfn|Leach|1994|p=85}} By 1910, retailers had formed a "[[Advertising to children|publicity structure]]" toward children for the sale of children's [[Good (economics)|goods]], which resulted in a significant increase in the sale of manufactured children's clothing, sportswear, candy, and baby clothing.{{sfn|Leach|1994|p=85}} By 1915, baby clothing had become one of the nation's largest industries.{{sfn|Leach|1994|p=85}}

In the 1980s, infant and toddler clothing [[fashion design]] became an increasing source of revenue for US [[designer label]]s and fashion design houses, such as [[Polo Ralph Lauren]] and [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]].{{sfn|Peterson|Kellogg|2008|p=360}} [[Gap Inc.]] established ''Baby Gap'' in 1990, four years after it had introduced the ''Gap Kids'' line.{{sfn|Condra|2008|p=225}}

The age of first-time mothers has been increasing in [[Western culture]]s, from 21.5 years old in 1970 to over 25 years old in the early 2000s, and hence they have more [[Disposable and discretionary income|disposable income]] to spend for infant goods, including clothing.{{sfn|Danziger|2004}}

Infant clothing is within the retail and wholesale trade categories of the [[North American Industry Classification System]] (NAICS). For the 2012 revision, wholesale infant clothing is in category 424330 (Women's, Children's, and Infants' Clothing and Accessories Merchant Wholesalers){{sfn|United States Census Bureau: NAICS 424330}} and retail infant clothing is in category 448130 (Children's and Infants' Clothing Stores).{{sfn|United States Census Bureau: NAICS 448130}}

===Role models===
The imitating model has changed over years. In the past nobility owned what was perceived as an ideal style paradigm. While nowadays, the upper-middle class embodies the ideal fashion; especially, in today's [[popular culture|pop culture]], this role is covered by celebrities and the so-called V.I.P.

==Gender conventions==
&lt;!-- [[Baptismal clothing|Christening gown]] --&gt;
Clothes have long been used to hide sexual differences in its strong biological sense and, at the same time, to point up and signal it through assumptions concerning gender in clothing codes. The manner in which an infant is dressed "affects behavior toward the infant".{{sfn|Shakin|Shakin|Hall Sternglanz|1985}} Clothing may be sex-typed by colour (e.g. - pink or yellow for girls, blue or red for boys), or by style (ruffles and puffed sleeves for girls).{{sfn|Shakin|Shakin|Hall Sternglanz|1985}} If children's clothes, in the past, were used to differentiate those belonging to rich families from those coming from poor ones, today clothes are a symbol of gender differentiation.

A 1985 study found that US parents were not "bothered by strangers' mistaking the infant's sex".{{sfn|Shakin|Shakin|Hall Sternglanz|1985}}

== Gender differentiation ==
[[Gender]] is a way in which social practices are ordered. In gender differentiation process, the everyday conduct of life is organized in relation to biological differences, defined by the bodily structures and processes of human reproduction. Bodies are therefore both agents and objects of practice. Such body-reflexive practices that define the [[social structure]] are not internal to the individual, but they involve [[social relations]] and shared symbolism.
They may well involve large-scale social institutions. Within this body structured practices, particular versions of [[femininity]] and [[masculinity]] are materialized as meaningful bodies and embodied meanings. Through body-reflexive practices and through the biological division of human bodies into male and female, more than individual lives are formed: a social world is formed, modelled on the basis of gender stereotypes.
&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn. Quality of human resources: gender and indigenous – Quality Gender, men and masculinities.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stereotypes ===
By [[gender stereotypes]] we mean a representation, imagery or classification of men, women, or gender relations, that presents a simplified, conventionalized and selective picture of men's and women's lives. This representation is pretty often spread up also by the exposure to TV contents, which has been associated with more stereotypical sexual attitudes (i.e., the view that men are stereotypically sex-driven, the notion according to which women are sexual objects to be valued for their looks).&lt;ref&gt;Bogt &amp; Rutger C. M. E. Engels &amp; Sanne Bogers &amp;Kloosterman. Shake It Baby, Shake It: Media Preferences, Sexual Attitudes and Gender Stereotypes Among Adolescents. Sex Roles; 63; pp.844–859; 2010;&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore, stereotypes frequently become vehicles for norms of inequality. For instance, a persistent devaluing of women can have the effect of celebrating masculine bodily power, or of believing that women and men should be confined to narrow and segregated social roles.
In Baby Fashion, gender-differentiated consumption can go from toys to particular dressing accessories or objects of everyday life. This particular structured system becomes an important tool to maintain intact these constructed gender social identities.
Despite the different gender studies that has been done during the last years, it seems that [[Gender studies#History of gender studies|sex role theory]], which is an old approach based on the power of custom and social conformity, seems to be correct about some still existing social constructions. Sex role theory explains gender patterns by appealing to the social customs that define proper behaviour for women and for men. People learn their roles, in the course of growing up, and then perform them under social pressures.
According to this theory, children, since their first years of life, are distinguished into girls and boys. They are dressed with the respective gender identifiable colours, the typical pink and blue. The blue dressed children are supposed to behave differently than the ones dressed in pink: they should be ruder, aggressive, demanding and more powerful. On the contrary, the pink dressed children are supposed to behave in a passive way, to be obedient and even prettier. When the girls grew up they are dressed with cute dresses, they are given toys like dolls and make up accessories, and they are educated to always take care of their physical aspect, to be able to cook and to always be educate and gentle with others. On the other hand, when boys grew up they are taught how to drive cars, how to be competitive in the market in order to earn money and how to chase all those persons who were dressed in pink colours.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, Raewyn. Questioni di genere. Il Mulino; 2009; pp. 167–168&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consumerism ==
Speaking about baby fashion, it is important to stress the [[consumerism]] that is behind all of this. Buying infant clothing is becoming more and more a phenomenon of fashion so that, since they are mainly bought by parents, sometimes the purchasing action is brought to an upper level through the [[objectification]] of the child. In fact, it can happen that they are adopted as a means to demonstrate the capability of their family to follow most recent fashions. When clothes are used in a way that differs from the norm, this can attract attention and provoke reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Klepp; Storm-Mathisen. Reading Fashion as Age: Teenage Girls' and Grown Women's Accounts of  Clothing as Body and Social Status. Fashion Theory, The Journal of Dress, Body and Culture;&lt;/ref&gt; This affirmation is supported by the many practices that define today’s society and that highlight a current phenomenon: the [[sexualization]] of the child.

=== Sexualisation ===
The acceptable sexual connotations expressed by clothing depends on both the era and the age of the person wearing the clothes.&lt;ref&gt;Klepp; Storm-Mathisen. Reading Fashion as Age: Teenage Girls' and Grown Women's Accounts of  Clothing as Body and Social Status. Fashion Theory, The Journal of Dress, Body and Culture;&lt;/ref&gt;
However, clothes continuously witness a phenomenon of sexualisation, resulting from a background that affects adults as well as children. Indeed, the body is more visible today than it was in the 1800s and in the first half of the 1900s.
Clothes themselves are innocent, it is the way in which they are displayed that sexualizes them: this happens mostly because of the influence of various media (television, internet, music, [[social networks]], advertising etc.), and the way in which children's clothes are disposed alongside the ones of adults. The automatic consequence is the association between the two types of clothes, summed-up in the common practice, carried out by manufacturers and retailers, of scaling-down adult version of fashion into a child one.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Reg. Letting children be children. Report of an Independent Review of the Commercialisation and Sexualisation of Childhood. Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Education by Command of Her Majesty, June 2011;&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, instead of age-appropriate clothes, children wear those that in principle have been designed for grown-up people. This happens especially with young girls who, nowadays, can be easily seen wearing short skirts, high heels, very deep necklines, bikinis or padded bras, all available in fabrics and prints that most of the people would consider inadequate for them. In fact, fashion is seen as imposing oppressive forms of gender identity, embodying practices designed to objectify and limit little girls.
At the same time, it will be difficult to ignore the limitations given to boys too. They are pressured by expectations about proper masculine behaviour from parents, school, mass media and peer groups. Masculine behaviour's role models are provided by sportsmen, military heroes, etc. and the social sanctions, from mild disapproval to violence, are applied to boys and men who do not conform to the role norms. 
This phenomenon is exasperated by the untimely [[sexual development]] of children that has been registered in recent years. As a matter of fact, it has been demonstrated that contemporary kids tend to reach a [[sexual maturity]] at an early age, accelerating therefore the mental, physical and emotional evolution and catching the possibility to wear daring dresses.

==Dangers==
{{See also|Infant mortality}}
Excessive [[thermal insulation]] has been associated with an increased incidence of [[sudden infant death syndrome]] (SIDS). The primary causes are an excess of bedding or clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and [[stuffed animal]]s.{{sfn|Fleming|Levine|Azaz|Wigfield|1993}} The [[odds ratio]] of SIDS associated with thermal insulation at least two [[Tog (unit)|togs]] above the lower critical value (after adjusting for season and [[confounding]] factors) was 1.35 in a [[New Zealand]] study, which also found that SIDS had some correlation with too little thermal insulation.{{sfn|Williams|Taylor|Mitchell|1996}} A 1984 study of 34 infant cot deaths found that for 2/3 excessive clothing and over-wrapping was a contributing cause.{{sfn|Stanton|1984}}

Clothing was responsible for an increased incidence of [[Hip dysplasia (human)#Congenital|congenital hip dislocation]] (CDH) in Japanese infants. By custom, a [[diaper]] and clothing had been applied to the infants "with the legs in extension".{{sfn|Ishida|1977}} Before 1965, the incidence of CDH in infants was up to 3.5%, but a national campaign established in 1975 "to avoid prolonged extension of the hips and knees of infants during the early postnatal period" led to a reduction in incidence of CDH in infants to 0.2% by the early 1980s.{{sfn|Yamamuro|Ishida|1984}}

===Fire hazard===
Close-fitting nightwear is "invariably safer than long, loose nightwear".{{sfn|Gordon|Pressley|1978}}&lt;!-- also states fire standards should not be based on textile alone --&gt;

[[Canada]] prohibits the importation, sale, or advertising of classes of clothing and other consumer products that do not meet the minimum flammability standards.{{sfn|Health Canada}} Standards for infant and children's sleepwear were defined in 1971 and amended in 1987 as part of the [[Canada Consumer Product Safety Act|Hazardous Products Act]].{{sfn|Health Canada}} Any textile product must also satisfy textile labelling requirements specified in the [[Textile Labelling Act]] administered by the [[Competition Bureau]] of [[Industry Canada]].{{sfn|Health Canada}}

In the United States, textile flammability is subject to the [[U.S. Flammable Fabrics Act]]. A study found that children less than five years old had a higher incidence of sleepwear fires than other age groups, and that they had an "unreasonable risk of death or injury from fire accidents involving sleepwear".{{sfn|Sita|1977}} This led to the first flammability standard for infant and children's sleepwear.{{sfn|Sita|1977}} On 30 April 1996, the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]] relaxed standards for children's sleepwear flammability, allowing retailers to sell "tight-fitting children's sleepwear and sleepwear for infants aged 9 months or younger" that does not meet the flammability criteria.{{sfn|Cusick|Grant|Kucan|1997}}

===Hygiene and health===
Infants may have [[Allergy|allergic]] reactions to certain materials, especially [[synthetic fibre]]s such as [[polyester]], [[rayon]], and [[nylon]], and [[natural fibre]]s such as [[wool]].{{sfn|Beegum|2005|p=19}}

[[apnea]]
[[contact dermatitis]]
also:{{sfn|Beegum|2005|p=19}}
wash infant clothing separately
wearing wet clothing = "harmful to the skin of the baby"
clean water and sunlight = antiseptic for baby clothes
rinse out all detergents

The '''International Center on Nonviolent Conflict''' is an independent, nonprofit educational foundation, founded by [[Jack DuVall]] and [[Peter Ackerman]]&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002. It promotes the study and utilization of nonmilitary strategies by civilian-based movements to establish and defend [[human rights]], [[social justice]] and democracy.

==Aims==
Based in Washington, DC, ICNC works with educational institutions and [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] in the United States and around the world to educate the global public and to influence policies and media coverage of the growing phenomenon of strategic nonviolent action.

==History==
The ICNC was founded by [[Peter Ackerman]] and [[Jack DuVall]] in 2002. Jack DuVall serves as ICNC’s president and Founding Director, while Peter Ackerman serves as ICNC's Founding Chair.&lt;ref&gt;"Peter Ackerman - Founding Chair". International Center on Nonviolent Conflict. 2009. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; A writer, former military intelligence officer, and former [[public television]] executive, Jack DuVall was the executive producer of a television series, "A Force More Powerful", on the television station [[PBS]] and is co-author of the companion book of the same name (Palgrave/St. Martin’s Press 2001), both of which explore major 20th century nonviolent action campaigns. Peter Ackerman, a venture capitalist who was a highly-paid associate of Michael Milken at Drexel Burham Lambert in the 1980s specializing in leveraged buyouts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1992-06-07/the-drexel-debacles-teflon-guy |title=The Drexel Debacle's Teflon Guy |last1=Bianco |first1=Anthony |publisher=Bloomberg |date=1992-06-08 |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; received his PhD. from Tufts University’s Fletcher School for Law and Diplomacy, and  has written a series of scholarly books on strategic nonviolent action, has served on the board of Freedom House (including as chair between 2005-2009&lt;ref&gt;"Dr. Peter Ackerman Becomes New Chairman of Freedom House".

Freedom House. 2009-01-08. Archived from the original on 2010-10-12. Retrieved 2010-10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;) and is a member of Council on Foreign Relations.[1] In raising public awareness of the history and ideas of nonviolent conflict in both democratic and autocratic societies, ICNC has disseminated books, articles, broadcast media, video programming, computer games and other learning materials. Staff members and associated scholars have led seminars in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle East for journalists, activists, educators and NGO leaders on the history and dynamics of strategic nonviolent action.

ICNC involvement in seminars and workshops involving activists in human rights, pro-democracy and social justice campaigns overseas have led to charges from some governments of foreign intervention, though ICNC policy prohibits its presenters from giving specific advice regarding any particular struggle. Such workshops, according to ICNC policy, come only in response to specific requests from activist groups themselves and are not initiated by ICNC. ICNC also maintains a strictly apolitical posture, in that it works with groups challenging autocratic governments regardless of a given regime's ideological orientation or relations with the United States.

However, ICNC allegedly maintains connections with the "US-based 'democracy promoting' establishment groups of USAID and Reagan's National Endowment for Democracy as well as links to the CIA."&lt;ref&gt;Marty Branagan (2013). Global Warming, Militarism and Nonviolence: The Art of Active Resistance, pp. 167-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICNC has cooperated with other independent non-profit groups concerned with strategic nonviolent action, including the [[Albert Einstein Institution]], Nonviolence International, and the Serbian-based Center for Applied Nonviolent Action and Strategies (CANVAS). ICNC is funded exclusively through a private family endowment and maintains a strict policy of not accepting funding from nor collaborating with any government or government-funded entities.

===Alleged ICNC intervention in Venezuelan politics===
ICNC has been criticized for involvement in US-backed regime change operations.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Gowans (2010).

==Response to Criticisms==
In response to criticisms made by Michael Barker, Stephen Zunes, who acts as the chair of the ICNC's advisory board wrote that the...

:"...ICNC does not 'work closely' with the Albert Einstein Institution, does not 'provide its theoretical underpinnings' and has never had a single operational meeting with anyone representing them. The primary connection between the two independent non-profit institutes has been ICNC's support for foreign-language translations of their literature, which have been used by nonviolent activists struggling for freedom and justice in dozens of countries." &lt;ref&gt;Stephen Zunes, [http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/38238 Inaccurate and unfair attacks on the ICNC], ''Green Left Weekly'', August 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19223">'''Internet metaphors''' provide users and researchers of the [[Internet]] a structure for understanding and communicating its various functions, uses, and experiences.  An advantage of employing [[metaphor]]s is that they permit individuals to visualize an abstract concept or phenomenon with which they have limited experience by comparing it with a concrete, well-understood concept such as physical movement through space. Metaphors to describe the Internet have been utilized since its creation and developed out of the need for the Internet to be understood by everyone when the goals and parameters of the Internet were still unclear.  Metaphors helped to overcome the problems of the invisibility and intangibility of the Internet's infrastructure and to fill linguistic gaps where no literal expressions existed.

"Highways, webs, clouds, matrices, frontiers, railroads, tidal waves, libraries, shopping malls, and village squares are all examples of metaphors that have been used in discussions of the Internet."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Over time these metaphors have become embedded in cultural communications, subconsciously shaping the [[cognitive frame]]works and perceptions of users who guide the Internet's future development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Popular metaphors may also reflect the intentions of Internet designers or the views of government officials.  Internet researchers tend to all agree that popular metaphors should be re-examined often to determine if they accurately reflect the realities of the Internet, but many disagree on which metaphors are worth keeping and which ones should be left behind.

==Overview==
[[File:Interstate 15.jpg|thumb|An earlier metaphor of the Internet was the [[information superhighway]].]]
'''Internet metaphors''' guide future action and perception of the Internet's capabilities on an individual and societal level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.metaphorik.de/sites/www.metaphorik.de/files/journal-pdf/18_2010_jamet.pdf|title = What Do Internet Metaphors Reveal about Perception of the Internet?|last = Jamet|first = Denis L.|date = 2010|journal = Metaphorik|accessdate = June 23, 2014|doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet metaphors are contestable and sometimes may present political, educational, and cognitive issues.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Johnston, R. (2009). [http://firstmonday.org/article/view/2370/2158 Salvation or destruction: Metaphors of the Internet.] ''First Monday, 14''(4). Retrieved June 20, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tensions between producer and user, commercial and non-commercial interests, and uncertainty regarding privacy all influence the shape these metaphors take.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Common Internet metaphors such as the [[information superhighway]] are often criticized for failing to adequately reflect the reality of the Internet as they emphasize the speed of [[information transmission]] over the communal and relationship building aspects of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Markham, A. N. (2003, October). [http://pure.au.dk//portal/files/69632404/MarkhamTPW.pdf Metaphors reflecting and shaping the reality of the internet: Tool, place, way of being.] In ''Association of Internet Researchers conference, Montreal, Canada''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Internet researchers from a variety of disciplines are engaged in the analysis of metaphors across many domains in order to reveal their impact on user perception and determine which metaphors are best suited for conceptualizing the Internet.  Results of this research have become the focus of a popular debate on ''which'' metaphors should be applied in political, educational, and commercial settings as well as which aspects of the Internet remain unaccounted for with current metaphors, limiting the scope of users understanding.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Metaphors of the Internet often reveal the intentions of designers and industry spokespeople, "For instance, those who use metaphors of consumption and shopping malls will devote resources to developing secure exchange mechanisms. Broadcasting metaphors carry with them assumptions about the nature of interactions between audiences and content providers that are more passive than those suggested by interactive game metaphors and applications.  [[Computer security]] experts deploy metaphors that invoke fear, anxiety, and apocalyptic threat" (Wyatt, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;244).&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Wyatt, S. (2004). [http://virtualknowledgestudio.nl/documents/danger-metaphors.pdf Danger! Metaphors at work in economics, geophysiology, and the Internet.] ''Science, Technology &amp; Human Values'', ''29''(2), 242-261.&lt;/ref&gt;  The extent to which the Internet is understood across individuals and groups determines their ability to navigate and build [[Web sites]] and [[social networks]], attend online school, send e-mail, and a variety of other functions.  Internet metaphors provide a comprehensive picture of the Internet as a whole as well as describe and explain the various tools, purposes, and protocols that regulate the use of these communication technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Rudestam, K. E., &amp; Schoenholtz-Read, J. (2010). ''Handbook of online learning: innovations in higher education and corporate training'' (2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the use of metaphors the concept of the Internet is abstract and its [[infrastructure]] difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Dodge, M. (2008). ''Understanding Cyberspace Cartographies: A Critical Analysis of Internet Infrastructure Mapping. ''(Doctoral Dissertation). Retrieved from http://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/m.dodge/thesis/chap_4.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  When it was introduced the Internet created a linguistic gap as no literal expressions existed to define its functions and properties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Internet metaphors arose out of this predicament so that it could be adequately described and explained to the public.  Essentially all language now used to communicate about the Internet is of a metaphorical nature although users are often unaware of this reality because it is embedded in a cultural context that is widely accepted.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are several types of metaphors that serve various purposes and can range from describing the nature of online relationships, modeling the Internet visually,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; to the specific functions of the Internet as a tool.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Each metaphor has implications for the experience and understanding of the Internet by its users and tends to emphasize some aspects of the Internet over others. Some metaphors emphasize space (Matlock, Castro, Fleming, Gann, &amp; Maglio, 2014).

== Popular culture ==
[[File:Internet.png|left|thumb|The World Wide Web was the first metaphor of the Internet, suggesting the networked connection of physical computers across the world.]]
Common recurring themes regarding the Internet appear in popular media and reflect pervasive cultural attitudes and perceptions.  Although other models and constructed metaphors of the Internet found in scholarly research and theoretical frameworks may be more accurate sources on the ''effects'' of the Internet, mass media messages in [[popular culture]] are more likely to influence how people think about and interact with the Internet.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Baym, N. K. (2010). ''Personal connections in the digital age''. Cambridge, UK: Polity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first metaphor to describe the Internet was the [[World Wide Web]] proposed in 1989.  However, uncertainty surrounding the structure and properties of the Internet was apparent in the newspapers of the 1990s that presented a vast array of contradicting visual models to explain the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Spatial constructs were utilized to make the Internet appear as a tangible entity placed within a familiar geographical context.  A popular metaphor adopted around the same time was [[cyberspace]] coined by [[William Gibson]] in his novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' to describe the world of computers and the society that gathers around them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Howard Rheingold]], an Internet enthusiast of the 1990s, propagated the metaphor of [[virtual communities]] and offered a vivid description of the Internet as "...a place for conversation or publication, like a giant coffee-house with a thousand rooms; it is also a world-wide digital version of the [[Speaker's Corner]] in London's Hyde Park, an unedited collection of letters to the editor, a floating flea market, a huge vanity publisher, and a collection of every odd-special interest group in the world" (Rheingold 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;130).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1991, [[Al Gore]]'s choice to use the information superhighway as a metaphor shifted perceptions of the Internet as a communal enterprise to an economic model that emphasized the speed of information transmission.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  While this metaphor can still be found in popular culture, it has generally been dropped in favor of other metaphors due to its limited interpretation of other aspects of the Internet such as social networks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The most common types of metaphors in usage today relate to either social or functional aspects of the Internet&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.hawaii.edu/~ztomasze/ling440/webmetaphors.html|title = Conceptual Metaphors of the World Wide Web|date = 2002|accessdate = June 20, 2014|website = Web Metaphors|publisher = |last = Tomaszewski|first = Zach}}&lt;/ref&gt; or representations of its infrastructure through visual metaphors and models.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Social metaphors ===

Internet metaphors frequently arise from social exchanges and processes that occur online and incorporate common terms that describe offline social activities and realities.  These metaphors often point to the fundamental elements that make up [[social interaction]]s even though online interactions differ in significant ways from face-to-face communication.  Therefore, social metaphors tend to communicate more about the values of society rather than the technology of the Internet itself.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Metaphors such as the electronic neighborhood and [[virtual community]] point to ways in which individuals connect to others and build relationships by joining a social network.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  [[Global village (term)|Global village]] is another metaphor that evokes the imagery of closeness and interconnectedness that might be found in a small village, but is applied to the worldwide community of Internet users. However, the global village metaphor has sometimes been criticized for suggesting that the ''entire'' world is connected by the Internet as the continued existence of social divides prevent many individuals from accessing the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The electronic frontier metaphor conceptualizes the Internet as a vast unexplored territory, a source of new resources, and a place to forge new social and business connections.  Similar to the American ideology of the [[Western Frontier]], the electronic frontier invokes the image of a better future to come through new opportunities afforded by the Internet.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] is a non-profit digital rights group that adopted the use of this metaphor to denote their dedication to the protection of personal freedoms and fair use within the digital landscape.  Social metaphors and their pervasive influence indicate the increasing importance placed on social interaction on the Internet.

=== Functional metaphors ===
Functional metaphors of the Internet shape our understanding of the medium itself and give us clues as to how we should actually use the Internet and interpret its infrastructure for design and policy making.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  These exist at the level of the Internet as a whole, at the level of a website, and the level of individual pages.  The majority of these types of metaphors are based on the concept of various spaces and physical places, therefore, most are considered spatial metaphors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, this aspect should not be considered the only defining feature of a functional metaphor as social metaphors are often spatial in nature.

Cyberspace is the most widely used spatial metaphor of the Internet and the implications of its use can be seen in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' definition, which denotes cyberspace as a space within whose boundaries digital communications take place.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bittarello, M. B. (2010). [http://www.obs.obercom.pt/index.php/obs/article/viewArticle/237 Spatial Metaphors describing the Internet and religious Websites: sacred Space and sacred Place.] ''Observatorio (OBS*)'', ''3''(4).&lt;/ref&gt;  The implications of this spatial metaphor in discourse on law can be seen in instances where the application of traditional laws governing real property are applied to Internet spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lemley, M. A. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3481337?uid=3739600&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104381943743 Place and cyberspace]. ''California Law Review'', 521–542.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, arguments against this type of ruling have claimed that the Internet is a borderless space, which should not be subject to the laws applied to places.  Others have argued that the Internet is in fact, a real space not sealed from the real world and can be zoned, trespassed upon, or divided up into holdings like real property.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, M. (2013). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geoj.12009/abstract "Geography/Internet: Ethereal Alternate Dimensions of Cyberspace or Grounded Augmented Realities?"] ''The Geographical Journal'', ''179'', 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blavin, J. H., &amp; Cohen, L. G. (2002). [http://farrall.org/research/cyberspace/cohen_blavin2002_cyberspace_metaphor_law.pdf Gore, Gibson, and Goldsmith: "The Evolution of Internet Metaphors in Law and Commentary"] ''Harv. JL &amp; Tech.'', ''16'', 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Surfing in Hawaii.jpg|thumb|''Surfing'' the 'Net' is a metaphor that uses the spatial domain of the ocean to suggest that navigating the Internet is similar to the flow of surfing in the sea of information.]]
Other functional metaphors are based on travel within space such as ''surfing'' the Net and suggest the Internet is similar to an ocean. [[Websites|Web''sites'']] indicate components of a space, which are static and fixed, whereas, [[webpages|web''pages'']] suggest pages of a book. Similarly, focal points of the Internet structure are called [[node (networking)|nodes]].  Home pages, chat rooms, windows, and the idea that you can ''jump'' from one page to the next also invoke spatial imagery that guide the functions that users perform on the Internet.  Other metaphors refer to the Internet as another dimension beyond typical spaces such as [[Web portal|portals]] and [[Gateway (web page)|gateways]] which refer to access and communication functions.  [[Firewalls and Internet Security|Firewalls]] invoke the image of physically blocking the incoming of information such as viruses and pop-up ads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Designers of computer systems often use spatial metaphors as a way of controlling the complexity of interfaces.  Designers create actions, procedures, and concepts of systems based on similar actions, procedures, and concepts of other domains such as physical spaces so that they will be familiar to users.  In designing [[hypertext]], a system that links topics on a screen to related information, navigational metaphors such as landmarks, routes, and way-finding have often been implemented for users ease of understanding how hypertext functions.&lt;ref&gt;Hsu, Y. C., &amp; Schwen, T. M. (2003). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581902001258 The effects of structural cues from multiple metaphors on computer users’ information search performance.] ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'', ''58''(1), 39-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Visual metaphors ===
Visual metaphors are popular in conceptualizing the Internet and are often deployed in commercial promotions through visual media and imagery. The most common visual metaphor is a network of wires with [[node (networking)|nodes]] and route lines plotted on a geographically based map.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  However, maps of Internet infrastructure produced for network marketing are rarely based on actual pathways of wires and cable on the ground, but are instead based on [[circuit diagram]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s similar to those seen on subway map&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Dodge, M., &amp; Kitchin, R. (2001). ''[http://www.kitchin.org/atlas/contents.html Atlas of cyberspace]'' (Vol. 158). Reading: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[globe]], or the [[Earth]] viewed from space, with network arcs of [[data flow]] wrapped around it, is another dominant metaphor for the Internet in Western contexts&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and is connected with the metaphor of the [[Global village (term)|Global Village]].  
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Internet map plain 1024.png|left|thumb|An abstract visual 'map' of the Internet created using algorithms of raw data from networks that serves as a visual metaphor of the complexity of the Internet.]] --&gt;
Many [[abstraction|abstract]] visual metaphors based on [[organic structures]] and patterns are found in literature on the Internet's infrastructure.  Often, these metaphors are used as a visual [[shorthand]] in explanations as they allow one to refer to the Internet as a definite object without having to explain the intricate details of its functioning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Clouds are the most common of abstract metaphors employed for this purpose in [[cloud computing]] and have been used since the creation of the Internet.&lt;ref name="reynolds19841204"&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/e/mail.84b | title=Kermit vs 4705? | publisher=Kermit Project, Columbia University | mailinglist=Info-Kermit Digest | date=1984-12-04 | accessdate=24 February 2016 | author=Reynolds, Steve | quote=After some attempts I decided to ask the 'cloud' about this.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other abstract metaphors of the Internet draw on the [[fractal]] branching of trees and leaves, and the [[latticework|lattice]]s of coral and webs, while others are based on the aesthetics of [[astronomy]] such as gas [[nebulas]], and [[star clusters]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Technical methods such as algorithms are often used to create huge, complex graphs or maps of raw data from networks and the topology of connections. The typical result of this process are visual representations of the Internet that are elaborate and visually striking, resembling organic structures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These artistic, abstract representations of the Internet have been featured in art galleries, sold as wall posters, used on book covers, and have been claimed to be a picture of the ''whole'' Internet by many fans. However, there are no instructions on how these images may be interpreted. The main function of these representations has sometimes been explained as a metaphor for the complexity of the Internet.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  '''  '''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">The '''inventor's paradox''' is a phenomenon that occurs in seeking a solution to a given problem. Instead of solving a specific type of problem, which would seem intuitively easier, it can be easier to solve a more general problem, which covers the specifics of the sought-after solution. The ''inventor's paradox''  has been used to describe phenomena in mathematics, programming, and logic, as well as other areas that involve critical thinking.

==History==
In the book ''[[How to Solve It]]'', [[George Pólya]] introduces what he defines as the inventor's paradox:
{{Quote|The more ambitious plan may have more chances of success […] provided it is not based on a mere pretension but on some vision of the things beyond those immediately present.|[[George Pólya]]|[[How to Solve It]].&lt;ref&gt;Pólya, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or, in other words, to solve what one desires to solve, one may have to solve more than that in order to get a properly working flow of information.&lt;ref name=Barwise41/&gt;

When solving a problem, the natural inclination typically is to remove as much excessive variability and produce limitations on the subject at hand as possible. Doing this can create unforeseen and intrinsically awkward parameters.&lt;ref name=tate110&gt;Tate, et al., p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is to find elegant and relatively simple solutions to broader problems, allowing for the ability to focus on the specific portion that was originally of concern.&lt;ref name=tate111&gt;Tate, et al., p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

There lies the ''inventor's paradox'', that it is often significantly easier to find a general solution than a more specific one, since the general solution may naturally have a simpler algorithm and cleaner design, and typically can take less time to solve in comparison with a particular problem.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;

==Examples==
===Mathematics===
The sum of numbers sequentially from 1-99:
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 97 + 98 + 99\, &lt;/math&gt;
This process, although not impossible to do in one's head, can prove to be difficult for most. However, the ability to generalize the problem exists, in this case by reordering the sequence to:
:&lt;math&gt;(1 + 99) + (2 + 98) + (3 + 97) + ... + (48 + 52) + (49 + 51) + (50) \,&lt;/math&gt;
In this form, the example can be solved by most without the use of a calculator.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;  If one notices the problem's lowest and highest numbers (1 + 99) sum to 100, and that the next pair of lowest and highest numbers (2 + 98) also sum to 100, they'll also realize that all 49 numbers are matching pairs that each sum to 100, except for the single number in the middle, 50.  The inventive mathematician will reformulate the problem in their mind as (49 * 100) + 50.  Since 49 * 100 is easy to calculate by adding 2 zeros to the digit places of 49, they think: 4900 + 50.  This is easy to add, because 50's maximum ordinal placement of the most significant digit (number 5 in the 2nd position "10s" place) is less than the minimum ordinal position of 4900's smallest significant digit (number 9 in the 3rd position "100s" place).  So the solver simply replaces the last two 0s in 4900 with 50 to add them together, yielding the answer 4950.  While the text description of this process seems complicated, each of the steps performed in the mind is simple and fast.

Although appearing in several applications, it can be easiest to explain through inspection of a relatively simple mathematical sequence.&lt;ref name=Barwise40&gt;Barwise p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 = 4\, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 + 5 = 9\, &lt;/math&gt;

and further along in the sequence:

:&lt;math&gt;1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25\, &lt;/math&gt;

In allowing the sequence to expand to a point where the sum cannot be found quickly, we can simplify by finding that the sum of consecutive odd numbers follows:&lt;ref name=Barwise41&gt;Barwise p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf(2k-1) = n^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Programming===
As an example in applying the same logic, it may be harder to solve a 25-case problem than it would be to solve an n-case problem, and then apply it to the case where n=25.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (2000), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
This paradox has applications in writing efficient programs. It is intuitive to write programs that are specialized, but in practice it can become easier to develop more generalized procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley (1982), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bruce Tate]], some of the most successful frameworks are simple generalizations of complex problems, and he says that [[Visual Basic]], the Internet, and [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache web servers]] plug-ins are primary examples of such practice.&lt;ref name=tate111/&gt; In the investigation of the semantics of language, many logicians find themselves facing this paradox. An example of application can be seen in the inherent concern of logicians with the conditions of truth within a sentence, and not, in fact, with the conditions under which a sentence can be truly asserted.&lt;ref name=Barwise41/&gt;
Additionally, the paradox has been shown to have applications in industry.&lt;ref name=tate110/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12150">'''Invisible support''' is a [[Psychology|psychological]] term used to describe a type of [[social support]] in which supportive exchanges are not visible to recipients. There are two possible situations that can describe acts of invisible support. The first possibility entails a situation where ''recipients are completely unaware of the supportive transaction between themselves and support-givers''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bolger, Zuckerman, &amp; Kessler|first=|year=2000|title=Invisible Support and Adjustment to Stress|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=79 |issue=6|pages=953–961|via=ProQuest|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.953|citeseerx=10.1.1.488.333}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a spouse may choose to spontaneously take care of housework without mentioning it to the other couple-member. Invisible support also occurs when ''recipients are aware of an act that takes place but do not interpret the act as a supportive exchange''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this case, a friend or family member may subtly provide advice in an indirect manner as a means to preserve the recipient's self-esteem or to defer his or her attention from a stressful situation. Invisible support can be viewed on both ends of an exchange, in which the recipient is unaware of the support received and the provider enacts support in a skillful, subtle way.

== Background ==
It is well known that perceptions of social support availability predict better adjustment to stressful life events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=House, Landis, &amp; Umberson|first=|year=1988|title=Social relationships and health|url=|journal=Science|volume=241 |issue=4865|pages=540–545|via=|doi=10.1126/science.3399889}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=|year=1992|title=Stress, social support, and disorder|url=|journal=The Meaning and Measurement of Social Support|volume=|pages=109–124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Close personal relationships and health outcomes: A key to the role of social support.|last=Gurung, R., Sarason, B., &amp; Sarason, I|first=|publisher=Handbook of personal relationships: theory, research and interventions (2nd ed)|year=1997|isbn=|location=Chichester, UK|pages=547–73|quote=|via=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been found that the perception of support availability is inherently comforting, and can serve as a psychological safety-net that motivates self-reliant [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] efforts in the face of [[Stress (psychology)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wethington, E., &amp; Kessler, R.

C., Wortman, C. B., &amp; Lehman, D. R.|first=|year=1988|title=The other side of support: Emotional over-involvement and miscarried helping.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since supportive acts benefit recipients but their actual knowledge of receiving support is sometimes harmful, it has been theorized that the most effective support exchange would involve one in which the provider reports giving support but the recipient does not notice that support has occurred. From a cost-benefit point of view, invisible support would be optimal for the recipient because the benefits of provision are accrued while the costs of receipt are avoided.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Using the same idea, it also implies that the least effective type of support would be one in which the provider does not report providing support but the recipient reports receiving it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first investigation of invisible support involved a couples study in which one member was preparing for the New York State Bar Exam. Support receipt and provision were measured by having both couple members complete daily diary entries. Over the course of one month, stressed individuals who reported low frequency of received support (but whose partner ranked his or her own actions as highly supportive) rated themselves low on anxiety and depression compared to other individuals who reported high frequency of received support.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Invisible support compared to visible support ==
A substantial body of work has evidence to suggest that support is most effective when it is invisible or goes unnoticed by recipients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howland, M., &amp; Simpson, J. A.|first=|year=2010|title=Getting in under the radar a dyadic view of invisible support|doi=10.1177/0956797610388817|pmid=21097721|journal=Psychological Science|volume=21|issue=12|pages=1878–1885|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shrout, P.

For example, greater observed support enacted by intimate partners during couples’ support-relevant exchanges have been shown to build feelings of closeness and support, boost positive mood and self-esteem, and foster greater goal achievement and relationship quality across time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins, N. L., &amp; Feeney, B. C.|first=|year=2004|title=Working models of attachment shape perceptions of social support: evidence from experimental and observational studies|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=87 |issue=3|pages=363–383|via=|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.3.363|pmid=15382986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sullivan, K.

To investigate this idea, a recent study in 2013 compared the short-term and long-term effects of visible and invisible support reception during romantic couples’ discussions of each partner’s personal goal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Girme, Y. U., Overall, N. C., &amp; Simpson, J. A.|first=|year=2013|title=When visibility matters: short-term versus long-term costs and benefits of visible and invisible support|doi=10.1177/0146167213497802|pmid=23885036|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=39|issue=11|pages=1441–1454|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that either type of support was more beneficial depending on the emotional distress that recipients felt at the time. Visible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) was associated with perceptions of greater support and discussion success for recipients who felt greater distress during the discussion. In contrast, invisible emotional support was not associated with recipients’ post-discussion perceptions of support or discussion success. For long-term support effects, it was found that only invisible emotional support predicted greater goal achievement across the following year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When put together, these findings suggest that visible support and invisible support have unique functions for well-being. When people are under distress, visible support appears to be a short-term remedy to reassure recipients that they are cared for and supported. These benefits are only present when recipients are actually distressed during the time that the supportive act takes place. On the other hand, while invisible support tends to go unnoticed by recipients, it seems to play an integral role in the long-term success of goal-maintenance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Effects on support providers ==
{{primary sources|section|date=November 2016}}
{{see also|social support|Psychology|Stress (psychological)|Coping (psychology)|self-esteem|self-efficacy}}
The effects of invisible support on recipients have been extensively investigated, but the consequences of invisible support on providers are less known. One study in 2016 investigated the benefits and costs of invisible support on couple-members who enacted supportive behaviors by differentiating the processes of invisible emotional support (support through reassurance, encouragement, and understanding) from processes of invisible instrumental support (providing tangible aid such as sending money or childcare).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=König, C., Stadler, G., Knoll, N., Ochsner, S., Hornung, R., &amp; Scholz, U.|first=|year=2016|title=Invisible Support: Effects on the Provider's Positive and Negative Affect|url=|journal=Applied Psychology: Health and Well-Being|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; No costs of support-giving were found for providers when they demonstrated acts of invisible emotional support. The effects for invisible instrumental support told a different story, where providers who reported high relationship satisfaction were unaffected, but providers who reported low relationship satisfaction were negatively affected by their acts of invisible instrumental support with an increase in negative mood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These findings suggest that emotional comfort may be a more central function to maintain close relationships than instrumental support. Therefore, providing invisible emotional support may lead to less perceptions of a costly inequity than providing invisible instrumental support on average. However, since invisible instrumental support did not incur costs for providers who reported high relationship satisfaction, it implies that high relationship satisfaction may buffer potential costs that would otherwise be felt by support-providers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The differential results between invisible instrumental and emotional support indicate that a solid distinction between instrumental and emotional social support may be useful to take into account when investigating effects of invisible support as a whole.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Józef Klemens Piłsudski'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pl|ˈjuzɛf ˈklɛmɛns pʲiwˈsutskʲi|lang|Pl-Józef_Piłsudski.ogg}}; 5 December 1867&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 1935) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Politician|statesman]] who served as the [[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] (1918–22) and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (from 1920). He was considered the ''[[de facto]]'' leader (1926–35) of the Second Polish Republic as the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. From World War I he had great power in [[Politics of Poland|Polish politics]] and was a distinguished figure on the international scene.{{sfn|Plach|2006|p=14}} He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911|Lieven94_159}}{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA441 p. 441]}}{{sfn|Held|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5O5NkwX-NnYC&amp;pg=PA249 p. 249]}}

Deeming himself a descendant of the culture and traditions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{r|Davies05_10}} Piłsudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland—"a home of nations" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities that he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]].{{r|Davies05_10}} His principal political antagonist, [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of the [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrat party]], by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish Crown]] and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] identity.

Early in his political career, Piłsudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won  militarily, he formed the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]. In 1914 he correctly predicted the outbreak of a major war, the [[Russian Empire]]'s defeat by the [[Central Powers]], and the Central Powers' defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|western Allies]].{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Piłsudski's Legions fought alongside [[Austria-Hungary]] against Russia. In 1917, with [[Imperial Russia|Imperalist Russia]] faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was imprisoned in [[Magdeburg]] by the Germans.

From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Piłsudski was Poland's [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]]. In 1919–21 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders.  His forces seemed on the verge of defeat in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] when, in the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], they threw back the invading Soviet Russian forces.  In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], Piłsudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']] and became Poland's [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.

In international affairs, Piłsudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and to enhance her national security: "[[Prometheism]]", aimed at achieving the disintegration of [[Imperial Russia|Imperialist Russia]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states lying between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s; serving as a bridge between Germany and Russia. The proposed Intermarium's central purpose was to secure its peoples against [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an [[imperialism]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}}

Historian [[Piotr S. Wandycz|Piotr Wandycz]] characterizes Piłsudski as "an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|Polish-Lithuanian]], and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions."{{sfn|Wandycz|1990|p=452}} Though some aspects of Piłsudski's administration remain controversial, he is highly esteemed in Polish memory and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist [[Roman Dmowski]], as a founder of the modern independent Poland.

==Early life==
[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski as a schoolboy]]
He was born 5 December 1867 to the [[szlachta|noble]] [[Piłsudski family|family Piłsudski]], at their manor named ''Zułów'', near the village of Zułowo  (now [[Zalavas]], [[Švenčionys district municipality]],{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=3}} [[Lithuania]]),{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=92}} in the Russian Empire since 1795 on the territory of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family.{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=95}} The Piłsudski family, although pauperized,{{r|POleksa04}} cherished Polish patriotic traditions{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_13-5}} and has been characterized either as Polish{{r|Lerski96_439|Davies05_40}} or as [[Polonized]]-[[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].{{r|POleksa04|BidJef98_186}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Józef was the second son born to the family.
Józef, when he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in ''Wilno'' (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), was not an especially diligent student.{{sfn|Roshwald|2001|p=36}} One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Feliks Dzierżyński]], who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.{{sfn|Blobaum|1984|p=30}} Along with his brothers [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], [[Adam Piłsudski|Adam]] and [[Jan Piłsudski|Jan]], Józef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''née'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.{{r|McM03_208}} His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Piłsudski in 1899]]
The family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service{{r|McM03_208}} and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.{{r|POleksa04}}

In 1885 Piłsudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.{{r|PWN}} In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.{{r|PolandGov}} He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.{{r|PolandGov}} On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], who was sentenced to fifteen years of [[hard labor]] (''[[katorga]]'') in eastern Siberia.{{r|ICRAP|Urbank97_50}}

Józef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_50}} While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].{{r|LandauDunlop30_30}} There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}} He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}}

During his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronisław Szwarce]], who had almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].{{r|Urbank97_74–7}} He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages{{r|POleksa04}} (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|Cisek|1994|p=13}} Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.{{r|Urbank97_71}}

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[Šilalė district]]). In 1893 he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS''){{r|PolandGov}} and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.{{r|Urbank97_88}} Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] he remained a Polish nationalist.{{r|McM03_209}} In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing an [[bibuła|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].{{r|PolandGov|PWN|Urbank97_93}}{{sfn|Piłsudski|1989|p=12}} In 1895, he became a PPS leader and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.{{r|PWN}}

On 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska]].{{r|Alabrud99_99|Garlicki195_63|Pobog-Ma90_7}} According to his chief biographer, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of "Robotnik" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], then in [[Łódź]]. Having a pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion. Russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband.{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|loc=pp. 27-8 (1982 ed.)}} The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,{{r|McM03_209}} [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Szczerbińska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. By then the couple had two daughters, [[Wanda Piłsudska|Wanda]] and [[Jadwiga Piłsudska|Jadwiga]].

[[File:Lingwood 1898.jpg|thumb|left|"Lingwood", [[Leytonstone]], where Piłsudski stayed in 1900]]
In February 1900, after Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground printing press in [[Łódź]], Piłsudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[Władysław Mazurkiewicz (physician)|Władysław Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and thence to [[Leytonstone]] in London where he stayed with [[Leon Wasilewski]] and his family.{{r|PolandGov}}

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.{{r|POleksa04}}

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to [[Tokyo]], Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,{{r|Urbank97_109–11}} conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}} Meeting with [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he suggested that starting a [[guerrilla war]] in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat [[Hayashi Tadasu]] supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical.{{sfn|Kowner|2006|p=285}}

Piłsudski's arch-rival [[Roman Dmowski]] travelled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt would then be doomed to failure.{{r|Urbank97_109–11|Zamo87_330}} Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political archenemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_109–11}}

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''bojówki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.{{r|Zamo87_330|Urbank97_113–6}} Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.{{r|Urbank97_117–8}}

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Piłsudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} In June 1905, Piłsudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[Łódź]]. During the "[[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days]]", as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} On 22 December 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.{{r|Zamo87_330}}

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} The decision and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Piłsudski's leadership.{{r|Zamo87_332}} His faction came to be called the "Old Faction" or "Revolutionary Faction" ("''Starzy''" or "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''"), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction", "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" ("''Młodzi''", "''Frakcja Umiarkowana''", "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Left|Lewica]]''"). The "Young" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the tsarist regime and creating a socialist [[utopia]] that would facilitate negotiations for independence.{{r|PWN}}

Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.{{r|PolandGov}} By 1909, his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders until the outbreak of the First World War.{{r|Urbank97_131}}

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army, which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned it out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of paramilitary units.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.{{r|Zamo87_332|Urbank97_121–2}}

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.{{r|Zamo87_332}} Piłsudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus "expropriated" to finance his secret military organization.{{r|EBritannica_JP}} The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.{{r|Urbank97_121–2}}

[[File:Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917.PNG|266px|thumb|right|Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of [[Polish Military Organisation]] in 1917]]

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an "Association for Active Struggle" (''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].{{r|Zamo87_332}} One of the ''ZWC'''s main purposes was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.{{r|PWN}}

In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lwów (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) and one in [[Kraków]], to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian authorities, Piłsudski founded a series of "sporting clubs", then the [[Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Piłsudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', "''Mieczysław''") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.{{r|PolandGov|Zamo87_332}} In 1914, Piłsudski declared, "Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."{{r|Zamo87_332}}

==World War I==
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in uniform]]
{{Main|World War I}}
At a meeting in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the United States.{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} By contrast, [[Roman Dmowski]], Piłsudski's rival, believed that the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the [[Triple Entente]] against the Central Powers.{{r|Zamo87_333}}
[[File:Jozef  Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski in World War I (1914)]]
At the outbreak of the war on 3 August in [[Kraków]], Piłsudski formed a small [[En cadre|cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of the [[Riflemen's Association]] and [[Polish Rifle Squads]].{{r|Urbank97_171–2}} That same day, [[The Seven Lancers of Belina|a cavalry unit]] under [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]] was sent to [[reconnoitre]] across the Russian border even before the official [[declaration of war]] between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.{{r|Urbank97_168}}

Piłsudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] into an area that the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] had evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious "National Government in Warsaw",{{r|Urbank97_174–5}} and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.{{r|Urbank97_178–9}} On 12 August 1914, Piłsudski's forces took the town of [[Kielce]], of [[Kielce Governorate]], but Piłsudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.{{r|Urbank97_170–1_180–2}}

Soon afterward he officially established the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], taking personal command of their [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]],{{r|PolandGov}} which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.{{r|PWN}} He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.{{r|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski and his officers, 1915]]
Piłsudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution]]-inspired "Citizen" (''Obywatel''), and he was referred to as "the Commandant" ("''Komendant''").{{r|Zamo87_333}} Piłsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men,{{r|Zamo87_333}} which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Portret brygadiera Józefa Piłsudskiego.jpg|thumb|Piłsudski. Painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1916]]
In mid-1916, after the [[Battle of Kostiuchnówka]] (4–6 July 1916), in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties,{{sfn|Rąkowski|2005|pp=109-11}} Piłsudski demanded for the Central Powers to issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed that demand with his own proffered [[resignation]] and that of many of the Legions' officers.{{r|Urbank97_251–2}} On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the "independence" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{r|EBritannica_JP|Biskupski2000}}

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]], created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]]; as such, he was responsible for the [[Polnische Wehrmacht]].{{r|Zamo87_333}} After the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution in early 1917]], and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and but be used to fight only Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.{{r|Rothschild90_45|Urbank97_253}} In the aftermath of a July 1917 "[[Oath Crisis]]" when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear a [[loyalty oath]] to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]{{r|PolandGov|Cienciala02}} while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.{{r|PWN}} Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, who was willing to take on  all the partitioning powers.{{r|PWN}}

On 8 November 1918, three days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], Piłsudski and his colleague, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon, like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them, placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Piłsudski would create a force that was friendly to them.{{r|Cienciala02}}

==Rebuilding Poland==

[[File:Polski automobil pancerny z obrony Lwowa 1918-19.JPG|thumb|''Piłsudski'' improvised armored car, 1919, named after Piłsudski]]
On 11 November 1918 in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day, which would become [[Poland's Independence Day]], he proclaimed an independent Polish state.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That week too, Piłsudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "[[Ober Ost]]" authority. Over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories.{{r|Cienciala02|Urbank97_256_277–8}}

On 14 November 1918, Piłsudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'') of renascent Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] in Warsaw; [[Ignacy Daszyński]]'s government in [[Lublin]]; and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Kraków]]) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education and [[women's suffrage]], to avoid major unrest.

However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''Towarzysz''") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: "Comrades, I took the red [[tram]] of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as '[[Slavic honorifics|Mister']] [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"{{r|PolandGov}} He declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.{{r|PWN|Suleja04_202}} He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after the war, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.{{r|McM03_210}} A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn."{{r|McM03_210}}

In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.{{r|McM03_210}}
[[File:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Piłsudski before Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', described Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making:  Piłsudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision.  He drove himself hard, working all day and all night.{{r|McM03_210}} He maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.{{r|McM03_210}} Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.{{r|McM03_209}}

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers in 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.{{r|Cienciala02}} It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris.{{r|McM03_210}} To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and [[Commander-in-Chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].{{r|McM03_213-4}} Articles 87–93 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]{{r|VersaillesTreaty1919_87-93}} and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.{{r|Grant99_114}}

[[File:PL Turek Pilsudski Monument 11.jpg|thumb|[[Józef Piłsudski monument, Turek|Piłsudski monument]], [[Turek]] (designed in 1936)]]
Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland).{{r|McM03_211-214|Boemeke98_314}} On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters ([[Marian Januszajtis-Żegota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a coup]] against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but they failed.{{r|Urbank97_499–501}}

On 20 February 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until 9 December 1922, when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected as the first [[president of Poland]].{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski's major foreign policy initiative was then a proposed federation (to be called ''"[[Międzymorze]]"'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for "Between-Seas"), and also known from the [[Latin]] as ''[[Intermarium]]'', stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]). It was to consist of Poland, the independent [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]],{{r|Cienciala02}} somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{r|PWN}}{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=93}}

Piłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence, as well as from the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing [[balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] structure.{{r|HistNet_01}} According to historian [[George Sanford (scholar)|George Sanford]], it was around 1920 that Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project.{{sfn|Sanford|2002|pp=5-6}}

Instead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] (1918–19), the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] (1920, culminating in [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]]), [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts]] (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21).{{r|PWN}} [[Winston Churchill]] commented, "The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun."{{r|HydeP01_75}}

==Polish–Soviet War==

{{Main|Polish–Soviet War}}
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in [[Poznań]]]]
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany". In the east, "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far".{{r|McM03_211}} In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish–Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lviv]].{{r|Urbank97_281}}

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland and that war with them was inevitable.{{r|Urbank97_2_90}} He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|White opponents]].{{r|Kenez99_37}} The "White Russians",  representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and they clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Piłsudski's Intermarium project.{{r|Urbank97_2_83}}

That was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.{{r|Urbank97_291}} Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.{{r|Kenez99_37|Urbank97_2_45}} By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Piłsudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.{{r|Urbank97_2_92}}

In the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919]] and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, [[Marshal]] Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{r|Davies03_95ff}} In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] being a historical part of the [[Crown of Poland]] for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.{{r|Cienciala02}}

The Polish and the Ukrainian Armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured [[Kiev]].{{r|Davies03_00}}
[[File:Pilsudski and Rydz-Smigly.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski ''(left)'' and [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] ''(right)'', 1920, during Polish-Soviet War]]
The Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion; in response, thousands of officers and deserters joined the Red Army, and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work.{{r|Figes96_699}} The Soviets launched a counter-offensive from [[Belarus]] and [[counterattack]]ed in Ukraine, advancing into Poland{{r|Davies03_00}} in a drive toward Germany to encourage the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in its struggle to take power. Soviet confidence soared.{{r|Lenin1920}} The Soviets announced their plans to invade Western Europe; Soviet communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]], writing in ''[[Pravda]]'', hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw "straight to London and Paris".{{r|CohenS80_101}} Soviet commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s order of the day for 2 July 1920 read: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]], Warsaw!"{{r|Lawrynowicz}} and "onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!"{{r|Cienciala02}}

On 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''[[Sejm]]'', formed a [[Council for Defense of the Nation]],  chaired by Piłsudski, to provide expeditious decision-making as a temporary supplanting of the fractious [[Sejm]].{{r|Urbank97_341–6_357–8}} The [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault{{r|Suleja04_265}} and demanded that for him to resign; some even accused him of treason.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} Their 19 July failure to carry a [[vote of no-confidence]] in the council led to Dmowski's withdrawal from it.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} On 12 August, Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, "Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All&amp;nbsp;– from Lenin to [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], from ''[[Pravda]]'' to ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]''&amp;nbsp;– considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw".{{r|Davies03_225}}
[[File:Piłsudski nad Nidą (22-132).jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski with his favorite horse, ''[[Kasztanka|Chestnut]]'' (''Kasztanka'')]]
However, over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] halted the Soviet advance.{{r|Davies03_00}} The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].{{r|Erickson01_95}} Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, but opponents would seek to minimize his role.{{r|LönnrothEt94_230}} In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General [[Maxime Weygand]] of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal, at best.{{r|Cienciala02|LönnrothEt94_230|Szczep}}

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and to defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the [[Wieprz River]] while some 25% of the available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. The plan next required two armies under General [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[Władysław Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled "Reserve Army" (also known as the "Strike Group", "''Grupa Uderzeniowa''"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.{{r|Cisek02_1401|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=197}} Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for that when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.{{r|Davies03_00|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

A National Democrat ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanisław Stroński]], coined the phrase, "Miracle at the Vistula" ("''Cud nad Wisłą''"),{{r|Głos05}} to express his disapproval of Piłsudski's "Ukrainian adventure". Stroński's phrase was adopted as praise for Piłsudski by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles, who were unaware of Stroński's ironic intent. A junior member of the French military mission, [[Charles de Gaulle]], would later adopt some lessons from the Polish-Soviet War as well as from Piłsudski's career.{{r|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=935}}

In February 1921, Piłsudski visited Paris, where, in negotiations with French President [[Alexandre Millerand]], he laid the foundations for the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]], which would be signed later that year.{{r|Urbank97_484}} The [[Treaty of Riga]], which ended the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] between Poland and Russia. Piłsudski called the treaty an "act of cowardice".{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 399 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5)}} The treaty and his secret approval of General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]'s [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|capture of Vilnius]] from the Lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of Piłsudski's federalist [[Intermarium]] plan.{{r|PWN}}

On 25 September 1921, when Piłsudski visited Lwów (now [[Lviv]]) for the opening of the first [[Eastern Trade Fair]] (''Targi Wschodnie''), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by [[Stepan Fedak]], acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]].{{r|Urbank97_485}}

==Retirement and coup==

He declined to run for the office.{{r|PWN}} On 9 December 1922, the Polish [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] elected [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] of [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"]]; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest.{{r|Urbank97_487-8}} On 14 December at the [[Belweder]] Palace, Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the ''Naczelnik'' was replaced by the President.{{r|Urbank97_488|EBritannica_JP}}
[[File:Pilsudski in Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|At Warsaw's [[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]], 3 July 1923, Piłsudski announced his retirement from active politics.]]
Two days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]], who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced by National Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.{{r|Urbank97_489}}

For Piłsudski, that was a major shock, which shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy{{r|Suleja04_300}} and made him support government by a strong hand.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=140}} He became [[Chief of the General Staff (Poland)|Chief of the General Staff]] and, together with [[Polish Minister of Military Affairs|Minister of Military Affairs]] [[Władysław Sikorski]], managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief [[state of emergency]].{{r|Urbank97_489–90}}

[[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] of [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] (PSL Piast), another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and [[Wincenty Witos]], also of PSL Piast, became prime minister. However, the new government, pursuant to the [[Lanckorona Pact]], an alliance among the centrist PSL Piast and the right-wing [[Popular National Union]] and [[Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat]] parties, contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and with whom he found it impossible to work.{{r|Urbank97_490–1}} On 30 May 1923, Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.
[[File:Dworek w Sulejówku.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in front of his [[Sulejówek]] house, with his former soldiers, before the 1926 coup]]
After General [[Stanisław Szeptycki]] proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Piłsudski criticized that as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June, he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution, thanking him for his past work.{{r|Urbank97_490}} Piłsudski went into retirement in [[Sulejówek]], outside Warsaw, at his country manor, ''"Milusin"'', which had been presented to him by his former soldiers.{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=210}} There, he settled down to supporting his family by writing a series of political and military memoirs, including ''Rok 1920'' (The Year 1920).{{r|PolandGov}}

Meanwhile, Poland's economy was in shambles. [[Hyperinflation]] fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis.{{r|Urbank97_502}} Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centred on former members of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] and the [[Polish Military Organization]] as well as some left-wing and [[intelligentsia]] parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government and eventually issued statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.{{r|PolandGov|PWN}}

When the [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,{{r|PWN}} on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''coup d'état'' (the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"|Liberation]], the [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie|Peasant Party]] and even the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].{{r|Urbank97_515}} Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;{{r|Suleja04_343}} 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.{{sfn|Roszkowski|1992|loc= p. 53, section 5.1}}

==In government==
On 31 May, the ''[[Sejm]]'' elected Piłsudski president of the Republic. Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], was elected in his stead. Mościcki then appointed Piłsudski as [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister of Military Affairs]] (defence minister), a post that he would hold for the rest of his life in 11 successive governments, two of which he headed himself from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930. He also served as [[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]], and Chairman of The War Council.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences".{{r|PWN}} His goals were to stabilize the country; reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency; and strengthen the army.{{r|PWN|Urbank97_528–9}} His role in the Polish government over the subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a "quasi-dictatorship".&lt;{{sfn|Biskupski|2012|p=46}}

===Internal politics===
[[File:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Warsaw, Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his [[Sanacja|Sanation]] regime (1926–1939), at times employing authoritarian methods, sought to "restore public life to moral health". From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled either by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, or by the ''[[Sejm]]''.{{r|PolandGov}} The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] that were introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926.{{r|PolandGov}} From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.{{r|PWN}}

The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s, with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents (the [[Brest trial]]s) on the eve of the 1930 [[Polish legislative election, 1930|legislative elections]] and with the 1934 establishment of a [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|prison]] for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today [[Biaroza]]),{{r|PWN}} where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.{{r|Śleszyński03}} After the ''[[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government|BBWR]]''{{'}}s 1930 victory, Piłsudski left most internal matters in the hands of [[Piłsudski's colonels|his "colonels"]] while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs.{{r|PWN}} He came under considerable criticism for his treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and damaged Poland's reputation.{{r|Biskupski2000}}
[[File:Aleksandra Piłsudska.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshal and his second wife, [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]], in later life]]
Piłsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland.{{r|CohenY89_65}} His intemperate public utterances (he called the ''[[Sejm]]'' a "prostitute") and his sending of 90 armed officers into the ''Sejm'' building in response to an impending [[vote of no-confidence]] caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.{{r|Times7Apr1930|Times11Nov1929|NYT12091993_Perlez}}

One of his main goals was to transform the [[parliamentary system]] into a [[presidential system]]; however, he opposed the introduction of [[totalitarianism]].{{r|PWN}} The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 that was tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications, providing for a strong presidency, came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the [[April Constitution]] would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its [[Polish Government in Exile|Government in Exile]] until the end of the war and beyond.

Nonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].{{r|PWN}} None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death, the [[Sanacja|Sanation]] structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.{{r|PWN}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski homaging at John III Sobieski tomb, commemorating 250 anniversary of battle of Vienna.PNG|thumb|In 1933, Piłsudski paid homage at the tomb of [[John III Sobieski]] in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of [[Battle of Vienna]].]]
Piłsudski's regime began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population.{{r|Stachura04_79|ColuEncyclPoland}} Piłsudski replaced the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]]' "[[polonization|ethnic-assimilation]]" with a "state-assimilation" policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state.{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166}} Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' anti-Semitic policies,{{r|Vital99_788|Payne95_141|Lieven94_163|Engelking01_75|Flannery05_200|Zimm03_19}} he extended his policy of "state-assimilation" to [[Polish Jews]].{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166|Prizel98_61|Wein90_292}} The years 1926 to 1935 and Piłsudski himself were favorably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]] whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]].{{r|Cieplinski02|Paulsson03_37}} Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish people, who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc.{{r|Snyder07_66}} Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.{{r|Zimm03_19}}

During the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the [[Great Depression]]{{r|Snyder04_144}} to the [[vicious spiral]] of ''[[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]'' terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate.{{r|Snyder04_144}}{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 407 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5 }} Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in the largely-Ukrainian eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in [[Upper Silesia]]. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the Depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.{{sfn|Leslie|1983|p=182}}

In the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]", has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment.{{r|PWN|Garlicki195_178}} His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armoured and air forces.{{r|Garlicki195_178}} Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he had supported the development of these military branches.{{r|Urbank97_2_330-7}} The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Kossak Józef Piłsudski.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal Piłsudski, painted by [[Wojciech Kossak]], 1928]]
Under Piłsudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], Hungary and [[Latvia]]. Relations were strained with [[Czechoslovakia]], however, and even worse with [[Lithuania]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=29}} Relations with [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could, for the most part, be described as neutral.{{r|Urbank97_538-40|Prizel98_71}}

Piłsudski's Promethean programme to weaken the Russian Empire and its [[successor state]], the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was co-ordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer, [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]. In the [[interbellum]], but it yielded few tangible results.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=56-87}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-293, Warschau, Empfang Goebbels bei Marschall Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|270px|German ambassador, [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], Piłsudski, [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Józef Beck]], Polish Foreign minister, in [[Warsaw]] on 15 June 1934, five months after the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]]]
Piłsudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his protégé, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] [[Józef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbours, such as Romania and Hungary.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

A supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]], part of the [[Little Entente]], Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of [[appeasement]] evident in their signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].{{r|Prizel98_71|Lukacs01_30|Jordan02_23}} Piłsudski, therefore, aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany and so Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both of its powerful neighbours: the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}} Both were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbours.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and he commented: "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be".{{r|Kipp93_95}} Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Piłsudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness,{{r|Hehn05_76}} of giving Germany time to rearm{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=237}}{{r|Davidson04_25}} and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition, primarily in Ukraine, which had been supported by Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=64}}

After [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have proposed to France a [[preventive war]] against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany.{{r|Urbank97_2_317-26}} Lack of French interest may have been a reason for Poland signing the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQH"/&gt;{{r|EBritannica_JP}} Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.&lt;ref name="Bel"/&gt;

Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with either Germany or the Soviet Union.{{r|EBritannica_JP}}&lt;ref name="Hildebrand"/&gt; Just before his death, Piłsudski told [[Józef Beck]] that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany, keep up the Polish alliance with France and improve relations with the United Kingdom.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

==Religious views==
Piłsudski's religious views are a matter of debate. He was baptised on 15 December 1867 in the church of Powiewiórka (then [[Švenčionys|Sventsiany]] deanery) by the priest, Thomas Valinsky. His godparents were Joseph and Constance Martsinkovsky Ragalskaya.&lt;ref&gt;[Adam Borkiewicz: Źródła do biografii Józefa Piłsudskiego the z lat 1867-1892, Niepodległość. T. XIX. Warszawa: 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He periodically changed his religious affiliation from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Lutheranism]], and back.

On 15 July 1899, at the village of Paproć Duża, near [[Łomża]], he married [[Maria Piłsudska]], a divorcée.  As the [[Catholic Church]] did not recognise divorces, she and Piłsudski had converted to [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Garlicki, ''Józef Piłsudski: 1867–1935'', [[Warsaw]], [[Czytelnik]], 1988,  {{ISBN|8307017157}}, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In connection with marrying, Piłsudski had converted to the Evangelical-Augsburg Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilsudski later returned to the Catholic Church in order to marry [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]]. Piłsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Piłsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Adviser Daria and Thomas, ''Jozef Pilsudski: Legends and Facts'', Warsaw 1987, {{ISBN|83-203-1967-6}}, p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suleja Vladimir, ''Jozef Pilsudski'', Wroclaw - Warsaw - Kraków 2005, {{ISBN|83-04-04706-3}}, pp. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], Piłsudski considered himself a Roman Catholic, but he did not appear to be religious and often used religion as a public tool. Piłsudski was quoted saying:
{{cquote|Religion is for brainless people.}} 
After the coup and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless enjoyed a good working relationship with Cardinal [[Aleksander Kakowski]], who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]], ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] to Royal Tombs at [[Wawel]]. This led to open conflict with the church and the government, which threatened to step down.

==Death==
[[File:Rossa-MATKA I SERCE SYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Piłsudski's mother in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. The huge black tombstone is inscribed: "''Matka i serce syna''"&lt;br/&gt; ("A mother and the heart of [her] son") and bears evocative lines from a poem by [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]].]]
By 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an hour of the announcement of his death.{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=5}} It was led by military personnel — former [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legionnaires]], members of the [[Polish Military Organization]], veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

The [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] immediately attacked Piłsudski as a fascist and capitalist,{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} though fascists themselves did not see him as one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SwMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22a+liberal+democrat+in+the+clothes+of+an+old-world+knight.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wwxy3WRgEl&amp;sig=Ok3awKVR6URUy-YX_7C3M14ENXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PvVrTPeCM4GsOJTuqZ0B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20liberal%20democrat%20in%20the%20clothes%20of%20an%20old-world%20knight.%22&amp;f=false ''Ideas into Politics: Aspects of European History, 1880–1950''] R. J. Bullen, Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, A. B. Polonsky, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1984, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Other opponents of the [[sanacja|Sanation]] regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as [[Ignacy Daszyński]] and [[Tomasz Arciszewski]]) and [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]] (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and [[Władysław Grabski]]) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions ([[Wincenty Witos]] voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but [[Maciej Rataj]] and [[Stanisław Thugutt]] being supportive), while [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] expressed a toned-down criticism.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Condolences were expressed by the clergy, including [[primate of Poland|Poland's Primate]] [[August Hlond]], as well as by [[Pope Pius XI]], who called himself a "personal friend" of Piłsudski. Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], Protestant, [[Judaism|Judaic]] and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of religious tolerance.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority, who even years after remembered him as a "very good man" who "protected Jews".&lt;ref name="Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener"/&gt;

Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, in addition to the Polish communists, the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Labour Bund]], and Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony 18 May in the [[Holy See]], a commemoration was conducted at [[League of Nations]] [[Geneva]] headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from [[head of state|heads of state]] across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's [[Joseph Stalin]], Italy's [[Benito Mussolini]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], France's [[Albert Lebrun]] and [[Pierre-Étienne Flandin]], Austria's [[Wilhelm Miklas]], Japan's Emperor [[Hirohito]], and Britain's King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Ceremonies, [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and an enormous funeral were held; a [[funeral train]] toured Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHumphrey1936|Humphrey 1936]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNkwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;pgis=1 p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt; A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. In 1937, after a two-year display at [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] in [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]], and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rasos Cemetery]], where it remains.{{r|PolandGov}}{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=338}}

The 1937 relocation of his remains, made by his long-standing adversary [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Adam Sapieha]], then [[Archbishop of Krakow]], incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal.&lt;ref name="Crowds urge Poland to banish Archbishop; Pilsudski Legionnaires also Assail Catholic Church on the Removal of Marshal's Body"/&gt;{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA525 p. 525]}}

On 13 May 1935, in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]].{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=13}} Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland, the "second man in the state after the President".{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=5}} While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.{{r|JabStaw98_14}}

As the Polish government became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and conservative, the Rydz-Śmigły faction was opposed by that of the more moderate [[Ignacy Mościcki]], who remained President.{{r|JabStaw98_14}} After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the "President's Men", mostly civilians (the "Castle Group", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]]), and the "Marshal's Men" ("[[Piłsudski's colonels|Piłsudski's Colonels]]"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, some of this political division would survive within the [[Polish government in exile]].

[[File:Piłsudski statue and honour guards.jpg|thumb|right|[[Józef Piłsudski Monument in Warsaw (Piłsudski Square)|Statue of Piłsudski]] on Warsaw's [[Piłsudski Square]]—one of many [[statuary]] tributes throughout Poland]]
Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zagłoba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=6}}

In 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki [[eulogy|eulogized]] the Marshal: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life's travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit&amp;nbsp;... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect."&lt;ref name="Mość"&gt;Translation of Mościcki's speech from 1935. For Polish original online, see {{cite web|last=Kobos|first=Piotr M.|url=http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje43/text02p.htm|title=Skazuję Was Na Wielkość: Legenda Józefa Piłsudskiego|work=Zwoje (The Scrolls) no. 2 (43)|year=1992|accessdate=15 January 2008|language=pl|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222111243/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje43/text02p.htm|archivedate=22 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Piłsudski's effort to build an ''Intermarium'' federation of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a "[[Prometheism|Promethean]]" endeavor to "break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipate the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar [[Second Polish Republic]]. This began to change, however, particularly after [[de-Stalinization]] and the [[Polish October]] (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.{{r|Władyka+Żuławnik}}

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the 1991 disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]], Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero.&lt;ref name="Roshwald"/&gt; On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' adopted a resolution: "Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever."&lt;ref name="Sejm1995"/&gt;

While some of Piłsudski's political moves remain controversial—particularly the May 1926 Coup d'état, the [[Brest trial]]s (1931–32), the 1934 establishment of the [[Bereza Kartuska detention camp]], and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the [[national minorities]]{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=66–67}}—Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.

[[File:Pilsudski carricature by Szwajcer.PNG|thumb|upright|Contemporary [[caricature]] of Józef Piłsudski by [[Jerzy Szwajcer]]]]
Piłsudski has lent his name to several military units, including the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legions Infantry Division]] and [[armored train]] No. 51 ("''I Marszałek''"—"the First Marshal").&lt;ref name="PIBWL"/&gt;

Also named for Piłsudski have been [[Piłsudski's Mound]], one of four man-made [[mound]]s in [[Kraków]];&lt;ref name="mound"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute of America]], a New York City research center and museum on the modern [[history of Poland]];&lt;ref name="Institute"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw]];&lt;ref name="MON"/&gt; a passenger ship, {{MS|Piłsudski}}; a gunboat, {{ORP|Komendant Piłsudski}}; and a racehorse, ''[[Pilsudski (horse)|Pilsudski]]''. Virtually every Polish city has its "Piłsudski Street". (There are, by contrast, few if any streets named after Piłsudski's [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] arch-rival, [[Roman Dmowski]], even in Dmowski's old [[Greater Poland|Greater-Poland]] political stronghold). There are statues of Piłsudski in many Polish cities; the highest density of such [[statuary]] memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three in little more than a mile between the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's residence, and [[Piłsudski Square]].

He was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as [[Jacek Malczewski]] (1916) and [[Wojciech Kossak]] (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, ''[[Kasztanka]]'', 1928), as well as of numerous caricatures and photos.

Piłsudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, such as the 1922 novel ''Generał Barcz'' (General Barcz) by [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]] and the 2007 novel ''[[Ice (Dukaj novel)|Ice]]'' (''Lód'') by [[Jacek Dukaj]]. Poland's [[National Library of Poland|National Library]] lists over 500 publications related to Piłsudski;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alpha.bn.org.pl/search*pol/d?SEARCH=pi%B3sudski|title=Piłsudski (keyword)|work=National Library Of Poland|accessdate =15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[Library of Congress]], over 300.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress Online Catalog"/&gt; Piłsudski's life was the subject of a 2001 Polish television documentary, ''Marszałek Piłsudski'', directed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki.&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt;

==Descendants==
Both daughters of Marshal Piłsudski returned to Poland in 1990, after the fall of the Communist system. Jadwiga Piłsudska's daughter Joanna Jaraczewska returned to Poland in 1979. She married a Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|"Solidarity"]] activist [[Janusz Onyszkiewicz]] in a political prison in 1983. Both were very involved in the Polish struggle against communism between 1979 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lachowicz, Teofil |editor=Karkowska, Julita |title=Droga na szczyty |website=Nowy Dziennik |language=pl |url=http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/01-06-06/pp-03-03-02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723095525/http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/01-06-06/pp-03-03-02.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as "Józef Piłsudski". A few English sources translate his first name as "Joseph", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including "''Wiktor''", "''Mieczysław''" and "''Ziuk''" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marszałek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}}Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=139}} For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. The question of Piłsudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which Piłsudski regarded as his spiritual ''patria'' failed to reborn itself and finally ceased to exist in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. [[Timothy Snyder]], who calls him a "Polish-Lithuanian", notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Snyder|2004|p=70}}

{{Uncommon Unicode notice}}
'''Lydian script''' was used to write the [[Lydian language]]. Like other scripts of [[Anatolia]] in the [[Iron Age]], the Lydian alphabet is related to the East Greek alphabet, but it has unique features.

The first modern codification of the Lydian alphabet was made by [[Roberto Gusmani]] in 1964, in a combined [[lexicon]], grammar, and text collection.

Early Lydian texts were written either from left to right or from right to left. Later texts all run from right to left. One surviving text is in the bi-directional [[boustrophedon]] manner. Spaces separate words except in one text that uses dots instead. Lydian uniquely features a [[quotation mark]] in the shape of a [[right triangle]].

==Alphabet==
The Lydian alphabet&lt;ref&gt;Adiego (2007) page 769.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Everson (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; is closely related to the other [[alphabets of Asia Minor]] as well as to the [[Greek alphabet]]. It contains letters for 26 sounds. Some are represented by more than one symbol, which is considered one "letter." Unlike the [[Carian script|Carian alphabet]], which had an ''f'' derived from [[Φ]], the Lydian ''f'' has the peculiar ''8'' shape also found in the [[Etruscan alphabet]].

 | title       = A Mantra Chant
 | description = A mantra chant set to Indian classical music (6 minutes 19 seconds)&lt;ref&gt;This is a Buddhist chant. The words in Pali are: Buddham saranam gacchami, Dhammam saranam gacchami, Sangham saranam gacchami. The equivalent words in Sanskrit, according to [[Georg Feuerstein]], are: Buddham saranam gacchâmi, Dharmam saranam gacchâmi, Sangham saranam gacchâmi. The literal meaning: I go for refuge in knowledge, I go for refuge in teachings, I go for refuge in community. In some traditions of Hinduism, the mantra is expanded to seven lines, with first word of the additional lines being Satyam (truth), Ahimsam (non-violence), Yogam (yoga) and Ekam (one universal life). For example, an additional line with Ahimsam is: Ahimsam saranam gacchâmi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest mantras were composed in [[Vedic Sanskrit]] by Hindus in India, and are at least 3000 years old.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Mantras now exist in various schools of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=gfeu/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nesbitt, Eleanor M.

The use, structure, function, importance, and types of mantras vary according to the school and philosophy of Hinduism and Buddhism. Mantras serve a central role in [[tantra]].&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;&lt;ref name="Teun Goudriaan 1981"&gt;Teun Goudriaan (1981), Hindu Tantric and Śākta Literature, in A History of Indian Literature, Vol. 2, {{ISBN|978-3447020916}}, Chapter VIII&lt;/ref&gt; In this school, mantras are considered to be a sacred formula and a deeply personal ritual, effective only after initiation. In other schools of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism or Sikhism, initiation is not a requirement.&lt;ref name=boyce/&gt;&lt;ref name=halper&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantras come in many forms, including ''ṛc'' (verses from the Rigveda for example) and ''sāman'' (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example).&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; They are typically melodic, mathematically structured meters, believed to be resonant with numinous qualities. At its simplest, the word [[Om|ॐ (Aum, Om)]] serves as a mantra. In more sophisticated forms, mantras are melodic phrases with spiritual interpretations such as a human longing for truth, reality, light, immortality, peace, love, knowledge, and action.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=halper/&gt; Some mantras have no literal meaning, yet are musically uplifting and spiritually meaningful.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

==Etymology and origins==
[[Image:Mantras written on a rock in nepal.jpg|thumb|Mantras written on a rock near [[Namche Bazaar]] [[Nepal]]]]
The Sanskrit word ''{{IAST|[[:wikt:mantra|mantra-]]}}'' (m.; also n. ''mantram'' in Tamil, the Sanskrit word 'Mantra' derived from Tamil word 'Mantram') consists of the root ''man-'' "to think" (also in ''[[:wikt:manas|manas]]'' "mind") and the suffix ''-tra'', designating tools or instruments, hence a literal translation would be "instrument of thought".&lt;ref&gt;Macdonell, Arthur A., ''A Sanskrit Grammar for Students'' § 182.1.b, p. 162(Oxford University Press, 3rd edition, 1927).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, W.D., ''Sanskrit Grammar'' § 1185.c, p. 449(New York, 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43136-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars&lt;ref name=jgtim&gt;[[Jan Gonda]] (1963), The Indian Mantra, Oriens, Vol. 16, pages 244–297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=staal&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt; consider mantras to be older than 1000 BC. By the middle [[Vedas|Vedic period]]—1000 BC to 500 BC—claims [[Frits Staal]], mantras in Hinduism had developed into a blend of art and science.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

The Chinese translation is {{lang-zh|t=眞言, 真言|p=zhenyan|l=true words|labels=no}}, the Japanese [[on'yomi]] reading of the Chinese being ''[[shingon]]'' (which is also used as the proper name for the prominent esoteric [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon sect]]).

According to Bernfried Schlerath, the concept of ''sātyas mantras'' is found in Indo-Iranian [[Yasna]] 31.6 and the [[Rigveda]], where it is considered structured thought in conformity with the reality or poetic (religious) formulas associated with inherent fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schlerath|first=Bernfried|year=1987| chapter="Aša: Avestan Aša"| title=Encyclopaedia Iranica| volume=2 | location=New York|publisher=Routledge |pages=694–696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mantras are neither unique to Hinduism nor other Indian religions such as Buddhism; similar creative constructs developed in Asian and Western traditions as well.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Mantras, suggests [[Frits Staal]], may be older than language.

==Definition==

There is no generally accepted definition of mantra.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 3-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Renou has defined mantra as a thought.&lt;ref&gt;T Renou (1946), ''Littérature Sanskrite'', Paris, page 74&lt;/ref&gt; Mantras are structured formulae of thoughts, claims Silburn.&lt;ref&gt;L. Silburn (1955), Instant et cause, Paris, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Farquhar concludes that mantras are a religious thought, prayer, sacred utterance, but also believed to be a spell or weapon of supernatural power.&lt;ref&gt;J. Farquhar (1920), An outline of the religious literature of India, Oxford, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Zimmer defines mantra as a verbal instrument to produce something in one’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1946), Myths and symbols in Indian art and civilization, {{ISBN|9780691017785}}, Washington DC, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; Bharati defines mantra, in the context of the Tantric school of Hinduism, to be a combination of mixed genuine and quasi-morphemes arranged in conventional patterns, based on codified esoteric traditions, passed on from a guru to a disciple through prescribed initiation.&lt;ref name=bharati&gt;Agehananda Bharati (1965), The Tantric Tradition, London: Rider and Co., {{ISBN|0-8371-9660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]], a widely cited scholar on Indian mantras,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; defines mantra as general name for the verses, formulas or sequence of words in prose which contain praise, are believed to have religious, magical or spiritual efficiency, which are meditated upon, recited, muttered or sung in a ritual, and which are collected in the methodically arranged ancient texts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jgvl&gt;Jan Gonda (1975), Vedic Literature (Samhitäs and Brähmanas), (HIL I.I) Wiesbaden: OH; also Selected Studies, (4 volumes), Leiden: E. J. Brill&lt;/ref&gt; There is no universally applicable uniform definition of mantra because mantras are used in different religions, and within each religion in different schools of philosophy. In some schools of Hinduism for example, suggests Gonda, a mantra is sakti (power) to the devotee in the form of formulated and expressed thought.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt; Staal clarifies that mantras are not rituals, they are what is recited or chanted during a ritual.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

In Oxford Living Dictionary mantra is defined as a word or sound repeated to aid concentration in meditation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mantra "Mantra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107170106/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mantra |date=7 November 2016 }}. ''Oxford Living Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge Dictionary provides two different definitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mantra "Mantra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629002205/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/mantra |date=29 June 2017 }}. ''Cambridge Dictionary.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first refers to Hinduism and Buddhism: a word or sound that is believed to have a special spiritual power. The second definition is more general: a word or phrase that is often repeated and expresses a particularly strong belief. For instance, a football team can choose individual words as their own "mantra."

==The literal meaning of mantras==
There is a long history of scholarly disagreement on the meaning of mantras and whether they are instruments of mind, as implied by the etymological origin of the word ''mantra''. One school suggests mantras are mostly meaningless sound constructs, while the other holds them to be mostly meaningful linguistic instruments of mind.&lt;ref name="halper"/&gt; Both schools agree that mantras have melody and a well designed mathematical precision in their construction and that their influence on the reciter and listener is similar to that is observed in people around the world listening to their beloved music that is devoid of words.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=staal/&gt;

Staal&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; presents a non-linguistic view of mantras. He suggests that verse mantras are metered and harmonized to mathematical precision (for example, in the ''viharanam'' technique), which resonate, but a lot of them are a hodgepodge of meaningless constructs such as are found in folk music around the world. Staal cautions that there are many mantras that can be translated and do have spiritual meaning and philosophical themes central to Hinduism, but that does not mean all mantras have a literal meaning. He further notes that even when mantras do not have a literal meaning, they do set a tone and ambiance in the ritual as they are recited, and thus have a straightforward and uncontroversial ritualistic meaning.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; The sounds may lack literal meaning, but they can have an effect. He compares mantras to bird songs, that have the power to communicate, yet do not have a literal meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Frits Staal (1985), Mantras and Bird Songs, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 105, No. 3, Indological Studies, pages 549–558&lt;/ref&gt; On that ''saman'' category of Hindu mantras, which Staal described as resembling the arias of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s oratorios and other European classics, he notes that these mantras have musical structure, but they almost always are completely different from anything in the syntax of natural languages. Mantras are literally meaningless, yet musically meaningful to Staal.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''saman'' chant mantras were transmitted, from one Hindu generation to next, verbally for over 1000 years, but never written, and a feat suggests Staal that was made possible by the strict mathematical principles used in constructing the mantras. These ''saman'' chant mantras are also mostly meaningless, cannot be literally translated as Sanskrit or any Indian language, but nevertheless are beautiful in their resonant themes, variations, inversions, and distribution.&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; They draw the devotee in. Staal is not the first person to view Hindu mantras in this manner. The ancient Hindu Vedic ritualist Kautsa was one of the earliest scholars to note that mantras are meaningless; their function is phonetic and syntactic, not semantic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass, page 112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

They admit Staal's observation that many mantras do contain bits and pieces of meaningless jargon, but they question what language or text doesn't. The presence of an abracadabra bit does not necessarily imply the entire work is meaningless. Alper lists numerous mantras that have philosophical themes, moral principles, a call to virtuous life, and even mundane petitions. He suggests that from a set of millions of mantras, the devotee chooses some mantras voluntarily, thus expressing that speaker's intention, and the audience for that mantra is that speaker's chosen spiritual entity. Mantras deploy the language of spiritual expression, they are religious instruments, and that is what matters to the devotee. A mantra creates a feeling in the practicing person. It has an emotive numinous effect, it mesmerizes, it defies expression, and it creates sensations that are by definition private and at the heart of all religions and spiritual phenomena.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=bharati/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, page 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of Hindu mantras===
During the early Vedic period, claims Staal,&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Vedic poets became fascinated by the inspirational power of poems, metered verses, and music. They referred to them with the root ''dhi-'', which evolved into ''dhyana'' (meditation) of Hinduism, and the language used to start and assist this process manifested as a mantra. By the middle vedic period (1000 BC to 500 BC), mantras were derived from all vedic compositions. They included ''ṛc'' (verses from Rigveda for example), ''sāman'' (musical chants from the Sāmaveda for example), ''yajus'' (a muttered formula from the yajurveda for example), and ''nigada'' (a loudly spoken yajus). During the Hindu Epics period and after, mantras multiplied in many ways and diversified to meet the needs and passions of various schools of Hinduism. Mantras took a center stage in the Tantric school,&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1996), Rituals and Mantras, Rules without meaning, {{ISBN|978-8120814127}}, Motilal Banarsidass, Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt; which posited that each mantra (''bijas'') is a deity;&lt;ref name="Teun Goudriaan 1981"/&gt; it is this distinct school of Hinduism and 'each mantra is a deity' reasoning that led to the perception that some Hindus have tens of millions of gods. Mantra came to mean in some Hindu schools as ‘that which protects our mind’ or “Manah traayate iti Mantraaha’.

===Function and structure of Hindu mantras===
One function of mantras is to solemnize and ratify rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1963), The Indian Mantra, Oriens, Vol. 16, pages 258–259&lt;/ref&gt; Each mantra, in Vedic rituals, is coupled with an act. According to ''Apastamba Srauta Sutra'', each ritual act is accompanied by one mantra, unless the ''Sutra'' explicitly marks that one act corresponds to several mantras. According to Gonda,&lt;ref&gt;Jan Gonda (1980), Vedic Ritual: The non-Solemn Rites, Amsterdam; see also Jan Gonda (1985), The Ritual Functions and Significance of Grasses in the Religion of the Veda, Amsterdam; Jan Gonda (1977), The Ritual Sutras, Wiesbaden&lt;/ref&gt; and others,&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1962), History of Dharmasastra, Volume V, part II&lt;/ref&gt; there is a connection and rationale between a Vedic mantra and each Vedic ritual act that accompanies it. In these cases, the function of mantras was to be an instrument of ritual efficacy for the priest, and a tool of instruction for a ritual act for others.

Over time, as the Puranas and Epics were composed, the concepts of worship, virtues and spirituality evolved in Hinduism. Religions such as Jainism and Buddhism branched off, and new schools were founded, each continuing to develop and refine its own mantras. In Hinduism, suggests Alper,&lt;ref&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, see Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; the function of mantras shifted from the quotidian to redemptive. In other words,&lt;ref name=ha78&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, pages 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; in Vedic times, mantras were recited a practical, quotidian goal as intention, such as requesting a deity's help in the discovery of lost cattle, cure of illness, succeeding in competitive sport or journey away from home. The literal translation of Vedic mantras suggests that the function of mantra, in these cases, was to cope with the uncertainties and dilemmas of daily life. In a later period of Hinduism,&lt;ref name=hac10&gt;Harvey Alper (1989), Understanding Mantras, {{ISBN|81-208-0746-4}}, State University of New York, Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; mantras were recited with a transcendental redemptive goal as intention, such as escape from the cycle of life and rebirth, forgiveness for bad karma, and experiencing a spiritual connection with the god. The function of mantras, in these cases, was to cope with the human condition as a whole. According to Alper,&lt;ref name="halper"/&gt; redemptive spiritual mantras opened the door for mantras where every part need not have a literal meaning, but together their resonance and musical quality assisted the transcendental spiritual process. Overall, explains Alper, using Śivasūtra mantras as an example, Hindu mantras have philosophical themes and are metaphorical with social dimension and meaning; in other words, they are a spiritual language and instrument of thought.&lt;ref name=hac10/&gt;

According to Staal,&lt;ref name=staal/&gt; Hindu mantras may be spoken aloud, ''anirukta'' (not enunciated), ''upamsu'' (inaudible), or ''manasa'' (not spoken, but recited in the mind). In ritual use, mantras are often silent instruments of meditation.

===Examples===
The most basic mantra is ''Om'', which in Hinduism is known as the "pranava mantra," the source of all mantras. The [[Hindu philosophy]] behind this is the premise that before existence and beyond existence is only One reality, Brahma, and the first manifestation of Brahma expressed as Om. For this reason, Om is considered as a foundational idea and reminder, and thus is prefixed and suffixed to all Hindu [[prayer]]s. While some mantras may invoke individual gods or principles, fundamental mantras, like the '[[Shanti Mantra]], the '[[Gayatri Mantra]]' and others all ultimately focus on the One reality.

'''Tantric school'''

In the Tantric school the universe is sound.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, L. (2015). Flotation: A Guide for Sensory Deprivation, Relaxation, &amp; Isolation Tanks. {{ISBN|1329173759}}, {{ISBN|978-1329173750}}, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The supreme (para) brings forth existence through the Word (Shabda). Creation consists of vibrations at various frequencies and amplitudes giving rise to the phenomena of the world.

Buhnemann notes that deity mantras are an essential part of Tantric compendia. The tantric mantras vary in their structure and length. Mala mantras are those mantras which have an enormous number of syllables. In contrast, bija mantras are one-syllabled, typically ending in [[anusvara]] (a simple nasal sound).  These are derived from the name of a deity; for example, [[Durga]] yields ''dum'' and [[Ganesha]] yields ''gam''. Bija mantras are prefixed and appended to other mantras, thereby creating complex mantras. In the tantric school, these mantras are believed to have supernatural powers, and they are transmitted by a preceptor to a disciple in an initiation ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Gudrun Bühnemann, Selecting and perfecting mantras in Hindu tantrism, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies / Volume 54 / Issue 02 / June 1991, pages 292–306&lt;/ref&gt; Tantric mantras found a significant audience and adaptations in medieval India, Hindu Southeast Asia and numerous Asian countries with Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (2000), Tantra in Practice, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691057798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Majumdar and other scholars&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Herbert]], Spiritualite hindoue, Paris 1947, {{ISBN|978-2226032980}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest mantras are central to the Tantric school, with numerous functions. From initiating and emancipating a tantric devotee to worshiping manifested forms of the divine. From enabling heightened sexual energy in the male and the female to acquiring supernormal psychological and spiritual power. From preventing evil influences to exorcizing demons, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattāchārya, Majumdar and Majumdar, Principles of Tantra, {{ISBN|978-8185988146}}, see Introduction by Barada Kanta Majumdar&lt;/ref&gt; These claimed functions and other aspects of the tantric mantra are a subject of controversy among scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks (1990), The Secret of the Three Cities: An Introduction to Hindu Sakta Tantrism, University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tantra usage  is not unique to Hinduism: it is also found in Buddhism both inside and outside India.&lt;ref&gt;David Gordon White (Editor) (2001), Tantra in practice (Vol. 8), Motilal Banarsidass, Princeton Readings in Religions, {{ISBN|978-8120817784}}, Chapters 21 and 31&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mantra japa'''
{{Main|Japa}}
Mantra ''japa'' is a practice of repetitively uttering the same mantra for an auspicious number of times, the most popular being [[108 (number)|108]], and sometimes just 5, 10, 28 or 1008.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmw&gt;Monier Monier-Williams (1893), Indian Wisdom, Luzac &amp; Co., London, page 245-246, see text and footnote&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Hinduism, Margaret and James Stutley (Munshiram Manoharlal Publishers) 2002, p.126&lt;/ref&gt; ''Japa'' is found in personal prayer or meditative efforts of some Hindus, as well during formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] (group prayers).  Japa is assisted by [[Japa mala|malas]] (bead necklaces) containing 108 beads and a head bead (sometimes referred to as the '[[Mount Meru (Mythology)|meru]]', or '[[guru]]' bead); the devotee using his/her fingers to count each bead as he/she repeats the chosen mantra. Having reached 108 repetitions, if he/she wishes to continue another cycle of mantras, the devotee turns the mala around without crossing the head bead and repeats the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Radha |first=Swami Sivananda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BFfxHiQb3HAC |title=Mantras: Words of Power |publisher=Timeless Books |location=Canada |isbn=978-1-932018-10-3 |page=54 |quote=Mantra Yoga (chanting), Japa Yoga: Vaikhari Japa (speaking), Upamsu Japa (whispering or humming), Manasika Japa (mental repetition), [[RamaKoti|Likhita Japa]] (writing) |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japa-yajna is claimed to be most effective if the mantra is repeated silently in mind (manasah).&lt;ref name=mmw/&gt;

According to this school, any [[shloka]] from holy Hindu texts like the Vedas, [[Upanishads]], [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Yoga Sutra]], even the [[Mahabharata]], [[Ramayana]], [[Durga saptashati]] or [[Chandi]] is a mantra, thus can be part of the ''japa'', repeated to achieve a numinous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Some very common mantras, called Nama japa, are: "Om Namah ''(name of deity)''"; for example, ''[[Om Namah Shivaya]]'' or ''Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya Namah'' (Om and salutations to Lord Shiva); ''Om Namo [[Narayana]]ya'' or ''Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevãya'' (Om and salutations to Lord Vishnu);  ''Om Shri Ganeshaya Namah'' (Om and salutations to Shri [[Ganesha]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meditation and Mantras, Swami Vishnu-Devananda (Motilal Banarsidass Publishers) 1981, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Hinduism, p.271; Some of the major books which are used as reference for Mantra Shaastra are: Parasurama Kalpa Sutra; Shaarada Tilakam; Lakshmi Tantra; Prapanchasara&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dharmasāstra'' claims [[Gayatri Mantra|Gāyatri mantra]] derived from Rig Veda verse 3.62.10, and the [[Purusha sukta|Purușasūkta]] mantra from Rig Veda verse 10.90 are most auspicious mantras for ''japa'' at sunrise and sunset; it is claimed to purify the mind and spirit.&lt;ref name=jgtim/&gt;

'''Shiva sutra mantras'''

Apart from [[Shiva Sutras]], which originated from Shiva's [[tandava]] dance, the [[Shiva Sutras of Vasugupta]]&lt;ref&gt;Siva Sutras: The Yoga of Supreme Identity, by Vasugupta, translation, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi, 1979.  {{cite web |url=http://bibleoteca.narod.ru/tantra/Jaideva_Singh_Siva_Sutras.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 March 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421033850/http://bibleoteca.narod.ru/tantra/Jaideva_Singh_Siva_Sutras.pdf |archivedate=21 April 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; are a collection of seventy-seven aphorisms that form the foundation of the tradition of spiritual mysticism known as [[Kashmir Shaivism]]. They are attributed to the sage [[Vasugupta]] of the 9th century C.E. ''Sambhavopaya'' (1-1 to 1–22), ''Saktopaya'' (2-1 to 2–10) and ''Anavopaya'' (3-1 to 3–45) are the main sub-divisions, three means of achieving God consciousness, of which the main technique of ''Saktopaya'' is a mantra. But "mantra" in this context does not mean incantation or muttering of some sacred formula. The word "mantra" is used here in its etymological signification.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, G.L. (1995). ''Sonic Theology: Hinduism and Sacred Sound.'' Motilal Banarsidass Publ. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; That which saves one by pondering over the light of Supreme I-consciousness is a mantra. The divine Supreme I-consciousness is the dynamo of all the mantras. ''Deha'' or body has been compared to wood, "mantra" has been compared to ''arani''—a piece of wood used for kindling fire by friction; ''prana'' has been compared to fire. ''Sikha'' or flame has been compared to ''atma'' (Self); ''ambara'' or sky has been compared to Shiva. When prana is kindled by means of mantra used as arani, fire in the form of ''udana'' arises in ''susumna'', and then just as flame arises out of kindled fire and gets dissolved in the sky, so also ''atma'' (Self) like a flame having burnt down the fuel of the body, gets absorbed in Shiva.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J. (2012). ''Siva Sutras: The Yoga of Supreme Identity.'' {{ISBN|8120804074}}, {{ISBN|978-8120804074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transcendental Meditation'''
{{main|Transcendental Meditation}}

The [[Transcendental Meditation technique|Transcendental Meditation]] technique, also known as 'TM', uses mantras that are assigned to the practitioner to be used as thought sound only, not chanted,  without connection to any meaning or idea.&lt;ref&gt;Shear Jonathon (Editor), ''The Experience of Meditation: Experts Introduce the Major Traditions'',pg.28.Paragon House. St Paul, MN.,2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual exercises of [[Surat Shabd Yoga|Surat Shabda Yoga]] include [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|simran]] (repetition, particularly silent repetition of a mantra given at initiation), dhyan (concentration, viewing, or contemplation, particularly on the Inner Master), and [[bhajan]] (listening to the inner sounds of the Shabda or the Shabda Master).

Repetition of a "mantram" (i.e., mantra) or holy name is Point 2 in the eight-point [[Passage Meditation]] program taught by [[Eknath Easwaran]], who recommended using a mantram drawn from a faith tradition, east or west. The mantram is to be used frequently throughout the day, at opportune moments.&lt;ref&gt;In Hinduism, frequent repetition at opportune moments is a common type of [[japa]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mantram Handbook|This method of mantram repetition]], and the larger program, was developed for use in any major faith tradition, or outside all traditions.&lt;ref name=mhand&gt;[[Eknath Easwaran]] (2008).

==Jainism==
The concept of mantras in [[Jainism]] is not focused on material aspects, rather mainly deals with seeking forgiveness, praising [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arihant]]s, or deities like Nakoda, Padmavati, Manibhadra, [[Saraswati]], [[Lakshmi]], and others.{{cn|date=April 2015}} Yet some mantras are claimed to enhance intellect, prosperity, wealth or fame. There are many mantras in [[Jainism]]; most of them are in [[Sanskrit]] or [[Prakrit]], but in the last few centuries, some have been composed in [[Hindi]] or [[Gujarati language|Gujrati]] languages. Mantras, couplets, are either chanted or sung, either aloud or by merely moving lips or in silence by thought.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaina.org jaina.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160516203809/http://www.jaina.org/ |date=16 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navkar Mantra===
Some examples of Jain mantras are [[Bhaktamara Stotra]], [[Uvasagharam Stotra]], etc. But the greatest is said to be the Namokar or [[Navkar Mantra]].{{cn|date=April 2015}}

The Navkar Mantra (literally, "Nine Line Mantra") is a central mantra in [[Jainism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[:Category:Jain mantras|Jain mantras]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The initial 5 lines consist of salutations to various sanctified souls, and the latter 4 lines are explanatory in nature, highlighting the benefits and greatness of this mantra.

===Micchami Dukkadam===
In [[Jainism]], [[forgiveness]] is one of the main virtues to be cultivated. ''Kṣamāpanā'' or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of ''[[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Varni, Jinendra; Ed. Prof. Sagarmal Jain, Translated Justice T.K. Tukol and Dr. K.K. Dixit (1993). Samaṇ Suttaṁ. New Delhi: Bhagwan Mahavir memorial Samiti. verse 84&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;In the ''[[pratikramana]]'' prayer, Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ''ekindriyas'' or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =Collected Papers on Jaina Studies | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | year =2000 | location =Delhi | isbn =81-208-1691-9 }} p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase, ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ.'' ''Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is a Prakrit phrase literally meaning "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless."&lt;ref&gt;Chapple. C.K.

===Forgiveness===
In their daily prayers and [[samayika]], Jains recite the following ''Iryavahi sutra'' in Prakrit, seeking forgiveness from literally all creatures while involved in routine activities:&lt;ref&gt;Translated from Prakrit by Nagin J. shah and Madhu Sen (1993) ''Concept of Pratikramana'' Ahmedabad: Gujarat Vidyapith pp.25–26&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
May you, O Revered One, voluntarily permit me. I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking. I honour your permission. I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them. I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking, coming and going, treading on a living organism, seeds, green grass, dew drops, ant hills, moss, live water, live earth, spider web and others. I seek forgiveness from all these living beings, be they one sensed, two sensed, three sensed, four sensed or five sensed, which I may have kicked, covered with dust, rubbed with earth, collided with other, turned upside down, tormented, frightened, shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives. (By confessing) may I be absolved of all these sins.

===Theravada===
According to [[Jack Kornfield]], 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The use of mantra or the repetition of certain phrases in Pali is a highly common form of meditation in the Theravada tradition. Simple mantras use repetition of the Buddha’s name, “Buddho,” [as “Buddho” is actually a title rather than a name] or use the “Dhamma,” or the “Sangha,” the community, as mantra words. Other used mantras are directed toward developing loving kindness. Some mantras direct attention to the process of change by repeating the Pali phrase that means “everything changes,” while other mantras are used to develop equanimity with phrases that would be translated, “let go.”

Very often mantra practice is combined with breathing meditation so that one recites a mantra simultaneously with in-breath and out-breath to help develop tranquility and concentration. Mantra meditation is especially popular among the lay people. Like other basic concentration exercises, it can be used simply to the mind, or it can be the basis for an insight practice where the mantra becomes the focus of observation of how life unfolds, or an aid in surrendering and letting go."&lt;ref&gt;Kornfield, j. Modern Buddhist masters, pg 311.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "Buddho" mantra is widespread in the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] and was taught by [[Ajahn Chah]] and his students.&lt;ref&gt;Ajahn Chah, Clarity of Insight, {{cite web |url=http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Clarity_Insight1.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602022820/http://www.ajahnchah.org/book/Clarity_Insight1.php |archivedate=2 June 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another popular mantra in [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] is ''Samma-Araham'', referring to the Buddha who has 'perfectly' (''samma'') attained 'perfection in the Buddhist sense' (''[[Arhat|araham]]''), used in [[Dhammakaya meditation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/pali|title=The Pali-English dictionary|date=1993|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=8120811445|edition=1.

In the [[Tantric Theravada]] tradition of Southeast Asia, mantras are central to their method of meditation. Popular mantras in this tradition include ''Namo Buddhaya'' ("Homage to the Buddha") and ''Araham'' ("Worthy One").

===Non-esoteric Buddhism===
In Buddhism in China and Vietnam, ten small mantras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amtfamtf.net/nfgy/sxz.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324051507/http://www.amtfamtf.net/nfgy/sxz.htm |archivedate=24 March 2007 |title=Pinyin of ten mantras |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=24 March 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; were finalized by the monk Yulin (玉琳國師), a teacher of the [[Shunzhi Emperor]] for monks, nuns, and laity to chant in the morning.

Along with the ten mantras, the [[Nīlakantha dhāranī|Great Compassion Mantra]], the [[Shurangama Mantra]] of the [[Shurangama Sutra|Shurangama]], [[Heart Sutra]] and [[Nianfo|various forms of nianfo]] are also chanted. The Shurangama Mantra may be the longest mantra. There are [[Thai people|Thai]] Buddhist [[amulet]] [[Katha_(storytelling_format)|katha]]: that is, mantras to be recited while holding an amulet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mir.com.my/leofoo/Thai-amulets/Chris_Tam_katha_libary/index.htm |title=A mini reference archive library of compiled Buddhist Katha/Katta |publisher=Mir.com.my |date= |accessdate=17 July 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626202226/http://www.mir.com.my/leofoo/Thai-amulets/Chris_Tam_katha_libary/index.htm |archivedate=26 June 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shingon Buddhism===
[[Kūkai]] (774–835), a noted Buddhist monk, advanced a general theory of [[language]] based on his analysis of two forms of Buddhist [[ritual]] language: ''[[dharani]]'' (dhāra.nī) and ''mantra''. Mantra is restricted to [[esoteric]] Buddhist practice whereas dharani is found in both esoteric and [[exoteric]] [[ritual]]. Dharanis for instance are found in the [[Heart Sutra]]. The term "[[shingon]]" (lit. ''true word'') is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese term for a mantra, ''zhēnyán''.

The word ''dharani'' derives from a Sanskrit root ''dh.r'' which means to hold or maintain. [[Ryuichi Abe]] suggests that it is generally understood as a [[mnemonic device]] which encapsulates the meaning of a section or chapter of a [[sutra]]. Dharanis are also considered to protect the one who chants them from malign influences and calamities.

The term ''mantra'' is traditionally said to be derived from two roots: ''man'', to [[Thought|think]]; and the action-oriented &lt;!--this doesn't make sense without more context: (k.rt)--&gt; suffix ''-tra''. Thus a mantra can be considered to be a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] device for deepening one's thought or in the Buddhist context for developing the [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightened]] [[mind]]. They have also been used as [[magic spell]]s for purposes such as attaining [[wealth]] and long life and eliminating enemies. In daily living, many thought the pronunciation of the mantra was not important to take its effect and the expected effect, may not happen because of fixed karma (定業), or because there appears a better way to solve the situation.

The distinction between dharani and mantra is hard to make. We can say that all mantras are dharanis but that not all dharanis are mantras. Mantras do tend to be shorter. Both tend to contain some unintelligible [[Phonics|phonic]] fragments such as Om, or Hu.m, which is perhaps why some people consider them to be essentially meaningless. Kūkai made mantra a special class of dharani which showed that every [[syllable]] of a dharani was a manifestation of the true nature of [[reality]]&amp;nbsp;– in Buddhist terms that all sound is a manifestation of [[shunyata]] or emptiness of self-nature. Thus rather than being devoid of meaning, Kūkai suggests that dharanis are in fact saturated with meaning&amp;nbsp;– every syllable is symbolic on multiple levels.

One of Kūkai's distinctive contributions was to take this symbolic association even further by saying that there is no essential difference between the syllables of mantras and [[sacred text]]s, and those of ordinary language. If one understood the workings of mantra, then any sounds could be a representative of ultimate reality. This emphasis on sounds was one of the drivers for Kūkai's championing of the phonetic writing system, the [[kana]], which was adopted in Japan around the time of Kūkai. He is generally credited with the invention of the kana, but there is apparently some doubt about this story amongst [[scholar]]s.

This mantra-based theory of language had a powerful effect on Japanese thought and society which up until Kūkai's time had been dominated by imported [[China|Chinese]] culture of thought, particularly in the form of the Classical Chinese language which was used in the court and amongst the literati, and [[Confucianism]] which was the dominant political [[ideology]]. In particular, Kūkai was able to use this new theory of [[language]] to create links between indigenous Japanese culture and Buddhism. For instance, he made a link between the Buddha Mahavairocana and the [[Shinto]] sun Goddess [[Amaterasu]]. Since the emperors were thought to be descended form Amaterasu, Kūkai had found a powerful connection here that linked the emperors with the Buddha, and also in finding a way to integrate [[Shinto]] with Buddhism, something that had not happened with Confucianism. Buddhism then became essentially an indigenous religion in a way that Confucianism had not. And it was through language and mantra that this connection was made. Kūkai helped to elucidate what mantra is in a way that had not been done before: he addresses the fundamental questions of what a text is, how signs function, and above all, what language is. In this, he covers some of the same ground as modern day [[Structuralism|Structuralists]] and others scholars of language, although he comes to very different conclusions.

In this system of thought, all sounds are said to originate from "a"&amp;nbsp;– which is the short ''a'' sound in f&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ther. For esoteric Buddhism "a" has a special function because it is associated with Shunyata or the idea that no thing exists in its own right, but is contingent upon causes and conditions. (See [[Dependent origination]]) In Sanskrit "a" is a prefix which changes the meaning of a word into its opposite, so "vidya" is understanding, and "avidya" is ignorance (the same arrangement is also found in many [[Greek language|Greek]] words, like e.g. "atheism" vs. "theism" and "apathy" vs. "pathos"). The letter a is both visualised in the [[Siddhaṃ script|Siddham]] script and pronounced in rituals and [[meditation]] practices. In the [[Mahavairocana Sutra]] which is central to [[Shingon Buddhism]] it says: Thanks to the original vows of the Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s, a [[Miracle|miraculous]] force resides in the mantras, so that by pronouncing them one acquires merit without limits". [in Conze, p.&amp;nbsp;183]

A mantra is [[Kuji-kiri]] in [[Shugendo]]. The word [[Shingon]] means mantra.&lt;ref name="Law1995p173"/&gt; According to Alex Wayman and Ryujun Tajima, Shingon means "true speech", has the sense of "an exact mantra which reveals the truth of the dharmas", and is the path of mantras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex Wayman|author2=Ryujun Tajima|title=The Enlightenment of Vairocana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rlhQwTAYR-oC|year=1992|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ.|isbn=978-81-208-0640-5|pages=225, 254, 293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of writing mantras, and copying texts as a spiritual practice, became very refined in Japan, and some of these are written in the Japanese script and [[Siddhaṃ script|Siddham]] script of Sanskrit, recited in either language. There are thirteen mantras used in Shingon-Buddhism, each dedicated to a major deity. The mantra for each deity name in Japanese, its equivalent name in Sanskrit, a transliteration of mantra, and the Japanese version in Shingon tradition are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shingon.org/ritual/daily.html The Koyasan Shingon-shu Lay Practitioner's Daily Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502064538/http://www.shingon.org/ritual/daily.html |date=2 May 2006 }}, Shingon Buddhist International Institute (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indo-Tibetan Buddhism===
[[Mantrayana]] (Sanskrit), which may be translated as "way of the mantra", was the original self-identifying name of those that have come to be determined '[[Nyingmapa]]'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The Nyingmapa which may be rendered as "those of the ancient way", a name constructed due to the genesis of the [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] "fresh", "new" traditions. Mantrayana has developed into a synonym of Vajrayana.

Noted translator of Buddhist texts [[Edward Conze]] (1904–1979) distinguishes three periods in the Buddhist use of mantra.

Initially, according to Conze, like their fellow Indians, Buddhists used mantra as protective spells to ward off malign influences. Despite a [[Vinaya]] rule which forbids monks engaging in the Brahminical practice of chanting mantras for material gain, there is a number of protective mantras for a group of ascetic monks. However, even at this early stage, there is perhaps something more than [[animism|animistic magic]] at work. Particularly in the case of the [[Ratana Sutta]] the efficacy of the verses seems to be related to the concept of "[[truth]]". Each verse of the sutta ends with "by the virtue of this truth may there be happiness".

Conze notes that later mantras were used more to guard the spiritual life of the chanter, and sections on mantras began to be included in some [[Mahayana]] sutras such as the [[White Lotus Sutra]], and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]]. The scope of protection also changed in this time. In the [[Sutra of Golden Light]] the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Four Great Kings]] promise to exercise sovereignty over the different classes of demigods, to protect the whole of Jambudvipa (the Indian subcontinent), to protect monks who proclaim the sutra, and to protect kings who patronise the monks who proclaim the sutra. The apotheosis of this type of approach is the [[Nichiren]] school of Buddhism that was founded in the 13th century Japan, and which distilled many previously complex Buddhist practices down to the [[veneration]] of the [[Lotus Sutra]] through a recitation of the daimoku: "[[Nam myoho renge kyo]]" which translates as "Homage to the Lotus Sutra".

The third period began, according to Conze, in about the 7th century, to take center stage and become a vehicle for salvation in their own right. [[Tantra]] started to gain momentum in the 6th and 7th century, with specifically Buddhist forms appearing as early as 300CE. ''Mantrayana'' was an early name for what is now more commonly known as ''[[Vajrayana]]'', which gives us a hint as to the place of mantra in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. The aim of Vajrayana practice is to give the practitioner a direct experience of reality, of things as they really are. Mantras function as [[symbol]]s of that reality, and different mantras are different aspects of that reality&amp;nbsp;– for example wisdom or compassion. Mantras are often associated with a particular deity, one famous exception being the [[Heart Sutra#Mantra|Prajnaparamita mantra]] associated with the [[Heart Sutra]]. One of the key Vajrayana strategies for bringing about a direct experience of reality is to engage the entire psycho-physical organism in the practices. In one Buddhist analysis, the person consists of 'body, speech and mind' (refer: [[Three Vajra]]). So a typical sadhana or [[meditation]] practice might include [[mudra]]s, or symbolic [[hand gesture]]s; the recitations of mantras; as well as the visualisation of [[Heaven|celestial]] beings and visualising the letters of the mantra which is being recited. Clearly here mantra is associated with speech. The meditator may visualise the letters in front of themselves, or within their body. They may be pronounced out loud, or internally in mind only.

====Om mani padme hum====
{{Main|Om mani padme hum}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-S-15-22-23, Tibetexpedition, Berghang mit tibetischer Schrift.jpg|thumb|[[Om mani padme hum]] on the [[Yarlung Valley|Gangpori]] (photo [[1938–1939 German expedition to Tibet]].]]

Probably the most famous mantra of Buddhism is [[Om mani padme hum]], the six syllable mantra of the [[Bodhisattva]] of compassion [[Avalokiteśvara]] (Tibetan: ''[[Chenrezig]]'', Chinese: ''[[Guanyin]]''). This mantra is particularly associated with the four-armed Shadakshari form of Avalokiteśvara. The [[Dalai Lama]] is said to be an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, and so the mantra is especially revered by his devotees.

The book ''Foundations of Tibetan Mysticism'' by [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]], gives a classic example of how such a mantra can contain many levels of symbolic meaning.

[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.|Donald Lopez]] gives a good discussion of this mantra and its various interpretations in his book ''Prisoners of Shangri-LA: Tibetan Buddhism and the West''. Lopez is an authoritative writer and challenges the stereotypical analysis of the mantra as meaning "The Jewel in the Lotus", an interpretation that is not supported by either a linguistic analysis, nor by Tibetan tradition, and is symptomatic of the Western [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] approach to the 'exotic' East. He suggests that Manipadma is actually the name of a bodhisattva, a form of Avalokiteshvara who has many other names in any case including Padmapani or ''lotus flower in hand''. The Brahminical insistence on the absolutely correct pronunciation of Sanskrit broke down as Buddhism was exported to other countries where the inhabitants found it impossible to reproduce the sounds. So in Tibet, for instance, where this mantra is on the lips of many Tibetans all their waking hours, the mantra is pronounced ''Om mani pema hung''.{{cn|date=June 2016}}

====Some other mantras in Tibetan Buddhism====
The following list of mantras is from ''[[Kailash: A Journal of Himalayan Studies]]'', Volume 1, Number 2, 1973. (pp.&amp;nbsp;168–169) (augmented by other contributors). It also includes renderings of ''Om mani padme hum''. The mantras used in Tibetan Buddhist practice are in [[Sanskrit]], to preserve the original mantras. Visualizations and other practices are usually done in the [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]].

*''Om vagishvara hum'' This is the mantra of the Mahabodhisattva [[Manjusri]], Tibetan: Jampelyang ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]] "'jam dpal dbyangs")... The Buddha in his wisdom aspect.
*''[[Om mani padme hum]]'' The mantra of [[Avalokitesvara]], Mahabodhisattva, the Buddha in his compassion aspect.

Ture means liberating from duality; it shows the "true" cessation of confusion. Soha means "may the meaning of the mantra take root in my mind."

According to Tibetan Buddhism, this mantra (Om tare tutare ture soha) can not only eliminate disease, troubles, disasters, and karma, but will also bring believers blessings, longer life, and even the wisdom to transcend one's circle of reincarnation.

*''Qīngjìng guāngmíng dàlì zhìhuì wúshàng zhìzhēn móní guāngfó'' (清淨光明大力智慧無上至真摩尼光佛) The mantra of the [[Manichaeism]] in China

===Collection===
The mantra in [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] are collected by [[Qianlong Emperor]] into a book. Kuang-Ming Lin (林光明) amended it.

==Bahá’í Faith==

Bahá’ís recite the mantra "Alláh-u-Abha" 95 times a day. Many use beads.

==Sikhism==
In the [[Sikh]] religion, a ''mantar'' or ''mantra'' is a [[Shabad (hymn)|Shabad]] (Word or [[hymn]]) from the [[Adi Granth]] to concentrate the mind on God. Through repetition of the mantra, and listening to one's own voice, thoughts are reduced and the mind rises above materialism to tune into the voice of God. 

Mantras in Sikhism are fundamentally different from the secret mantras used in other religions.&lt;ref name="Tālib 1992"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advancedcentrepunjabi.org/eos/MUL%20MANTRA.html|title=MŪL MANTRA|last=Tālib|first=Gurbachan Siṅgh|year=1992|work=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism|publisher=Punjabi University|accessdate=19 September 2010|location=Patiala}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in other religions, Sikh mantras are open for anyone to use. They are used openly and are not taught in secret sessions but are used in front of assemblies of Sikhs.&lt;ref name="Tālib 1992"/&gt;

The [[Mool Mantar]], the first composition of [[Guru Nanak]], is the second most widely known Sikh mantra.

The most widely known mantra in the Sikh faith is "Wahe Guru." According to the Sikh poet Bhai Gurdas, the word "Wahe Guru" is the Gurmantra, or the mantra given by the Guru, and eliminates ego. &lt;ref name="Bhai Gurdas"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sikhitothemax.org/shabad?id=40293&amp;q=vghjh&amp;type=1&amp;source=all&amp;highlight=202491|title=GUR MANTRA|work=SikhiTotheMax|last=Gurdas|first=Bhai|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 10th Sikh Master, Guru Gobind Singh, the "Wahe Guru" mantra was given by God to the Order of the Khalsa, and reforms the apostate into the purified.

==Taoism==
There are mantras in [[Taoism]], such as the words in Dafan yinyu wuliang yin (大梵隱語無量音) and the Tibetan Buddhism mantra ''[[om]]'' (唵). There are mantras in [[Cheondoism]], [[Daesun Jinrihoe]], [[Jeung San Do]] and [[Onmyōdō]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2s.biglobe.ne.jp/~Taiju/970_kuchizusami.htm |title=口遊 |publisher=S.biglobe.ne.jp |date= |accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], the '''marginal propensity to consume''' ('''MPC''') is a metric that quantifies [[induced consumption]], the concept that the increase in personal consumer spending ([[consumption (economics)|consumption]]) occurs with an increase in [[disposable income]] (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which individuals spend on consumption is known as propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of additional income that an individual consumes. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then of that dollar, the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents. Obviously, the household cannot spend ''more'' than the extra dollar (without borrowing).

According to [[John Maynard Keynes]], marginal propensity to consume is less than one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John M. |title=[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money]] |location=New York |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |page=96 |year=1936 |quote=The fundamental psychological law ... is that men [and women] are disposed, as a rule and on average, to increase their consumption as their income increases, but not as much as the increase in their income. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Mathematically, the &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt; function is expressed as the [[derivative]] of the [[consumption function]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with respect to disposable income &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; curve.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\frac{dC}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

or, approximately,

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Delta C&lt;/math&gt; is the change in consumption, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; is the change in disposable income that produced the consumption.
Marginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\Delta C/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt;. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Income!! Consumption
|-
| 120 || 120
|-
| 180 || 170
|}
		
Here &lt;math&gt;\Delta C= 50&lt;/math&gt;; &lt;math&gt;\Delta Y= 60&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}=\Delta C/\Delta Y= 50/60= 0.83&lt;/math&gt; or 83%.
For example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You suddenly have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on a new business suit, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (&lt;math&gt;\$400/\$500&lt;/math&gt;).

[[File:MPC.png|thumb|The above figure illustrates the consumption function. The slope of the consumption function tells us how much consumption increases when disposable income increases by one currency unit. That is, the slope of the consumption function is the MPC.]]

The marginal propensity to consume is measured as the ratio of the change in consumption to the change in income, thus giving us a figure between 0 and 1. The MPC can be more than one if the subject borrowed money or dissaved to finance expenditures higher than their income. The MPC can also be less than zero if an increase in income leads to a reduction in consumption (which might occur if, for example, the increase in income makes it worthwhile to save up for a particular purchase). One minus the MPC equals the [[marginal propensity to save]] (in a two sector closed economy), which is crucial to [[Keynesian economics]] and a key variable in determining the value of the [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]].

In a standard Keynesian model, the MPC is less than the [[average propensity to consume]] (APC) because in the short-run some (autonomous) consumption does not change with income.  Falls (increases) in income do not lead to reductions (increases) in consumption because people reduce (add to) savings to stabilize consumption.  Over the long-run, as wealth and income rise, consumption also rises; the marginal propensity to consume out of long-run income is closer to the average propensity to consume.

The MPC is not strongly influenced by interest rates; consumption tends to be stable relative to income.  In theory one might think that higher interest rates would induce more saving (the substitution effect) but higher interest rates also mean than people do not have to save as much for the future.

Economists often distinguish between the marginal propensity to consume out of permanent income, and the marginal propensity to consume out of temporary income, because if consumers expect a change in income to be permanent, then they have a greater incentive to increase their consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Barro |first2=Vittorio |last2=Grilli |year=1994 |title=European Macroeconomics |location= |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0333577647 |pages=417–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This implies that the Keynesian [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] should be ''larger'' in response to permanent changes in income than it is in response to temporary changes in income (though the earliest Keynesian analyses ignored these subtleties). However, the distinction between permanent and temporary changes in income is often subtle in practice, and it is often quite difficult to designate a particular change in income as being permanent or temporary. What is more, the marginal propensity to consume should also be affected by factors such as the prevailing interest rate and the general level of [[consumer surplus]] that can be derived from purchasing.

== MPC and the multiplier ==
MPC's importance depends on the multiplier theory. MPC determines the value of the multiplier. The higher the MPC, the higher the multiplier and vice versa. The relationship between the multiplier and the propensity to consume is as follows:
:                                                 &lt;math&gt; Y = C+I &lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = \Delta C + \Delta I &lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y = c\Delta Y + \Delta I &lt;/math&gt;               (where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt;)
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y - c\Delta Y = \Delta I&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y(1-c) = \Delta I&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \Delta Y= \frac{\Delta I}{(1-c)}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                &lt;math&gt; \frac {\Delta Y}{\Delta I} = \frac {1}{(1-c)}&lt;/math&gt;
:                                                 &lt;math&gt; K = \frac{1}{(1-c)} &lt;/math&gt;                   (where ,&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is multiplier and &lt;math&gt;K = \frac {\Delta Y}{\Delta I})&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the MPC, the multiplier &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is, by definition, equal to &lt;math&gt;1/(1-MPC)&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplier can also be derived from MPS (marginal propensity to save) and it is the reciprocal of MPS, &lt;math&gt;K= 1/\mathit{MPS}&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\Delta C/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; (MPC)  !!&lt;math&gt;\Delta S/\Delta Y&lt;/math&gt; (MPS) [&lt;math&gt;1-\mathit{MPC}&lt;/math&gt;]!! |&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (multiplier coefficient)
|-
| 0 || 1 ||1
|-
| 1/2 || 1/2 || 2
|-
| 2/3 || 1/3 || 3
|-
| 3/4 || 1/4 || 4
|-
| 4/5 || 1/5 || 5
|-
| 8/9 || 1/9 || 9
|-
| 9/10 ||1/10 || 10
|-
| 1    || 0||  &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The above table shows that the size of the multiplier varies directly with the MPC and inversely with the MPS. Since the MPC is always greater than zero and less than one (i.e. &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\mathit{MPC} &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;), the multiplier is always between one and infinity (&lt;math&gt;1&lt;K&lt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;). If the multiplier is one, it means that the whole increment of income is saved and nothing is spent because the MPC is zero. On the other hand, an infinite multiplier implies that MPC is equal one and the entire increment of income is spent on consumption. It will soon lead to full employment in the economy and then create a limitless inflationary spiral. But these are rare phenomenon. Therefore, the multiplier coefficient varies between one and infinity.

== Significance of MPC ==
When income increases, the MPC falls but more than the APC. Conversely, when income falls, the MPC rises and the APC also rises but at a slower rate than the former. Such changes are only possible during cyclical fluctuations whereas in the short-run there is no change in the MPC and &lt;math&gt;\mathit{MPC}&lt;\mathit{APC}&lt;/math&gt;.
Keynes is concerned primarily with the MPC, for his analysis pertains to the short-run while the APC is useful in the long-run analysis. The post-Keynesian economists have come to the conclusion that over the long-run APC and MPC are equal and approximate 0.9. In the Keynesian analysis the MPC is given more prominence. Its value is assumed to be positive and less than unity which means that when income increases the whole of it is not spent on consumption. On the contrary, when income falls, consumption expenditure does not decline in the same proportion and never becomes zero. The Keynesian hypothesis is that the marginal propensity to consume is positive but less than unity (&lt;math&gt;0\le \Delta C/\Delta Y &lt;1&lt;/math&gt;) is of great analytical and practical significance. Besides telling us that consumption is an increasing function of income and it increases by less than the increment of income, this hypothesis helps in explaining
1)	The theoretical possibility of general [[overproduction]] or "[[underemployment equilibrium]]" and also
2)	The relative stability of a highly developed industrial economy. For it implies that the gap between income and consumption at all high levels of income is too wide to be easily filled by investment with the possible consequences that the economy may fluctuate around underemployment equilibrium.
Thus the economic significance of the MPC lies in filling the gap between income and consumption through planned investment to maintain the desired level of income.

=== MPC and nature of country ===
The MPC is higher in the case of poorer people than in rich&lt;ref&gt;http://equitablegrowth.org/equitablog/wealth-inequality-marginal-propensity-consume/&lt;/ref&gt;. When a person earns a higher income, the cost of their basic human needs amount to a smaller fraction of this income, and correspondingly their average propensity to save is higher than that of a person with a lower income. The marginal propensity to save of the richer classes is greater than that of the poorer classes. If, at any time, it is desired to increase aggregate consumption, then the purchasing power should be transferred from the richer classes (with low propensity to consume) to the poorer classes (with a higher propensity to consume). Likewise, if it is desired to reduce community consumption, the purchasing power must be taken away from the poorer classes by taxing consumption. The marginal propensity to consume is higher in a poor country and lower in the case of rich country. The reason is same as stated above. In the case of rich country, most common of the basic needs of the people have already been satisfied, and all the additional increments of income are saved, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to save but in a lower marginal propensity to consume. In a poor country, on the other hand, most of the basic needs of the people remain unsatisfied so that additional increments of income go to increase consumption, resulting in a higher marginal propensity to consume and a lower marginal propensity to save. This is the reason MPC is higher in the underdeveloped countries of Asia and Africa, and lower in developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Germany.

=== The MPC of individuals ===
Much of the current discussion seems to rely on the MPC being unique to a country, and homogeneous across such an economic entity; and the theory and the mathematical formulae apply to this use of the term.  However, individuals have an MPC, and furthermore MPC is not homogeneous across society. Even if it was, the nature of the consumption is not homogeneous. Some consumption may be seen as more benevolent (to the economy) than others. Therefore, spending could be targeted where it would do most benefit, and thus generate the highest (closest to 1) MPC. This has traditionally been regarded as construction or other major projects (which also bring a direct benefit in the form of the finished product).
Clearly, some sectors of society are likely to have a much higher MPC than others. Someone with above average wealth or income or both may have a very low (short-term, at least) MPC of nearly zero—saving most of any extra income. But a pensioner, for example, will have an MPC of 1 or even greater than 1. This is because a pensioner is quite likely to spend every penny of any extra income. Further, if the extra income is seen as regular extra income, and guaranteed into the future, the pensioner may actually spend MORE than the extra £1. This would occur where the extra income stream gives confidence that the individual does not need to put aside as much in the form of savings; or perhaps can even dip into existing savings.
More importantly, this consumption is much more likely to occur in local small business—local shops, pubs and other leisure activities for example. These types of businesses are themselves likely to have a high MPC, and again the nature of their consumption is likely to be in the same, or next tier of businesses, and also of a benevolent nature.
Other individuals with a high, and benevolent, MPC would include almost anyone on a low income—students, parents with young children, and the unemployed.

'''Micronized rubber powder''' (MRP) is classified as fine, dry, powdered elastomeric [[crumb rubber]] in which a significant proportion of particles are less than 100&amp;nbsp;µm and free of foreign particulates (metal, fiber, etc.). MRP particle size distributions typically range from 180&amp;nbsp;µm to 10&amp;nbsp;µm. Narrower distributions can be achieved depending on the classification technology.

==MRP source materials==

MRP is typically made from vulcanized elastomeric material, most often from end-of-life tire material, but can also be produced from post-industrial [[nitrile]] rubber, [[ethylene propylene diene monomer|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]] and natural rubber compounds.

==Characteristics==

MRP is a free flowing, black rubber powder that disperses into a multitude of systems and applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayyer|first=Ravi|title=Evaluation of micronized rubber powders with cost/performance benefits|url=http://digital.ipcprintservices.com/display_article.php?id=956952|publisher=Rubber World|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its micron size, MRP can be incorporated into multiple polymers, and provides a smooth surface appearance on finished products.  In some cases, in order to improve compatibility with host materials, the MRP is given a chemical treatment to activate, or “make functional” the surface of the powder particles.  This is referred to as functionalized MRP or FMRP.

MRP represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most basic rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Tire-Derived Fuel |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=28 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326030623/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm |archivedate=26 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA: Ground Rubber Applications |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220052729/http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/materials/tires/ground.htm |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MRP is a micron-size material that is produced in various sizes, including 80 mesh and down to 300 mesh. MRP is virtually metal and fiber-free, enabling its use in a wide range of advanced products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Mary|title=Rubber Powder Supplier Gains Traction With Global Sales, Green Solution|url=http://www.globalatlanta.com/article/26726/rubber-powder-supplier-gains-traction-with-global-sales-green-solution/|accessdate=29 April 2014|newspaper=Global Atlanta|date=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Applications==

MRP is used as a compound extender to offset the use of natural rubber and synthetic polymers as well as act as a process aid in material production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=Jin Kuk|title=Study on powder utilization of waste tires as a filler in rubber compounding|journal=[[Rubber Chemistry and Technology]]|date=Nov–Dec 1998|volume=71|issue=5|pages=1028|doi=10.5254/1.3538508|last2=Burford|first2=R. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, MRP can reduce formulation costs, because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, According to some estimates, MRP offers up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

MRP also can improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used.  For example, the smaller particle sizes of MRP are known to increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.  However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

Due to its size and composition, MRP can be incorporated into more advanced and higher-value applications than [[crumb rubber]]. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products.  It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Guangyu |author2=Song, Yingdeng |author3=Xiolin, Li |author4=Zhang, Liqun|title=Noise-reducing performance of rubber powder modified asphalt pavement materials|journal=China Synthetic Rubber Industry|year=2011|volume=34|issue=4|pages=314–317}}&lt;/ref&gt; coatings, and sealants.  MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade [[Polypropylene|polypropylene (PP)]], [[high-density polyethylene|high-density polyethylene (HDPE)]] and [[nylon]]s. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in [[thermoplastic elastomers|thermoplastic elastomers (TPE)]] and [[thermoplastic]] [[vulcanizate]]s (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

Currently, the leading producer of MRP is [[Lehigh Technologies]], which utilizes a cryogenic turbo mill process with more than 100 million pounds of annual production capacity. MRP produced by Lehigh has set high benchmarks for performance in a range of applications with customers and third-party research institutions, including several studies on increased asphalt performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Willis|first=J.

'''Mind monkey''' or '''monkey mind''', from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ''xinyuan'' and [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] ''shin'en'' 心猿 [lit. "heart-/mind-monkey"], is a [[Buddhist]] term meaning "unsettled; restless; capricious; whimsical; fanciful; inconstant; confused; indecisive; uncontrollable". In addition to Buddhist writings, including Chan or [[Zen]], [[Consciousness-only]], [[Pure Land]], and [[Shingon]], this "mind-monkey" psychological metaphor was adopted in [[Taoism]], [[Neo-Confucianism]], poetry, drama, and literature. "Mind-monkey" occurs in two reversible [[Chengyu|four-character idioms]] with ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 [lit. "thought-/will-horse"], most frequently used in Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and Japanese ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿. The "Monkey King" [[Sun Wukong]] in the ''[[Journey to the West]]'' personifies the mind-monkey. Note that much of the following summarizes Carr (1993).

==Linguistic and cultural background==
"Mind-monkey" 心猿 is an exemplary [[animal metaphor]]. Some figures of speech are cross-linguistically common, verging upon [[linguistic universal]]s; many languages use "monkey" or "ape" words to mean "mimic", for instance, Italian [[Wikt:scimmiottare|scimmiottare]] "to mock; to mimic" &lt; [[Wikt:scimmia|scimmia]] "monkey; ape", Japanese ''sarumane'' 猿真似 [lit. "monkey imitation"] "copycat; superficial imitation", and English ''[[monkey see, monkey do]]'' or ''[[Wikt:ape|to ape]]''). Other animal metaphors have culture-specific meanings; compare English ''[[Wikt:chickenhearted|chickenhearted]]'' "cowardly; timid'; easily frightened" and Chinese ''jixin'' 雞心 [lit. "chicken heart"] "heart-shaped; cordate".

The four [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] elements of Chinese ''xinyuanyima'' or Japanese ''shin'en'iba'' are ''xin'' or ''shin'' 心 "heart; mind", ''yi'' or ''i'' 意 "thought", ''yuan'' or ''en'' 猿 "monkey", and ''ma'' or ''ba'' 馬 "horse"'.

===The 心 "heart; mind" and 意 "idea; will"===
The psychological components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''xin'' or Sino-Japanese ''shin'' or ''kokoro'' [[Wikt:心|心]] "heart; mind; feelings, affections; center" and ''yi'' or ''i'' [[Wikt:意|意]] 'thought, idea; opinion, sentiment; will, wish; meaning'. This [[Chinese character]] 心 was graphically simplified from an original [[pictogram]] of a heart, and 意 "thought; think" is an [[ideogram]] combining 心 under ''yin'' [[Wikt:音|音]] "sound; tone; voice" denoting "sound in the mind; thought; idea".

In [[Chinese Buddhism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]], ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "heart; mind" generally translates [[Sanskrit]] ''[[Wikt:citta|citta]]'' "the mind; state of mind; consciousness" and ''yi''/''i'' 意 translates Sanskrit ''[[Wikt:manas|manas]]'' "the mental organ; deliberation". Some Buddhist authors have used 心 and 意 interchangeably for "mind; cognition; thought". Compare these ''[[Digital Dictionary of Buddhism]]'' glosses 
*心 "Spirit, motive, sense. The mind as the seat of intelligence, mentality, idea. (Skt. ''citta'') … Thought, intellect, feeling; (Skt. ''mānasa'')"
*意 "Thought, intellect; (Skt. ''manas''; Tib. ''yid''); the mind; (Skt. ''citta''; Tib. ''sems'')".
For example, take the Buddhist word Chinese ''xin-yi-shi'' or Japanese ''shin-i-shiki'' 心意識 [lit. "mind, thought, and cognition"] that compounds three near-synonyms. [[Abhidharma]] theory uses this word as a general term for "mind; mentality", but [[Yogacara]] theory of [[Eight Consciousnesses]] distinguishes ''xin''/''shin'' 心 "[[store consciousness]]", ''yi''/''i'' 意 "''manas'' consciousness", and ''shi''/''shiki'' 識 "six object-contingent consciousnesses".

''Xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 [lit. "mind-monkey idea-horse"] "distracted; indecisive; restless" is comparable with some other Chinese [[collocation]]s.
*''xinmanyizu'' 心滿意足 ["heart-full mind-complete"] "perfectly content; fully satisfied"
*''xinhuiyilan'' 心灰意懶 ["heart-ashes mind-sluggish"] "disheartened; discouraged; hopeless" (or ''xinhuiyileng'' 心灰意冷 with ''leng'' "cold; frosty")
*''xinhuangyiluan'' 心慌意亂 ["heart-flustered mind-disordered"] "alarmed and hysterical; perturbed"
*''xinfanyiluan'' 心煩意亂 ["heart-vexed mind-disordered"] "terribly upset; confused and worried"

===The 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse"===
[[File:Marbleized Clay, Tri-Color Glazed of Monkey Piggy-Back on Horse.JPG|thumb|[[Sancai|Tri-color glaze]] porcelain, showing 猿 "monkey" and 馬 "horse". [[Tang dynasty]].]]
[[File:Chinesischer Maler des 10. Jahrhunderts (I) 001.jpg|thumb|''Gibbons and horses'', 10th-century [[Song dynasty]] painting]]
The animal components of the "mind-monkey will-horse" metaphor are Chinese ''yuan'' or Japanese ''en'' [[Wikt:猿|猿]] "gibbon; monkey; ape" and ''ma'' or ''ba'' [[Wikt:馬|馬]] "horse".

Chinese ''yuan'' 猿 (''yuan'' [[Wikt:猨|猨]] or ''nao'' [[Wikt:猱|猱]]) originally meant the "[[agile gibbon]], black-handed gibbon, ''Hylobates agilis''" but now generally means "ape; monkey" (e.g., ''yuanren'' 猿人 ["ape-man"] "[[Homo erectus]]; anthropoid apes'"). [[Robert van Gulik]] (1967:33) concludes that until about the 14th century, ''yuan'' designated the gibbon, but due to extensive deforestation, its habitat shrank to remote southern mountains; from then on, "the majority of Chinese writers knowing about the gibbon only by hearsay, they began to confuse him with the macaque or other Cynopithecoids." Other common Chinese "monkey" names include ''feifei'' 狒狒 "[[hamadryas baboon]], ''Papio hamadryas''", ''hou'' [[Wikt:猴|猴]] "monkey; ape", and ''mihou'' 獼猴 (''muhou'' 母猴) or ''husun'' 猢猻 "[[rhesus macaque]], rhesus monkey, ''Macaca mulatta''", [[Victor H. Mair]] (1990:36) reconstructs Old Sinitic *''mug-gug'', which "probably ultimately derives from the same African word as English 'macaque'" and is reminiscent of Sanskrit "maraṭāsana ('monkey posture')" (see [[Hanumanasana]]). These "monkey; ape" characters combine the [[Wikt:犭|犭]] "dog [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]" with different [[phonetic]] elements, such as the ''yuan'' [[Wikt:袁|袁]] phonetic in ''yuan'' 猿.

In [[Chinese mythology]], ''yuan'' "gibbons" were supposedly long-lived because they could ''yinqi'' 引氣 ["pull [[qi]]"] "absorb life-force", which is a ''[[Tao Yin|daoyin]]'' 導引 ["guiding and pulling"] "Daoist gymnastic technique". [[Chinese classic texts]] mentioned "monkey leaping" and "monkey bowing" yoga (Miura 1989:354). One of the 2nd-century BCE [[Mawangdui Silk Texts]] depicts 28 Daoist gymnastic exercises, many of which are named after animals, including number 22 ''muhou'' "macaque". In the present day, ''houquan'' 猴拳 ["monkey fist/boxing"] "[[Monkey Kung Fu]]" is a [[Chinese martial arts]] style and ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" is a Daoist breath meditation technique. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;When one breathes in and out, one's concentration causes the generative force to rise and fall (in the microcosmic orbit) thus slowly turning the wheel of the law. Count from one to ten and then from ten to one hundred breaths with the heart (mind) following the counting to prevent it from wandering outside. When the heart and breathing are in unison, this is called ''locking up the monkey heart'' and ''tying up the running horse of intellect''. (Luk 1990:48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Japanese [[kanji]] 猿 is pronounced as Sino-Japanese ''en'' &lt; ''yuan'' or native ''saru'' "monkey", especially the indigenous "[[Japanese macaque]], ''Macaca fuscata''". In Japanese [[Shinto]] tradition, the monkey deity [[Sarutahiko]] was a divine messenger. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney (1987:41) contrasts how, "in earlier periods the dominant meaning of the monkey was that of mediator between deities and humans. Later in history, its meaning as a scapegoat became increasingly dominant."

Chinese ''ma'' 馬 "horse", which was the linguistic source for Sino-Japanese ''ba'' or ''ma'' 馬 "horse", originally referred to [[Przewalski's horse]] and later the [[Mongolian horse]], [[Ferghana horse]], etc. Horses were considered divine animals in both China (see Creel 1968) and Japan. For the Chinese, [[Edward H. Schafer]] says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;He was invested with sanctity by ancient tradition, endowed with prodigious qualities, and visibly stamped with the marks of his divine origin. A revered myth proclaimed him a relative of the dragon, akin to the mysterious powers of water. Indeed, all wonderful horses, such as the steed of the pious Hsüan-tsang which, in later legend [see the ''Xiyouji'' below], carried the sacred scriptures from India, were avatars of dragons, and in antiquity the tallest horses owned by the Chinese were called simply "dragons." (1963:59) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
For the Japanese, the ancient Shinto practice of offering ''shinme'' 神馬 "sacred (esp. white) horses" to shrines has evolved into the modern donation of symbolic ''[[Shinto]] [[Ema (Shinto)|ema]]'' 絵馬 [lit. "picture horse"] "votive tablets"'.

Besides the "mind-monkey idea-horse" metaphor, monkeys and horses have further associations. In [[Chinese astrology]], ''wu'' [[Wikt:午|午]] "[[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]]" and ''shen'' [[Wikt:申|申]] "[[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]]" are the 7th and 9th of the 12 zodiacal animals. In Chinese animal mythology, monkeys supposedly bring good health to horses. The ''[[Bencao Gangmu]]'' (tr. Read 1931, no. 400) records the "custom of keeping a female monkey in the horse's stable to ward off sickness (the menstrual discharge of the monkey is said to give immunity to the horse against infectious diseases)".

==Early literary history of "mind-monkeys"==
This section summarizes Chinese and Japanese developments of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''yima'' or ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse" collocations and their synonyms. The earliest known textual usages are presented chronologically.

===Chinese "mind monkey" collocations===
Chinese authors coined "mind monkey" expressions from the [[Later Qin|Later Qin Dynasty]] (384-417 CE) through the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE). In modern usage, some terms are considered [[Classical Chinese]], but others like ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" are [[Modern Standard Chinese]]. Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:154-159).

The c. 406 ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' 維摩詰所說經 was [[Kumarajiva]]'s groundbreaking CE Chinese translation of the ''[[Vimalakirti Sutra]]''. It introduced "mind-monkey" in the [[simile]] ''xin ru yuanhou'' 心如猨猴 "heart/mind like a monkey/ape" (with ''yuan'' 猿's [[variant Chinese character]] 猨). "Since the mind of one difficult to convert is like an ape, govern his mind by using certain methods and it can then be broken in" (tr. Dudbridge 1970:168). Carr (1993:169) suggests the subsequent line about ''xiang ma'' 象馬 "elephants and horses" having unruly natures could have affected the later ''yima'' "idea-horse" term.

The ''Mengyu chanhui shi'' 蒙預懺悔詩 "Poem Repenting Foolish Pleasure" is attributed to [[Emperor Jianwen of Liang]] (503-550 CE), who was a renowned author. This poem has the oldest known usage of ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey", but with (the possibly miscopied) ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse" instead of ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse". "The [三循/修] three disciplines/cultivations expel the [愛馬] love-horse, and the [六意/念] six recollections/ideas still the [心猿] mind-monkey." This Buddhistic poem has numerous graphic variants, including these ''sanxun'' 三循 "three disciplines" for ''sanxiu'' 三修 "three cultivations" (meditation on impermanence, awareness, and selflessness) and ''liuyi'' 六意 "six ideas" for ''liunian'' 六念 "six recollections" (mindfulness about [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[dharma]], [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]], precepts, almsgiving, and heaven). Based on these contextual graphic inconsistencies, Carr (1993:156) suggests the possibility that a [[scribe]] transposed Jianwen's original ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse" as ''aima'' 愛馬 "love-horse".

The ''Daci'ensi sanzang fashizhuan'' 大慈恩寺三藏法師傳 "Biography of the Tripitaka Dharma Master of the Temple of Great Compassionate Blessings" is a biography of [[Xuanzang]] (see the ''Xiyouji'' below) written by his disciple [[Kuiji]] (or Ci'en, the namesake temple in [[Luoyang]], see [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang]]). This record of the Consciousness-Only ([[Yogacara]]) Buddhism, has a memorial dated 657 CE that parallels ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" with ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-/feeling-monkey": "Now if you wish to entrust your thoughts to the Chan sect, you must make your mind as pure as still water, control your emotion-monkey's indolence and fidgeting, and restrain your idea-horse's haste and galloping."

The [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Xu Hun]] 許渾 ([[floruit|fl.]] 832-844) wrote the first known parallel between "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse." His ''Zengti Du yinju'' 贈題杜隱居 "Poem Written for Sir Du the Recluse" says: "Nature exhausts the mind-monkey's hiding, spirit disperses the idea-horse's moving/stopping. Guests who come ought to know this: both self and world are unfeeling."

The common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" phrase dates back to a ''[[bianwen]]'' 變文 "[[Vernacular Chinese]] transformation text" narrative version of the ''Weimojie suoshuo jing'' (above) that was discovered in the [[Mogao Caves]]. This ''jiangjingwen'' 講經文 "sutra lecture text" dated 947 CE says: "Within the indeterminable and unfathomable depths, the mind-monkey and idea-horse cease their craziness." 

The 1075 CE ''[[Wuzhen pian]]'', which is a [[Daoist]] classic on ''[[Neidan]]''-style [[internal alchemy]], used ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" without "horse".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thoroughly understanding the mind-monkey, the machinations in the heart, by three thousand achievements one becomes a peer of heaven. There naturally is a crucible to cook the dragon and tiger; Why is it necessary to support a household and be attached to spouse and children? (tr. Cleary 1987:118) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cleary (1987:198) glosses ''xinyuan'' as "the unruly mind, jumping from one object to another."

The Song Dynasty poet Zhu Yi 朱翌 (1098–1186 CE) reversed the Tang lyrical ''xinyuanyima'' expression into ''yimaxinyuan'' "will-horse mind-monkey". His ''Shuixuanshi'' 睡軒詩 "Sleeping Porch Poem" says: "Haste is useless with the idea-horse and mind-monkey, so take off your baggage someplace deep within dreamland."

The c. 1200 ''Nan Tang shu'' 南唐書 "History of the [[Southern Tang]]" used the simile ''yi ru ma xin ru nao'' 意如馬心如猱 "ideas like a horse and mind like a gibbon/monkey". Congshan 從善 (939-987), seventh son of the figurehead [[Emperor Yuanzong of Southern Tang]], confesses: "Long ago in my youth, my ideas were like a horse and my mind was like a monkey. I was indolent with happiness and enjoyed lust, was pleased with rewards and forgot toil." 

 [[Image:Xiyou.PNG|160px|thumb|illustration of Sun Wukong]]
The c. 1590 ''Xiyouji'' 西遊記 "''[[Journey to the West]]''" (or "''[[Monkey (novel)|Monkey]]''") popularized "mind-monkey" more than any other text. This famous Chinese novel centers upon the pilgrimage of [[Xuanzang]] to India, and frequently uses ''xinyuan'' and ''yima'' expressions (Dudbridge 1970:167, Chang 1983:200). Many are found in the couplet titles of chapters, for instance, 30 "The evil demon attacks the true Dharma; The Horse of the Will recalls the Monkey of the Mind". The preeminent translator [[Anthony C. Yu]] (1977:59) describes controlling the mind-monkey and will-horse as "a theme central to the entire narrative and which receives repeated and varied developments." Chapter 7 has this exemplary poem:
&lt;blockquote&gt;A monkey's transformed body weds the human mind. Mind is a monkey – this, the truth profound. The Great Sage [Buddha], Equal to Heaven, is no idle thought. For how could the post of [Bima "Assistant of Horses"] justly show his gifts? The Horse works with the Monkey – and this means both Mind and Will, Must firmly be harnessed and not ruled without. All things return to Nirvāna, taking this one course: In union with Tathāgata [Buddha] to live beneath twin trees. (tr. Yu 1977:168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Many ''Xiyouji'' scholars allegorically interpret ''xinyuan'' "heart-/mind-monkey" as the protagonist monkey-man [[Sun Wukong]] and ''yima'' "idea-/will-horse" as the dragon prince White Horse that enters the story in chapter 15. There are long-standing scholarly disagreements over whether Sun Wukong evolved from [[Hanuman]], the monkey hero in the (3rd century BCE) ''[[Ramayana]]''. It is "imagistically proper" for Sun to be a monkey, says Mair (1989:662), because "Zen thought symbolizes the restless and unbridled mind of man as an "ape/monkey-mind" 心猿."

Japanese Buddhist monks not only imported [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]] such as ''shin'en'' &lt; ''xinyuan'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' &lt; ''yima'' 意馬 "idea-horse", but also invented analogous Japanese words like ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". Unless otherwise noted, translations are by Carr (1993:159-161). The earliest known usages of relevant "mind-monkey" terminology are shown in the table below.

During the [[Heian period]] (794-1185 CE), the Chinese "mind-monkey" and "idea-horse" were paraphrased as ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea-monkey" and ''shinba'' 心馬 "mind-horse". The 797 CE ''[[Sangō Shiiki]]'' 三教指帰 "Indications of the [[Three teachings]] (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism)" was written by [[Kūkai]], who founded esoteric [[Shingon Buddhism]]. Two passages introduced Japanese "mind-monkey" and "will-horse" [[neologism]]s. One used ''i'en'' 意猿 "idea/will monkey" with the common word ''nouma'' 野馬 "wild horse": "The four great difficulties overexcite the wild horse's fast gallop, the twenty-six contributory causes mislead the plans of the idea-monkey." Another passage used ''shinba'' 心馬 "heart/mind horse" and ''isha'' 意車 "idea-chariot": "Whip the mind-horse to gallop off in the eight directions, grease the idea chariot and gambol within the nine heavens."

During the [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333 CE), [[Pure Land Buddhism]] introduced the Sino-Japanese terms ''shin'en'' 心猿 "mind-monkey" and ''iba'' 意馬 "idea-horse", and an early travelogue popularized them. The ''Genkyū hōgo'' 元久法語 "[[Genkyū]] era (1204–1206) Buddhist Sermons" is a collection of writings by [[Hōnen]], the founder of the [[Jodo Shu|Jōdo Shū]]. His c. 1205 "Tozanjō 登山状 "Mountain Climbing Description"  (tr. adapted from Carr 1993:159) uses ''iba'' with ''shin'en'': "When you wish to enter the gate of determined goodness, then your idea-horse runs wild within the bounds of the six sense objects [''rokujin'' 六塵 &lt;  [[Ayatana]]: "form, sound, smell, taste, tangibility, and [[dharma]]"]. When you wish to enter the gate of scattered goodness, then your mind-monkey gambols and jumps across the branches of the ten evil deeds [''jūaku'' 十悪: killing, stealing, adultery, lying, cursing, slandering, equivocating, coveting, anger, and false views]." The 1223 ''Kaidōki'' 海道記 "Record of Coast Road Travels" was a travelogue of the [[Tōkaidō (road)]] from [[Kyoto]] to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. It used ''shinsen'' 心船 "heart/mind boat" meaning "imaginary journey" with ''iba'' 意馬 "idea/will horse" and wrote ''arasaru'' 荒猿 "wild monkey" for ''arasu'' 荒す "treat roughly/wildly": "I rowed the mind-boat for make-believe. As yet, I neither poled across myriad leagues of waves on the Coast Road, nor roughly rode the idea-horse to urge it on through clouds of the distant mountain barrier." 

During the early [[Edo period]] (1603–1868), the four-character Chinese collocations ''yimashinen'' 意馬心猿 and ''shinenyima'' 心猿意馬 were introduced into Japanese. The 1675 ''Man'an kana hōgo'' 卍庵仮名法語, which was a vernacular collection of [[Zen]] sermons, first used ''shin'en'iba'' 意馬心猿. "For this reason, even if you reside somewhere with remote mountain streams and desolate tranquillity, and sit in silent contemplation, you will only be passing idle time because you are isolated from the road of the mind-monkey and idea-horse." The 1699 [[Kabuki]] play ''Wakoku gosuiten'' 和国五翠殿 "Japan's Five Green Palaces" repeatedly used ''ibashin'en''. For instance, the first act described two prisoners tied to a tree: "They are the idea-horse and mind-monkey themselves. So if this pine tree is the pole of Absolute Reality, then these two prisoners are a greedy monkey – no, a cat – and a horse running wild; and they are just like the idea-horse and mind-monkey."

=="Mind-monkey" in English==
'''Mind monkey''' and '''monkey mind''' both occur in English usage, originally as translations of ''xinyuan'' or ''shin'en'' and later as culturally-independent images. Michael Carr concludes,
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Xinyuan-yima'' 心猿意馬 "monkey of the heart/mind and horse of the ideas/will" has been a successful metaphor. What began 1500 years ago as a Buddhist import evolved into a standard Chinese and Japanese literary phrase. Rosenthal (1989:361) says a proverb's success "'depends on certain imponderables," particularly rhythm and phrasing. Of the two animals in this metaphor, the "monkey" phrase was stronger than the "horse" because ''xinyuan'' "mind-monkey" was occasionally used alone (e.g., ''Wuzhenpian'') and it had more viable variants (e.g., ''qingyuan'' 情猿 "emotion-monkey" in ''Ci'en zhuan''). The "mental-monkey" choice of words aptly reflects restlessness, curiosity, and mimicry associated with this animal. Dudbridge (1970:168) explains how "the random, uncontrollable movements of the monkey symbolise the waywardness of the native human mind before it achieves a composure which only Buddhist discipline can effect." (1993:166) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Translations===
English translations of Chinese ''xinyuan'' or Japanese ''shin'en'' commonly include "mind monkey", "monkey mind", and "monkey of the mind".

This first list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 5 Chinese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 11 bilingual [[Chinese dictionaries]] translate ''xinyuanyima'' 心猿意馬 and ''yimaxinyuan'' 意馬心猿.
*【意馬心猿】 his will is like a horse's, and his heart like an ape's; inconstant and strong (''[[A Syllabic Dictionary of the Chinese Language]]'', Williams 1874)
*【心猿意馬】 gibbon heart and horse ideas, – unsettled and wandering (''[[A Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Giles 1919)
*【心猿意馬】 irresolute; vacillating; fluctuating ... Inconstant; fickle in the mind (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'', Tsang 1920, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 Unsettled in mind; fluctuating; wavering in purpose (''A Complete Chinese–English Dictionary'')
*【意馬心猿】The intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'', Lu 1931, cf. next)
*【心猿意馬】 Restless and unsettled (''Zhonghua Han-Ying dacidian'')
*【心猿意馬】 the intents of the mind and heart are like the horse and the ape – very difficult to bring under control; undecided (''[[Mathews' Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', Mathews 1943)
*【心猿意馬】 cannot make up one's mind; indecision; procrastination (''A New Practical Chinese- English Dictionary'', Liang 1971)
*【心猿意馬】 prone to outside attractions, temptations; in a restless and jumpy mood (''[[Lin Yutang's Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage]]'' 1972)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious (''The Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1979)
*【心猿意馬】 in a restless and jumpy mood / capricious (''A New Chinese–English Dictionary'', Ding 1985)
*【心猿意馬】 restless and whimsical; fanciful and fickle; capricious; when one meant gibbon, he thinks of a horse (''A Modern Chinese–English Dictionary'', Beijing 1988)
*【心猿意馬】 ① capricious; restless ② indecisive (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'', DeFrancis 1996, cf. next)
*【意馬心猿】 indecisive; wavering (''[[ABC Chinese-English Dictionary]]'')
Six of these 11 Chinese–English dictionaries enter only the common ''xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey idea-horse," 2 only the reverse ''yimaxinyuan'', and 3 enter both. Three translation equivalents give English "ape" rather than "gibbon" or "monkey" for ''yuan'' 猿, and "ape" sounds metaphorically stronger than "monkey." Note how several of these dictionaries have identical translations. 

This second list (expanded from Carr 1993:179, Table 7 Japanese-English Translation Equivalents) compares how 9 bilingual [[Japanese dictionaries]] translate ''ibashin'en'' 意馬心猿, none enters ''shin'en'iba'' 心猿意馬.
*【意馬心猿】 Clamorous demands of passion (''Takenobu's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1918)
*【意馬心猿】 overmastering passion (''A Standard Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takehara 1924)
*【意馬心猿】Passions hard of control; uncontrollable passions (''Saito's Japanese–English Dictionary'', Saito 1930)
*【意馬心猿】Clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Takenobu 1931)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; [uncontrollable] passions; wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Katsumata 1954)
*【意馬心猿】 uncontrollable passions (''The Modern Reader's Japanese-English Character Dictionary'', Nelson 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Masuda 1974)
*【意馬心猿】 (uncontrollable) passions (''Japanese Character Dictionary'', Spahn and Hadamitzky 1989)
*【意馬心猿】 the clamorous demands of passion; (uncontrollable) passions (''Kenkyusha's New Japanese–English Dictionary'', Watanabe 2003)

All 9 Japanese–English dictionaries mention "passion" or "passions." Note how Saito's "uncontrollable passions" first appeared in 1930 and was copied into 6 other dictionaries. The 5 editions of [[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese–English Dictionary]] illustrate lexicographical modifications. Editors copied the "clamorous demands of passion" phrase from the 1st edition (''Takenobu's …'' 1918) into all the subsequent versions. The 2nd (1931) first added "uncontrollable" to "passions," which was copied in later editions. The 3rd edition (1954) included a literal translation "wild horses of passions and flighty monkeys of desires", but this was omitted from the 4th (1974) and 5th (2003, which added the [[definite article]] "the").

===Popular culture===
Examples of "mind monkey" are predictably common in Chinese [[popular culture]]. For instance, ''Sam yuen yi ma'' 心猿意馬 – the [[Cantonese (language)|Cantonese]] pronunciation of ''Xinyuanyima'' "mind-monkey will-horse" –  was a 1999 Hong Kong movie (known in English as "The Accident") by [[Stanley Kwan]]. However, examples of "mind monkey" are surprisingly widespread in modern English culture. For instance, there are [[blog]]s named "Mind Monkey!", "Mind of the Monkey", "Monkey Mind", and "No monkey mind". Author Steve Michael Reedy explores the concept of the Monkey Mind through his collection of children's fantasy stories in [["Tales For Your Monkey's Mind."]]

In English-language publishing, fewer books are titled with "mind monkey", such as ''Master the Mind Monkey'' (Patkar 2007), than "monkey mind". "Taming" is common among ''Taming the Monkey Mind'' (Chodron 1999), ''Taming the Monkey Mind; A Guide to Pure Land Practice'' (Cheng 2000), and ''Taming Our Monkey Mind: Insight, Detachment, Identity'' (Krystal 2007). Other examples of book titles include ''Samba and the Monkey Mind'' (Williams 1965), ''Meeting the Monkey Halfway'' (Sumano and Popp 2000), ''Your Monkey Mind Connection'' (Antoinette 2007), and ''Still the Monkey'' (Alivia 2007). 

The originally Buddhist "mind monkey" metaphor is also known in popular English-language music. "Mad Melancholy Monkey Mind" is a band. There are albums entitled "Mind Monkey" (Bill Foreman 1999), "Monkey Mind" (Wonder Stump, 2003), and "Monkey Mind Control" (Jay Roulston 2003). Song titles include "The Monkey on the Mind" (Dave Wilkerson 1960) and "Monkey Mind" ([[Neil Rolnick]] 2003).

'''Multiple gender attraction''' ('''MGA'''), sometimes '''multi-gender attraction''', is an [[umbrella term]] that includes any [[Romance (love)|romantic]] or [[sexual orientation]] which experiences attraction to more than one [[gender]]. Such orientations include, but are not limited to, [[bisexuality]], [[pansexuality]], and [[polysexuality]].

[[File:What did you learn in school today? An Outreachy Retrospective.pdf|thumb|Outreach Program for Women]]

'''Outreach''' is an activity of providing services to any populations who might not otherwise have access to those services.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre2009"/&gt; A key component of outreach is that the groups providing it are not stationary, but mobile; in other words they are meeting those in need of outreach services at the locations where those in need are.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Centre2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dewson"/&gt; In addition to delivering services, outreach has an educational role, raising the awareness of existing services.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach is often meant to fill in the gap in the services provided by mainstream (often, governmental) services, and is often carried out by [[non-profit]], [[nongovernmental organization]]s.&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt; This is a major element differentiating outreach from [[public relations]].&lt;ref name="EliassonRiemer1999"/&gt; Compared with staff providing traditional services, Dewson et al. (2006) notes that outreach staff may be less qualified, but are more highly motivated.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Rhodes (1996) distinguishes between three types of outreach: domiciliary (undertaken at individual homes), detached (undertaken in public environments and targeting individuals), and peripatetic (undertaken at public or private environments and targeting organizations rather than individuals).&lt;ref name="Rhodes1996"/&gt; Dewson et al. (2006) lists another type in addition to those three: the satellite type, where services are provided at a dedicated site.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Dewson et al. (2006) list the following tools of outreach: leaflets, newsletters, advertising; stalls and displays, and dedicated events, with the common location being local community institutions such as libraries, community centres, markets and so on.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt; Compared with traditional service providers, outreach services are provided closer to individuals residence, are voluntary, and have fewer, if any, enforceable obligations.&lt;ref name=dewson/&gt;

Outreach can target various populations, from [[sex workers]]&lt;ref name="HardyKingston2010"/&gt; and [[drug]] users,&lt;ref name="Rhodes1996"/&gt; to museum goers.&lt;ref name="Sachatello-Sawyer2002"/&gt;

It has been extended to include any attacks against Jews and physical destruction of Jewish property, as well as looting of Jewish homes and businesses, throughout history.{{r|YIVO}}{{r|books1}}{{r|books2}} The characteristics of a pogrom vary widely, depending on the specific incidents, at times leading to, or culminating in, [[massacre]]s.

The Russian-language term was adopted in the English language in order to describe the mass violence of 1881 and 1882 that was directed against Jews within the [[Pale of Settlement]] which was first created by [[Catherine the Great]] in what would become most of present-day [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]], as well as parts of [[Lithuania]], [[Moldova]] and [[Poland]]. The term ''pogrom'' is sometimes used, as well, to describe publicly sanctioned purgative attacks against non-Jewish ethnic or religious groups.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;&lt;ref name="google"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Definitions of pogrom}}
First recorded in 1882, the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''pogrom'' (погро́м, {{IPA-ru|pɐˈgrom|pron}}) is derived from the common prefix po- and the verb ''gromit''' (громи́ть, {{IPA-ru|grɐˈmʲitʲ|pron}}) meaning "to destroy, to wreak havoc, to demolish violently". Its literal translation is "to harm".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt; The noun "pogrom", which has a relatively short history, is used in [[English language|English]] and many other languages as a [[loanword]], possibly borrowed from [[Yiddish]] (where the word takes the form פאָגראָם).&lt;ref name="dictionary"/&gt; Its widespread circulation in today's world began with the antisemitic excesses in the Russian Empire in 1881–1883.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;

==Historical background==
Anti-Jewish riots had already taken place in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. Jewish communities were targeted in the [[Black Death Jewish persecutions]] of 1348–1350, in [[Toulon]] in 1348, in [[Barcelona]] as well as in other Catalan cities,&lt;ref&gt;Anna Foa ''The Jews of Europe after the black death '' 2000 p. 13 "The first massacres took place in April 1348 in Toulon, where the Jewish quarter was raided and forty Jews were murdered in their homes. Shortly afterwards, violence broke out in Barcelona."&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Erfurt massacre (1349)]], the [[Basel massacre]], massacres in Aragon and in Flanders,&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Judaica: chronological index of Jewish history''; p. 203  Máttis Kantor - 2005 "The Jews were savagely attacked and massacred, by sometimes hysterical mobs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture''; p. 376 2006 "The period of the Black Death saw the massacre of Jews across Germany, and in Aragon, and Flanders,"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the "Valentine's Day" [[Strasbourg pogrom]] of 1349.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, «La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire» ("The greatest epidemic in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n° 310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 510 Jewish communities were destroyed during this period,&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will. ''The Renaissance'', Simon and Schuster (1953), page 730–731, {{ISBN|0-671-61600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; extending further to the [[Brussels massacre]] of 1370. On Holy Saturday of 1389, a pogrom began in [[Prague]] that led to the burning of the Jewish quarter, the killing of many Jews, and the suicide of many Jews trapped in the main synagogue; the number of dead was estimated at 400–500 men, women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Newman [https://www.academia.edu/1470909/The_Passion_of_the_Jews_of_Prague_The_Pogrom_of_1389_and_the_Lessons_of_a_Medieval_Parody_2012_ The Passion of the Jews of Prague: The Pogrom of 1389 and the Lessons of a Medieval Parody] Church History 81:1 (March 2012), 1-26&lt;/ref&gt;

The first atrocities against Jewish civilians, on a genocidal scale of destruction, were committed during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s of 1648–1657 in present-day [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Herman Rosenthal |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=469&amp;letter=C |title=Chmielnicki, Bogdan Zinovi |website=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]] |year=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern historians give estimates of the scale of the murders by Khmelnytsky's [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|Cossacks]] ranging between 40,000 and 100,000 men, women and children,&lt;ref&gt;Historians, who put the number of killed Jewish civilians at between 40,000 and 100,000 during the [[Khmelnytsky Pogrom]]s in 1648–1657, include:&lt;ol type="a" style="Margin: 0;"&gt;&lt;li&gt;{{space}} Naomi E.

The outbreak of violence against Jews ([[Hep-Hep riots]]) occurred at the beginning of the 19th century as a reaction to [[Jewish emancipation]] in the [[German Confederation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Amos Elon |first=Amos |last=Elon |year=2002 |title=The Pity of It All: A History of the Jews in Germany, 1743-1933 |location= |publisher=Metropolitan Books |isbn=0-8050-5964-4 |page=103 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further information|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire}}

The [[Russian Empire]], which previously had very few Jews, acquired territories with [[Russian Partition|large Jewish populations]] during the military [[Partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795 conducted jointly with [[Austrian Partition|the Austrian]] and [[Prussian Partition|Prussian armies]], and resulting in Poland's elimination from the geopolitical map of Europe for the next 123 years.&lt;ref name="Davies60"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |author-link=Norman Davies |title=God's Playground: a history of Poland |id=Volume II: Revised Edition |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon Press |year=2005 |chapter=Rossiya: The Russian Partition (1772–1918) |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;q=alien+imposition |pages=60–61 |isbn=978-0199253401|title-link=God's Playground }}&lt;/ref&gt; In conquered territories, a new political entity called the [[Pale of Settlement]] was formed in 1791 by [[Catherine the Great]]. Most Jewish people from the former Commonwealth were allowed to reside only within the Pale, including families expelled by royal decree from St. Petersburg, Moscow and other large Russian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0018_0_18416.html |title=Shtetl |website=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]], The Gale Group}} ''Also in:'' {{cite web |url=http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48956361.html |title=Pale of Settlement |website=History Crash Course #56  |author=Rabbi Ken Spiro |publisher=Aish.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1821 [[Odessa pogroms]] marked the beginning of the 19th century pogroms in Tsarist Russia; there were four more such pogroms in [[Odessa]] before the end of the century.

===Russian Civil War period===
Large-scale pogroms, which began in the Russian Empire several decades earlier, intensified during the period of the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Revolution of 1917]]. Professor [[Zvi Gitelman]] (''A Century of Ambivalence'') estimated that only in 1918–1919 over 1,200 pogroms took place in Ukraine, thus amounting to the greatest slaughter of Jews in Eastern Europe since 1648.&lt;ref name=Gitelman25&gt;{{cite book |last=Gitelman |first=Zvi Y. |year=2001 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3f2rng6jDW4C&amp;q=Kiev+March+1919+since+1648 |title=Revolution and the Ambiguities |id=Chapter&amp;nbsp;2 |isbn=978-0253338112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] in his book ''[[Two Hundred Years Together]]'' provided additional statistics from research conducted by [[Nahum Gergel]] (1887–1931).

The instructions issued from above had only a limited impact on soldiers' attitudes toward violence against Jews, as related by author and future Nobel laureate [[Ivan Bunin]]. On May 15, 1919, Bunin wrote in his diary about yet another massacre: {{quote|Members of the [[Red Army]] in [[Odessa]] led a pogrom against the Jewish population in the town of [[:ru:Большой Фонтан (Одесса)|Big Fountain]]. Ovsyaniko-Kulikovsky and the writer Kipen happened to be there and told me the details. Fourteen [[commissar|commissars]] and thirty Jews from among the common people were killed. Many stores were destroyed. The soldiers tore through the night, dragged the victims from their beds, and killed whomever they met. People ran into the [[steppe]] or rushed into the sea. They were chased after and fired upon – a genuine hunt, as it were. Kipen saved himself by accident – fortunately he had spent the night not in his home, but at the White Flower sanitorium. At dawn, a detachment of Red Army soldiers appeared. 'Are there any Jews here?' they asked the watchman. 'No, no Jews here.' 'Swear what you're saying is true!' The watchman swore, and they went on farther. Moisei Gutman, a cab [driver], was killed. He was a dear man who moved us from our [[dacha]] last fall.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ivan Bunin]] (1998), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Uf_yeeb97wC&amp;q=Big+Fountain Cursed Days: A Diary of Revolution.]'' May 2/15, 1919.

In the early 20th century, pogroms broke out elsewhere in the world as well. In 1904 in [[Ireland]], the [[Limerick boycott]] caused several Jewish families to leave the town. During the 1911 [[History of the Jews in Wales#Modern period|Tredegar riot]] in [[Wales]], Jewish homes and businesses were looted and burned over the period of a week, before the [[British Army]] was called in by then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Winston Churchill]], who described the riot as a "pogrom".&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; In 1919 there was a pogrom in [[Argentina]], during the [[Tragic Week (Argentina)|Tragic Week]].&lt;ref name="bookrags"/&gt;

===After World War II===
After the end of [[World War II]], a series of violent antisemitic incidents occurred against returning Jews throughout [[Europe]], particularly in the Soviet-occupied East where [[Nazi]] propagandists had extensively promoted the notion of a [[Judeo-Bolshevism|Jewish-Communist conspiracy]] (see [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946]] and [[Anti-Jewish violence in Eastern Europe, 1944–1946]]). Anti-Jewish riots also [[The Sergeants affair#Reactions in Britain|took place in Britain]] in 1947.

In the Arab world, anti-Jewish rioters killed over 140 Jews in the [[1945 Anti-Jewish Riots in Tripolitania]]. Following the start of the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]], a number of anti-Jewish events occurred throughout the Arab world, some of which have been described as pogroms. In 1947, half of Aleppo's 10,000 Jews left the city in the wake of the [[1947 Anti-Jewish riots in Aleppo|Aleppo riots]], while other anti-Jewish riots took place in [[1947 Aden riots|British Aden]] and [[1948 Anti-Jewish Riots in Oujda and Jerada|the French Moroccan cities of Oujda and Jerada]].&lt;ref name="antisemitism"/&gt;

{{see also|Definitions of pogrom}}

According to [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], "the term is usually applied to attacks on [[Jews]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, [and] the first extensive pogroms followed the assassination of [[Tsar Alexander II]] in 1881",&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; and the ''Wiley-Blackwell Dictionary of Modern European History Since 1789'' states that pogroms "were [[antisemitic]] disturbances that periodically occurred within the tsarist empire."&lt;ref name="WileyBlackwell"/&gt; However, the term is widely used to refer to many events which occurred prior to the [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]]. Historian of Russian Jewry [[John Klier]] writes in ''Russians, Jews, and the Pogroms of 1881–1882'' that "By the twentieth century, the word 'pogrom' had become a generic term in English for all forms of collective violence directed against Jews."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt; [[Henry Abramson|Abramson]] wrote that "in mainstream usage the word has come to imply an act of [[antisemitism]]", since while "Jews have not been the only group to suffer under this phenomenon&amp;nbsp;... historically Jews have been frequent victims of such violence".&lt;ref name=Abramson/&gt;

[[File:TulsaRaceRiot-1921.png|left|thumb|The 1921 [[Tulsa race riot]], which destroyed the wealthiest black community in the United States, has been described as a pogrom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-reading-ferguson-books-on-race-police-protest-and-us-history-20140818-story.html | title=Reading Ferguson: books on race, police, protest and U.S. history | accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The term is also used in reference to attacks on non-Jewish ethnic minorities, and accordingly some scholars do not include antisemitism as the defining characteristic of ''pogroms''. Reviewing its uses in scholarly literature, historian [[Werner Bergmann]] proposes that pogroms should be "defined as a ''unilateral, nongovernmental'' form of ''collective'' violence ''initiated by the majority population'' against a largely defenseless ethnic group, and he states that pogroms occur when the ''majority'' expects the state to provide them with no assistance in overcoming a (perceived) threat from the minority,"&lt;ref name="google"/&gt; but he adds that in Western usage, the word's "anti-Semitic overtones" have been retained.&lt;ref name=Bergmann/&gt;  Historian [[David Engel (historian)|David Engel]] supports this, writing that "there can be no logically or empirically compelling grounds for declaring that some particular episode does or does not merit the label [pogrom]," but states that the majority of the incidents "habitually" described as pogroms took place in societies significantly divided by ethnicity and/or religion where the violence was committed by the higher-ranking group against a stereotyped lower-ranking group against whom they expressed some complaint, and with the belief that the law of the land would not be used to stop them.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;

There is no universally accepted set of characteristics which define the term pogrom.&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bergmann2/&gt;  Klier writes that "when applied indiscriminately to events in [[Eastern Europe]], the term can be misleading, the more so when it implies that 'pogroms' were regular events in the region and that they always shared common features."&lt;ref name=Klier58/&gt;  Use of the term pogrom to refer to events in 1918–19 in Polish cities including [[Kielce pogrom (1918)|Kielce]], [[Pinsk massacre|Pinsk]] and [[Lwów pogrom (1918)|Lwów]], was specifically avoided in the 1919 [[Morgenthau Report]] and the word "excesses" was used instead because the authors argued that the use of the term "pogrom" required a situation to be [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] rather than political in nature, which meant that it was inapplicable to the conditions existing in a war zone,&lt;ref name=Engel/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pietrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pease"/&gt; and media use of the term pogrom to refer to the 1991 [[Crown Heights riot]] caused public controversy.&lt;ref name="JewishWeek"/&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conaway"/&gt; In 2008, two separate attacks in the [[West Bank]] by [[Israeli Jews|Israeli Jewish]] [[Israeli settlement|settlers]] on [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[Arab]]s were characterized as pogroms by then [[Prime Minister of Israel]] [[Ehud Olmert]].&lt;ref name="smh"&gt;"As a Jew, I was ashamed at the scenes of Jews opening fire at innocent Arabs in Hebron. There is no other definition than the term 'pogrom' to describe what I have seen."[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/settlers-attack-palestinian-village/2008/09/14/1221330653198.html Settlers attack Palestinian village]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7770384.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Middle East - Olmert condemns settler 'pogrom'|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Werner Bergmann suggests a particularly unifying characteristic of all such incidents: "[b]y the ''collective attribution'' of a threat, the pogrom differs from other forms of violence, such as [[lynching]]s, which are directed at individual members of a minority group, while the ''imbalance of power'' in favor of the rioters distinguishes pogroms from other forms of riot ([[food riot]]s, [[race riot]]s or '[[communal riot]]s' between evenly matched groups); and again, the ''low level of organization'' separates them from [[vigilantism]], [[terrorism]], [[massacre]] and [[genocide]]".&lt;ref name="international"/&gt;

To decide whether a word like ''pogrom'', for example, is an appropriate term to describe the events that are studied here, requires a comparative re-discussion of two historical frames—the Alexandria of 38 C.E. and the Russia of the end of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Alexandrian Riots of 38 C.E. and the Persecution of the Jews: A Historical Reconstruction |author=Prof. Sandra Gambetti |publisher=BRILL |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdCMH96eKwUC&amp;q=ante+litteram |pages=11–12 |isbn=978-9004138469 |location=University of California, Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scholarly research around the subject has been divided on certain points, including whether the Alexandrian Jews fought to keep their citizenship or to acquire it, whether they evaded the payment of the poll-tax or prevented any attempts to impose it on them, and whether they were safeguarding their identity against the Greeks or against the Egyptians.

Pereswetoff-Morath writes in "A Grin without a Cat" (2002) that "I feel that Birnbaum's use of the term "anti-Semitism" as well as, for example, his use of "pogrom" in references to medieval Rus are not warranted by the evidence he presents.

The first syllable, po-, is a prefix indicating "means" or "target". The word therefore seems to imply a sudden burst of energy (thunderbolt) directed at a specific target. A pogrom is generally thought of as a cross between a popular riot and a military atrocity, where an unarmed civilian, often urban, population is attacked by either an army unit or peasants from surrounding villages, or a combination of the two.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Bergmann"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=A4mqsik_VDcC&amp;pg=PA351 International handbook of violence research, Volume 1 (Springer, 2005)] "The word "pogrom" (from the Russian, meaning storm or devastation) has a relatively short history. Its international currency dates back to the anti-Semitic excesses in Tsarist Russia during the years 1881–1883, but the phenomenon existed in the same form at a much earlier date and was by no means confined to Russia. As John D. Klier points out in his seminal article "The pogrom paradigm in Russian history", the anti-Semitic pogroms in Russia were described by contemporaries as demonstrations, persecution, or struggle, and the government made use of the term besporiadok (unrest, riot) to emphasize the breach of public order. Then, during the twentieth century, the term began to develop along two separate lines. In the Soviet Union, the word lost its anti-Semitic connotation and came to be used for reactionary forms of political unrest and, from 1989, for outbreaks of interethnic violence; while in the West, the anti-Semitic overtones were retained and government orchestration or acquiescence was emphasized."&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name=Bergmann2&gt;Bergmann writes that "the concept of "ethnic violence" covers a range of heterogeneous phenomena, and in many cases there are still no established theoretical and conceptual distinctions in the field (Waldmann, 1995:343)" Bergmann then goes on to set out a variety of conflicting scholarly views on the definition and usage of the term pogrom.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7714">'''Probabilistic causation''' is a concept in a group of philosophical theories that aim to characterize the relationship between cause and effect using the tools of [[probability theory]]. The central idea behind these theories is that causes raise the probabilities of their effects, [[all else being equal]].

==Deterministic versus probabilistic theory==
Interpreting [[causality|causation]] as a [[Causal determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must ''always'' be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation.  Informally, ''A'' probabilistically causes ''B'' if ''A'''s occurrence increases the probability of ''B''.  This is sometimes interpreted to reflect imperfect knowledge of a deterministic system but other times interpreted to mean that the causal system under study has an inherently [[indeterministic]]  nature. ([[Propensity probability]] is an analogous idea, according to which probabilities have an objective existence and are not just limitations in a subject's knowledge).

Philosophers such as [[Hugh Mellor]]&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, D.H. (1995) ''The Facts of Causation'', Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-19756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Patrick Suppes]]&lt;ref name=suppes&gt;Suppes, P. (1970) ''A Probabilistic Theory of Causality'', Amsterdam: North-Holland Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; have defined causation in terms of a cause preceding and increasing the probability of the effect. (Additionally, Mellor claims that cause and effect are both facts - not events - since even a non-event, such as the failure of a train to arrive, can cause effects such as my taking the bus.  Suppes, by contrast, relies on events defined set-theoretically, and much of his discussion is informed by this terminology.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Interpretations of Probability'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearl&lt;ref name=Pearl&gt;Pearl, Judea (2000).  ''Causality:  Models, Reasoning, and Inference,'' Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the entire enterprise of probabilistic causation has been misguided from the very beginning, because the central notion that causes "raise the probabilities" of their effects cannot be expressed in the language of probability theory. In particular, the inequality ''Pr(effect | cause) &gt; Pr(effect | ~cause)'' which philosophers invoked to define causation, as well as its many variations and nuances, fails to capture the intuition behind "probability raising", which is inherently a manipulative or counterfactual notion. 
The correct formulation, according to Pearl, should read:&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;
       ''Pr(effect | do(cause)) &gt; Pr(effect | do(~cause))''&lt;/center&gt;
where ''do(C)'' stands for an external intervention that compels the truth of ''C''. The conditional probability ''Pr(E | C)'', in contrast, represents a probability resulting from a passive observation of ''C'', and rarely coincides with ''Pr(E | do(C))''. Indeed, observing the barometer falling increases the probability of a storm coming, but does not
"cause" the storm; were the act of manipulating the barometer to change the probability of storms, the falling barometer would qualify as a cause of storms. In general, formulating the notion of "probability raising" within the calculus of ''do''-operators&lt;ref name=Pearl /&gt; resolves the difficulties that probabilistic causation has encountered in the past half-century,&lt;ref name=suppes /&gt;&lt;ref name=cartwright&gt;Cartwright, N. (1989). ''Nature's Capacities and Their Measurement,'' Claredon Press, Oxnard.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eells&gt;Eells, E. (1991). ''Probabilistic Causality'' Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; among them the infamous [[Simpson's paradox]], and clarifies precisely what relationships exist between probabilities and causation.

The establishing of cause and effect, even with this relaxed reading, is notoriously difficult, expressed by the widely accepted statement "[[Correlation does not imply causation]]". For instance, the observation that smokers have a dramatically increased lung cancer rate does not establish that smoking must be a ''cause'' of that increased cancer rate: maybe there exists a certain genetic defect which both causes cancer and a yearning for nicotine; or even perhaps nicotine craving is a symptom of very early-stage lung cancer which is not otherwise detectable. Scientists are always seeking the exact mechanisms by which Event ''A'' produces Event ''B''. But scientists also are comfortable making a statement like, "Smoking probably causes cancer," when the statistical correlation between the two, according to probability theory, is far greater than chance. In this dual approach, scientists accept both deterministic and probabilistic causation in their terminology.

In [[statistics]], it is generally accepted that observational studies (like counting cancer cases among smokers and among non-smokers and then comparing the two) can give hints, but can never ''establish'' cause and effect. Often, however, qualitative causal assumptions (e.g., absence of causation between some variables) may permit the derivation of consistent 
causal effect estimates from observational studies.&lt;ref name=Pearl /&gt;

The gold standard for causation here is the ''randomized experiment'': take a large number of people, randomly divide them into two groups, force one group to smoke and prohibit the other group from smoking, then determine whether one group develops a significantly higher lung cancer rate. Random assignment plays a crucial role in the inference to causation because, in the long run, it renders the two groups equivalent in terms of all other possible effects on the outcome (cancer) so that any changes in the outcome will reflect only the manipulation (smoking).  Obviously, for ethical reasons this [[experiment]] cannot be performed, but the method is widely applicable for less damaging experiments.  One limitation of experiments, however, is that whereas they do a good job of testing for the presence of some causal effect they do less well at estimating the size of that effect in a population of interest.  (This is a common criticism of studies of safety of food additives that use doses much higher than people consuming the product would actually ingest.)

==Closed versus open systems==

In a [[closed system]] the data may suggest that cause '''A * B''' precedes effect '''C''' in a defined interval of time '''τ'''.  This relationship can determine causality with confidence bounded by '''τ'''.  However, this same relationship may not be deterministic with confidence in an open system where uncontrolled factors may affect the result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-probabilistic/#MarCon Markov Condition: ''Interpretations of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

An example would be a system of A, B and C, where A, B and C are known. Characteristics are below and limited to a given time (such as 50 ms, or 50 hours):

^A * ^ B =&gt; ^ C (99.9999998027%)

A * ^B =&gt; ^C (99.9999998027%)

^A * B =&gt; ^C (99.9999998027%)

A * B =&gt; C (99.9999998027%)

One can reasonably claim, within 6 [[Standard Deviation]]s, that A * B cause C given the time boundary (such as 50 ms, or 50 hours) '''IF And Only IF''' A, B and C are the '''only''' parts of the system in question.  Any result outside of this may be considered a deviation.

'''Quasi-empirical methods''' are [[methodology|methods]] applied in [[science]] and [[mathematics]] to achieve [[epistemology]] similar to that of [[empiricism]] (thus ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]] + empirical'') when [[experience]] cannot [[falsifiability|falsify]] the ideas involved. [[Empirical research]] relies on [[empirical evidence]], and its empirical methods involve [[experiment]]ation and disclosure of apparatus for [[reproducibility]], by which scientific findings are [[verification and validation|validated]] by other scientists. Empirical methods are studied extensively in the [[philosophy of science]], but they cannot be used directly in fields whose hypotheses cannot be falsified by real experiment (for example, [[mathematics]], [[philosophy]], [[theology]], and [[ideology]]). Because of such [[empirical limits in science]], the [[scientific method]] must rely not only on empirical methods but sometimes also on quasi-empirical ones. The prefix ''[[wikt:quasi-#Prefix|quasi-]]'' came to denote methods that are "almost" or "socially approximate" an ideal of truly empirical methods.

It is unnecessary to find all counterexamples to a theory; all that is required to disprove a theory logically is one counterexample. The converse does not prove a theory; [[Bayesian inference]] simply makes a theory more likely, by weight of evidence.

One can argue that no science is capable of finding all counter-examples to a theory, therefore, no science is strictly empirical, it's all quasi-empirical. But usually, the term "quasi-empirical" refers to the means of choosing problems to focus on (or ignore), selecting prior work on which to build an argument or proof, notations for informal claims, peer review and acceptance, and incentives to discover, ignore, or correct errors.  These are common to both [[science]] and [[mathematics]], and do not include experimental method.

[[Albert Einstein]]'s discovery of the [[general relativity]] theory relied upon [[thought experiments]] and [[mathematics]]. Empirical methods only became relevant when confirmation was sought. Furthermore, some empirical confirmation was found only some time after the general acceptance of the theory.

Thought experiments are almost standard procedure in [[philosophy]], where a conjecture is tested out in the imagination for possible effects on experience; when these are thought to be implausible,  unlikely to occur, or not actually occurring, then the conjecture may be either rejected or amended.  [[Logical positivism]] was a perhaps extreme version of this practice, though this claim is open to debate.

Post-20th-century [[philosophy of mathematics]] is mostly concerned with [[quasi-empiricism in mathematics|quasi-empirical mathematical methods]], especially as reflected in the actual [[mathematical practice]] of working mathematicians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15240">The concept of '''relation''' as a term used in general philosophy has a long and complicated history. One of the interests for the Greek philosophers lay in the number of ways in which a particular thing might be described, and the establishment of a relation between one thing and another was one of these. A second interest lay in the difference between these relations and the things themselves. This was to culminate in the view that the things in themselves could not be known except through their relations. Debates similar to these continue into modern philosophy and include further investigations into types of relation and whether relations exist only in the mind or the real world or both.

An understanding of types of relation is important to an understanding of relations between many things including those between people, communities and the wider world. Most of these are complex relations but of the simpler, analytical relations out of which they are formed there are generally held to be three types, although opinion on the number may differ. The three types are spatial relations which include geometry and number, relations of cause and effect, and the classificatory relations of similarity and difference that underlie knowledge. Going by different names in the sciences,&lt;ref&gt;Perreault J. ''Categories and Relators'' (''International Classification'', vol 21, No 4, Frankfurt 1994) pp.189ff where Perreault talks of ordinal relations (e.g. dimensions), determinative relations (e.g. activities) and subsumptive relations (e.g. types and kinds)&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;Piaget J. ''Structuralism'' (tr. Maschler C., Routledge and Kegan Paul, London 1971) pp 24-25 where [[Jean Piaget]] refers to the mathematicians, [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], using topological structures (derived from geometrical relations), order structures (from predecessor-successor relations) and algebraic structures (including sets and sub-sets)&lt;/ref&gt; and the arts &lt;ref&gt;Norberg-Schulz C., ''Intentions in Architecture'' (Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., London 1963) Besides such headings as Form (geometrical and spatial relations), Building Task (functional relations) and Semantics (relations of meaning) the book refers to [[Charles W. Morris]]'s division of semiology into syntactics (formal relation of signs), pragmatics (use and effect of signs) and semantics (the relation between the sign and reality)&lt;/ref&gt;  they can be thought of as three large families and it is the history of these that will be dealt with here.

==Ancient Greeks==
Traditionally the history of the concept of relation begins with [[Aristotle]] and his concept of relative terms. In ''Metaphysics'' he states: "Things are called relative as the double to the half... as that which can act to that which can be acted upon... and as the knowable to knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 1020b; cf De Generatione 333a&lt;/ref&gt; It has been argued that the content of these three types can be traced back to the [[Parmenides (dialogue)|Eleatic Dilemmas]], a series of puzzles through which the world can be explained in totally opposite ways, for example things can be both one and many, both moving and stationary and both like and unlike one another.&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Parmenides'' 129, cf 136&lt;/ref&gt;

For Aristotle relation was one of ten distinct kinds of [[Categories (Aristotle)|predicate]] (Gk. ''kategorien'') which list the range of things that can be said about any particular subject: "...each signifies either substance or quantity or  quality or relation or where or when or being-in-a-position or having or acting or being acted upon".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Categories'' in ''Aristotle's Categories and De Interpretatione'' (tr. Ackrill J.L., Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1963) Ch.4&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects and predicates were combined together to form simple propositions. These were later redefined as "categorical" propositions in order to distinguish them from two other types of proposition, the disjunctive and the hypothetical, identified a little later by [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;Long A. &amp; Sedley D. ''The Hellenistic Philosophers'' (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1987) p.206&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative strand of thought at the time was that relation was more than just one of ten equal categories. A fundamental opposition was developing between substance and relation.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''Metaphysics'' 998b ff; cf 1029a &amp; 1070a; ''Physics'' 185a; ''Analytica Posteriora'' 83b&lt;/ref&gt; Plato in ''Theaetetus'' had noted that "some say all things are said to be relative" &lt;ref&gt;Long &amp; Sedley, ''op.cit''. p.480&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Speusippus]], his nephew and successor at the Academy maintained the view that "... a thing cannot be known apart from the knowledge of other things, for to know what a thing is, we must know how it differs from other things".&lt;ref&gt;Ex Brit cv ''Speusippus''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plotinus]] in third century Alexandria reduced Aristotle's categories to five: substance, relation, quantity, motion and quality.&lt;ref name="enneads"&gt;Plotinus ''Enneads''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|VI.3.3, VI.3.21}} He gave further emphasis to the distinction between substance and relation and stated that there were grounds for the latter three: quantity, motion and quality to be considered as relations. Moreover, these latter three categories were posterior to the Eleatic categories, namely unity/plurality; motion/stability and identity/difference concepts that Plotinus called "the hearth of reality".&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|V.1.4}}

Plotinus liked to picture relations as lines linking elements, but in a process of abstraction our minds tend to ignore the lines "and think only of their terminals".&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|VI.5.5}} His pupil and biographer, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], developed a tree analogy picturing the relations of knowledge as a tree branching from the highest genera down through intermediate species to the individuals themselves.&lt;ref name="enneads"/&gt;{{rp|V.3.10, V.6.1}}

==Scholasticism to the Enlightenment==
The opposition between substance and relation was given a theological perspective in the Christian era. [[Basil of Caesarea|Basil]] in the Eastern church suggested that an understanding of the [[Trinity]] lay more in understanding the types of relation existing between the three members of the Godhead than in the nature of the Persons themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas ''Summa Theologiae'' (Blackfriars, 1967) p.30 (note); cf St.Augustine ''The Trinity'' (Catholic University of America Press, 1963) p.180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Aquinas]] in the Western church noted that in God "relations are real",&lt;ref name="gilby"&gt;Gilby T. ''St. Thomas Aquinas: Theological Texts'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}} and, echoing Aristotle, claimed that there were indeed three type of relation which give a natural order to the world. These were quantity, as in double and half; activity, as in acting and being acted upon; and understanding, through the qualitative concepts of genus and species.&lt;ref name="gilby"/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2017}} "Some have said that relation is not a reality but only an idea. But this is plainly seen to be false from the very fact that things themselves have a mutual natural order and relation... There are three conditions that make a relation to be real or logical ..." &lt;ref&gt;Pegis A.C. ''Introduction to St. Thomas Aquinas'' (Random House, 1948) S.T. Q13.A7&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the Scholastic period marked the beginning of a decline in the pre-eminence of the classificatory relation as a way of explaining the world. Science was now in the ascendant and with it scientific reason and the relation of cause and effect. In Britain, [[John Locke]], influenced by Isaac Newton and the laws of motion, developed a similar mechanistic view of the human mind. Following [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]'s notion of "trains of thought"&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes T. ''Leviathan'' (Blackwell, Oxford, 1946) p.13&lt;/ref&gt; where one idea naturally follows another in the mind, Locke developed further the concept of knowledge as the perception of relations between ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Locke J. ''Essay Concerning Human Understanding'' (J.F.Dove, London, 1828) pp. 367-372; 4.1.2-4.1.7&lt;/ref&gt; These relations included mathematical relations, scientific relations such as co-existence and succession, and the relations of identity and difference.

It was left to the Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] to reduce these kinds of [[Association of Ideas|mental association]] to three: "To me there appears to be only three principles of connexion among ideas namely Resemblance, Contiguity in time or place, and Cause or Effect".&lt;ref&gt;Hume D. ''An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'' (Cohen R. (ed.) Bantam, London, 1965) p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

The problem which troubled Hume of being able to establish the reality of relations from experience, in particular the relation of cause and effect, was solved in another way by [[Immanuel Kant]] who took the view that our knowledge is only partly derived from the external world. Part of our knowledge he argued must be due to the modifying nature of our own minds which imposes on perception not only the forms of space and time but also the categories of relation which he understood to be ''a priori'' concepts contained within the understanding. Of these he famously said: "Everything in our knowledge... contains nothing but mere relations".&lt;ref name="kant"&gt;Kant I. ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (tr. Smith N.K., Macmillan, London, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87}}

Kant took a more analytical view of the concept of relation and his categories of relation were three namely, community, causality and inherence.&lt;ref name="kant"/&gt;{{rp|113}} These can be compared with Hume's three kinds of association in that, firstly, community depicts elements conjoined in time and space, secondly causality compares directly with cause and effect, and thirdly inherence implies the relation of a quality to its subject and plays an essential part in any consideration of the concept of resemblance. Preceding the table of categories in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' is the table of judgements and here, under the heading of relation, are the three types of [[syllogism]] namely the [[Disjunctive syllogism|disjunctive]], the [[Hypothetical syllogism|hypothetical]] and the [[Categorical proposition|categorical]],&lt;ref name="kant"/&gt;{{rp|107, 113}} developed as we have seen through Aristotle, Chryssipus and the logicians of the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Peter of Spain (author)|Peter of Spain]] and [[William of Sherwood]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] raised objections to the term Community and the term disjunction, as a relation, can be usefully substituted for the more complex concept of community.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer A. ''The World as Will and Representation'' (tr. Payne E., Dover Publications, New York, 1966) p.459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|G.W.F.Hegel]] also referred to three types of proposition but in Hegel the categories of relation which for Kant were "subjective mental processes" have now become "objective ontological entities".&lt;ref&gt;Stace W.T. ''The Philosophy of Hegel'' (Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1924) p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern developments in philosophy==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S. Peirce]] in America recorded that his own categories of relation grew originally out of a study of Kant. He introduced three metaphysical categories which pervaded his philosophy, and these were ordered through a consideration of the development of our mental processes:

* Firstness. "The first is predominant in feeling... the whole content of consciousness is made up of qualities of feeling as truly as the whole of space is made up of points or the whole of time by instants".&lt;ref name="peirce"&gt;Peirce C.S. ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' (Hartshorne C. &amp; Weiss P. (eds.) Harvard University Press, 1931) Vol I&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149–159}}  Consciousness in a sense arises through the gradual disjunction of what was once whole. Elements appear to be monadic in character and are represented as points in space and time.
* Secondness. The idea of secondness "is predominant in the ideas of causation" coming into being as "an action and reaction" between ourselves and some other, or between ourselves and a stimulus.&lt;ref name="peirce"/&gt;{{rp|159–163}}  It is essentially dyadic in character and in some versions of symbolic logic is represented by an arrow.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein ''op.cit''. pp.23 &amp; 61&lt;/ref&gt;
* Thirdness. "Ideas in which thirdness predominates include the idea of a [[Semiotics|sign]] or representation... For example, a picture signifies by similarity".&lt;ref&gt;Peirce ''op.cit''. pp. 170-176&lt;/ref&gt; This type of relation is essentially triadic in nature and is represented in Peirce's logic as a brace or bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce ''op.cit.'' Vol II, p.159; cf Wittgenstein ''op.cit.'' p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

These categories of relation appeared in Peirce's logic of relatives and followed earlier work undertaken by the mathematician [[Augustus De Morgan]] at Cambridge who had introduced the notion of relation into formal logic in 1849. Among the philosophers who followed may be mentioned [[Thomas Hill Green|T.H Green]] in England who took the view that all reality lies in relations and [[William James]] in America who, emphasising the concept of relation, pictured the world as a "concatenated unity" with some parts joined and other parts disjoined.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore J. ''A Hundred Years of Philosophy'', 1957 (Penguin, 1968) pp.58,108, ; cf Peirce ''op.cit''. Vol II, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bertrand Russell]], in 1921, reinforced James's view that "... the raw material out of which the world is built up, is not of two sorts, one matter and one mind but that it is designed in different patterns by its interrelations, and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical".&lt;ref&gt;Russell B. ''Analysis of Mind'' (George Allen &amp; Unwin, London 1921) pp.10 &amp; 23&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], also in 1921, saw the same kinds of relation structuring both the material world and the mental world. While the real world consisted of objects and their relations which combined together to form facts, the mental world consisted of similar subjects and predicates which pictured or described the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Tractatus Logico Philosophicus'', 1921 (Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1961) p.37&lt;/ref&gt; For Wittgenstein there were three kinds of description (enumeration, function and law) which themselves bear a notable if distant "family resemblance" to the three kinds of relation whose history we have been following.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein L. ''Philosophical Investigations'', 1953 (tr. Anscombe G., Blackwell, Oxford, 1978) p.32 ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Also of note at the beginning of the twentieth century were arguments associated with [[George Edward Moore|G.E.Moore]] among others concerning the concept of internal and external relations whereby relations could be seen as either contingent or accidental parts of the definition of a thing.&lt;ref&gt;Passmore ''op.cit''. p.207&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Role conflict''' occurs when there are incompatible demands placed upon a person such that compliance with both would be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, D., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1978). The social psychology of organizations 2ed. New York City: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons experience role conflict when they find themselves pulled in various directions as they try to respond to the many statuses they hold.&lt;ref name="Gerber &amp; Macionis"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerber |first1=Linda M. |last2=Macionis |first2=John J. |title=Sociology |date=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |isbn=978-0-13-800270-1 |page=129 |edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Role conflict can be something that can be for either a short period of time, or a long period of time, and it can also be connected to situational experiences.{{Explain|date=December 2017}}

Intra-role conflict occurs when the demands are within a single domain of life, such as on the job. An example would be when two superiors ask an employee to do a task, and both cannot be accomplished at the same time. Inter-role conflict occurs across domains of life. An example of inter-role conflict would be a husband and father who is also Chief of Police. If a tornado strikes the small town he is living in, the man has to decide if he should go home and be with his family and fulfill the role of being a good husband and father or remain and fulfill the duties of a "good" Chief of Police because the whole town needs his expertise."&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/peters-mothers.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times|title=When Mothers Work: Loving Our Children Without Sacrificing Our Selves|author=Peters, Joan K.|isbn= 0-201-12794-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conflict among the roles begins because of the human desire to reach success, and because of the pressure put on an individual by two imposing and incompatible demands competing against each other. The effects of role conflict, as found through case-studies and nationwide surveys, are related to individual personality characteristics and interpersonal relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kahn|first=R.L.|author2=Wolfe D.M. |author3=Quinn R.P. |author4=Snoek J.D. |author5=Rosenthal R.A. |title=Organizational stress: studies in role conflict and ambiguity|journal=APA PsycNET|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual personality characteristic conflicts can arise within personality role conflict where "aspects of an individual's personality are in conflict with other aspects of that same individual's personality".&lt;ref name="Truett"/&gt; Interpersonal relations can cause conflict because they are by definition "having an association between two or more people that may range from fleeting to enduring, which can cause that conflict."

Example: "People in modern, high-income countries juggle many responsibilities demanded by their various statuses and roles.  As most mothers can testify both parenting and working outside the home are physically and emotionally draining.  Sociologists thus recognize role conflict as conflict among the roles corresponding to two or more statuses".&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

The discipline of [[group dynamics]] in psychology recognizes role conflict within a group setting.  Members of a group may feel that they are responsible for more than one role within this setting and that these roles may become disagreeable with each other.  When the expectations of two or more roles are incompatible, role conflict exists.  For example, a supervisor at a factory may feel strain due to his or her role as friend and mentor to the subordinate employees, while having to exhibit a stern and professional watchful eye over the employees.

==Work–family conflict==
A commonly noted role conflict is that between [[Work–family conflict|work and family]]. Researchers have noticed a [[Income and fertility#Paradox|declining fertility rate]] in developed countries. Some studies suggest that this drop may be because more women are pursuing careers and obtaining educations. The research is trying to show that women who have more trouble balancing their work life and family duties go on to have fewer additional children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hynes|first=K.M.|author2=Liu S. |title=Are difficulties in balancing work and family associated with subsequent fertility?|journal=Education Resources Information Center|year=2012|url=http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/recordDetails.jsp?ERICExtSearch_Descriptor=%22Role+Conflict%22&amp;_pageLabel=RecordDetails&amp;objectId=0900019b8049b6ad&amp;accno=EJ953811&amp;_nfls=false|accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While some people believe that work–family role conflict only occurs for women, a 2008 study by the Families and Work Institute showed that 49% of employed males with families experienced work–family conflict. The study also showed that work flexibility is the number one concern for employed females with families and the number two or three issue for employed men with families. Flexibility in the workplace can be a huge relief to a person struggling to balance their career and home-life. Having that control is something that could change the relationship between work and family life to better be able to manage role conflict, and if more business participated in this action there could be a possible better outcome for all.&lt;ref name="Dell'Antonia"/&gt; Another study was done in France where the same common conflict of work and family life roles were interfering to an extreme. This study found that not even working from home was the solution, but to be able to come in late or leave early, on a flexible schedule is what was working best to be able to handle the role conflict.  Having this sort of flex schedule enables people to be able to work with their role conflicts and try to better be able to manage and cope with them. Again this study supports that if businesses do create this sort of flex schedule that this could be a definite possible solution.&lt;ref name="Dell'Antonia"/&gt;

Role conflict requirements for different roles might compete for a person's limited time, or could occur due to various strains associated with multiple roles. Some people can play one role and play it well while others can play multiple roles and also play them well. For example, we see a father as the provider and the protector while we see the women as the housewives, cooking and cleaning. If a man were to enter into the kitchen and proceed to cook, we might feel that he is acting inappropriately for his role and the same goes as if a woman was to do handy work in the household. This attitude is a root cause for the conflict many women feel when they become full-time workers and mothers. Women's rights have evolved greatly in the past forty years and women share most of the same rights as men. While women have stepped up to fill different roles, men have not stepped in to help balance out the work load. Modern day mothers are expected to be able have the career capacity of a man and the domestic grace modeled after the ideal mother/wife of the 1950s. Realistically, women have a hard time balancing the two. Many women feel that they are forced to choose between career and family, then are made to feel guilty about their choice by society.&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt;

==Social factors among low-income adults==
When one has multiple role responsibilities, duties or demands from education, job or family relationships, it can be hard to manage. Additionally, the responsibilities are manageable while other times it can be hard to manage especially when one is living in a low income household.

==Homeless men and gender==

[[Homelessness]] is a situation that takes a heavy toll on anyone, especially men with children or dependents. Traditional gender roles describe men as being the providers. Homeless men are often unemployed thus lack the means to provide the resources that their family needs. This can cause high levels of distress in men. Homeless men may also become the sole caregiver of their children during homelessness. This can lead to high stress levels in men because they are expected to take on the role of both provider and nurturer. The transition can be very overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;https://pantherfile.uwm.edu/margo/public/984/Fall2009/articles/HomelessDuncan.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In prisons==
[[Prison]]s are filled predominantly with male inmates. This may be due to the dominant construction of masculinity, which inclines males to criminality and violence. Dominant masculinity is symbolized by control, independence, heterosexuality, aggressiveness, authority, and a capacity for violence in American culture. When a male finds themselves lacking in one of these areas they may be driven to make up for it in another area; such as when a poor, jobless young man tries to show masculinity by carrying a gun or wearing gang related clothing. When one is in prison, many of the resources use to assert masculinity are not readily available, thus men seek other ways to proclaim their masculinity. Many inmates find in imperative to put on a mask of hyper-masculinity, which may conflict with their normal personality, in order to maintain their status within the prison. This expectation to maintain a certain idea of masculinity "contradict[s] basic human needs and desires for intimacy and emotional expression, creating stress and conflict between men's core selves and social expectations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Karp, David R.|url=http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Karp%20Vitae_files/Unlocking_Masculinities.pdf|title=Unlocking Men, Unmasking Masculinities: Doing Men's Work in Prison|journal=The Journal of Men's Studies|volume=18|number=1|pages=63–83|year=2010|access-date=2012-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032445/http://www.skidmore.edu/~dkarp/Karp%20Vitae_files/Unlocking_Masculinities.pdf|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Role conflict is seen not only in the inmates of the prison, but also the prison personnel. There are two types of prisons: custody prisons and treatment prisons. The main goal of a custody prison is to protect the community by maintaining control over the inmates. The correctional officers are expected to maintain order, enforce rules, and keep custody. A key rule to their job is that interaction between inmates and officers is to remain distant. The main goal of a treatment prison is to protect the community by rehabilitating the inmate. The Officers are expected to respond to inmates in a therapeutic manner and develop ties with the inmates. Currently prisons are combining the two types of custody and the staff is experiencing role conflict. Officers are being asked to do conflicting jobs such as remain socially distant while also building close, supportive relationships with inmates. This emphasis on the combination of custody and treatment often results in two distinguished, mutually antagonistic groups of staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hepburn, J. R.; Albonetti, C.|title=Role Conflict in Correctional Institutions: An Empirical Examination of the Treatment-Custody Dilemma Among Correctional Staff|url=http://www.jwalkonline.org/docs/Grad%20Classes/Survey/articles/psyclimate/not%20used/role%20conflict%20in%20correctional.pdf|journal=Criminology|volume=17|issue=4|pages=445–460|year=1980|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1980.tb01308.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role clarity and role ambiguity==
One of the main causes of role conflict is role ambiguity, which is the lack of certainty in what a certain role in an organization requires. This can be the result or poor communication of job duties or unclear instructions from a supervisor. This can lead to role conflict when there are contradicting ideas as to what tasks are supposed to be accomplished. Team members can then be uncertain of their role and their teammate’s roles to the team and team objectives begin to conflict with one another.

The solution to this problem and role conflict as a whole can come from role clarity. As its name suggests, role clarity is clearly defining roles and objectives so as to reduce role conflict and role ambiguity. To do this, employers need to clearly communicate with employees as to the goals of a project. Also, employees should be fully aware of their role in the group and their responsibilities. It is helpful if one develops and maintains a working environment where workers have communication and if needed, feedback can be provided. Encouragement is another form of clarity. If one has a question or is not clear about a specific role that has been given to them, workers can communicate. Make sure the person understands their roles and duties to avoid any mistakes that can occur, and ensure that workers have an up-to-date role so they can manage their roles accordingly.

==Within a workplace==
Working with groups – especially in a work or committee setting – can sometimes result in role conflict if an individual feels that his or her roles are in opposition.  These roles may be in conflict for many reasons.  For example, the role taker may misunderstand the role sender's prescribed tasks or the miscommunication can occur the other way, as well.  If a role taker is seemingly enthusiastic about taking on many tasks within various roles, this may be communicated to the role sender and he or she may be given conflicting role requirements.  Role conflict can pair with role ambiguity – a situation in which the expectations of a role are ill-defined – to create role stress, which is detrimental to workplace performance.  Role stress has also been linked to decreased job satisfaction and employee turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Kemery, [[Arthur G. Bedeian|Bedeian]], Mossholder &amp; Touliatos, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid role conflict within a work place, managers should outline specifically the duties required by an employee to avoid any miscommunication or confusion.  Feedback should also be provided to employees, as this explicitly illustrates if the role-taker is properly performing the role requirements and can assist the role-taker if there are any concerns.  Steps should be taken to avoid the crossover of potentially conflicting roles and if two or more roles are required of an employee, these roles should be separated by time and place if possible.

==Work performance==
{{Main|Job performance}}
Role conflict can have many different effects on the work-life of an individual as well as their family-life. In a study in Taiwan, it was found that those suffering from role conflict also suffered greatly in their work performance, mainly in the form of lack of [[motivation]]. Those with role conflict did not do more than the bare minimum requirements at work. There was also a decline in the ability to assign tasks. Having multiple roles will often lead to job dissatisfaction. 

Experiencing role conflict within the work place may also lead to [[workplace bullying]]. When companies undergo organizational change workers often experience either a loss or a gain in areas of a workers job, thus changing the expectations of the worker. Change is often very [[Occupational stress|stressful]] for workers. Workers who might have lost a degree of power may feel like they lost their authority and begin to lash out at other employees by being verbally abusive, purposefully withholding work related items, or sometimes even physically to withhold their status.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Dombeck, Ph.D. (July 24, 2007) [https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/the-long-term-effects-of-bullying/ 
The Long Term Effects Of Bullying] Retrieved 6 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter-role==
Interpersonal role conflict occurs when the source of the dilemma stems from occupancy of more than one focal position. For example, as a husband and a father in a social system a superintendent may think his wife and children expect him to spend most of his evenings with them. However, his school board and P.T.A. groups, he may feel, expect him (as their school superintendent) to spend most of his after-office hours on educational and civic activities. The superintendent usually cannot satisfy both of these incompatible expectations.&lt;ref name=Mackey&gt;{{cite thesis|author=Mackey, B. A.|year=1977|title=Application of role conflict theory to the role expectations held for the dean of students by various reference groups|type=Doctoral dissertation|publisher=University of Florida|url=https://archive.org/stream/applicationofrol00mack}}. Available from University of Florida, George A. Smathers Libraries (applicationofrol00mack).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intra-role==
Intra-personal role conflict occurs when an individual in one role believes that others have many different expectations for him/her in regards to that role. "The school superintendent, for example, may feel that the teachers expect him to be their spokesperson and leader, to take their side on such matters as salary increases and institutional policy. However, the superintendent may feel that the school board members expect him to represent them, to "sell" their views to the staff because he is the executive officer and the administrator of school board policies".&lt;ref name=Mackey/&gt;

==Coping==
"Inter-role conflict results from competing sets of expectations that are aroused by organizational, interpersonal, and personal conflicts"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mertensmeyer, C., &amp; Coleman, M.|year=1987|title=Correlates of inter-role conflict in young rural and urban parents |edition=4 |volume= 36|pages=425–429|journal=Family Relations|location=Minneapolis|publisher=National Council of Family Relations|doi=10.2307/584495|jstor=584495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following strategies assist in modifying and managing these areas.

One response to role conflict is deciding that something has to go. More than one politician, for example, has decided not to run for office because of the conflicting demands of a hectic campaign schedule and family life. In other cases, people put off having children in order to stay on the fast track for career success.&lt;ref&gt;John Macionis, Gerber,  John, Linda (2010). Sociology 7th Canadian Ed. Toronto, Ontario: Pearson Canada Inc. pp. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
Even the roles linked to a single status can make competing demands on us. A plant supervisor may enjoy being friendly with workers. At the same time, distance is necessary to evaluate his staff.&lt;ref name="Macionis"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

An individual can alter external, structurally imposed expectations held by others, regarding the appropriate behavior of a person in his or her position.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite journal|ref=harv|last=Hall|first=D. T.|year=1972|title=A model of coping with role conflict: The role behavior of college educated women|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|volume=17|issue=04|pages=471–486|jstor=2393827|doi=10.2307/2393827}}{{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The most effective alteration is change in the workplace. If the job is a "family-friendly" environment, the needs of a parent may be met easier. One of the biggest stress-relievers for working parents is [[paid time off]] including family sick days. A parent may feel trapped if he or she needs to stay home with their child but knows that missing a day of work will, in return, dock them a day of pay. If they have a few days of paid leave they will be able to take care of their child and not have to worry about losing money for doing so. 
Another workplace support of work-family conflict is child-care. Some jobs have a daycare facility on site or nearby, assisting parents in knowing their children are well taken care of while they are working.  The latter example distributes role expectations to others in order to alleviate role conflict.

"Another approach involves changing one's attitude toward and perceptions of one's role expectations, as opposed to changing the expectations themselves. An example is setting priorities among and within roles, being sure that certain demands are always met (for example, the needs of sick children), while others have lower priority (such as dusting furniture)."&lt;ref name="Hall"/&gt;

{{Sociology}}
The '''ruling class''' is the [[social class]] of a given [[society]] that decides upon and sets that society's [[political agenda]].

[[sociology|Sociologist]] [[C. Wright Mills]] (1916–1962) argued that the ruling class differs from the [[power elite]]. The latter simply refers to the small group of people with the most political power. Many of them are politicians, hired political managers and/or military leaders. The ruling class are people who directly influence politics, education and government with the use of wealth or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codevilla|first1=Angelo|title=America’s Ruling Class — And the Perils of Revolution |journal=The American Spectator|volume=2|issue=July 2010|pages=19|url=http://spectator.org/articles/39326/americas-ruling-class-and-perils-revolution|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
Analogous to the class of the major capitalists, other [[mode of production|modes of production]] give rise to different ruling classes: under [[feudalism]] it was the feudal lords while under [[slavery]] it was the slave-owners. Under the feudal society, feudal lords had power over the vassals because of their control of the fiefs. This gave them political and military power over the people. In slavery, because complete rights of the person's life belonged to the slave owner, they could and did every implementation that would help the production in the farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USASownership.htm|title=Slave Ownership&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202306/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USASownership.htm|archivedate=2007-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his recent studies on elites in contemporary societies, [[Mattei Dogan]] has argued that because of their complexity and their heterogeneity and particularly because of the social division of work and the multiple levels of stratification, there is not, or can not be, a coherent ruling class, even if in the past there were solid examples of ruling classes as in the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s and the more recent [[totalitarian]] regimes of the 20th century ([[Communism|Communist]] and [[Fascism|Fascist]]).

[[Milovan Djilas]] said that in a Communist regime the [[nomenklatura]] form a ruling class, which "benefited from the use, enjoyment, and disposition of material goods", thus controls all of the property and thus all of the wealth of the nation. Furthermore, he argued, the Communist bureaucracy was not an accidental mistake, but the central inherent aspect of the Communist system since a Communist regime would not be possible without the system of bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XicFgasYzWQC&amp;pg=PT5&amp;lpg=PT5&amp;dq=barbarism+and+civilization:+a+history+of+europe+in+our+time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w4XEEvVUgQ&amp;sig=E4qsoffdiIi9oFkZx_Vv4vFIs_s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fxuSVPKfNtSBygSoiYHQAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=nomenklatura&amp;f=false|title=Barbarism and Civilization: A History of Europe in our Time|first=Bernard|last=Wasserstein|date=12 February 2009|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191622519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Globalization]] theorists argue that today a [[transnational capitalist class]] has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf Transnational Capitalist Class&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816014925/http://www.uweb.ucsb.edu/~jhsprague/Sprague_Jeb_2009_Globalizations_Interview_with_Leslie_Sklair.pdf |date=2010-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
There are several examples of ruling class systems in movies, novels and television shows. The 2005 American independent film ''[[The American Ruling Class]]'' written by former ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' editor Lewis Lapham and directed by John Kirby is a semi-documentary that examines how the American economy is structured and for whom. The 2017 Philippine political crime-suspense epic ''[[Wildflower (TV series)|Wildflower]]'' is about a rich influential and corrupt political family the Ardientes ruling over a town where a wave of murders and crimes which they have committed washed over.

Society, in the novel ''[[Brave New World]]'', by [[Aldous Huxley]], is [[eusociality|eusocial]] with a genetically engineered [[caste system]]. The [[World_State_in_Brave_New_World#Population|alpha++ class]] is the ruling class having been bred as scientists and administrators and control the World State in the novel. This situation can also be found in the [[George Orwell]] novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' where the inner party as symbolized by the fictitious [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] literally controls what everyone in the outer party hears, sees and learns, albeit without genetic engineering and on the model of Stalinist communism having taken over the Anglosphere (Oceania). In Oceania, the ignorant masses ("[[proles]]") are relatively free as they pose no threat to [[The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism|oligarchical collectivism]] ("Big Brother").

Examples in movies include ''[[Gattaca]]'', where the genetically-born were superior and the ruling class; and ''[[V for Vendetta]]'', which depicted a powerful totalitarian government in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The comedic film ''[[The Ruling Class (film)|The Ruling Class]]'' was a satire of British [[aristocracy]], depicting nobility as self-serving and cruel, juxtaposed against an insane relative who believes that he is [[Jesus Christ]], whom they identify as a "bloody [[Bolshevik]]".

'''Scapegoating''' is the practice of singling out a person or group for unmerited [[blame]] and consequent negative treatment. Scapegoating may be conducted by individuals against individuals (e.g. "he did it, not me!"), individuals against groups (e.g., "I couldn't see anything because of all the tall people"), groups against individuals (e.g., "Jane was the reason our team didn't win"), and groups against groups.

A [[scapegoat]] may be an adult, child, sibling, employee, peer, ethnic, political or religious group, or country. A [[whipping boy]], [[identified patient]] or "[[fall guy]]" are forms of scapegoat.

==At the individual level==

A medical definition of scapegoating is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?scapegoating |title=scapegoating - Definition |publisher=Mondofacto.com |date=1998-12-12 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Process in which the mechanisms of [[Psychological projection|projection]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]] are utilized in focusing feelings of [[aggression]], [[hostility]], [[frustration]], etc., upon another individual or group; the amount of [[blame]] being unwarranted." Scapegoating is a hostile tactic often employed to characterize an entire group of individuals according to the unethical or immoral conduct of a small number of individuals belonging to that group. Scapegoating relates to [[guilt by association]] and [[stereotyping]].

Scapegoated groups throughout history have included almost every imaginable group of people: genders, religions, people of different races, nations, or sexual orientations, people with different political beliefs, or people differing in behaviour from the majority. However, scapegoating may also be applied to organizations, such as governments, corporations, or various political groups.

===Its archetype===
Jungian analysist [[Sylvia Brinton Perera]] situates its mythology of [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera, ''The Scapegoat Complex'' (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals experience it at the [[Jungian archetype|archetypal]] level. As an ancient social process to rid a community of its past evil deeds and reconnect it to the sacred realm, the [[scapegoat]] appeared in a biblical rite,&lt;ref&gt;[[Acharei Mot|Book of ''Leviticus'', Chapter 16]], per the holy day of [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;/ref&gt; which involved two goats and the pre-Judaic, [[chthonic]] god [[Azazel]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986), p.17: the Hebrews "later considered Azazel a fallen angel". Perera at p.112 n.28, citing to [[Louis Ginzberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern scapegoat complex, however, "the energy field has been radically broken apart" and the libido "split off from consciousness". Azazel's role is deformed into an accuser of the scapegoated victim.&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986), p.18 (two quotes re modern secular culture, Azazel's role debased).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Blame for breaking a perfectionist moral code, for instance, might be measured out by aggressive scapegoaters. Themselves often wounded, the scapegoaters can be sadistic, [[superego]] accusers with brittle [[Persona (psychology)|persona]]s, who have driven their own shadows [[Unconscious mind|underground]] from where such are [[Psychological projection|projected]] onto the victim. The scapegoated victim may then live in a hell of felt unworthiness, retreating from consciousness, burdened by shadow and transpersonal guilt,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[C. G. Jung]], "A psychological view of conscience" in his ''Collected Works'' (Princeton: Bollingen 1953-1979), vol. 10, cited by Perera (1986), re pp. 11-12 n.8, 14 n.21, 33 n.45.&lt;/ref&gt; and hiding from the pain of self-understanding. [[Psychotherapy|Therapy]] includes modeling self-protective skills for the victim's battered ego, and guidance in the search for inner integrity, to find the victim's own [[voice]].&lt;ref&gt;Perera (1986): archetype (pp. 9-10, 16, 18, 48-49, 73, 77, 83, 98); ancient rite (pp. 8, 11-25, two goats 16-17, 88-97); modern complex (18-29, 30, 98, quotes at 18); accusers (9, 18-21, blames victim 20, superego 21, 28-29, 30-33, shadow 30, projected 31, also wounded 32, 55); victims (11-12, 15-16, hiding 24, 26-28, hell 26, ego 28, 33, 34-35, 43-72, burden 98); within families (30-33, 35, 53-54, 73, 76, 99); therapy (18, 22, 24-25, 26-29, voice 29, 33, 41-43, 47, 69-72, 86-97).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projection===
{{Main article|Psychological projection}}
Unwanted thoughts and feelings can be unconsciously projected onto another who becomes a scapegoat for one's own problems. This concept can be extended to projection by groups. In this case the chosen individual, or group, becomes the scapegoat for the group's problems. "Political agitation in all countries is full of such projections, just as much as the backyard gossip of little groups and individuals."&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, in C. G. Jung, ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1964) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]] considered indeed that "there must be some people who behave in the wrong way; they act as scapegoats and objects of interest for the normal ones".&lt;ref&gt;C. G Jung, ''Analytical Psychology'' (London 1976) p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict&lt;!--'Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict' redirects here--&gt;==

The '''scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; provides an explanation for the correlation between times of relative economic despair and increases in prejudice and violence toward [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poppe|first=Edwin|title=Effects of changes in GNP and perceived group characteristics on national and ethnic stereotypes in central and eastern Europe.|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1689–1708|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb02746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of [[Anti-black racism|anti-black]] violence ([[racist]] violence) in the southern United States between 1882 and 1930 show a correlation between poor economic conditions and outbreaks of violence (e.g., lynchings) against blacks. The correlation between the price of cotton (the principal product of the area at that time) and the number of lynchings of black men by whites ranged from -0.63 to -0.72, suggesting that a poor economy induced white people to take out their frustrations by attacking an outgroup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hovland|first=C. I.|last2=Sears| first2=R. R. |title=Minor studies of aggression: VI. Correlation of lynchings with economic indices|journal=Journal of Psychology: Interdisciplinary and Applied|year=1940|volume=9|issue=2|pages=301–310|doi=10.1080/00223980.1940.9917696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scapegoating as a group necessitates that [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup]] members settle on one specific target to blame for their problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1002/9780470773963.ch15|chapter=Choice of Scapegoats|title=On the Nature of Prejudice: Fifty Years after Allport|pages=244–261|year=2005|last1=Glick|first1=Peter|isbn=9780470773963|editor-last1=Dovidio|editor-first1=John F.|editor-last2=Glick|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Rudman|editor-first3=Laurie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0C&amp;pg=PA244|publisher=Blackwell Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scapegoating is also more likely to appear when a group has experienced difficult, prolonged negative experiences (as opposed to minor annoyances). When negative conditions frustrate a group's attempts at successful acquisition of its most essential needs (e.g., food, shelter), groups develop a compelling, shared ideology that - when combined with social and political pressures - may lead to the most extreme form of scapegoating: [[genocide]].

Scapegoating can also cause oppressed groups to lash out at other oppressed groups. Even when injustices are committed against a minority group by the majority group, minorities sometimes lash out against a different [[minority group]] in lieu of confronting the more powerful majority.

In management, scapegoating is a known practice in which a lower staff employee is blamed for the mistakes of senior executives. This is often due to lack of [[accountability]] in upper management.&lt;ref name="it-scapegoat"&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/the-art-of-scapegoating-in-it-projects The Art of Scapegoating in IT Projects] PM Hut, 15 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scapegoat mechanism&lt;!--'Scapegoat theory of intergroup conflict' redirects here--&gt;==

Literary critic and philosopher [[Kenneth Burke]] first coined and described the expression '''scapegoat mechanism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; in his books ''Permanence and Change'' (1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=99056219|title=Permanence and Change: An Anatomy of Purpose - 1935 by Kenneth Burke. 99056219 - Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Grammar of Motives'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=72433755|title=A Grammar of Motives - 1945, Page iii by Kenneth Burke. - Online Research Library: Questia|website=www.questia.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These works influenced some [[philosophical anthropology|philosophical anthropologists]], such as [[Ernest Becker]] and [[René Girard]]. Girard developed the concept much more extensively as an interpretation of human culture. In Girard's view, it is humankind, not God, who has need for various forms of atoning violence. Humans are driven by desire for that which another has or wants ([[mimetic desire]]). This causes a triangulation of desire and results in conflict between the desiring parties. This mimetic ''contagion'' increases to a point where society is at risk; it is at this point that the ''scapegoat mechanism''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dumont.typepad.com/publications/Mimesis_Jean-Baptiste_Dumont.pdf Mimesis - The Scapegoat Model], Jean-Baptiste Dumont&lt;/ref&gt; is triggered. This is the point where one person is singled out as the cause of the trouble and is expelled or killed by the group. This person is the scapegoat. Social order is restored as people are contented that they have solved the cause of their problems by removing the scapegoated individual, and the cycle begins again. The keyword here is "content". Scapegoating serves as a psychological relief for a group of people. Girard contends that this is what happened in the narrative of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth, the central figure in Christianity. The difference between the scapegoating of Jesus and others, Girard believes, is that in the [[resurrection of Jesus]] from the dead, he is shown to be an innocent victim; humanity is thus made aware of its violent tendencies and the cycle is broken.  Thus Girard's work is significant as a reconstruction of the ''[[Christus Victor]]'' [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] theory.

[[File:Svetlana at fortune-telling by K.Brullov (1836, Nizhniy Novgorod museum).jpg|thumb|uoright=1.3|Svetlana reflects herself in the [[mirror]] (painting by [[Karl Briullov]], 1836)]] 
'''Self-consciousness''' is a heightened sense of [[self-awareness]]. It is a preoccupation with oneself, as opposed to the philosophical state of self-awareness, which is the awareness that one exists as an individual being, though the two terms are commonly used interchangeably or [[synonym]]ously.&lt;ref&gt;Richard P. Lipka/Thomas M. Brinthaupt ''Self-perspectives Across the Life Span'', p. 228, SUNY Press, 1992 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1003-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unpleasant feeling of self-consciousness may occur when one realizes that one is being watched or observed, the feeling that "everyone is looking" at oneself. Some people are habitually more self-conscious than others. Unpleasant feelings of self-consciousness are sometimes associated with [[shyness]] or [[paranoia]].

==Impairment==
When feeling self-conscious, one becomes aware of even the smallest of one's own actions. Such awareness can impair one's ability to perform complex actions. 
[[Adolescence]] is believed to be a time of heightened self-consciousness. A person with a chronic tendency toward self-consciousness may be [[shyness|shy]] or [[introvert]]ed.&lt;ref&gt;W. Ray Crozier ''Shyness: Development, Consolidation, and Change'', p. 71, Routledge, 2000 {{ISBN|978-0-415-22432-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
Unlike [[self-awareness]], which in a philosophical context is being conscious of oneself as an individual, self-consciousness, being excessively conscious of one's appearance or manner, can be a problem at times. Self-consciousness is often associated with shyness and embarrassment, in which case a lack of pride and low [[self-esteem]] can result. In a positive context, self-consciousness may affect the development of identity, for it is during periods of high self-consciousness that people come the closest to knowing themselves objectively. Self-consciousness affects people in varying degrees, as some people are constantly self-monitoring or self-involved, while others are completely oblivious about themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Branden ''[[The Psychology of Self-Esteem]]'', p. 42, Nash Publishing Corp., 1969 {{ISBN|0-8402-1109-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychologist]]s frequently distinguish between two kinds of self-consciousness, private and public. '''Private self-consciousness''' is a tendency to introspect and examine one's inner self and feelings. '''Public self-consciousness''' is an awareness of the self as it is viewed by others. This kind of self-consciousness can result in self-monitoring and social anxiety. Both private and public self-consciousness are viewed as personality traits that are relatively stable over time, but they are not correlated. Just because an individual is high on one dimension doesn't mean that he or she is high on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Simon ''Identity in Modern Society'', p. 30, Blacwell Publishing, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-631-22747-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different levels of self-consciousness affect [[behavior]], as it is common for people to act differently when they "lose themselves in a crowd". Being in a crowd, being in a dark room, or wearing a disguise creates anonymity and temporarily decreases self-consciousness (see [[deindividuation]]). This can lead to uninhibited, sometimes destructive behavior.

If a media outlet, newspapers or blogs for example, reports on the violent acts and Anti-Shi'ist activities in a light that is honest, unbiased reporting, the organization contacts that media and thanks the author or other organization on the importance of reporting these violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1306/S00213/shia-rights-violation-by-yousef-al-qaradawi.htm |title=Shia Rights Violation By Yousef Al-Qaradawi &amp;#124; Scoop News |publisher=Scoop.co.nz |date=2013-06-10 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization publicly condemns any reports that justifies violence or entire events itself, trying to raise awareness and bring the violations to the attention of the people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldshiaforum.wordpress.com/2012/07/21/shia-rights-watch-statement-save-the-lives-of-shia-muslims-and-shrines-in-syria/ |title=Shia Rights Watch Statement: Save the Lives of Shia Muslims and Shrines in Syria &amp;#124; World Shia Forum |publisher=Worldshiaforum.wordpress.com |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reports ===

Each year, Shia Rights Watch publishes reports that document human rights violations committed against Shia Muslims as defined by the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In 2012, SRW published five reports including one on [[Pakistan]], [[Bahrain]], [[Malaysia]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Indonesia]]. These reports include recommendations to the United States government with action steps for each specific country to move towards a more unbiased and peaceful government that does not exclude minorities, including religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abna.ir/print.asp?lang=3&amp;id=358029 |title=Saudi Shia Muslim Victims of Sectarian Isolationism: Shia Rights Watch |publisher=Abna.ir |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists, researchers, human rights activists and members of the United States government request to the organization, largely based on case studies and research, to obtain a copy.&lt;ref name="thenewstribe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribe.com/2012/05/17/shia-rights-watch-to-release-report-highlighting-bahrains-atrocities/ |title=Shia Rights Watch to release report highlighting Bahrain’s ‘atrocities’ |publisher=The News Tribe |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], '''social facts''' are values, cultural norms, and social structures that transcend the individual and can exercise [[social control]]. The French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]] defined the term, and argued that the discipline of sociology should be understood as the empirical study of social facts. For Durkheim, social facts "...&amp;nbsp;consist of manners of acting, thinking and feeling external to the individual, which are invested with a coercive power by virtue of which they exercise control over him."&lt;ref name="Rules"&gt;{{cite book |first=Émile |last=Durkheim |title=The Rules of Sociological Method and Selected Texts on Sociology and its Method |others=W. D. Halls (translator) |editor-first=Steven |editor-last=Lukes |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=1982 |orig-year=1st pub. 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Durkheim's social fact==
In ''[[The Rules of Sociological Method]]'' Durkheim laid out a theory of sociology as "the science of social facts". He considered social facts to "consist of representations and actions" which meant that "they cannot be confused with organic phenomena, nor with physical phenomena, which have no existence save in and through the individual consciousness."&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt; Durkheim says that a social fact is a thing that many [[people]] do very similarly because the socialized community that they belong to has influenced them to do these things.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Emile Durkheim: What Is a Social Fact?|url = http://www.csudh.edu/dearhabermas/durkheim02.htm|website = www.csudh.edu|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim defined the social fact this way:
:"A social fact is any way of acting, whether fixed or not, capable of exerting over the individual an external constraint;
::or:
:which is general over the whole of a given society whilst having an existence of its own, independent of its individual manifestations".&lt;ref name="Rules"/&gt;

He viewed it as a concrete idea that affected a person's everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Durkheim|first1=Emile|title=What is a Social Fact|journal=The Rules of Sociological Method|date=1982|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's examples of social facts included social institutions such as kinship and marriage, currency, language, religion, political organization, and all societal institutions we must account for in everyday interactions with other members of our societies. Deviating from the norms of such institutions makes the individual unacceptable or misfit in the group.

Among the most noted of Durkheim's work was his discovery of the "social fact" of [[suicide]] rates. By carefully examining [[police]] suicide [[statistics]] in different districts, Durkheim demonstrated that the suicide rate of [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] communities is lower than that of [[Protestant]] communities. He ascribed this to a ''social'' (as opposed to individual) cause.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, E. ''Suicide''. 1897.&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered groundbreaking and remains influential.

Durkheim's discovery of social facts was significant because it promised to make it possible to study the behaviour of entire societies, rather than just of particular individuals. Durkheim points to individual actions as instances or representations of different types of actions in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmaus|first1=Warren|title=Durkheim's Philosophy of Science and the Sociology of Knowledge: Creating an Intellectual Niche|date=1994|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226742519|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contemporary, interpretivist, sociologists like Max Atkinson and Jack Douglas refer to Durkheim's studies for two quite different purposes, however:

* Durkheim's studies are graphic demonstrations of how careful the social researcher must be to ensure that data gathered for analysis is accurate. Durkheim's reported suicide rates were, it is now clear, largely an artifact of the way particular deaths were classified as "suicide" or "non-suicide" by different communities. What he actually discovered was not different ''suicide rates'' at all—but different ways of ''thinking about suicide''.
* His studies are also an entry point into the study of social meaning—and the way that apparently identical individual acts often cannot be classified empirically. Social ''acts'' (even such an apparently private and individual act as suicide), in this modern view, are always seen (and classified) by social ''actors''. Discovering the social facts about such acts, it follows, is generally neither possible nor desirable—but discovering the way individuals perceive and classify particular acts is what offers insight. A further complication is introduced by asking about the status of our "discovery" of these perceptions and classifications. After all, don't such "discoveries" ''also'' reflect socially embedded practices of classification? But if the alleged discoveries of perceptions of social facts aren't therefore dubious, it is hard to see why the original claims about the social facts are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deviance and Social Control Unit M5: Suicide (2)|url=http://www.sociology.org.uk/devs2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douglas|first1=Jack D.|title=Social Meanings of Suicide|date=1967|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691621173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mauss's total social fact==
For [[Marcel Mauss]] (Durkheim's nephew and sometime collaborator) a ''total social fact'' (French ''fait social total'') is "an activity that has implications throughout society, in the economic, legal, political, and religious spheres".&lt;ref&gt;Edgar (1999), 64&lt;/ref&gt;
Diverse strands of social and psychological life are woven together through what he came to call ''total social facts''. A total social fact informs and organizes seemingly quite distinct practices and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Edgar (2002), 157&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcel Mauss]] popularized the term in his book, ''[[The Gift (book)|The Gift]]'':
{{quote|These phenomena are at once legal, economic, religious, aesthetic, morphological and so on. They are legal in that they concern individual and collective rights, organized and diffuse morality; they may be entirely obligatory, or subject simply to praise or disapproval. They are at once political and domestic, being of interest both to classes and to clans and families. They are religious; they concern true religion, animism, magic and diffuse religious mentality. They are economic, for the notions of value, utility, interest, luxury, wealth, acquisition, accumulation, consumption and liberal and sumptuous expenditure are all present...&lt;ref&gt;Mauss (1966), 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:IKAROS solar sail.jpg|thumb|250px|[[IKAROS]] space-probe with solar sail in flight (artist's depiction) showing a typical square sail configuration]]
'''Solar sails''' (also called '''light sails''' or '''photon sails''') are a proposed method of [[spacecraft propulsion]] using [[radiation pressure]] exerted by sunlight on large mirrors. A useful analogy may be a sailing boat; the light exerting a force on the mirrors is akin to a sail being blown by the wind. High-energy [[Laser propulsion|laser beams]] could be used as an alternative light source to exert much greater force than would be possible using sunlight, a concept known as beam sailing.

Solar sail craft offer the possibility of low-cost operations combined with long operating lifetimes. Since they have few moving parts and use no propellant, they can potentially be used numerous times for delivery of payloads.

Solar sails use a phenomenon that has a proven, measured effect on spacecraft. Solar pressure affects all spacecraft, whether in [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary space]] or in orbit around a planet or small body. A typical spacecraft going to Mars, for example, will be displaced thousands of kilometers by solar pressure, so the effects must be accounted for in trajectory planning, which has been done since the time of the earliest interplanetary spacecraft of the 1960s. Solar pressure also affects the [[Aircraft attitude|orientation]] of a craft, a factor that must be included in [[spacecraft design]].&lt;ref&gt;Georgevic, R. M. (1973) "The Solar Radiation Pressure Forces and Torques Model", ''The Journal of the Astronautical Sciences'', Vol. 27, No. 1, Jan–Feb. First known publication describing how solar radiation pressure creates forces and torques that affect spacecraft.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total force exerted on an 800 by 800 meter solar sail, for example, is about {{convert|5|N|lbf|lk=on}} at Earth's distance from the Sun,&lt;ref name="Wright "&gt;{{citation| author = Jerome Wright| year = 1992| title = Space Sailing| publisher = Gordon and Breach Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a low-thrust [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion]] system, similar to spacecraft propelled by [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric engines]], but as it uses no propellant, that force is exerted almost constantly and the collective effect over time is great enough to be considered a potential manner of propelling spacecraft.

==History of concept==
[[Johannes Kepler]] observed that [[comet]] tails point away from the Sun and suggested that the Sun caused the effect. In a letter to Galileo in 1610, he wrote, "Provide ships or sails adapted to the heavenly breezes, and there will be some who will brave even that void." He might have had the comet tail phenomenon in mind when he wrote those words, although his publications on comet tails came several years later&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kepler (1604) ''Ad vitellionem parali pomena'', Frankfort; (1619) ''De cometis liballi tres '', Augsburg&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Clerk Maxwell]], in 1861–1864, published his theory of [[electromagnetic field]]s and radiation, which shows that light has [[momentum]] and thus can exert pressure on objects. [[Maxwell's equations]] provide the theoretical foundation for sailing with light pressure. So by 1864, the physics community and beyond knew [[sunlight]] carried momentum that would exert a pressure on objects.

[[Jules Verne]], in ''From the Earth to the Moon'',&lt;ref name="Verne1865"&gt;Jules Verne (1865) ''De la Terre à la Lune'' (''From the Earth to the Moon'')&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1865, wrote "there will some day appear velocities far greater than these [of the planets and the projectile], of which light or electricity will probably be the mechanical agent ... we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars."&lt;ref name="Impey"&gt;Chris Impey, ''Beyond: Our Future in Space,'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; This is possibly the first published recognition that light could move ships through space.

[[Pyotr Lebedev]] was first to successfully demonstrate light pressure, which he did in 1899 with a torsional balance;&lt;ref&gt;P. Lebedev, 1901, "Untersuchungen über die Druckkräfte des Lichtes", ''Annalen der Physik'', 1901&lt;/ref&gt; Ernest Nichols and Gordon Hull conducted a similar independent experiment in 1901 using a [[Nichols radiometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dujs.dartmouth.edu/spring-2008-10th-anniversary-edition/what-else-has-happened-a-celebration-of-the-legacy-of-physics-at-dartmouth|title=A Celebration of the Legacy of Physics at Dartmouth |last=Lee|first=Dillon |year=2008|work=Dartmouth Undergraduate Journal of Science|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Svante Arrhenius]] predicted in 1908 the possibility of solar radiation pressure distributing life spores across interstellar distances, providing one means to explain the concept of [[panspermia]]. He apparently was the first scientist to state that light could move objects between stars.&lt;ref&gt;Svante Arrhenius (1908) ''Worlds in the Making''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]] first proposed using the pressure of sunlight to propel spacecraft through space and suggested, "using tremendous mirrors of very thin sheets to utilize the pressure of sunlight to attain cosmic velocities".&lt;ref&gt;Urbanczyk, Mgr., "Solar Sails-A Realistic Propulsion for Space Craft", Translation Branch Redstone Scientific Information Center Research and Development Directorate U.S. Army Missile Command Redstone Arsenal, Alabama, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Zander]] (Tsander) published a technical paper in 1925 that included technical analysis of solar sailing. Zander wrote of "applying small forces" using "light pressure or transmission of light energy to distances by means of very thin mirrors".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Zander's 1925 paper, "Problems of flight by jet propulsion: interplanetary flights", was translated by NASA. See NASA Technical Translation F-147 (1964), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[JBS Haldane]] speculated in 1927 about the invention of tubular spaceships that would take humanity to space and how "wings of metallic foil of a square kilometre or more in area are spread out to catch the Sun's radiation pressure".&lt;ref&gt;JBS Haldane, ''The Last Judgement'', New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[J. D. Bernal]] wrote in 1929, "A form of space sailing might be developed which used the repulsive effect of the Sun's rays instead of wind. A space vessel spreading its large, metallic wings, acres in extent, to the full, might be blown to the limit of Neptune's orbit. Then, to increase its speed, it would tack, close-hauled, down the gravitational field, spreading full sail again as it rushed past the Sun."&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bernal (1929) ''The World, the Flesh &amp; the Devil: An Enquiry into the Future of the Three Enemies of the Rational Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first formal technology and design effort for a solar sail began in 1976 at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] for a proposed mission to rendezvous with [[Halley's Comet]].&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;

==Physical principles==

===Solar radiation pressure===
{{Main article|Radiation pressure}}
Many people believe that spacecraft using solar sails are pushed by the Solar winds just as [[sailboat]]s and [[sailing ship]]s are pushed by the winds across the waters on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2000/ast28jun_1m/|title=Setting Sail for the Stars|publisher=NASA|language=English|date=28 June 2000|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Solar radiation exerts a [[Radiation pressure|pressure]] on the sail due to reflection and a small fraction that is absorbed.

The momentum of a [[photon]] or an entire flux is given by [[Energy–momentum relation|Einstein's relation]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/relmom.html |title=Relativistic Momentum |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wright-appendixA"&gt;Wright, Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt;

:p = E/c

where p is the momentum, E is the energy (of the photon or flux), and c is the [[speed of light]]. Solar radiation pressure can be related to the irradiance ([[solar constant]]) value of 1361&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] (Earth-Sun distance), as revised in 2011:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kopp, G. |author2=Lean, J. L. |title=A new, lower value of total solar irradiance: Evidence and climate significance|year=2011|publisher=Geophysical Research Letters 38|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010GL045777/pdf|doi=10.1029/2010GL0457770}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE FROM SIG FIGURES: LEADS TO MISLEADING VALUES &amp; INCONSISTENCIES--&gt;

*perfect absorbance: F = 4.54&amp;nbsp;μN per square metre (4.54&amp;nbsp;μ[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]) in the direction of the incident beam (an inelastic collision)
*perfect reflectance: F = 9.08&amp;nbsp;μN per square metre (9.08&amp;nbsp;μPa)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; in the direction normal to surface (an elastic collision)

An ideal sail is flat and has 100% [[specular reflection]]. An actual sail will have an overall efficiency of about 90%, about 8.17&amp;nbsp;μN/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name="wright-appendixA"/&gt; due to curvature (billow), wrinkles, absorbance, re-radiation from front and back, non-specular effects, and other factors.

The force on a sail and the actual acceleration of the craft vary by the inverse square of distance from the Sun (unless extremely close to the Sun&lt;ref&gt;McInnes, C. R. and Brown, J. C. (1989) ''Solar Sail Dynamics with an Extended Source of Radiation Pressure'', International Astronautical Federation, IAF-89-350, October.&lt;/ref&gt;), and by the square of the cosine of the angle between the sail force vector and the radial from the Sun, so

:F = F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; θ / R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (ideal sail)

where R is distance from the Sun in AU. An actual square sail can be modeled as:

:F = F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; (0.349 + 0.662 cos 2θ − 0.011 cos 4θ) / R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Note that the force and acceleration approach zero generally around θ = 60° rather than 90° as one might expect with an ideal sail.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

If some of the energy is absorbed, the absorbed energy will heat the sail, which re-radiates that energy from the front and rear surfaces, depending on the [[emissivity]] of those two surfaces.

[[Solar wind]], the flux of charged particles blown out from the Sun, exerts a nominal dynamic pressure of about 3 to 4 [[Pascal (unit)|nPa]], three orders of magnitude less than solar radiation pressure on a reflective sail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141127142813/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/SWN/index.html |date=November 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sail parameters===
Sail loading (areal density) is an important parameter, which is the total mass divided by the sail area, expressed in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is represented by the Greek letter σ.

A sail craft has a characteristic acceleration, a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, which it would experience at 1&amp;nbsp;AU when facing the Sun. Using the value from above of 9.08 μN per square metre of radiation pressure at 1 AU, a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is related to areal density by:

:a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.08(efficiency) / σ mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Assuming 90% efficiency, a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; =  8.17 / σ mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

The lightness number, λ, is the dimensionless ratio of maximum vehicle acceleration divided by the Sun's local gravity.  Using the values at 1&amp;nbsp;AU:

:λ = a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; / 5.93

The lightness number is also independent of distance from the Sun because both gravity and light pressure fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun. Therefore, this number defines the types of orbit maneuvers that are possible for a given vessel.

The table presents some example values. Payloads are not included. The first two are from the detailed design effort at JPL in the 1970s. The third, the lattice sailer, might represent about the best possible performance level.&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;  The dimensions for square and lattice sails are edges.  The dimension for heliogyro is blade tip to blade tip.

===Attitude control===
An active [[attitude control]] system (ACS) is essential for a sail craft to achieve and maintain a desired orientation. The required sail orientation changes slowly (often less than 1 degree per day) in interplanetary space, but much more rapidly in a planetary orbit. The ACS must be capable of meeting these orientation requirements. Attitude control is achieved by a relative shift between the craft's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] and its [[center of mass]]. This can be achieved with control vanes, movement of individual sails, movement of a control mass, or altering reflectivity.

Holding a constant attitude requires that the ACS maintain a net torque of zero on the craft. The total force and torque on a sail, or set of sails, is not constant along a trajectory. The force changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes the billow in the sail and deflects some elements of the supporting structure, resulting in changes in the sail force and torque.

Sail temperature also changes with solar distance and sail angle, which changes sail dimensions. The radiant heat from the sail changes the temperature of the supporting structure. Both factors affect total force and torque.

To hold the desired attitude the ACS must compensate for all of these changes.&lt;ref name="wright 6+B"&gt;Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix B.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constraints===
In Earth orbit, solar pressure and drag pressure are typically equal at an altitude of about 800&amp;nbsp;km, which means that a sail craft would have to operate above that altitude. Sail craft must operate in orbits where their turn rates are compatible with the orbits, which is generally a concern only for spinning disk configurations.

Sail operating temperatures are a function of solar distance, sail angle, reflectivity, and front and back emissivities. A sail can be used only where its temperature is kept within its material limits. Generally, a sail can be used rather close to the Sun, around 0.25&amp;nbsp;AU, or even closer if carefully designed for those conditions.&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;

==Applications==
Potential applications for sail craft range throughout the [[Solar System]], from near the Sun to the comet clouds beyond Neptune.  The craft can make outbound voyages to deliver loads or to take up station keeping at the destination.  They can be used to haul cargo and possibly also used for human travel.&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;

===Inner planets===
For trips within the inner Solar System, they can deliver loads and then return to Earth for subsequent voyages, operating as an interplanetary shuttle.  For Mars in particular, the craft could provide economical means of routinely supplying operations on the planet according to Jerome Wright, "The cost of launching the necessary conventional propellants from Earth are enormous for manned missions. Use of sailing ships could potentially save more than $10 billion in mission costs."&lt;ref name="Wright "/&gt;

Solar sail craft can approach the Sun to deliver observation payloads or to take up station keeping orbits.  They can operate at 0.25 AU or closer.  They can reach high orbital inclinations, including polar.

Solar sails can travel to and from all of the inner planets.  Trips to Mercury and Venus are for rendezvous and orbit entry for the payload.  Trips to Mars could be either for rendezvous or swing-by with release of the payload for [[Aerobraking|aerodynamic braking]].&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;

===Outer planets===
Minimum transfer times to the outer planets benefit from using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  However, this method results in high arrival speeds.  Slower transfers have lower arrival speeds.

The minimum transfer time to Jupiter for ''a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 1&amp;nbsp;mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with no departure velocity relative to Earth is 2 years when using an indirect transfer (solar swing-by).  The arrival speed (''V''&lt;span style="font-size:140%;"&gt;&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) is close to 17&amp;nbsp;km/s.  For Saturn, the minimum trip time is 3.3 years, with an arrival speed of nearly 19&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="Wright " /&gt;

=== Oort Cloud/Sun's inner gravity focus ===

The Sun's inner [[Solar lens|gravitational focus]] point lies at minimum distance of 550 AU from the Sun, and is the point to which light from distant objects is [[Two-body problem in general relativity#Bending of light by gravity|focused by gravity]] as a result of it passing by the Sun. This is thus the distant point to which solar gravity will cause the region of deep space on the other side of the Sun to be focused, thus serving effectively as a very large telescope objective lens.&lt;ref&gt;Eshleman, Von R., "Gravitational lens of the Sun: its potential for observations and communications over interstellar distances," ''Science, Vol. 205'', No. 4411 (1979) pp. 1133-1135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lens&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maccone |first1=Claudio |title=The Sun as a Gravitational Lens : A Target for Space Missions A Target for Space Missions Reaching 550 AU to 1000 AU |url=http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715033119/http://www.spaceroutes.com/astrocon/AstroconVTalks/Maccone-AstroconV.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2010 |accessdate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that an inflated sail, made of [[beryllium]], that starts at 0.05 AU from the Sun would gain an initial acceleration of 36.4&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and reach a speed of 0.00264c (about 950&amp;nbsp;km/s) in less than a day. Such proximity to the Sun could prove to be impractical in the near term due to the structural degradation of beryllium at high temperatures, diffusion of hydrogen at high temperatures as well as an electrostatic gradient, generated by the ionization of beryllium from the solar wind, posing a burst risk. A revised perihelion of 0.1 AU would reduce the aforementioned temperature and solar flux exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul Gilster |url=http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=4238 |title=An Inflatable Sail to the Oort Cloud |publisher=Centauri-dreams.org |date=2008-11-12 |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such a sail would take "Two and a half years to reach the heliopause, six and a half years to reach the Sun’s inner gravitational focus, with arrival at the inner Oort Cloud in no more than thirty years."&lt;ref name=lens/&gt; "Such a mission could perform useful astrophysical observations en route, explore gravitational focusing techniques, and image Oort Cloud objects while exploring particles and fields in that region that are of galactic rather than solar origin."

===Satellites===
[[Robert L. Forward]] has commented that a solar sail could be used to modify the orbit of a satellite about the Earth. In the limit, a sail could be used to "hover" a satellite above one pole of the Earth. Spacecraft fitted with solar sails could also be placed in close orbits such that they are stationary with respect to either the Sun or the Earth, a type of satellite named by Forward a "[[statite]]". This is possible because the propulsion provided by the sail offsets the gravitational attraction of the Sun. Such an orbit could be useful for studying the properties of the Sun for long durations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Likewise a solar sail-equipped spacecraft could also remain on station nearly above the polar [[terminator (solar)|solar terminator]] of a planet such as the Earth by tilting the sail at the appropriate angle needed to counteract the planet's gravity.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In his book ''[[The Case for Mars]]'', [[Robert Zubrin]] points out that the reflected sunlight from a large statite, placed near the polar terminator of the planet Mars, could be focused on one of the Martian polar ice caps to significantly warm the planet's atmosphere. Such a statite could be made from asteroid material.

===Trajectory corrections===
The [[MESSENGER]] probe orbiting [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] used light pressure on its solar panels to perform fine trajectory corrections on the way to Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514095117/http://messenger.jhuapl.edu/news_room/details.php?id=102 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-05-14 |title=MESSENGER Sails on Sun's Fire for Second Flyby of Mercury |date=2008-09-05 |quote=On September 4, the MESSENGER team announced that it would not need to implement a scheduled maneuver to adjust the probe's trajectory. This is the fourth time this year that such a maneuver has been called off. The reason? A recently implemented navigational technique that makes use of solar-radiation pressure (SRP) to guide the probe has been extremely successful at maintaining MESSENGER on a trajectory that will carry it over the cratered surface of Mercury for a second time on October 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By changing the angle of the solar panels relative to the Sun, the amount of solar radiation pressure was varied to adjust the spacecraft trajectory more delicately than possible with thrusters. Minor errors are greatly amplified by [[gravity assist]] maneuvers, so using radiation pressure to make very small corrections saved large amounts of propellant.

===Interstellar flight===
In the 1970s, [[Robert Forward]] proposed two [[beam-powered propulsion]] schemes using either lasers or [[maser]]s to push giant sails to a significant fraction of the [[speed of light]].&lt;ref name="Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar"&gt;{{Cite journal| author=Forward, R.L. | title=Roundtrip Interstellar Travel Using Laser-Pushed Lightsails | journal=J Spacecraft | volume=21 | issue=2 | pages=187–195 | year=1984 | doi=10.2514/3.8632 |bibcode = 1984JSpRo..21..187F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the science fiction novel ''[[Rocheworld]]'', Forward described a light sail propelled by super lasers. As the starship neared its destination, the outer portion of the sail would detach. The outer sail would then refocus and reflect the lasers back onto a smaller, inner sail. This would provide braking thrust to stop the ship in the destination star system.

Both methods pose monumental engineering challenges. The lasers would have to operate for years continuously at [[gigawatt]] strength. Forward's solution to this requires enormous solar panel arrays to be built at or near the planet Mercury. A planet-sized mirror or [[fresnel lens]] would need to be located at several dozen [[astronomical unit]]s from the Sun to keep the lasers focused on the sail. The giant braking sail would have to act as a precision mirror to focus the braking beam onto the inner "deceleration" sail.

A potentially easier approach would be to use a maser to drive a "solar sail" composed of a mesh of wires with the same spacing as the wavelength of the microwaves directed at the sail, since the manipulation of microwave radiation is somewhat easier than the manipulation of visible light. The hypothetical "[[Starwisp]]" interstellar probe design&lt;ref name=starwisp&gt;Forward, Robert L., "Starwisp: An Ultralight Interstellar Probe,” ''J. Spacecraft and Rockets, Vol. 22'', May–June 1985, pp. 345-350.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=starwisp2&gt;Landis, Geoffrey A., "Microwave Pushed Interstellar Sail: Starwisp Revisited," paper AIAA-2000-3337, 36th Joint Propulsion Conference, Huntsville AL, July 17–19, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; would use microwaves, rather than visible light, to push it. Masers spread out more rapidly than optical lasers owing to their longer wavelength, and so would not have as great an effective range.

Masers could also be used to power a painted solar sail, a conventional sail coated with a layer of chemicals designed to evaporate when struck by microwave radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/technovel_sail_050211.html |title=Earth To Mars in a Month With Painted Solar Sail |publisher=SPACE.com |date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The momentum generated by this [[evaporation]] could significantly increase the [[thrust]] generated by solar sails, as a form of lightweight [[ablative laser propulsion]].

To further focus the energy on a distant solar sail, Forward proposed a lens designed as a large [[zone plate]]. This would be placed at a location between the laser or maser and the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Forward1984RoundtripInterstellar" /&gt;

Another more physically realistic approach would be to use the light from the Sun to accelerate.&lt;ref&gt;"Solar Sail Starships:Clipper Ships of the Galaxy," chapter 6, [[Eugene F. Mallove]] and [[Gregory L. Matloff]], ''The Starflight Handbook: A Pioneer's Guide to Interstellar Travel'', pp. 89-106, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1989. {{ISBN|978-0471619123}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship would first drop into an orbit making a close pass to the Sun, to maximize the solar energy input on the sail, then it would begin to accelerate away from the system using the light from the Sun. Acceleration will drop approximately as the inverse square of the distance from the Sun, and beyond some distance, the ship would no longer receive enough light to accelerate it significantly, but would maintain the final velocity attained. When nearing the target star, the ship could turn its sails toward it and begin to use the outward pressure of the destination star to decelerate. Rockets could augment the solar thrust.

Similar solar sailing launch and capture were suggested for [[directed panspermia]] to expand life in other solar system. Velocities of 0.05% the speed of light could be obtained by solar sails carrying 10&amp;nbsp;kg payloads, using thin solar sail vehicles with effective areal densities of 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with thin sails of 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] thickness and sizes on the order of one square kilometer. Alternatively, swarms of 1&amp;nbsp;mm capsules could be launched on solar sails with radii of 42&amp;nbsp;cm, each carrying 10,000 capsules of a hundred million [[extremophile]] microorganisms to seed [[life]] in diverse target environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Meot-Ner (Mautner) |first1=Michael N. |last2=Matloff |first2=Gregory L. |title=Directed panspermia: A technical and ethical evaluation of seeding nearby solar systems |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |year=1979 |volume=32 |pages=419–423 |url=http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFDirectedPanspermia1JBIS1997Paper.pdf |bibcode=1979JBIS...32..419M }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Mautner |first = Michael N. | title = Directed panspermia. 2.

===Deorbiting artificial satellites===
Small solar sails have been proposed to accelerate the deorbiting of small artificial satellites from Earth orbits.  Satellites in [[low Earth orbit]] can use a combination of solar pressure on the sail and increased atmospheric drag to accelerate satellite [[atmospheric entry|reentry]].&lt;ref name=ps20131226/&gt;  A de-orbit sail developed at [[Cranfield University]] is part of the UK satellite TechDemoSat-1, launched in 2014, and is expected to be deployed at the end of the satellite's five-year useful life.

==Sail configurations==
[[File:Solarsail msfc.jpg|left|thumb|NASA illustration of the unlit side of a half-kilometre solar sail, showing the struts stretching the sail.]]
[[File:Cosmos1 in orbit.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An artist's depiction of a Cosmos&amp;nbsp;1-type spaceship in orbit]]

[[IKAROS]], launched in 2010, was the first practical solar sail vehicle.  As of 2015, it was still under thrust, proving the practicality of a solar sail for long-duration missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2012/03/20120321_sac_ikaros.pdf | title=Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator machine (小型ソーラー電力セイル実証機) | publisher=JAXA | accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is spin-deployed, with tip-masses in the corners of its square sail.  The sail is made of thin [[polyimide]] film, coated with evaporated aluminium.  It steers with electrically-controlled [[liquid crystal]] panels.  The sail slowly spins, and these panels turn on and off to control the attitude of the vehicle.  When on, they diffuse light, reducing the momentum transfer to that part of the sail.  When off, the sail reflects more light, transferring more momentum.  In that way, they turn the sail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=JAXA|title=Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator 'IKAROS'  Successful Attitude Control by Liquid Crystal Device|url=http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100723_ikaros_e.html|publisher=JAXA|accessdate=24 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thin-film [[solar cell]]s are also integrated into the sail, powering the spacecraft.  The design is very reliable, because spin deployment, which is preferable for large sails, simplified the mechanisms to unfold the sail and the LCD panels have no moving parts.

Parachutes have very low mass, but a parachute is not a workable configuration for a solar sail. Analysis shows that a parachute configuration would collapse from the forces exerted by shroud lines, since radiation pressure does not behave like aerodynamic pressure, and would not act to keep the parachute open.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ibid., p. 71, last paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest thrust-to-mass designs for ground-assembled deploy-able structures are square sails with the masts and [[guy (sailing)|guy]] lines on the dark side of the sail. Usually there are four masts that spread the corners of the sail, and a mast in the center to hold [[guy-wire]]s. One of the largest advantages is that there are no hot spots in the rigging from wrinkling or bagging, and the sail protects the structure from the Sun. This form can, therefore, go close to the Sun for maximum thrust. Most designs steer with small moving sails on the ends of the spars.&lt;ref name=jpl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |title=Design &amp; Construction|publisher=NASA JPL |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050311004606/http://solarsails.jpl.nasa.gov/introduction/design-construction.html |archivedate = 2005-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:sail-design-types.gif|center]]

In the 1970s [[JPL]] studied many rotating blade and ring sails for a mission to rendezvous with [[Halley's Comet]]. The intention was to stiffen the structures using angular momentum, eliminating the need for struts, and saving mass. In all cases, surprisingly large amounts of tensile strength were needed to cope with dynamic loads. Weaker sails would ripple or oscillate when the sail's attitude changed, and the oscillations would add and cause structural failure. The difference in the thrust-to-mass ratio between practical designs was almost nil, and the static designs were easier to control.&lt;ref name=jpl /&gt;

JPL's reference design was called the "heliogyro". It had plastic-film blades deployed from rollers and held out by centrifugal forces as it rotated. The spacecraft's attitude and direction were to be completely controlled by changing the angle of the blades in various ways, similar to the cyclic and collective pitch of a [[helicopter]]. Although the design had no mass advantage over a square sail, it remained attractive because the method of deploying the sail was simpler than a strut-based design.&lt;ref name=jpl /&gt;

Heliogyro design is similar to the blades on a helicopter. The design is faster to manufacture due to lightweight centrifugal stiffening of sails. Also, they are highly efficient in cost and velocity because the blades are lightweight and long. Unlike the square and spinning disk designs, heliogyro is easier to deploy because the blades are compacted on a reel. The blades roll out when they are deploying after the ejection from the spacecraft. As the heliogyro travels through space the system spins around because of the centrifugal acceleration. Finally, payloads for the space flights are placed in the center of gravity to even out the distribution of weight to ensure stable flight.&lt;ref name=jpl /&gt;

JPL also investigated "ring sails" (Spinning Disk Sail in the above diagram), panels attached to the edge of a rotating spacecraft. The panels would have slight gaps, about one to five percent of the total area. Lines would connect the edge of one sail to the other. Masses in the middles of these lines would pull the sails taut against the coning caused by the radiation pressure. JPL researchers said that this might be an attractive sail design for large manned structures. The inner ring, in particular, might be made to have artificial gravity roughly equal to the gravity on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name=jpl /&gt;

A solar sail can serve a dual function as a high-gain antenna.&lt;ref name=ant&gt;{{cite web|author=Khayatian, Rahmatsamii, Porgorzelski, UCLA and JPL|url=http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12275/1/01-0276.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527065541/http://trs-new.jpl.nasa.gov/dspace/bitstream/2014/12275/1/01-0276.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-27|title=An Antenna Concept Integrated with Future Solar Sails}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs differ, but most modify the [[metallizing|metalization]] pattern to create a holographic monochromatic lens or mirror in the radio frequencies of interest, including visible light.&lt;ref name=ant /&gt;

== Electric solar wind sail ==
{{main article | Electric sail }}

[[Pekka Janhunen]] from [[Finnish Meteorological Institute|FMI]] has invented a type of solar sail called the [[electric solar wind sail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.fmi.fi/~pjanhune/Esail/|title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanically it has little in common with the traditional solar sail design. The sails are replaced with straightened conducting tethers (wires) placed [[radius|radially]] around the host ship. The wires are electrically charged to create an [[electric field]] around the wires. The electric field extends a few tens of metres into the plasma of the surrounding solar wind. The solar electrons are reflected by the electric field (like the photons on a traditional solar sail). The radius of the sail is from the electric field rather than the actual wire itself, making the sail lighter. The craft can also be steered by regulating the electric charge of the wires. A practical electric sail would have 50–100 straightened wires with a length of about 20&amp;nbsp;km each.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

Electric solar wind sails can adjust their electrostatic fields and sail attitudes.

== Magnetic sail ==
{{main article | Magnetic sail }}

A [[magnetic sail]] would also employ the solar wind. However, the magnetic field deflects the electrically charged particles in the wind. It uses wire loops, and runs a static current through them instead of applying a static voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/library/meetings/fellows/nov99/320Zubrin.pdf |title=Fellows meeting |date=1999 |website=www.niac.usra.edu/files |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these designs maneuver, though the mechanisms are different.

Magnetic sails bend the path of the charged protons that are in the [[solar wind]]. By changing the sails' attitudes, and the size of the magnetic fields, they can change the amount and direction of the thrust.

==Sail making==

===Materials===

The most common material in current designs is a thin layer of aluminum coating on a polymer (plastic) sheet, such as aluminized 2&amp;nbsp;µm [[Kapton]] film. The polymer provides mechanical support as well as flexibility, while the thin metal layer provides the reflectivity.  Such material resists the heat of a pass close to the Sun and still remains reasonably strong. The aluminum reflecting film is on the Sun side. The sails of ''[[Cosmos 1]]'' were made of [[metallized polyethylene terephthalate|aluminized PET film]] ([[PET film (biaxially oriented)|Mylar]]).

[[Eric Drexler]] developed a concept for a sail in which the polymer was removed.&lt;ref name=Drexler&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/16234/06483741.pdf?sequence=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604235745/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/16234/06483741.pdf?sequence=1|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-06-04|author=Drexler, K. E.|year=1977|title=Design of a High Performance Solar Sail System, MS Thesis, |publisher=Dept. of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Institute of Techniology, Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed very high thrust-to-mass solar sails, and made prototypes of the sail material. His sail would use panels of thin aluminium film (30 to 100 [[nanometre]]s thick) supported by a [[tension (physics)|tensile]] structure. The sail would rotate and would have to be continually under thrust. He made and handled samples of the film in the laboratory, but the material was too delicate to survive folding, launch, and deployment. The design planned to rely on space-based production of the film panels, joining them to a deploy-able tension structure. Sails in this class would offer high area per unit mass and hence accelerations up to "fifty times higher" than designs based on deploy-able plastic films.&lt;ref name=Drexler /&gt;
The material developed for the Drexler solar sail was a thin aluminium film with a baseline thickness of 0.1&amp;nbsp;µm, to be fabricated by vapor deposition in a space-based system. Drexler used a similar process to prepare films on the ground. As anticipated, these films demonstrated adequate strength and robustness for handling in the laboratory and for use in space, but not for folding, launch, and deployment.

Research by [[Geoffrey Landis]] in 1998–1999, funded by the [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]], showed that various materials such as [[alumina]] for laser lightsails and [[carbon fiber]] for microwave pushed lightsails were superior sail materials to the previously standard aluminium or Kapton films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/4Landis.pdf|title=Advanced Solar- and Laser-pushed Lightsail Concepts|author=Geoffrey A. Landis, Ohio Aerospace Institute|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Energy Science Laboratories developed a new [[carbon fiber]] material that might be useful for solar sails.&lt;ref name="carbonsail_000302.html"&gt;[http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html SPACE.com Exclusive: Breakthrough In Solar Sail Technology] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101191444/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/carbonsail_000302.html |date=January 1, 2011 }} (DEAD LINK!)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sbir.nasa.gov/SBIR/abstracts/99/sbir/phase1/SBIR-99-1-25.02-2034.html|title=Carbon Solar Sail|website=sbir.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material is over 200 times thicker than conventional solar sail designs, but it is so porous that it has the same mass. The rigidity and durability of this material could make solar sails that are significantly sturdier than plastic films. The material could self-deploy and should withstand higher temperatures.

There has been some theoretical speculation about using [[molecular manufacturing]] techniques to create advanced, strong, hyper-light sail material, based on [[Carbon nanotube|nanotube]] mesh weaves, where the weave "spaces" are less than half the wavelength of light impinging on the sail. While such materials have so far only been produced in laboratory conditions, and the means for manufacturing such material on an industrial scale are not yet available, such materials could mass less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news5890.html |title=Researchers produce strong, transparent carbon nanotube sheets |publisher=Physorg.com |date=2005-08-18 |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; making them lighter than any current sail material by a factor of at least 30. For comparison, 5 micrometre thick [[Mylar]] sail material mass 7&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, aluminized Kapton films have a mass as much as 12&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;ref name=jpl /&gt; and Energy Science Laboratories' new carbon fiber material masses 3&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="carbonsail_000302.html"/&gt;

The least dense metal is [[lithium]], about 5 times less dense than aluminium.  Fresh, unoxidized surfaces are reflective.  At a thickness of 20&amp;nbsp;nm, lithium has an area density of 0.011&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  A high-performance sail could be made of lithium alone at 20&amp;nbsp;nm (no emission layer).  It would have to be fabricated in space and not used to approach the Sun. In the limit, a sail craft might be constructed with a total areal density of around 0.02&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, giving it a lightness number of 67 and a&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; of about 400&amp;nbsp;mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. [[Magnesium]] and [[beryllium]] are also potential materials for high-performance sails.  These 3 metals can be alloyed with each other and with aluminium.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

===Reflection and emissivity layers===
Aluminium is the common choice for the reflection layer.  It typically has a thickness of at least 20&amp;nbsp;nm, with a reflectivity of 0.88 to 0.90.  Chromium is a good choice for the emission layer on the face away from the Sun.  It can readily provide emissivity values of 0.63 to 0.73 for thicknesses from 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;nm on plastic film.  Usable emissivity values are empirical because thin-film effects dominate; bulk emissivity values do not hold up in these cases because material thickness is much thinner than the emitted wavelengths.&lt;ref name="Wright Ch4"&gt;Wright, ibid. Ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fabrication===
Sails are fabricated on Earth on long tables where ribbons are unrolled and joined to create the sails. Sail material needed to have as little weight as possible because it would require the use of the shuttle to carry the craft into orbit. Thus, these sails are packed, launched, and unfurled in space.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, W. m. 'Sail film materials and supporting structure for a solar sail, a preliminary design, volume 4." Jet Propulsion Lab. California, Pasadena, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, fabrication could take place in orbit inside large frames that support the sail.  This would result in lower mass sails and elimination of the risk of deployment failure.

==Operations==
[[File:Sail-InOut.gif|thumb|A solar sail can spiral inward or outward by setting the sail angle]]

===Changing orbits===
Sailing operations are simplest in interplanetary orbits, where attitude changes are done at low rates. For outward bound trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented forward of the Sun line, which increases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving farther from the Sun. For inward trajectories, the sail force vector is oriented behind the Sun line, which decreases orbital energy and angular momentum, resulting in the craft moving in toward the Sun.  It is worth noting that only the Sun's gravity pulls the craft toward the Sun—there is no analog to a sailboat's tacking to windward. To change orbital inclination, the force vector is turned out of the plane of the velocity vector.

In orbits around planets or other bodies, the sail is oriented so that its force vector has a component along the velocity vector, either in the direction of motion for an outward spiral, or against the direction of motion for an inward spiral.

Trajectory optimizations can often require intervals of reduced or zero thrust.  This can be achieved by rolling the craft around the Sun line with the sail set at an appropriate angle to reduce or remove the thrust.&lt;ref name="Wright" /&gt;

===Swing-by maneuvers===
A close solar passage can be used to increase a craft's energy.  The increased radiation pressure combines with the efficacy of being deep in the Sun's gravity well to substantially increase the energy for runs to the outer Solar System.  The optimal approach to the Sun is done by increasing the orbital eccentricity while keeping the energy level as high as practical.  The minimum approach distance is a function of sail angle, thermal properties of the sail and other structure, load effects on structure, and sail optical characteristics (reflectivity and emissivity).  A close passage can result in substantial optical degradation.  Required turn rates can increase substantially for a close passage.  A sail craft arriving at a star can use a close passage to reduce energy, which also applies to a sail craft on a return trip from the outer Solar System.

A lunar swing-by can have important benefits for trajectories leaving from or arriving at Earth.  This can reduce trip times, especially in cases where the sail is heavily loaded.  A swing-by can also be used to obtain favorable departure or arrival directions relative to Earth.

A planetary swing-by could also be employed similar to what is done with coasting spacecraft, but good alignments might not exist due to the requirements for overall optimization of the trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, ibid., Ch 6 and Appendix C.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects operating or completed==

===Attitude (orientation) control===
Both the [[Mariner 10]] mission, which flew by the planets [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]], and the [[MESSENGER]] mission to Mercury demonstrated the use of solar pressure as a method of [[attitude control]] in order to conserve attitude-control propellant.

[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] also used solar pressure on its solar paddles as a method of attitude control to compensate for broken [[reaction wheel]]s and chemical thruster.

MTSAT-1R ([[Multi-Functional Transport Satellite]])'s solar sail counteracts the torque produced by sunlight pressure on the solar array. The trim tab on the solar array makes small adjustments to the torque balance.

===Ground deployment tests===
NASA has successfully tested deployment technologies on small scale sails in vacuum chambers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/roboticexplorers/solar_sails.html|title=Solar Sails Could Send Spacecraft 'Sailing' Through Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 1993, the [[Znamya (space mirror)#Znamya 2|Znamya 2]], a 20-meter wide aluminized-mylar reflector, was successfully deployed from the Russian [[Mir]] space station. Although the deployment succeeded, propulsion was not demonstrated. A second test, [[Znamya (space mirror)#Znamya 2.5|Znamya 2.5]], failed to deploy properly.

In 1999, a full-scale deployment of a solar sail was tested on the ground at DLR/ESA in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet98/LEIPOLD.pdf|title=Full-scale deployment test of the DLR/ESA Solar Sail|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suborbital tests ===

A joint private project between [[Planetary Society]], [[Cosmos Studios]] and [[Russian Academy of Science]] in 2001 made a suborbital prototype test, which failed because of rocket failure.

A 15-meter-diameter solar sail (SSP, solar sail sub payload, ''soraseiru sabupeiro-do'') was launched together with [[ASTRO-F]] on a [[M-V]] rocket on February 21, 2006, and made it to orbit. It deployed from the stage, but opened incompletely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ssp.htm |title=SSSat 1, 2 |publisher=Space.skyrocket.de |date= |accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 9, 2004, the Japanese [[Institute of Space and Astronautical Science|ISAS]] successfully deployed two prototype solar sails from a sounding rocket. A clover-shaped sail was deployed at 122&amp;nbsp;km altitude and a fan-shaped sail was deployed at 169&amp;nbsp;km altitude. Both sails used 7.5-[[micrometre|micrometer]] film. The experiment purely tested the deployment mechanisms, not propulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/news/2004/0810_Japanese_Researchers_Successfully_Test.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060203030741/http://www.planetary.org/news/2004/0810_Japanese_Researchers_Successfully_Test.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-02-03 |title=Cosmos 1 - Solar Sail (2004) Japanese Researchers Successfully Test Unfurling of Solar Sail on Rocket Flight |year=2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

JAXA successfully tested IKAROS in 2010. The goal was to deploy and control the sail and, for the first time, to determine the minute orbit perturbations caused by light pressure. Orbit determination was done by the nearby [[Akatsuki (spacecraft)|AKATSUKI probe]] from which IKAROS detached after both had been brought into a transfer orbit to Venus. The total effect over the six month flight was 100&amp;nbsp;m/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/e/forefront/2011/tsuda/index.shtml|title=Solar Sail Navigation Technology of IKAROS|last=Tsuda|first=Yuichi|year=2011|publisher=[[JAXA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2010, no solar sails had been successfully used in space as primary propulsion systems. On 21 May 2010, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched the [[IKAROS]] (Interplanetary Kite-craft Accelerated by Radiation Of the Sun) spacecraft, which deployed a 200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; polyimide experimental solar sail on June 10.&lt;ref name="jaxa.jp/press/2010/06/20100611_ikaros_e"&gt;{{cite web| title = Small Solar Power Sail Demonstrator 'IKAROS' Successful Solar Sail Deployment | work = JAXA website press release | publisher = Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency | date = 2010-06-11 | url = http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/06/20100611_ikaros_e.html | accessdate = 2010-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature&gt;{{Cite news| title=News briefing: 27 May 2010 | url=http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100526/full/465402a.html | work= NatureNEWS | date=26 May 2010 | accessdate= 2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Samantha Harvey | title=Solar System Exploration: Missions: By Target: Venus: Future: Akatsuki | url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Akatsuki | publisher=NASA | date=21 May 2010 | accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the next phase for the demonstration of acceleration by radiation began. On 9 July 2010, it was verified that IKAROS collected radiation from the Sun and began photon acceleration by the orbit determination of IKAROS by range-and-range-rate (RARR) that is newly calculated in addition to the data of the relativization accelerating speed of IKAROS between IKAROS and the Earth that has been taken since before the Doppler effect was utilized.&lt;ref name="http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100709_ikaros_j.html"&gt;{{cite web| title = About the confirmation of photon acceleration of "IKAROS" the small solar-sail demonstrating craft ('''There is not English press release yet''')| work = JAXA website press release | publisher = Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency | date = 2010-07-09 | url = http://www.jaxa.jp/press/2010/07/20100709_ikaros_j.html| accessdate = 2010-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The data showed that IKAROS appears to have been solar-sailing since 3 June when it deployed the sail.

===NanoSail-D 2010===
{{main article|NanoSail-D2}}
[[File:Nano Sail D.jpg|right|thumb|A photo of the experimental solar sail, NanoSail-D.]]

A team from the NASA [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (Marshall), along with a team from the NASA [[Ames Research Center]], developed a solar sail mission called '''NanoSail-D''', which was lost in a launch failure aboard a [[Falcon 1]] rocket on 3 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5482 NASASpaceflight.com - SpaceX Falcon I FAILS during first stage flight] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080811134536/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=5482 |date=August 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26jun_nanosaild.htm?list1097511 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211221207/https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/26jun_nanosaild.htm?list1097511 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-11 |title=NASA to Attempt Historic Solar Sail Deployment |publisher=NASA |date=2008-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second backup version, [[NanoSail-D2]], also sometimes called simply NanoSail-D,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/connect/chat/nanosail_chat2_prt.htm|title=NASA Chat: First Solar Sail Deploys in Low-Earth Orbit|date=2011-01-27|publisher=NASA|quote=Sometimes the satellite is called NanoSail-D and sometimes NanoSail-D2. ...

The objectives of the mission were to test sail deployment technologies, and to gather data about the use of solar sails as a simple, "passive" means of de-orbiting dead satellites and space debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/news/releases/2011/11-055.html|title=NASA - NASA's NanoSail-D Satellite Continues to Slowly De-Orbit Earth's Upper Atmosphere|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NanoSail-D structure was made of aluminium and plastic, with the spacecraft massing less than {{convert |10|lb|kg}}. The sail has about {{convert|100|sqft|m2}} of light-catching surface. After some initial problems with deployment, the solar sail was deployed and over the course of its 240-day mission reportedly produced a "wealth of data" concerning the use of solar sails as passive deorbit devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/11-148.html|title=NASA - NASA's Nanosail-D 'Sails' Home -- Mission Complete|website=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[NASA]] launched the second NanoSail-D unit stowed inside the FASTSAT satellite on the Minotaur IV on November 19, 2010. The ejection date from the FASTSAT microsatellite was planned for December 6, 2010, but deployment only occurred on January 20, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/smallsats/nanosaild.html |title=NASA - NanoSail-D Home Page |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2011-01-21 |accessdate=2011-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary Society LightSail Projects===
{{main article|LightSail-2}}

In June 21, 2005, a joint private project between [[Planetary Society]], [[Cosmos Studios]] and [[Russian Academy of Science]]  launched a prototype sail ''Cosmos 1''  from a submarine in the [[Barents Sea]], but the [[Volna]] rocket failed, and the spacecraft failed to reach orbit. They intended to use the sail to gradually raise the spacecraft to a higher Earth orbit over a mission duration of one month. The launch attempt sparked public interest according to Louis Friedman.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman Louis, "The Rise and Fall of Cosmos 1", http://sail.planetary.org/story-part-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the failed launch attempt of Cosmos 1, [[The Planetary Society]] received applause for their efforts from the space community and sparked a rekindled interest in solar sail technology.

On Carl Sagan's 75th birthday (November 9, 2009) the Planetary Society announced plans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/science/space/10solar.html| title=Setting Sail Into Space, Propelled by Sunshine| last=OVERBYE| first=DENNIS| date=November 9, 2009| language=| quote=Planetary Society, ... the next three years, ... series of solar-sail spacecraft dubbed LightSails|accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make three further attempts, dubbed [[LightSail-1]], -2, and -3.&lt;ref name="planetary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/lightsail-solar-sailing/lightsail-mission-faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430105820/http://www.planetary.org/explore/projects/lightsail-solar-sailing/lightsail-mission-faq.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 April 2012 |title=LightSail Mission FAQ |publisher=[[The Planetary Society]] |accessdate=18 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new design will use a 32 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Mylar sail, deployed in four triangular segments like NanoSail-D.&lt;ref name="planetary"/&gt; The launch configuration is a 3U [[CubeSat]] format, and as of 2015, it was scheduled as a secondary payload for a 2016 launch on the first [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon Heavy]] launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |last1=Nye| first1=Bill |title=Kickstart LightSail |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDBzRa9RzfM |time=3:20 |accessdate=15 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
"[[LightSail-1]]" was launched on 20 May 2015.&lt;ref name=NBCNEWS&gt;{{cite web |title=Blastoff! X-37B Space Plane and LightSail Solar Sail Go Into Orbit |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/blastoff-x-37b-space-plane-lightsail-solar-sail-go-space-n361931}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the test was to allow a full checkout of the satellite's systems in advance of the main 2019 mission, LightSail-2.

==Projects in development or proposed==
Despite the losses of ''Cosmos 1'' and NanoSail-D (which were due to failure of their launchers), scientists and engineers around the world remain encouraged and continue to work on solar sails. While most direct applications created so far intend to use the sails as inexpensive modes of cargo transport, some scientists are investigating the possibility of using solar sails as a means of transporting humans. This goal is strongly related to the management of very large (i.e. well above 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) surfaces in space and the sail making advancements.  Manned space flight utilizing solar sails is still in the development state of infancy.

===Sunjammer 2015===
{{Main article|Sunjammer (spacecraft)}}
A technology demonstration sail craft, dubbed [[Sunjammer (spacecraft)|''Sunjammer'']], was in development with the intent to prove the viability and value of sailing technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/tdm/solarsail/solarsail_overview.html |title=Nasa Solar Sail Demonstration |publisher=www.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sunjammer'' had a square sail, 124 feet (38 meters) wide on each side (total area 13,000 sq ft or 1,208 sq m).  It would have traveled from the Sun-Earth {{L1}} [[Lagrangian point]] 900,000 miles from Earth (1.5 million km) to a distance of 1,864,114 miles (3 million kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/19565-worlds-largest-solar-sail-sunjammer.html|title=NASA to Launch World's Largest Solar Sail in 2014|author=Leonard David|publisher=Space.com|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstration was expected to launch on a [[Falcon 9]] in January 2015.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/worlds-largest-solar-sail-launch-november-2014-214450113.html|title=World's Largest Solar Sail to Launch in November 2014|author=Mike Wall|publisher=Space.com|date=June 13, 2013|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would have been a secondary payload, released after the placement of the [[Deep Space Climate Observatory|DSCOVR]] climate satellite at the L1 point.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"/&gt; Citing a lack of confidence in its contractor's ability to deliver, the mission was cancelled in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spacenews.com/article/civil-space/42227nasa-nixes-sunjammer-mission-cites-integration-schedule-risk|title=NASA Nixes Sunjammer Mission, Cites Integration, Schedule Risk|last=Leone|first=Dan|work=spacenews.com|date=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gossamer deorbit sail===
{{asof|2013|12}}, the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) has a proposed deorbit sail, named "''Gossamer''", that would be intended to be used to accelerate the deorbiting of small (less than {{convert|700|kg}}) artificial satellites from [[low-Earth orbit]]s.  The launch mass is {{convert|2|kg}} with a launch volume of only {{convert|15|*|15|*|25|cm|ft}}.  Once deployed, the sail would expand to {{convert|5|x|5|m|ft}} and would use a combination of solar pressure on the sail and increased atmospheric drag to accelerate satellite [[atmospheric entry|reentry]].&lt;ref name=ps20131226&gt;

===OKEANOS===
{{main article|OKEANOS}}
OKEANOS (Outsized Kite-craft for Exploration and Astronautics in the Outer Solar System) is a proposed mission concept by Japan's [[JAXA]] to Jupiter's [[Jupiter Trojan|Trojan asteroids]] using a hybrid solar sail for propulsion; the sail is covered with thin [[Solar panels on spacecraft|solar panels]] to power an [[ion engine]]. ''In-situ'' analysis of the collected samples would be performed by either direct contact or using a lander carrying a high-resolution mass spectrometer. A lander and a sample-return to Earth are options under study.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto 2015"&gt; [http://www.hayabusa.isas.jaxa.jp/kawalab/astro/pdf/2015A_16.pdf Sampling Scenario for the Trojan Asteroid Exploration Mission] (PDF).

'''The Geochemist's Workbench''' (GWB) is an integrated set of interactive [[Simulation software|software]] tools for solving a range of problems in aqueous [[chemistry]]. The graphical user interface simplifies the use of the [[geochemical code]].

== History ==
The GWB package was originally developed at the Department of [[Geology]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] over a period of more than twenty years,&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C. and Yeakel, S., 2016, ''The Geochemist’s Workbench® Release 11 - GWB Essentials Guide''. https://www.gwb.com/pdf/GWB11/GWBessentials.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; under the sponsorship initially of a consortium of companies and government laboratories and later through license fees paid by a community of users.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, L. and M. Goldhaber, 2011, ''The Geochemist's Workbench Computer Program''. http://crustal.usgs.gov/projects/aqueous_geochemistry/geochemists_workbench.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, J., March 2012, ''Aqueous Solutions: Solving problems from carbon sequestration to Fukushima''. Central Illinois Business, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, the GWB development team moved to the Research Park at the University of Illinois, where they operate as an independent company named Aqueous Solutions LLC.&lt;ref name="Bethke"&gt;Bethke, C.M., and S. Yeakel, 2014, ''The Geochemist's Workbench User's Guides'', Version 10.0. Aqueous Solutions LLC, Champaign&lt;/ref&gt; Since its release, over 3,000 copies have been licensed in 64 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Official website http://www.gwb.com/software_overview.php&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, a free Student Edition of the software was released.&lt;ref name = "GWB Student"&gt;Student Edition website http://student.gwb.com/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

An early version of the software was one of the first applications of [[Parallel computing|parallel]] [[Vector processing|vector computing]], the predecessor to today's [[multi-core processor]]s, to geological research.&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C.M., W.J. Harrison, C. Upson, and S.P. Altaner, 1988, Supercomputer analysis of sedimentary basins. ''Science'' '''239''', 261-267&lt;/ref&gt; The current release is [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreaded]], and as such retains features of the early parallel vector architecture.&lt;ref&gt;GWB Multithreading page http://www.gwb.com/multithread.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The GWB is an integrated [[geochemical]] [[Computer simulation|modeling]] package used for balancing [[chemical reactions]], calculating stability diagrams and the [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] states of natural waters, tracing reaction processes, modeling reactive transport, plotting the results of these calculations, and storing the related data.  The Workbench, designed for personal computers running [[MS Windows]], is distributed commercially in three packages: GWB Professional, Standard, and Essentials, as well as in the free [[#Other geochemical modeling programs in common use|GWB Student Edition]].&lt;ref name="NGWA Newszine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geochemistry Software Made Available for Free to Students|url=http://newsmanager.commpartners.com/ngwanz/issues/2014-08-22/3.html#1|website=www.ngwa.org|publisher=National Ground Water Association|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GWB reads datasets of [[thermodynamic]] [[equilibrium constants]] (most commonly compiled from 0 to 300&amp;nbsp;°C along the steam saturation curve) with which it can calculate chemical equilibria. Thermodynamic datasets from other popular programs like PHREEQC,&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L., 1995, User's Guide to PHREEQC, a computer model for speciation, reaction-path, advective-transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 95-4227.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Parkhurst and Appelo"&gt;Parkhurst, D.L. and C.A.J. Appelo, 1999, User's Guide to PHREEQC (version 2), a computer program for speciation, batch-reaction, one-dimensional transport and inverse geochemical calculations. US Geological Survey Water-Resources Investigations Report 99-4259.&lt;/ref&gt; WATEQ4F,&lt;ref name = "Ball and Nordstrom"&gt;Ball, J.W. and D.K. Nordstrom, 1991, User's manual for WATEQ4F, with revised thermodynamic data base and test cases for calculating speciation of major, trace, and redox elements in natural waters. US Geological Survey Open File Report 91-183.&lt;/ref&gt; and Visual MINTEQ&lt;ref name = "Visual MINTEQ"&gt;hem.bredband.net/b108693/-VisualMINTEQ_references.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; have been formatted for the GWB, enabling comparison and validation of the different codes.&lt;ref&gt;Gustafsson, J.P., 2010, ''Visual MINTEQ thermodynamic databases in GWB format''. http://www2.lwr.kth.se/English/OurSoftware/vminteq/download.html&lt;/ref&gt; The program K2GWB&lt;ref&gt;Cleverley, J.S. and E.N. Bastrakov, 2005, K2GWB: Utility for generating thermodynamic data files for The Geochemist's Workbench® at 0–1000 °C and 1–5000 bar from UT2K and the UNITHERM database. ''Computers &amp; Geosciences'' '''31''', 756-767&lt;/ref&gt; (log K to GWB) was written to generate thermodynamic data for GWB under pressures and temperatures beyond the limits of the default datasets. The GWB can couple chemical reaction with [[Groundwater model|hydrologic transport]] to produce simulations known as [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport models]]. GWB can calculate flow fields dynamically, or import flow fields as numeric data or calculated directly from the [[USGS]] hydrologic flow code [[MODFLOW]].&lt;ref name="Bethke" /&gt;

== Uses in science and industry ==
[[Geochemistry|Geochemists]] working in the field, office, lab, or classroom store their analyses, calculate the [[Chemical equilibrium|distribution of chemical mass]], create plots and diagrams, evaluate their experiments, and solve real-world problems.

The software is used by [[Environmental chemistry|environmental chemists]], [[Environmental engineering|engineers]], [[Environmental microbiology|microbiologists]], and remediators to gain quantitative understanding of the chemical and microbiological reactions which control the fate and mobility of contaminants in the biosphere. With this knowledge, they can develop predictive models of contaminant fate and transport, and test the effectiveness of costly remediation schemes before implementing them in the field.

Within the energy industry, [[Petroleum engineering|petroleum engineers]], [[Mining engineering|mining geologists]], [[environmental geochemists]] and [[geothermal energy]] developers use the software to search for resources, optimize recovery, and manage wastes, all while using safe and environmentally friendly practices. Geocientists manage the side effects of energy production in [[carbon sequestration]] projects and in the design of [[Deep geological repository|nuclear waste repositories]].

== Uses in education ==
Hundreds of scholarly articles cite or use GWB&lt;ref name="Google Scholar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Scholar search: The Geochemist's Workbench|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Geochemist%27s+Workbench+&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C14|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several textbooks apply the software to solve common problems in environmental [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]], the [[petroleum industry]], and [[economic geology]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethke, C.M., 1996, ''Geochemical Reaction Modeling, Concepts and Applications''. Oxford University Press, 397 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhu, C. and G. Anderson, 2002, ''Environmental Applications of Geochemical Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 300 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geochemistry]] students can save time performing routine but tedious tasks that are easily accomplished with the software. Instead of balancing chemical reactions and constructing [[Pourbaix diagram|Eh-pH diagrams]] by hand, for example, students can spend time exploring advanced topics like [[Chemical equilibrium|multi-component equilibrium]], [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] theory, or [[Reactive transport modeling in porous media|reactive transport]].&lt;ref name="GBRM"/&gt; Students can apply for a free download of The Geochemist's Workbench Student Edition from the developer's website.&lt;ref name="GWB Student" /&gt;

{{listen|filename=17.4 kHz sound.ogg|align=right|title=The Mosquito ringtone|description= This is a 10-second sample of an audio clip at a frequency of approximately 17.4 kHz.&lt;ref name=MK4&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/security-equipment-mosquito-mk4-anti-loitering-device#key-spec |title=The Mosquito MK4 Anti-Loitering device – Key specifications |publisher=Compoundsecurity.co.uk |date=21 February 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''The Mosquito''' or '''Mosquito alarm''' is an electronic device used to deter [[loitering]] by young people by emitting sound at high frequency, in some versions so it can be heard mostly by younger people. The devices have attracted controversy on the basis of human rights and discrimination concerns.

The device is marketed as a safety and security tool for preventing youths from congregating in specific areas. As such, it is promoted to reduce [[anti-social behaviour]], such as loitering,  [[vandalism]], [[recreational drugs|drug use]], drug distribution, and violence. In the UK, over 3,000 have been sold, mainly for use outside shops and near [[transport hub]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7759818.stm Now crime gadget can annoy us all], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The device is also sold in Australia, France, Denmark, Italy,  Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Canada and the USA.&lt;ref name=epochtimes&gt;The Epoch Times. 6 August 2008. Joan Delaney, [http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/canada/mosquito-high-frequency-repellent-2280.html ''‘Mosquito’ Prompts Teens to Buzz Off ''.]. Retrieved 6 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say that it discriminates against young people and infringes their human rights, while supporters argue that making the Mosquito illegal would infringe the rights of shopkeepers who suffer business losses when "unruly teenagers" drive away their customers.&lt;ref name=walesonline&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffan Rhys |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2008/02/11/mosquito-device-inventor-tells-campaign-to-buzz-off-91466-20459944/ |title=News – Wales News – Mosquito device inventor tells campaign to buzz off |publisher=WalesOnline |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosquito distributors have said that they keep standards to ensure that the device is not abused, and Howard Stapleton who invented the device has asked European governments to legislate guidelines governing its use.&lt;ref name=epochtimes/&gt;

The newest version of the device, launched late in 2008, has two frequency settings, one of approximately 17.4 [[hertz|kHz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/atc/atc_teenbuzz.mp3?dl=1 |title=MP3 sample of the 17.4&amp;nbsp;kHz tone |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can generally be heard only by young people, and another at 8 kHz that can be heard by most people. The maximum potential output [[Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level|sound pressure level]] is stated by the manufacturer to be 108 [[decibel|decibels (dB)]], and the manufacturer's product specification furthermore states that the sound can typically be heard by people below 25 years of age.&lt;ref name=MK4 /&gt; The ability to hear high frequencies deteriorates in most humans with age (a condition known as [[presbycusis]]), typically observable by the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-high-frequency-hearing/ |title=Sonic Science: The High-Frequency Hearing Test |author=Education.com |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=23 May 2013 |accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Mosquito machine was invented by Howard Stapleton in 2005, and was originally tested in [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]], [[South Wales]], where it was successful in reducing [[teenagers]] loitering near a [[grocery store]].&lt;ref Name="Lyall"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|last=Lyall|authorlink=Sarah Lyall|title=This Mosquito makes unruly teenagers buzz off|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=28 November 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/28/world/europe/this-mosquito-makes-unruly-teenagers-buzz-off.html|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was born after he was irritated by a factory noise when he was a child.&lt;ref name="BBC051108"&gt;{{cite news|title=Noise machine deters shop gangs |publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2005|url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_east/4415318.stm | accessdate =11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The push to create the product was when Mr. Stapleton's 17-year-old daughter went to the store to buy milk and was harassed by a group of 12 to 15-year-olds. Using his children as test subjects, he determined the frequency of "The Mosquito."&lt;ref&gt;Discovery's Science Channel "Weird Connections" Episode 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mosquito was released to the mainstream market in 2005, through Stapleton's company Compound Security Solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/business-news/lifes-buzz-mosquito-inventor-2367385|title=Life's a buzz for Mosquito inventor|last=Williamson|first=David|date=11 November 2005|work=Wales Online|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current device has two settings: the high frequency sound targeted at youth, and another that can be heard by everyone. The range of the sound is {{convert|140|ft|0}} with the [[sound baffle]], and {{convert|200|ft|0}} without. It requires a 24-volt DC or 15-volt AC power supply.

A device installed in a [[SPAR|Spar]] shop in Caerleon Road in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], South Wales&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4839346.stm |title=Anti-gang noise box switched off |publisher=BBC News |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was banned after three months by the Newport Community Safety Partnership, a partnership set up to meet the requirements of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], with members including [[Newport City Council]], [[Gwent Police]], Newport Local Health Board, South Wales Fire Service, representatives of [[Her Majesty's Customs and Excise|Customs and Excise]], and the [[Welsh Assembly Government]]. Despite the ban, another Spar shop in Newport installed the device. A Newport Community Safety Partnership spokesman said: "Any view expressed by the Partnership does not stop any business or private company from purchasing these devices. They must ensure these systems comply with the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/archive/2006/04/12/Gwent+Archive/4625078._Mosquito__returns_to_zap_the_rowdies/ |title='Mosquito' returns to zap the rowdies |publisher=South Wales Argus |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426175910/http://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/archive/2006/04/12/Gwent+Archive/4625078._Mosquito__returns_to_zap_the_rowdies/ |archive-date=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, in response to a national campaign launched by the [[Children’s Commissioner for England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/news/3500-ultra-sonic-dispersal-devises-told-buzz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207104553/http://www.childrenscommissioner.gov.uk/news/3500-ultra-sonic-dispersal-devises-told-buzz |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2017 |title=3,500 ultra-sonic dispersal devises told to Buzz Off |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2017 |publisher=Office of the Children's Commissioner }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], and the [[National Youth Agency]], the government issued a statement insisting that "'Mosquito alarms are not banned and the government has no plans to ban them".&lt;ref name=walesonline/&gt;

===Teen Buzz ringtone===

The sound was made into a mobile phone [[ringtone]], which could not be heard by teachers if the phone rang during a class.&lt;ref Name="GadgetSpy "&gt;{{cite web

==Awards==

The Mosquito won the [[Ig Nobel]] for Peace in 2006. The Ig Nobels celebrate the quirkier side of serious scientific endeavour, honouring "achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/oct/06/science.highereducation |title=Electronic teenager repellant and scraping fingernails, the sounds of Ig Nobel success &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian  |date= 6 October 2006|accessdate=21 June 2009 | location=London | first=Alok | last=Jha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==

The German [[Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] stated in a report on The Mosquito, entitled ''"Use of ultrasonic noise channels not entirely safe"'':

{{quote|The results of the examination are now available. The auditors were not able to certify this device as completely safe.

The risk to the target group of teenagers and young adults is relatively low. They can leave the area when they hear the sound. On the other hand small children and infants are especially at risk, due to lengthy exposure to the sound, because the adults themselves do not perceive the noise. Moreover, the [[ultrasound]] affects not only hearing. Disruption of the equilibrium senses, as well as other extra-aural effects are well known. With the sound levels that can be reached by the device, the onset of dizziness, headache, nausea and impairment is to be expected. This is not the limit of the total risks to safety and health.&lt;ref name="baua"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baua.de/nn_5858/de/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2007/12/pm079-07.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131822/http://www.baua.de/nn_5858/de/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2007/12/pm079-07.html |archive-date=27 September 2011 |title=Einsatz von Ultraschall-Störgeräusch-Sendern nicht ganz unbedenklich |publisher=German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health |date=14 December 2007 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

In a United Kingdom survey of the relevant studies of adults exposed to high frequency sound in an occupational context for the [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) in 2001, it was concluded that the studies were inadequate to establish guidelines for safe exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Health and Safety Executive]]. Institute of Sound and Vibration Research. [http://www.hse.gov.uk/research/crr_pdf/2001/crr01343.pdf ''Damage to human hearing by airborne sound of very high frequency or ultrasonic frequency'']. Retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mosquito's manufacturer relies on these inconclusive adult studies to justify the safety of the device.&lt;ref&gt;compoundsecurity.co.uk.

Retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Autistic Society]] said in 2008 that it was "extremely concerned" about possible harmful effects of the devices upon people with autism.&lt;ref name="brookfield"/&gt; Since autism causes auditory [[hypersensitivity]], individuals with this disability can have more intense reactions to this sound, especially if they are also under 25.{{cn|date=November 2015}} Since autism can also affect communication skills, some individuals may not be able to communicate their discomfort to caregivers.{{cn|date=November 2015}} A supermarket in [[Longridge]], England, removed a mosquito device in 2008 after a campaign by a 19-year-old Paul Brookfield, who has autism.

Other disabilities may be exacerbated by the device. In March 2009, a child who had recently undergone ear surgery reported that the device set off her tinnitus, causing significant pain. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childrensrights.ie/sites/default/files/submissions_reports/files/BriefingNoteMosquitoMarch09_0.pdf ''Children’s Rights Alliance Briefing Note on the Mosquito Device''].

==Support of the Mosquito==

The Mosquito has received support and endorsements from municipalities, school districts, property management companies, convenience stores and other organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compoundsecurity.co.uk/about-us/testimonials|title=Testimonials From Our Clients|publisher=Compound Security Systems|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rochdale Safer Communities Partnership said the borough was committed to the continued use of the Mosquito:

"We feel totally justified in deploying Mosquito devices in the borough of Rochdale to give the community respite in cases of acute anti-social behaviour and youth nuisance," she said. "We use the devices when there are large groups of young people making life a problem for residents and businesses, as we are very keen not to let problems of anti-social behaviour escalate."&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/s/1036237_mosquito_device_defended_|title='Mosquito device' defended |last=Ottewell|first=David|date=13 February 2008|work=Manchester Evening News|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) also supports the usage of the device,&lt;ref name="manchestereveningnews.co.uk"/&gt; and so does British Retail Consortium (BRC), stating that "Not all young people are involved in violence, but given that some retail staff are facing a level of insolence [from teenagers] they have to have the option of doing what they can to protect themselves. They are entitled to discourage threatening groups from hanging around or in their shops."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/02/14/44435/anti-yob-mosquito-device-backed-by-british-retail-consortium.html|title=Anti-yob 'mosquito' device backed by British Retail Consortium|last=Peacock|first=Louisa|date=14 February 2008|work=Personnel Today|accessdate=17 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202211252/http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/2008/02/14/44435/anti-yob-mosquito-device-backed-by-british-retail-consortium.html|archivedate=2 December 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Maple Ridge, Pitt Meadows and Vancouver west side school districts in British Columbia, Canada, the device has been credited with lowering exterior vandalism at one school by about 40%.&lt;ref name=epochtimes /&gt;

==Opposition==

Opposition categorises it as an indiscriminate&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7240180.stm |title=Calls to ban 'anti-teen' device |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name="Mahadevan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mahadevan |first=Janaki |title=Campaigners call for Mosquito alarm ban |publisher=Watford Observer |date=14 February 2008 |url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/news/2043241.campaigners_call_for_mosquito_alarm_ban/ | accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sonic weapon]] which succeeds only in demonising children and young people and may breach their human rights.&lt;ref name=BBC3/&gt;  The [[National Youth Rights Association]] has met with some success fighting the devices in the United States.&lt;ref name=NYRA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youthrights.org/2011/06/22/hastings-debates-pitching-out-teen-vandals/ |title=Hastings Debates Pitching Out Teen Vandals |publisher=StarTribune |date=22 June 2011 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYRA2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://youthrights.org/2010/10/04/gallery-place-mosquito-swatted-down/ |title=Gallery Place “Mosquito” Swatted Down |publisher=NBC 4 Washington |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A UK campaign called "Buzz off" is calling for The Mosquito to be banned.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; [[Shami Chakrabarti]], director of Liberty, has claimed that the sound is "untested [and] unregulated" and that it can be a "sonic weapon directed against children and young people." [[Albert Aynsley-Green]], the former Children’s Commissioner for England, criticised the devices for indiscriminately targeting all children and babies regardless of their behaviour. He described such measures as "demonising children and young people", and creating a "dangerous and widening divide" between the young and the old.&lt;ref Name="Mahadevan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news | date=9 June 2008 | title=UK society 'demonising' children | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7443104.stm | accessdate=14 June 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was singled out for criticism in a joint report by children's commissioners for all parts of the UK, which formed part of a United Nations review of standards in the UK.&lt;ref name=BBC2/&gt; A report for the [[Council of Europe]] called for a ban in 2010, suggesting use of the Mosquito may breach human rights law.&lt;ref name=BBC3&gt;{{cite news | date=28 June 2010 | title=Calls to ban Mosquito 'teen repellent' device ruled out | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10442500 | accessdate=14 June 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, the device was banned on all Council and Partnership buildings in Sheffield following a successful campaign led by the then Member of UK Youth Parliament for Sheffield, [[Harrison Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffieldtelegraph.co.uk/news/local/local-teen-wins-campaign-to-ban-controversial-device-1-3104497|title=Local teen wins campaign to ban controversial device|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffield is the largest city in the country with such a ban in place. It was recognised by the UK Government in their Positive For Youth document, published by the Department for Education in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Positive for Youth: A new approach to cross-government policy for young people aged 13 to 19 |url=http://media.education.gov.uk/assets/files/positive%20for%20youth.pdf |publisher=[[Department for Education]] |date=2011 |page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy paper acts to set out a new-approach to cross government policy for young people aged 13–19. Although mentioned in the document, a national ban of the mosquito device was not in the Coalition Agreement, and is not part of current Government policy.

In July 2014, a new campaign was started in order to get a mosquito device removed from the public library in [[Milford Haven]], [[Pembrokeshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/remove-mosquito-device-audio-weapon-from-milford-haven-library|title=Remove Mosquito Device/Audio Weapon from Milford Haven Library!|publisher=|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milfordmercury.co.uk/news/11330284.display/|title='Mosquito' alarm campaign grows wings|work=Milford Mercury|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Nodeterentatmhl?fref=ts|title=Stop The Mosquito Device/Anti-Teen Weapon at Milford Haven Library|work=Facebook|accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is ongoing.

In 2016, a shopping centre in Queensland, Australia removed the device after two years of campaigning by a local lawyer, due to it discriminating young people. It had been installed in the centre for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/jun/30/national-ban-sought-on-sonic-anti-loitering-device-aimed-at-young-people |title=National ban sought on sonic anti-loitering device aimed at young people |date=30 June 2016 |last=Robertson |first=Joshua|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==

Campaigners and authorities in many countries have stated that they believe the device to breach human rights&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt; and may even constitute assault.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/archives/2007/0530/ireland/using-mosquito-devices-on-children-could-constitute-assault-says-ombudsman-33884.html |title=Using mosquito devices on children could constitute assault, says ombudsman |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=30 May 2007 |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]] has expressed concern that the device may violate sections 8 and 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|author=Florian Rötzer |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/24/24893/1.html |title=TP: Akustische Waffe oder harmlose Teenagerabwehr? |publisher=Heise.de |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom's [[Human Rights Act 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/mosquito-device.shtml |title=The Mosquito Device |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928044813/http://www.liberty-human-rights.org.uk/news-and-events/mosquito-device.shtml |archive-date=28 September 2007 |publisher=[[Liberty (advocacy group)|Liberty]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] prepared a report stating that this device violates many articles of both the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]], and should be banned in Europe, because it is often "painful" and causes "degrading and discriminatory consequences for young people".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |title=Recommendation 1930 (2010): Prohibiting the marketing and use of the “Mosquito” youth dispersal device |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=17891&amp;lang=en |last=Wach |first=Piotr |date=25 June 2010 |publisher=[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] |accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, Baroness Sarah Ludford [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] moved a motion to the [[European Parliament]] to ban the use of the Mosquito. It failed to get enough signatures from MEPs to proceed to a full debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/EU-rejects-bid-ban-Mosquito/article-326093-detail/article.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712032930/http://www.thisisplymouth.co.uk/news/EU-rejects-bid-ban-Mosquito/article-326093-detail/article.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 July 2009 |title=EU rejects bid to ban Mosquito |publisher=Thisisplymouth.co.uk |date=14 September 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium, a resolution was passed by the House in June 2008 asking the government to take all necessary measures to prohibit the use of devices like the Mosquito on Belgian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rtlinfo.be/rtl/archive/article/143873?&amp;archiveYear=2008 |title=Le Mosquito proche d'être interdit en Belgique? |trans-title=The Mosquito close to being banned in Belgium? |date=26 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720013128/http://www.rtlinfo.be/rtl/archive/article/143873?&amp;archiveYear=2008 |archive-date=20 July 2009|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legality of the device has also been tested in the French courts, where the Tribunal de Grande Instance de [[Saint-Brieuc]] prohibited the use of The Mosquito within its municipality, and ordered a private individual to pay €2,000 compensation after operating the device outside their house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=lefigaro.fr |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualites/2008/04/30/01001-20080430ARTFIG00369-la-justice-interdit-le-boitier-anti-jeunes.php |title=Le Figaro – Actualités : La justice interdit le boîtier anti-jeunes |work=[[Le Figaro]]|date=30 April 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ireland's Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, anyone who "directly or indirectly applies force to or causes an impact on the body of another... without the consent of the other" (force including "application of [any] form of energy"), is guilty of committing assault. This issue has been raised in relation to the Mosquito device by Ireland's Ombudsman for Children following legal advice provided by Youth Work Ireland,&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt; but has yet to be tested in the Irish courts.

In the United Kingdom, the manufacturers claim that the tones are broadcast at 75&amp;nbsp;dB,{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} meaning that the product falls within the government's auditory-safety limits, although the German news source [[Heise News Ticker|Heise]] reported the device emits 85&amp;nbsp;dB.,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and websites{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} selling the Mosquito claim it can go up to 95dB with a special chip, which in reality allows the Mosquito to reach 104dB.&lt;ref name="baua" /&gt; The government of the United Kingdom issued a statement in 2008 stating that "'Mosquito alarms are not banned and the government has no plans to ban them".&lt;ref name=walesonline /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7241527.stm |title=No plan to ban 'anti-teen' device |publisher=BBC News |date=12 February 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English county of [[Kent]] has chosen not to allow the usage of the Mosquito on council-owned buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2008/jun/13/localgovernment.youngpeople |title=Kent bans high-pitch Mosquito which targets youths |work=The Guardian  |date=13 June 2008 |accessdate=21 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[macroeconomics]], the '''triangle model''' employed by [[new Keynesian economics]] is a model of inflation derived from the [[Phillips Curve]] and given its name by [[Robert J. Gordon]]. The model views inflation as having three root causes: [[built-in inflation]], [[demand-pull inflation]], and [[cost-push inflation]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Gordon (1988), ''Macroeconomics: Theory and Policy'', 2nd ed., Chap. 22.4, 'Modern theories of inflation'. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the earliest theories of the Phillips Curve, the triangle model attempts to account for the phenomenon of [[stagflation]].

'''''Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That?''''' is a 2012 non-fiction book by the American humorist [[Henry Alford (writer)|Henry Alford]] that details [[manners]] from around the world.

After being interested in a quote by [[Edmund Burke]] about how important manners are, Alford traveled around the world researching manners. He also interviews people such as etiquette authority [[Judith Martin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/books/review/would-it-kill-you-to-stop-doing-that-a-modern-guide-to-manners-by-henry-alford-book-review.html |title=Henry Alford on How to Behave |author=Jincy Willet |date=6 January 2012 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Jincy Willet of ''The New York Times'' said that the book "amuses as much as it informs". Sarah Halzack of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the book "a bit haphazard" although "his self-effacing tone and dry sense of humor help to unify the pieces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/2012/01/09/gIQAXQFrnQ_story.html |title=‘Would It Kill You To Stop Doing That?: A Modern Guide to Manners’ by Henry Alford |author=Sarah Halzack |date=3 February 2012 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Marchand of ''[[National Post]]'' said that "sometimes his humour is a bit strained" although his advice can be "very practical".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/01/20/open-book-would-it-kill-you-to-stop-doing-that-by-henry-alford/ |title=Open Book: Would It Kill You to Stop Doing That? by Henry Alford |author=Philip Marchand |date=20 January 2012 |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
