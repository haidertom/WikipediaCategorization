'''"A Lost Wand"''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[Jean Ingelow]].  It was first published in 1872 as part of ''The Little Wonder Horn'',&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bibsite/&gt; and later republished as one of the stories in ''Wonder-Box Tales'' in 1902.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt; The story revolves around Hulda, a lucky young girl in [[Norway]] who receives the opportunity to be granted a wish after finding a ring in her slice of cake.

== Summary ==
After finding a magical ring in her slice of cake, Hulda is given the opportunity to make a wish. A fairy appears from the flower on top of the cake, and tells Hulda she will give her anything she wishes for. Unknowing of what her wish would bring, she asks for the fairy's wand. After handing Hulda her beautiful [[gold]] wand, the fairy is stripped of her powers and will ultimately be held at the will of her enemy if she doesn’t one day retrieve the wand. It could not be returned immediately, it had to be on a midsummers day. Until then, the fairy requested that Hulda keep it safe for her while she was gone. Days passed and the fairy had never returned, this left Hulda believing that the fairy had died. Then a  dishonest guest paid a visit to Hulda and convinced her to trade the wand for a piece of his beautiful jewelry. After trading the wand for a bracelet with a bird clasp, Hulda realizes her visitor was actually a [[gnome]]. The gnome was the enemy the fairy had been worried about; with the wand in his possession he would make the fairy his slave. Hulda was aware she made a mistake, and did not rest until she retrieved the gold wand and returned it to the fairy. Not only did she give the fairy her powers back, but also in turn she saved her own life.&lt;ref name=Gutenberg/&gt;

== History and origin ==
"A Lost Wand" was written in the mid-1800s.  Much of Ingelow’s literature was influenced by the writings of [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[George Macdonald]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Her stories were written specifically for children, not so much to teach a lesson; but for entertainment,{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} which was a relatively new concept during this time period.

== Characters ==

=== Hulda ===

Hulda is a young girl from Norway whose world is turned upside down after being granted a wish by a fairy. After receiving her wish, she regrets ever making it. She spends the next few years of her life trying to undo what she asked for. Her genuine, courageous attitude is what ultimately helps her catch the enemy and relieve the fairy of Hulda's unfortunate wish.

=== The Fairy ===

The reason for the fairy's existence is to better the lives of mortals, which she does by granting them one wish. After an unfortunate wish is made by a young girl Hulda, the fairy is stripped of her powers and held at the will of her enemy she goes into hiding. Her hopeful outlook on the situation however is the guidance that the little girl Hulda needed to retrieve what she had once lost for the fairy.

=== The Peddler (Gnome) ===

The [[gnome]] is a creature covered in dirt and earthly material. Although he disguised himself as "The Peddler", he was still the known enemy of the fairy. His devious, evil ways almost stripped the fairy of her powers for good. His bad intentions did not go unpunished; in the end it is always those with kindness in mind who prosper.

'''Africa Beyond''' is a project celebrating African arts and culture in the UK, supported by [[Arts Council England]], the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], the [[British Museum]], the [[Southbank Centre]], iniva (Institute for International Visual Arts) and other partners.

Africa Beyond was founded in March 2006, based in [[London]]. It was created as a legacy of Africa 05, a major celebration of African arts, held throughout 2005. It organises artist residencies linking Africa and the UK, runs public events such as the Word from Africa festival (first hosted at the British Museum in May 2007), and works with arts venues to improve their links with African audiences and artists.

The BBC hosted the Africa Beyond website, which features articles on African music, film, theatre, dance, literature and visual arts, with a special focus on artists and stories relevant to audiences in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesouthafrican.com/bbc-launches-africa-beyond/ "BBC launches Africa Beyond"], TheSouthAfrica.com, 27 march 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The website is no longer updated.

'''''Along the River During the Qingming Festival''''', also known by its [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name as the '''''Qingming Shanghe Tu''''', is a painting by the [[Song dynasty]] artist [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085–1145). It captures the daily life of people and the landscape of the capital, Bianjing (present-day [[Kaifeng]]) during the [[Northern Song]]. The theme is often said to celebrate the festive spirit and worldly commotion at the [[Qingming Festival]], rather than the holiday's ceremonial aspects, such as [[ancestral veneration|tomb sweeping and prayers]]. Successive scenes reveal the lifestyle of all levels of the society from rich to poor as well as different economic activities in rural areas and the city, and offer glimpses of period clothing and architecture.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt;  The painting is considered to be the most renowned work among all [[Chinese painting]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Christ to Coke: How Image Becomes Icon|author =[[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Kemp, Martin]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|isbn=978-0-19-161988-5|page=8|quote=...an image-making society second to none before the nineteenth century, the most famous painting is ''Qingming shanghe tu'' (''Along the River During the Qing Ming Festival'' or ''Spring Festival on the River'') by Zhang Zeduan, an artist working in the eleventh to twelfth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallech/&gt;&lt;ref name=tnm/&gt; and it has been called "China's ''[[Mona Lisa]]''."&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/03/arts/design/03pain.html?_r=2|title=‘China’s Mona Lisa’ Makes a Rare Appearance in Hong Kong|author =Bradsher, Keith|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=July 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an artistic creation, the piece has been revered and court artists of subsequent dynasties made re-interpretive versions, each following the overall composition and the theme of the original but differing in details and technique.&lt;ref name="Doar " &gt;Bruce Doar, "International Conference on Qingming Shanghe Tu and Song Dynasty Genre Paintings, Beijing, 10–12 October 2005.," ''China Heritage Newsletter, China Heritage Project ''4 (December 2005) [http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/scholarship.php?searchterm=004_qingmingconf.inc&amp;issue=004]&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the centuries, the Qingming scroll was collected and kept among numerous private owners, before it eventually returned to public ownership. The painting was a particular favorite of [[Puyi]], the Last Emperor, who took the Song dynasty original with him when he left Beijing. It was re-purchased in 1945 and kept at the Palace Museum in the [[Forbidden City]]. The Song dynasty original and the Qing versions, in the Beijing and Taipei Palace Museums respectively, are regarded as national treasures and are exhibited only for brief periods every few years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2003/01/11/melvin_ed3_.php|title=A rare peek at China's treasures|author =Melvin, Sheila|publisher=''International Herald Tribune''|date=January 11, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The countryside and the densely populated city are the two main sections in the picture, with the river meandering through the entire length. The right section is the rural area of the city. There are crop fields and unhurried rural folk—predominately farmers, goatherds, and pig herders—in bucolic scenery. A country path broadens into a road and joins with the city road. The left half is the urban area, which eventually leads into the city proper with the gates. Many economic activities, such as people loading cargoes onto the boat, shops, and even a tax office, can be seen in this area. People from all walks of life are depicted: peddlers, jugglers, actors, paupers begging, monks asking for alms, fortune tellers and seers, doctors, innkeepers, teachers, millers, metalworkers, carpenters, masons, and official scholars from all ranks.
[[File:清明上河图.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The bridge scene where the crew of an oncoming boat have not yet fully lowered their sails and are in danger of crashing into the bridge]]

Outside the city proper (separated by the gate to the left), there are businesses of all kinds, selling wine, grain, secondhand goods, cookware, bows and arrows, lanterns, musical instruments, gold and silver, ornaments, dyed fabrics, paintings, medicine, needles, and artifacts, as well as many restaurants. The vendors (and in the Qing revision, the shops themselves) extend all along the great bridge, called the Rainbow Bridge (虹橋 ''Hong Qiao'') or, more rarely, the Shangtu Bridge (上土橋).

Where the great bridge crosses the river is the center and main focus of the scroll. A great commotion animates the people on the bridge. A boat approaches at an awkward angle with its [[mast (sailing)|mast]] not completely lowered, threatening to crash into the bridge. The crowds on the bridge and along the riverside are shouting and gesturing toward the boat. Someone near the apex of the bridge lowers a rope to the outstretched arms of the crew below. In addition to the shops and diners, there are inns, temples, private residences, and official buildings varying in grandeur and style, from huts to mansions with grand front- and backyards.

People and commodities are transported by various modes: wheeled wagons, [[Working animal|beasts of labor]] (in particular, a large number of donkeys and mules), sedan chairs, and chariots. The river is packed with fishing boats and passenger-carrying ferries, with men at the river bank, pulling the larger ships.

Many of these details are roughly corroborated by Song dynasty writings, principally the ''[[Dongjing Meng Hua Lu (Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital)|Dongjing Meng Hua Lu]]'', which describes many of the same features of life in the capital.

== Exhibition ==
In a rare move, the Song original was exhibited in Hong Kong from June 29 to mid-August 2007 to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's transfer to the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is estimated that the costs of shipping the painting ran into tens of millions of dollars in addition to an undisclosed cost of insuring this piece of priceless art.

From January 2–24, 2012, the painting was exhibited in the [[Tokyo National Museum]] as the centerpiece of a special exhibition to mark the 40th anniversary of normalized diplomatic relations between China and Japan,&lt;ref name=tnm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnm.jp/modules/r_free_page/index.php?id=1418|title=Two Hundred Selected Masterpieces from the Palace Museum, Beijing|publisher=[[Tokyo National Museum]]|quote=...arguably the most renowned painting in the history of Chinese art, will be included in the exhibition, ''Two Hundred Selected Masterpieces from the Palace Museum, Beijing''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Japanese museum officials providing the "highest security standards" for the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaculture.org/exchange/2012-01/17/content_428302.htm |title=Iconic Painting Causes Crowd Disturbance in Japan |publisher=Chinaculture.org |date=January 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902033748/http://www.chinaculture.org/exchange/2012-01/17/content_428302.htm |archivedate=September 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early copy, generally considered to be very faithful to the original, was made by [[Zhao Mengfu]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]]. Another notable remake was painted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (14th to 17th centuries). This version has a length of 6.7 meters, longer than the original. It also replaced the scenery from the Song dynasty to that of the Ming dynasty based on contemporary fashions and customs, updating the costumes worn by the characters and the styles of vehicles (boats and carts). The Song wooden bridge is replaced with a stone bridge in the Ming remake. The arc of the stone bridge is much taller than that of the wooden original, and where the original had a boat about to crash into the bridge, the reinterpretation has a boat being methodically guided under the bridge by ropes, pulled by men ashore, several other large boats dutifully waiting their turn, undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sing Tao Daily]]'' Hong Kong Island edition.

Another version by five [[Qing dynasty]] court painters (Chen Mu, Sun Hu, Jin Kun, Dai Hong and Cheng Zhidao) was presented to the [[Qianlong Emperor]] on January 15, 1737. This version, shown below, was later moved, along with many other artifacts, to the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei in 1949.&lt;ref name=Taipei&gt;{{cite web|author=The National Palace Museum, Taipei |url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/collection/selections_02.htm?docno=90&amp;catno=15&amp;pageno=5 |title=''Along the River During the Ch'ing-ming Festival'' (with zoom-in viewer) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028105008/http://www.npm.gov.tw/en/collection/selections_02.htm?docno=90&amp;catno=15&amp;pageno=5 |archivedate=October 28, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many more people, over 4,000, in the Qing remake, which also is much larger (at 11 metres by 35&amp;nbsp;cm, or 37&amp;nbsp;ft by 1&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name="video" /&gt; The leftmost third of this version is within the palace, with buildings and people appearing refined and elegant. Most people within the castle are women, with some well-dressed officials. On the contrary, in the original Song version, the leftmost side is still the busy city.

=== Associated poem ===

In April 1742, a poem was added to the right-most end of the Qing remake. The poem apparently was composed by the [[Qianlong Emperor]]; the calligraphy is in the [[running script]] style, and is in the hand of Liang Shizheng (梁詩正), a prominent court official and frequent companion of the Qianlong Emperor. The poem reads as follows:

=== Digital version ===
For a three-month period in the [[World Expo 2010]] presented at the China Pavilion, the original painting was remade into a 3D animated, viewer-interactive digital version, titled ''River of Wisdom'', about 30 times the size of the original scroll. The computer animated mural, with moving characters and objects and portraying the scene in 4-minute day to night cycles, was one of the primary exhibitions in the Chinese Pavilion, drawing queues up to two hours with a reservation. Elaborate computer animation gives life to the painting.

After the Expo, the digital version was on display at the [[AsiaWorld–Expo]] in [[Hong Kong]] from November 9 to 29, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author =20 October 2010 |url=http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/life/200000-tickets-sold-out-first-day-glimpse-along-river-during-qingming-festival-666493 |title=Queue for hours to get tickets to 'Along the River During the Qingming Festival' or see it here |publisher=CNNGO |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414093512/http://www.cnngo.com/hong-kong/life/200000-tickets-sold-out-first-day-glimpse-along-river-during-qingming-festival-666493 |archivedate=April 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; where it was a major commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/scene/2010/11/12/too-hot-a-ticket-river-of-wisdom/|title='River of Wisdom' is Hong Kong's hottest ticket|author =Seno, Alexandra A.|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|date=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was then exhibited at the [[Macau East Asian Games Dome|Macau Dome]] in [[Macau]] from March 25 to April 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/22963-Animated-Chinese-painting-Macau.html|title=Animated Chinese painting in Macau|publisher=''Macau Daily Times''|date=3 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195546/http://www.macaudailytimes.com.mo/macau/22963-Animated-Chinese-painting-Macau.html|archivedate=October 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The digital painting also traveled to [[Taiwan]] and displayed at the Expo Dome in [[Taipei]] from July 1 to September 4, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.taipei.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=2057299&amp;ctNode=8472&amp;mp=100002|title=Renowned Chinese Painting Animation Show Comes to Expo Dome|publisher=Taipei City Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From December 7, 2011 to February 6, 2012, in an exhibition titled ''A Moving Masterpiece: The Song Dynasty As Living Art'', the digital reproduction was exhibited at the [[Singapore Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sg.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/art-city-song-dynasty-living-art-021030368.html|title=Art and the City: The Song Dynasty as a Living Art|publisher=Yahoo!

==Analysis and questions==

Scholars have studied the painting more and more carefully in the second half of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first century but do not agree on many basic points.&lt;ref name="Doar " /&gt;
=== Translations of the title ===
Scholars have disputed the accuracy of the translation of the painting's name; the word ''Qingming'' may refer to either the [[Qingming Festival]] or to "peace and order". Several translations have been suggested, such as:
* ''Going Upriver on the Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Life along the Bian River at the Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Life Along the Bian River at the Pure Brightness Festival'' 
* ''Riverside Scene at Qingming Festival'' 
* ''Upper River during Qing Ming Festival''
* ''Spring Festival on the River'',&lt;ref name=Bahr&gt;{{cite journal |last= Priest |first= Alan |date=June 1948 |title= Spring Festival on the River |journal= The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series|volume= 6|issue= 10|pages=280–292|doi=10.2307/3258128|jstor= 3258128 |publisher= The Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Spring Festival Along the River'', or alternatively,
* ''Peace Reigns Over the River''.

During the late 1960s, the Taipei Palace Museum released a series of books (later digitized as CD-ROM), videos, and stamps about the scroll that translated it loosely as ''A City of Cathay''.&lt;ref name=video&gt;
{{cite web|first=Government Information Office |last=The Republic of China |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/live/av/sou_sig/sight04_1.htm |title=Video (26 min.) of ''A City of Cathay'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124049/http://www.gio.gov.tw/live/av/sou_sig/sight04_1.htm |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stamps&gt;{{cite web |author = Art on Stamps | publisher= Victor Manta, Switzerland| url=http://www.artonstamps.org/Countries/Taiwan/Cathay/cathay-city.htm |title= Old Chinese Paintings on Stamps}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning and content===
Three things have been accepted about the original painting:
* The city depicted is [[Kaifeng]]
* It was painted before the fall of the [[Northern Song dynasty]] in 1127
* It depicts the Qingming Festival&lt;ref name="Doar " /&gt;

Some recent scholarship challenges each of those assertions:  
* The city depicted is an idealized non-existent city&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Hansen |first= Valerie |coauthors= |year= 1996 |month= |title= Mystery of the Qingming Scroll and Its Subject: The Case Against Kaifeng|journal= [[Journal of Song-Yuan Studies]] |url= http://history.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/hansen-qingming-scroll(2).pdf|volume= |issue=26 |pages=183–200|ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It was painted after the fall of the Northern Song dynasty in 1127
* It depicts a scene in early autumn

In 2003 a further interpretation was presented:&lt;ref&gt;Tsao Hsingyuan, "Unraveling the Mystery of the Handscroll 'Qingming Shanghe Tu'", in ''[[Journal of Song-Yuan Studies]]'' 33 (2003): 155–179.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The city depicted is indeed Kaifeng
* It depicts a day in the Qingming [[solar term]] of the [[Chinese calendar]], but not the Qingming Festival itself

An interpretation published in 2013 proposed that the painting was the artist's subtle entreaty to the emperor to discern dangerous trends beneath the surface of prosperity, and some of the suggested hints were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= 马 |first= 伯庸 |coauthors= |year= 2013 |month= |title= 古董局中局2：清明上河图之谜 |volume= |issue= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Receiving grain shipment at the docks was crucial to Kaifeng which depended on transporting the food from the far south, yet only a lowly official was on duty
* The few guards stationed at the city gate and the docks appeared not to be alert and even lax in their appearances
* The term "Qingming" did not refer to the solar term but was taken from the phrase 清明之世 ("A bright and enlightened era") from the ''[[Book of the Later Han]]'', and the name of the painting was meant to be ironic

The wooden bridge depicted in the original version was reconstructed by a team of engineers and documented by the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television show ''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' during their ''[[Secrets of Lost Empires]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =''[[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'' |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/lostempires/china/builds.html |title= Building a Rainbow Bridge}} {{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/27fbchina.html |title= Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Annette  Lemieux''' (born 1957 in Norfolk, Virginia) is an American artist who emerged in the early 1980s along with the “picture theory” artists ([[David Salle]], [[Jack Goldstein]], [[Cindy Sherman]], [[Barbara Kruger]], [[Richard Prince]]). Lemieux brought to the studio a discipline equally based on introspection, and the manifestations of an ideological [[minimalism]].  Process is a key component in the execution of her works over the past three decades, creating the lure to the confrontation of issues of social and historical urgency.
Lemieux has been the recipient of awards from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]] and the Keiser Wilhelm Museum, Germany and an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Monserrat College]] of Art.  Presently, in addition to her studio and exhibition schedule, she is a senior lecturer at [[Harvard University]] in the area of visual and environmental studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2007/07/annette-lemieux-html|title=Annette Lemieux|date=1 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux is represented by Elizabeth Dee Gallery in [[New York City|New York]].

==Early life==

Annette Rose Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia. Her father Joseph was in the Marines, and the family lived in a house close to the base. When Lemieux's father was called overseas, her mother, Margaret, moved with their two daughters – Annette and Suzette – to her hometown of Torrington, Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemieux|first1=Annette|title=The Strange Life of Objects|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Champaign, Illinois|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, she received her [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] in painting from Hartford Art School University of Hartford in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/view/10.1093/gao/9781884446054.001.0001/oao-9781884446054-e-7002021784|title=Lemieux, Annette – Grove Art|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

In early works like ''[[It’s a Wonderful Life]]'', 1986 [named after the 1946 [[Frank Capra]] film], Lemieux incorporated multiple forms of popular media to create a narrative in the form of self-doubt, personal vulnerability, along with an awareness of the absurdist political/religious/economic histories we accumulate as a civilization in a never-ending current.&lt;ref name="oxfordartonline.com"/&gt;  Following the legacies of [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[John Cage]], she works to narrow the gap between “art” and “life”.  Lemieux's works resist the traps of a “signature style,” and she has referred to her shows looking more like group shows rather than a single artist's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amalfitano|first1=Lelia|last2=Hoos Fox|first2=Judith|title=The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux|date=2010|publisher=Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion|location=Seattle, WA|isbn=978-1-883015-45-9|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work surprises us, challenges her audience to keep up, and resists the conformity of the brand.  As stated by Peggy Phelan, “For Lemieux, the art object offers her thoughts and feelings a way to travel . . . Art is her way of responding, both publicly and intimately, to the ongoing predicament of our lives”.&lt;ref&gt;Lemieux, Annette, Lelia Amalfitano, Judith H. Fox, Rosetta Brooks, Peggy Phelan, Robert Pincus-Witten, and Lucy Flint-Gohlke. The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux. Champaign, Ill: Krannert Art Museum and Kinkead Pavilion, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lemieux works from a repertoire of real objects and images from films and books featuring reproductions of historical photographs from the forties and fifties, which she calls her “landscape.” Her practice reflects a deep commitment to content and well as process, incorporating intellectual analyses of social codes with an emphasis on psychological and emotional content. Fundamentally interdisciplinary in content and form, Lemieux’s work is a continual exploration and explication of our cultural constructs and how objects that reflect the self define the self within the culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/index.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions – Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review of Lemieux's major retrospective "The Strange Life of Objects," Elizabeth Michelman explains that, "[In] addressing her content-laden material systematically, not sentimentally, Lemieux places objects and images in predicaments that are highly structured and memorable. In both two- and three-dimensional formats, she appropriates and wittily recontextualizes furnishings, texts and photographs rescued from history, popular culture and personal records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscopemagazine.com/asdyn/index.wr?is=32&amp;a=2|title=Elizabeth Michelman. "The Strange Life of Objects: The Art of Annette Lemieux." artscope New England.|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her recent show entitled ''Unfinished Business'' at the [[Carpenter Center]], Harvard University, Lemieux explored the territory between object, mediated memory, personal experience and cultural history that has informed her practice for three decades.  Lemieux’s objects and imagery derive directly from the world as it exists, not from the recesses of a private imagination that must search itself to produce the substance of invented images.
With representative examples of her work in over 50 public collections, Lemieux has been the focus of two recent exhibitions organized by the [[Krannert Art Museum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kam.illinois.edu/pr/lemieux/checklist.cfm.html|title=Traveling Exhibitions - Krannert Art Museum|website=www.kam.illinois.edu|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harvard University.

==Collections==
Lemieux's work can be found in the permanent collections of numerous art museums, including [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York; [[The Metropolitan Museum of Art|Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York; [[The Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum of American Art]]; Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Hirshhorn Museum, Washington;  [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis;  [[Yale University Art Gallery]], New Haven; Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University; Worcester Art Museum, Worcester MA; [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts Boston]]; The Art Institute Chicago, as well as many other museums throughout the world. Additionally, she has received awards and grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Museum]], the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, as well as other institutions. In 2009,  received an honorary Doctorate in Fine Arts from [[Montserrat College of Art]] as well.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web|title=Annette Lemieux- Senior Lecturer on Visual and Environmental Studies|url=http://www.ves.fas.harvard.edu/lemieux.html|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BookLikes''' is a "[[social cataloging]]" website founded in June 2011 by [[Dawid Piaskowski]], a software engineer, e-business analyst and entrepreneur, and [[Joanna Grzelak-Piaskowska]], a linguist and literary scholar.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Keyfacts"&gt;{{cite web | title= Keyfacts | url = http://booklikes.com/press/29/keyfacts | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"&gt;{{cite web | title= Timeline | url = http://booklikes.com/press/27/timeline | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Team"&gt;{{cite web | title= Team | url = http://booklikes.com/press/28/team | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The website allows individuals to freely search BookLikes' database of books and reviews. Users can sign up and register books to generate library catalogs.  They can also create their own groups of book suggestions and discussions.

Within eight months of beta testing prior to the May 14, 2013 public launch of the website in its current form, it gathered 8000 bloggers.&lt;ref name="LitReactor: New Book Social Media Site 'BookLikes' Now Open (May 17, 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | title= New Book Social Media Site 'BookLikes' Now Open | url = http://litreactor.com/news/new-book-social-media-site-booklikes-now-open | work = LitReactor | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 17 May 2013|last = Shultz|first = Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before its public launch in the current format, BookLikes had won an award as the most innovative small business in Greater Poland, on April 17, 2012.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title= If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes | url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-pavley/if-you-like-books-youll-l_b_3893860.html | work = [[Huffington Post]] | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 9 September 2013|last = Pavley|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2013, the company also won the Microsoft BizSpark People's Choice Award, at the Microsoft BizSpark Euro Summit in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"&gt;{{cite web | title= Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes | url = http://blogs.technet.com/b/bizspark_group_blog/archive/2013/07/04/bringing-volume-to-serendipity-bizspark-grows-under-microsoft-ventures-germany-opens-microsoft-accelerator-to-packed-event.aspx | work = Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 2013, the website's offices are in Poland; however, founder and CEO Dawid Piaskowski said in a June 2013 interview with the [[Los Angeles Times]] that its owners were contemplating a move of its headquarters to the United States, either to New York City or to California, before the end of 2013.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times: Can Booklikes be the next Goodreads? (June 11, 2013)"&gt;{{cite news | title= Can Booklikes be the next Goodreads? | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jun/11/entertainment/la-et-jc-can-booklikes-be-the-next-goodreads-20130529 | work = Los Angeles Times | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 11 June 2013|last = Kellogg|first = Carolyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also as of October 2013, roughly 45% of the site's visitors come from the United States; other countries where the website is growing in popularity include Poland, Belgium, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Germany, and Egypt.&lt;ref name="BookLikes Alexa Ranking"/&gt;

== History ==
A first version of BookLikes was launched in June 2011 as a book recommendation engine and social network; a self-described "Facebook for book lovers with price comparison" similar to [[Goodreads]], substantially relying on its own sophisticated book recommendation engine.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TechCrunch: BookLikes.com Attempts To Out-Suggest Amazon (September 14, 2011)"&gt;{{cite web | title= BookLikes.com Attempts To Out-Suggest Amazon | url = https://techcrunch.com/2011/09/14/booklikes-com-attempts-to-out-suggest-amazon/|work = TechCrunch | accessdate=12 October 2013|date = 14 September 2011|last = Biggs|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, the site was presented throughout 2011 at major startup and technology fairs such as [[Seedcamp]] (New York), [[TechCrunch Disrupt]] (San Francisco), and the 2011 Vienna Startup Week.

During the first months of 2012, a new CTO was hired (Daniel Szwarc), and a German version of the service was launched. The growth of [[Goodreads]], as well as the loss of part of BookLikes's data on the servers of the company initially entrusted with hosting those data, and the discovery that the recommendation engine on which the service, until then, had chiefly relied, was not reaching the site's users in the intended way. This prompted the founders to fundamentally revisit the site's conception. They then redesigned it in the [[Tumblr]]-like interactive blog format in which it was eventually launched in May 2013, having won an award as the most innovative small company in Greater Poland already in April 2012.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Company Info/Timeline"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;

Within five months of its launch in the redesigned format, the site became one of the top 20,000 websites operative in the United States, the sixth highest-ranked startup in Poland, and one of the top 530-ranked startups worldwide.&lt;ref name = "BookLikes Alexa Ranking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookLikes StartUpRanking data"&gt;{{cite web | title=BookLikes StartUpRanking data | url = http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/booklikes.com | publisher= Alexa | accessdate= 12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, it also won the influential Microsoft BizSpark People's Choice Award, at the Microsoft BizSpark Euro Summit in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt; Like [[LibraryThing]], BookLikes was a major beneficiary of (former) [[Goodreads]] users' move towards other book-oriented internet platforms in the wake of [[Goodreads]]'s acquisition by [[Amazon.com]] and a [http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1499741-important-note-regarding-reviews September 2013 change of review-related policy], which left a number of Goodreads users dissatisfied.&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads?

== Features ==
BookLikes is currently available in three different languages, English, German, and Polish, and plans to add further languages in the future. On the BookLikes website, users can add books to their standard and personal bookshelves, rate and review books, see what their friends are reading, participate in discussion boards and groups on a variety of topics, and get suggestions for future reading choices. Once a user starts following other users, he will see the users' updates and reviews in his or her "Dashboard" feed. BookLikes also adds their own blog updates to a user's feed. The site provides default bookshelves—Read, Currently reading, Planning to read—and the opportunity to create customized shelves to categorize a user's books. Every book that is added by a user can be added to a [[Wish list|wishlist]] or be marked as favorite or private.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

Similar to [[Tumblr]]'s interface, it lets users access the site on two different levels. On the one hand, a site-wide level, which includes a "Dashboard" feed of items posted by BookLikes and updates from users the user chooses to follow. It also shows the features and services provided directly by BookLikes, such as its recommendation engine, site-related widgets, a presentation of top reviewers, book-related giveaways, "Daily Deals" and other so-called "Goodies", a "friend invite" scheme, discussion groups, and certified author pages for users who are authors themselves.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Product info"&gt;{{cite web | title= Product info | url = http://booklikes.com/press/21/product-info | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Press Release, May 14, 2013"&gt;{{cite web | title= Press Release | url = http://booklikes.com/press/37/press-release | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: FAQ"&gt;{{cite web | title= FAQ | url = http://booklikes.com/page/18/faq | work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Community Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web | title= Community Guidelines | url = http://blog.booklikes.com/post/198757/booklikes-community-guidelines|work = BookLikes | accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The site also created an official BookLikes group where users can offer feedback and suggestions for new features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.booklikes.com/post/632730|title = Discussion Rooms - Create Groups and Book Clubs|accessdate = 17 October 2013|date = 17 October 2013|website = BookLikes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a second, parallel level, users create their own blogs which other users can subscribe to and which can be customized based on templates provided by BookLikes. The website allows users to link their own website or blog with BookLikes, which then replaces the blog BookLikes offers its users. Users may also customize their blog's layout with [[HTML]].&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads? Try Booklikes (September 21, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Product info"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Press Release, May 14, 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookLikes: FAQ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Community Guidelines"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}}

Users can write posts and each post can be marked as a review. BookLikes features a rating system of one to five stars, with the option of using half-stars. Users can accompany their review with a rating or rate a work without writing a review. By reblogging posts, users can share reviews or updates of other users or repost their own updates and users can like posts of others.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

The website facilitates reader interactions with authors through giveaways, authors' blogs, and profile information.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;

Since March 2013, BookLikes also allows its users to link their BookLikes account to [[affiliate marketing]] programs, such as [[Amazon.com]] Associates and [[The Book Depository]] Affiliates in order to generate revenue.&lt;ref name="BookLikes: Press Release, May 14, 2013"/&gt;{{primary source inline|date=December 2016}} The profits of these affiliate programs go entirely to the users.&lt;ref name="Huffington Post: If You Like Books, You'll Like BookLikes (September 9, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Microsoft TechNet/BizSpark Featured Startup on Azure – BookLikes (August 6, 2013)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Digital Reader: Looking for a Replacement for Goodreads?

[[Silver]] was important in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] society as it was the most precious metal right after [[gold]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cormack|first1=Robin|title=Byzantium Art|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-284211-4|pages=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Byzantine silver''' was prized in both the secular and domestic realms. Aristocratic homes had silver dining ware, and in churches silver was used for crosses, liturgical vessels such as the [[paten]]s and [[chalice]]s required for every [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver was also used as a medium in pagan mythological scenes and objects such as the [[Sevso Treasure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver pieces, especially [[Household silver|silver]]ware, continued to be rendered in the classical style into the seventh century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
[[File:The_Antioch_Chalice,_first_half_of_6th_century,_Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art.jpg|The [[Antioch Chalice]]. Created during the first half of the sixth century.  [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.|frame]]Silver items were also controlled stamped, sometimes up to five times on a single piece, many such pieces are dated between the fourth and eighth centuries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the reign of [[Heraclius]] (r. 610-41 AD), the production of silverware halts, which coincides with the State confiscating valuable metals to help replenish the treasury during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Persian War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Silver items began to regularly buried, such as the [[Kaper Koraon Treasure|Stuma Treasure]] of 56 objects found in Syria during 1908, dated between 540 and 640 and attributed to the village church of [[Sergius and Bacchus|St Sergios]] at Kaper Koraon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Sion Treasure from Lycia consists of 71 pieces with 30 pieces stamped between 550 and 565 AD &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; See [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine Coins]] for currency and monetary information.

== Bowls ==

[[File:Byzantine_-_Silver_Cup_-_Walters_57631.jpg|left|thumb|This bowl, which could have been used for hand washing or baptism.  [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore, Maryland.]]
During the nineteenth century two silver bowls were discovered in Estonia that date to the late fifth or early sixth century period of which the Byzantine Emperor [[Anastasius I Dicorus|Anastasius I]] reigned 491-518 AD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quast, Tamla|first1=Dieter, Ulle|title=Two Fifth Century Ad Byzantine Silver Bowls from Estonia|journal=Estonian Journal of Archeology|date=2010|volume=14.2|issue=December|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The silver bowl deemed the “Kriimani” bowl, for the location in which it was found, has a rim of 15.5&amp;nbsp;cm with a height of 9&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Two beaded bands border the rim of the bowl. Silver analysis shows 93-95% Silver, 3.5-5% Copper, and traces of Gold and Platinum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The second bowl, referred to as the “Varnja Bowl,” was discovered in 1895 near the village of Varnja.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Varnja bowl also has two beaded bands that circle the rim, and it is also stamped similar to the Kriimani  bowl.

== Crosses ==

Crosses were also lavishly adorned with precious materials and biblical scenes during the Byzantine period. Scholars refer to a cross called “The Work of Mark,” due to the monks inscriptions on the cross.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hetherington|first1=Paul|title=The Work of Mark|journal=Apollo|date=2010|issue=March|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross is dated at late tenth or early eleventh century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This cross is 47&amp;nbsp;cm high, 26&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and very ornamented meaning it was probably used in processions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The iron core of the cross is encased in silver. Points projecting from the four arms of the cross would all have had small silver-gilt balls, which can be seen on other such crosses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traces of gilding where the balls would have been provide further evidence. On one side across the central arm are three roundels forming a deesis, which shows [[Jesus|Christ]] as a central figure holding a book of gospels in his left hand and blessing with his right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] is shown bowing on Christ’s left while [[St John the Baptist]] bows on his right &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundel on the top arm portrays the Archangel Michael, while the bottom roundel portrays a figure titled [[Theodore the Martyr|St Theodore]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This side is heavily embossed with silver-gilt, and has a vine scroll and beaded border.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side does not have such borders.

The reverse has a black medium used in conjunction with the partial gilding of niello, which is an enamel type substance, in this case mixed with sulphur and silver.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The roundels portray saints with the top of the cross showing the evangelist St John Theologos. The arm roundels show [[St Peter]] on the left and [[St Paul]] on the right.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The fourth roundel shows [[St Basil]] in bishops robes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The middle of the scene has Virgin Mary and her child with a standing portrait of [[St Constantine, Thorpe Constantine|St Constantine]] above them decorated in his robe.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Virgin Mary has [[St Demetrius]] on the left, St Procopius on her right, and the last saint shown is St Nikitas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All saints are identified by the engraving of their names above them. An inscription of a semicircular area just 3&amp;nbsp;cm wide and embedded into the front of the cross, before the tang projects, reads “‘The work of the Faithful Mark’” &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
	 
Similar crosses are known of such as the cross of Adrianople. This cross has frontal images of Christ and the Virgin Mary, along with archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] and [[Gabriel]] on the cross arms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The reverse side shows church fathers, and the donor’s name is inscribed as [[Sisinnios Triphyllios|Sisinnios]], which dates the cross to the final years of the tenth century.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Another cross, in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], is dated to the eleventh century due to its comparison of portraits with imperial portraits on coins and seal of that time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Distribution of silver-gilt relief decoration and niello are the same on both sides.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Plates ==
Silver pieces, and especially plates, such as the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]] of 338 AD are engraved and styled similary to the set of nine plates showing the Life of [[King David|David]] stamped between 613 and 630 AD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Kaiseraugst [[Achilles]] Plate has the closest similarity to the [[David Plates]] in regards to late antique silver.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leader|first1=Ruth|title=The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium|journal=Art Bulletin|date=2000|volume=82|issue=September|pages=421–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Achilles Plate was buried with a large hoard of domestic silver during the fourth century inside the walls of the Rhine frontier fort of [[Agusta Rarica]], which was discovered in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achiles Plate has the signature of Pausylyps of [[Thessalanike]] which places its manufacturing in the eastern Byzantine empire.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is reinforced with the similar control stamps on the David Plates.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The large octagonal plate has decoration around its rim, and in the center a medallion shows a series of scenes of Achilles’ life before the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The Achilles Plate shows a narrative of eleven scenes on one plate.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and the Achilles Plate show a tradition of late antique silver working that produced many objects between the fourth and seventh centuries with scenes from traditional Grecco-Roman mythology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The David Plates and Achilles Plate are very decorative, and would have been used as show pieces.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''Children's Orchestra Society''' (COS) is a non-profit organization in [[New York City]] founded by Dr. Hiao Tsiun Ma for musically talented children and teens.&lt;ref name=COS&gt;[http://www.childrensorch.org/pages/index.php?pID=4&amp;PHPSESSID=a0e75c1a3e02a5c12005571ec659335a ''About Us'', The Children's Orchestra Society, ChildrensOrch.org, 2007], retrieved on: July 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=COS3/&gt;

==Purpose==
Founded in 1962, the organization is dedicated to "teaching children the language of music" and to presenting young musicians - through orchestra and chamber music presentations - to other children and to well-established artists.  It is under the leadership of its executive director, Dr. Yeou-Cheng Ma, and music director, [[Michael Dadap]] since 1984.  COS believed in children's capability to learn and develop musical talent at the highest level, especially if nurtured and supported.  Teaching begins from early childhood to high school graduates. With this vision, through the support of its board members, and the dedicated work of its staff and faculty, COS grew from an 18-member ensemble to a 35 string players in 1984, then to more than 200 student members, which is composed of four orchestras, a chamber music department, musicianship classes, and private lessons in piano, guitar and all orchestral instruments. Its advanced orchestra, the ''Young Symphonic Ensemble'', was able to present annual concerts at [[Lincoln Center]]'s [[Alice Tully Hall]] since the establishment of the Discovery Concert Series in 1994.  Some of COS's past guest artists include: [[Emanuel Ax]], [[Sarah Chang]], [[Jaime Laredo]], [[Cecile Licad]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Paula Robison]], [[David Shifrin]], and [[Cho-Liang Lin]]. The ''Young Symphonic Ensemble'' (YSE) had also toured in numerous cities in [[North America]], the [[Far East]] and the [[United Kingdom]], including performances in [[Scotland]], the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Toronto]].  COS members perform in orchestral and chamber music concerts with well-known musicians and their peer group. In 2007, COS made its [[Carnegie Hall]] Debut with guest artists [[Jaime Laredo]] and [[Sharon Robinson (cellist)|Sharon Robinson]]. The organization strives to involve members with their communities through performances for civic and cultural groups. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has reviewed several of its performances.&lt;ref name=COS/&gt;&lt;ref name=COS2&gt;[http://www.childrensorch.org/pages/index.php?pID=113 The Children's Orchestra Society, Profile, ChildrensOrch.org, 2007], retrieved on: July 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and philosophy==
Apart from being a non-profit and an educationally inclined organization for children, the Children's Orchestra Society also has the mission to cultivate and nurture children in the spirit of teamwork and to provide skills that are useful in life through music-learning and performing opportunities in orchestral and chamber music settings. COS provides excellent training in classical music.  The organization has a unique child-centered teaching approach 
because it believes in a child's innate capacity to learn and develop encouraged in a friendly, supportive and cooperative environment. The learning experience of a child at COS is not specifically to produce professional musicians, but to instill in each member the concept of invaluable experience and the benefits of music making.  This is done at COS by fostering a supportive learning environment, by creating performing opportunities, by providing role models and a bridge to the professional world through master classes and performance collaborations with eminent musicians, and by enriching and involving the community through performances for civic and cultural groups.&lt;ref name=COS3&gt;[http://www.childrensorch.org/pages/index.php?pID=75 Mission and Philosophy, The Children's Orchestra Society, ChildrensOrch.org, 2007], retrieved on: July 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
The Children's Orchestra Society is committed to keeping its programs accessible to the broadest range of families. Acceptance to COS is based on auditions.  The audition process is very thorough. The organization accepts students of various levels and offers a wide range of programs suitable for students from beginners to the most gifted. Membership fees are kept below the actual costs of the organization's operation, and scholarships are available for exceptional young musicians who require financial assistance.&lt;ref name=COS3/&gt;

'''''Christ Driving the Money Changers from the Temple''''' is a  painting by [[El Greco]], from 1568, now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=NGA&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.43723.html |title = Christ Cleansing the Temple |website = National Gallery of Art |accessdate= 13 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts the [[Cleansing of the Temple]], an event in the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].

There exist three other copies of the painting and also a faithful reproduction in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]], which has recently been considered as authentic by scholars in the field of visual arts.&lt;ref name=Goshgarian-Genette&gt;{{cite book|last=G. M. Goshgarian|first=Gérard Genette|title=The work of art: Immanence and Transcendence, Volume 1|year=1997|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|isbn=0-8014-8272-0|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cmo-sLMYPiQC&amp;pg=PA165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two versions and that other on loan from Madrid are titled ''Purification of the Temple.'' The one at the National Gallery in Washington is called ''Christ Cleansing the Temple.'' The painting which bears this actual title belongs to the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]] and it is somewhat different from all the other versions of this legendary  [[Christian art|Christian]] scene.&lt;ref name=Loney&gt;{{cite web|last=Loney|first=Glenn Loney|title=El Greco Refines Two Potent Images: St. Jerome &amp; Money-Changers Versions at Frick|url=http://www.nymuseums.com/lm01064t.htm|publisher=NY Museums|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
It is considered by several authors as the masterpiece of the Venetian period of El Greco. Despite containing some [[Crete|Cretan]] elements acquired during his formal training,&lt;ref name="Arte Historia"&gt;{{cite web|last=Arte Historia|title=Expulsión de los mercaderes|url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/genios/cuadros/1681.htm|publisher=Junta de Castilla y León|accessdate=5 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; this painting can be fully considered a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Perspective emphasizes the handling of the anatomy, the application of color and drama of the scene.

This is a picture of varied influences, from [[Tintoretto]] to [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]] through [[Paolo Veronese]], and other painters of the [[Cinquecento]] venetian school. Still, some errors are seen like the absence of a point of view, the difficulty in making complex groups and the lack of experience in modeling figures.

In [[distributed computing]], '''code mobility''' is the ability for running [[Computer program|program]]s, code or objects to be [[data migration|migrated]] (or moved) from one machine or application to another.&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt; This is the process of moving '''mobile code''' across the nodes of a [[Computer network|network]] as opposed to distributed computation where the ''data'' is moved.

It is common practice in distributed systems to require the movement of code or processes between parts of the system, instead of data.&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuggetta|first=Alfonso|author2=Gian Pietro Picco |author3=Giovanni Vigna |year=1998|title=Understanding Code Mobility|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|publisher=IEEE Press  Piscataway|location=NJ, USA|volume=24|issue=5|pages=342–361|issn=0098-5589|url=http://www2.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/abs/trans/ts/1998/05/e0342abs.htm|accessdate=29 July 2009|doi=10.1109/32.685258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of code mobility include scripts downloaded over a network (for example [[JavaScript]], [[VBScript]]), [[Java applet]]s, [[ActiveX control]]s, [[Flash animation]]s, Shockwave movies (and Xtras), and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] embedded within [[Microsoft Office]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~lpb/papers/mcode96.html | title=Mobile Code Security | publisher=Australian Defence Force Academy | accessdate=23 April 2012 | author=Dr Lawrie Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The purpose of code mobility is to support sophisticated operations. For example, an application can send an object to another machine, and the object can resume executing inside the application on the remote machine with the same state as it had in the originating application.

According to a classification proposed by Fuggetta, Picco and Vigna,&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt; code mobility can be either strong or weak:
''strong code mobility'' involves moving both the [[Machine code|code]], data and the execution state from one host to another, notably via a [[process image]] (this is important in cases where the running application needs to maintain its state as it migrates from host to host), while ''weak code mobility'' involves moving the code and the data only. Therefore, it may be necessary to restart the execution of the program at the destination host.

Several paradigms, or ''architectural styles'', exist within code mobility:&lt;ref name="Understanding Code Mobility"/&gt;

* [[Remote evaluation]] — A client sends code to a remote machine for execution.
* [[Code on demand]] — A client downloads code from a remote machine to execute locally.
* [[Mobile agent]]s — Objects or code with the ability to migrate between machines autonomously.

==Implementations==
Within code mobility, the Mobile Agent paradigm has conventionally attracted the most interest and research,&lt;ref name="Is Code Still Moving Around"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Carzaniga|first=Antonio|author2=Gian Pietro Picco |author3=Giovanni Vigna |year=2007|title=Is Code Still Moving Around? Looking Back at a Decade of Code Mobility|journal=ICSE COMPANION '07 Companion to the proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Software Engineering|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|location=Washington, DC, USA|pages=9–20|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248922|doi=10.1109/ICSECOMPANION.2007.44}}&lt;/ref&gt; however some recent work has produced general purpose implementations.&lt;ref name=Mobility-RPC/&gt;

;Mobile agent frameworks
* [[Aglets]] — Mobile agent framework, Java
* [[Java Agent Development Framework]] — Mobile agent framework, Java
* [http://www.mobilec.org/ Mobile-C] — Mobile agent platform, C/C++ &lt;ref name=Mobile-C&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile-C: a Multi-Agent Platform for Mobile C/C++ Agents|url=http://www.mobilec.org/|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;General purpose
* [http://code.google.com/p/mobility-rpc/ Mobility-RPC] — Mobile agent, remote evaluation, code on demand, RPC, Java &lt;ref name=Mobility-RPC&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobility-RPC - Seamless Code Mobility and RPC for the Java platform|url=http://code.google.com/p/mobility-rpc/|accessdate=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobile code can also be encapsulated or embedded in other file formats not traditionally associated with executable code.  An example of this form of encapsulation is the presence of [[JavaScript]] in a [[PDF]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite web
  | title = Acrobat JavaScript Specification
  | url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/5186AcroJS.pdf
  | accessdate = 18 November 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Viruses==
Mobile code can also download and execute in the client workstation via email.  Mobile code may download via an email attachment (e.g., macro in a Word file) or via an HTML email body (e.g., JavaScript).  For example, the [[ILOVEYOU]], TRUELOVE, and AnnaK email viruses/worms all were implemented as mobile code (VBScript in a .vbs email attachment that executed in Windows Scripting Host). In almost all situations, the user is not aware that mobile code is downloading and executing in their workstation.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Renting code==
Mobile code also refers to code "used for rent", a way of making software packages more affordable.  i.e. to use on demand.  This is specially relevant to the mobile devices being developed which are cellular phones, PDAs, etc. all in one.  Instead of installing software packages, they can be "leased" and paid for on a per-usage basis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14134">'''Contemporary Ukrainian literature''' is a notion referred to [[Ukrainian literature]] of the past several decades. Most often 1991 as a year of Ukrainian independence is considered as a start of the contemporary Ukrainian literature as from that year on the literary censorship of the [[Soviet Union]] ceased to exist and writers were able to deviate from the official [[socialist realism]] style. Principal changes took place in Ukrainian literature already in the years of [[Perestroika]] (1985) and especially after the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Some researchers consider that contemporary Ukrainian literature started from the 1970-s after the generation of the [[sixtiers]].

Due to the increased freedom and openness of the Ukrainian society to foreign influences and much broader contacts with literatures of other countries contemporary Ukrainian literature is different from the literature of soviet and classical period. It turns to the previously forbidden topics ([[Holodomor]], sexuality, drugs, deviant behavior, etc.), using new styles ([[postmodernism]], neo avant-garde, profanity and [[surzhyk]]), diversity and mixing of genres, shocking effects and reflecting upon social problems and historical memory.

Modern Ukraine also has a significant number of [[Russian language in Ukraine|Russophone writers]], who are especially successful in the genres of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]].&lt;ref name="pentacle"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Oldie |first1=H.L. |last2=Dyachenko |first2=Marina and Sergey |last3=Valentinov |first3=Andrey|year=2005 |script-title=ru:Пять авторов в поисках ответа (послесловие к роману "Пентакль") |trans-title=Five authors in search for answers (an afterword to Pentacle) |language= Russian|location=Moscow |publisher=Eksmo |isbn=5-699-09313-3 |quote=Украиноязычная фантастика переживает сейчас не лучшие дни. ... Если же говорить о фантастике, написанной гражданами Украины в целом, независимо от языка (в основном, естественно, на русском), — то здесь картина куда более радужная.

Speaking of fiction written by Ukrainian citizens, regardless of language (primarily Russian, of course), there's a brighter picture. More than 30 fantasy and science fiction writers are active here, their books are regularly published (in Russia, mostly), they enjoy the readers' love they deserve; many are recipients of prestigious literary awards, including internatnional.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Oksana Zabuzhko.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Oksana Zabuzhko]].]]
During the later [[USSR]] some Ukrainian writers started to deviate from the officially approved literary style of [[socialist realism]]. Among these writers were [[Valeriy Shevchuk]] with his psychological prose and the authors of "chymeric prose" ([[Vasyl Zemlyak]] and [[Volodymyr Drozd]]) similar to [[magical realism]]. There existed also underground literary circles like the [[Kyiv school of poetry]] ([[Vasyl Holoborodko]], [[Mykola Vorobyov]], [[Viktor Kordun]], [[Mykhaylo Hryhoriv]]), a circle of Lviv writers around the samizdat "Skrynya" almanac ([[Hryhoriy Chubay]], [[Oleh Lysheha]], [[Mykola Riabchuk]], [[Viktor Morozov]], [[Roman Kis]], [[Orest Yavorskyi]]), separate dissident writers like [[Ihor Kalynets]]. Authors belonging to ''Kyiv ironic school'' ([[Volodymr Dibrova]], [[Bohdan Zholdak]], [[Les Podervianskyi]]) are considered to be the forefathers of Ukrainian postmodernism. Contemporary Ukrainian literature was also influenced by the ''New York group'' of Ukraininan emigre writers, who separated politics from their art in contrast to the politically active [[sixtiers]] writers in soviet Ukraine. On the background of stronger censorship and repression in the times of [[Brezhnev]] many writers in Ukraine since 1970-s distanced themselves into inner immigration making their literature self-sufficient.

With advent of [[Perestroika]] the censorship pressure on writers decreased. This allowed them to turn to previously prohibited styles and themes. The populist canon of social realism was revised, the works of the "Shot renaissance" modernist generation of 1920-s, [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]] and underground writers were printed.

The role of a writer in the society was revised. A writer in soviet Ukraine played a specially important social function, which new postmodernist writers (especially the [[Bu-Ba-Bu]] group of poets including [[Yuri Andrukhovych]], [[Viktor Neborak]] and [[Oleksandr Irvanets]]) tried to debunk.

Some of the centers of new Ukrainian literature were situated away from the republican capital of Kyiv. ''Stanislav phenomenon'' emerged in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] and included a group of eminent writers like [[Yuri Andrukhovych]], [[Yuriy Izdryk]], [[Taras Prokhasko]], [[Halyna Petrosanyak]] and [[Mariya Makytsey]].

[[Mykola Riabchuk]] was an influential figure in Ukrainian literature in the end of 1980-s and beginning of 1990-s. He edited "Suchasnist", the most influential literary journal at that period. Thanks to Riabchuk many still to become famous writers were first published.

After the collapse of the USSR Ukraine faced a decade of substantial social changes. A free book marked had to replace the state-financed soviet publishing system and the support of writers loyal to the regime.

[[File:Yuri Andruchovych by Kubik.JPG|thumb|right|150px|[[Yuri Andrukhovych]]]]
Modernist tradition in Ukrainian literature was raptured by extermination of many Ukraininan writers in 1930-es. A Soviet period of considerable cultural isolation followed. This led to the fact some contemporary Ukrainian authors write in classical, modernist or postmodernist styles coming in terms with the historic gap each on their own terms.

Many works of contemporary writers are concentrated on darker sides of human life, violence and crisis. This came about as a reaction to the false and compulsory optimism of the official socialist realist literature.

There are numerous literary festivals in Ukraine, most important are the Lviv international literary festival, [[Meridian Czernowitz]] and Kyivski lavry.

Some Ukrainian authors write in a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian called [[surzhyk]] ([[Bohdan Zholdak]], [[Les Podervianskyi]], [[Volodymyr Dibrova]], [[Myhaylo Brynyh]]) using it to create a comic effect as this is the language of the marginalized.

A number of writers of Ukraine write in Russian language. [[Andriy Kurkov]] is the best known of them. Also a great number of contemporary Russian science fiction writers originally come from Ukraine or still live there ([[H. L. Oldie]], [[Alexander Zorich]], [[Yuri Nikitin (author)|Yuri Nikitin]], [[Andrey Valentinov]], [[Marina and Sergey Dyachenko]] and [[Vladimir Arenev]]).

[[File:Portrait of Madame Tallien Jean-Bernard Duvivier 1806.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Thérésa Tallien]] by [[Jean-Bernard Duvivier]] (1806) with Empire waist [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
'''Empire silhouette''', '''Empire line''', '''Empire waist''' or just '''Empire''' is a style in clothing in which the dress has a fitted [[bodice]] ending just below the [[breast|bust]], giving a high-waisted appearance, and a gathered [[skirt]] which is long and loosely fitting but skims the body rather than being supported by voluminous [[petticoat]]s. The outline is especially flattering to [[pear-shaped|pear shapes]] wishing to disguise the stomach area or emphasize the bust. The shape of the dress also helps to lengthen the body's appearance.

While the style goes back to the late 18th century, the term "Empire silhouette" arose over a century later in early 20th-century Britain; here the word ''empire'' refers to the period of the [[First French Empire]]; Napoleon's first Empress [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]] was influential in popularizing the style around Europe.  The word "empire" is pronounced with a special quasi-French pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ɑː|m|ˈ|p|ɪər}} in the fashion world.&lt;ref&gt;Nellis, Cynthia [http://fashion.about.com/cs/glossary/g/empire.htm "Empire"] on [[About.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The style began as part of [[Neoclassical fashion]], reviving styles from [[Greco-Roman]] art which showed women wearing loose fitting rectangular [[tunic]]s known as ''[[peplos]]'' or the more common ''[[Chiton (costume)|chiton]]'' which were belted under the bust, providing support for women and a cool, comfortable outfit suitable for the warm climate.

The last few years of the 18th century first saw the style coming into fashion in Western and Central Europe (and European-influenced areas). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a "Greek supper" where the ladies wore plain white "Greek" tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted. Hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnets]] or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different color. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently lain around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favored.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century such styles had spread widely across Europe. In France the style was sometimes called "à la grecque" after the decorations found on the pottery and sculpture of [[Classical Greek art]]. The adoption of this style led to a drastic contrast between 1790s fashions and the constricting and voluminous styles of the [[1750–1795 in fashion|1770s]] (with a rigid cylindrical torso above [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]]). The change is probably partially due to the French political upheavals after 1789 (which encouraged the recovery of ancient virtues, and discouraged the type of ostentatious ornately luxurious display formerly common in aristocratic fashions). The early styles often featured entirely bare arms, as in the ancient exemplars, but from about 1800 short sleeves became more typical, initially sometimes transparent as in [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s ''[[Portrait of Madame Récamier]]'' (1800), then puffed. The style evolved through the [[Napoleonic era]] until the early [[1820s in fashion|1820s]], becoming gradually less simple, after which the hourglass Victorian styles became more popular.

English women's styles (often referred to as "[[English Regency|regency]]") followed the same general trend of raised [[Waistline (clothing)|waistlines]] as French styles, even when the countries were at war. The style was very often worn in white to denote a high social status (especially in its earlier years); only women solidly belonging to what in England was known as the "genteel" classes could afford to wear the pale, easily soiled garments of the era. The look was popularized in Britain by [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]], who designed such garments for her performances of poses in imitation of classical antiquity ("attitudes"), which were a sensation throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Charles McGrath, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/01/weekinreview/01mcgrath.html Pretty Words, Jane; Would That You Were Too], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The high-waisted cut of the dress was also applied to outer garments, such as the pelisse. The Empire silhouette contributed to making clothes of the [[1795–1820 in fashion|1795–1820 period]] generally less confining and cumbersome than high-fashion clothes of the earlier 18th and later 19th centuries.

The 1960s saw a revival of the style, possibly reflecting the less strict social mores of the era, similar to when the unconstricting 1920s "[[flapper]]" styles replaced the heavy [[corset]]ry of the early 1900s.

'''Idea art''', is an [[art]] form in which small individual [[idea]](s) and not the grand [[concept]](s) or ideologies involved in the work take precedence over generic [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], material and disciplinary concerns.
Works of idea art may be in text, [[found object]], 2d, 3d, moving images, sound, performance, digital, interactive media and/ or as installations. This method was fundamental to Turkish artist [[Genco Gulan]]'s definition of idea art, one of the first to appear online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openspaceistanbul.co.uk/genco-gulan/|title=Idea art definition by Genco Gulan| archivedate=June 2016|publisher=Open Space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In idea art the idea is the most important aspect of the art work. It may be start a project and/ or maybe attached to it later, after he or she finishes the production. In this way, the artist not only works like and [[architect]] or an engineer, as in the case of [[conceptual art]] but also works like a [[curator]] and/ or an art writer.

Idea art should not be confused with idealism or in other words, perfectualism. Individual ideas for art should not be perfect or beautiful but appropriate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7475">There is a '''[[legend]] of the Leather Bridge''' ({{lang-de|Sage von der Ledernen Brücke}}) in several regions of Germany and Switzerland. The word ''lederne'' could also have meant "ladder" or "lantern".

== Palatinate ==
[[File:BurgErfenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Erfenstein Castle from the south]]
[[File:Burgspangenbergrp.jpg|thumb|Spangenberg Castle from the north]]
According to legend, there was once a leather bridge crossing the [[Elmstein valley]] between the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatine]] castle of [[Erfenstein Castle|Erfenstein]], high above the left bank of the [[Speyerbach]] river, and a second castle, [[Spangenberg Castle (Rhineland-Palatinate)|Spangenberg]], on the opposite side of the valley. Two brothers, or at least two close friends, who visited each other frequently, decided to build the bridge in order to avoid having to take the difficult path through the valley between the two castles and over the then wild River Speyerbach.

Their friendship continued for many years. But one day the two lords, having feasted together at the Spangenberg again, began a heated argument. No doubt, an excess of wine had contributed to the situation. One word led to another and finally the Erfenstein lord, beside himself with rage, returned over the bridge, having shouted loudly, "I will never come back!" Equally furious, the lord of Spangenberg roared after him, "You don't need to; I'll see to that!" And when the lord of Erfenstein reached the middle of the bridge, Spangenberg cut the leather straps with his sword. The bridge fell into the depths and the lord of Erfenstein plunged to his death. One source records that the dispute was because one lord, who was a bachelor and the golden-haired wife of his brother had fallen in love and the bridge was used for their trysts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TNoCEYmIziUC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Story+of+the+%22Leather+Bridge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nasHU-mPDcGM7AbhvIGIDQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Story%20of%20the%20%22Leather%20Bridge%22&amp;f=false ''Up the Wooden Hill: The Tale of Two Families''] by Jill Schaefer. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TvZiC5ZEqQQC&amp;pg=PA82&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sage%20von%20der%20Ledernen%20Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;f=false ''Pfälzerwald und Deutsche Weinstraße: Wandern &amp; Einkehren. 50 Touren. Mit GPS ...''] by Jörg-Thomas Titz. Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.   &lt;/ref&gt;

Ever after this murder there was bitter enmity between the owners of the two castles and they damaged one another whenever they could.

The historic background to the legend is that the two castles were always owned by different overlords – initially Spangenberg to the [[Bishopric of Speyer|Speyer prince-bishop]] and Erfenstein to the [[counts of Leiningen]] – who in were always in competition with one another. When, later, their ownership changed, a conflict broke out, the Weißenburg Feud, between Elector [[Frederick I of the Palatinate|Frederick&amp;nbsp;I]] of the [[Electoral Palatinate|Palatinate]] and his cousin, Duke [[Louis I of Palatinate-Zweibrücken|Louis&amp;nbsp;I]] of [[Palatinate-Zweibrücken]]. As a result both castles were destroyed in 1470; first, Erfenstein, and then, Spangenberg. 

Technically, to make a bridge made of soft, sagging material such as leather would not have been practicable because the height of the castles above the floor of the valley (about one hundred metres) would not be enough to span the five hundred metres between them.

== Eifel ==
A leather bridge is supposed to have linked the two castles of [[Stolzenburg (Eifel)|Stolzenburg]] and Pielstein over the [[Urft (river)|Urft]]. According to local legend, their knights lived in the lap of luxury, demanding [[socage]] from the farmers, yet allowing their children to play skittles along the bridge with loaves of bread, whilst the subjects were dying of hunger. God himself is said to have destroyed both castles by unleashing a natural disaster.

== Sauerland ==
Near [[Arnsberg]] legend has it that the devil made a leather bridge between the castles of [[Rüdenburg]] and [[Arnsberg Castle|Arnsberg]] in order to provide an escape route for the beleaguered lord of Rüdenburg and his men. This was done in gratitude for the hospitality that the Rüdenburgers had previously unwittingly shown the devil.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h3tBAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;dq=%22Sage+von+der+Ledernen+Br%C3%BCcke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3bYHU9a0LOTW7QaWhYHwCA&amp;ved=0CG0Q6AEwCA ''Geschichte Arnsbergs...: Mit einer alten Ansicht von Stadt und Schloss Arnsberg nebst Abtei Wedinghausen''] by Karl Feaux de Lacroix (1895). Retrieved 21 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Nördlinger Ries ==
In the valley of [[Kartäusertal]], on the southern edge of the [[Nördlinger Ries]] there was supposed to have been a leather bridge between the three sister castles of Rauhaus, [[Hochhaus Castle|Hochhaus]] and [[Niederhaus Castle|Niederhaus]]. According to legend, whoever "cut the leather bridge" would have his castle swallowed up by the earth.

It is assumed that the ''lederne Brücke'' in this story, actually means a "bridge of lights", in other words that there was a communication link between the castles that was maintained using light signals. When, one day, Rauhaus Castle became unoccupied, the light bridge was interrupted. The castle was then plundered by the local populace and [[slighted]]; it was thus practically "swallowed by the earth".

== Thuringia ==
In [[Mellingen (Thuringia)|Mellingen]] on the River [[Ilm (Saale)|Ilm]] southeast of  [[Weimar]] there were once two castles: one on the Kapellenberg hill and the  Heinrichsburg, both of which were probably destroyed during the [[Saxon Fratricidal War]]. Both castles, separated by about 1.5 kilometres, were supposed to have been connected by a leather bridge. Especially in the older literature (around 1900) it is posited that this legend is a mythological reference to [[Edda]].

== Vogtland ==
Near [[Elsterberg]] on the [[White Elster]] are the ruins of [[Elsterberg Castle]]. A leather bridge is supposed to have joined the old castle over a distance of several hundred metres to the newer buildings.

== Lower Lusatia ==
An evil [[Wends|Wendish]] prince, or according to other [[Sorbs|Sorbian]] legends a Wendish king called ''Prebislav'' in the 10th century, is supposed to have lived in a castle in the ''Teufelslauch'' northeast of [[Friedland (Lower Lusatia)|Friedland]] in the direction of the village of ''Reudnitz''. In order to pursue his crimes as a  [[robber knight]], he left the castle over a leather bridge that he rolled out in front of him and rolled up behind him. When he robbed a man who was in league with the devil, the devil whipped up a mighty [[thunderstorm]]. A lightning bolt killed the prince and the floods caused the castle to sink into the ground. All that remains are the water-filled depressions of the ''Teufelslauch'' ("Devil's Hole").

== Switzerland ==
In [[Wileroltigen]] a tale is told of tunnels, a leather bridge and a stone grave. The castle of [[Oltigen Castle|Oltigen]] and the castle of Wileroltigen were first mentioned in 1006. Along with Hugo of Mümpelgard (Montbéliard), Count of Oltigen they came to an evil end in May 1410, according to [[Conrad Justinger]].

'''The Leningrad School of Painting''' ({{lang-ru|Ленинградская школа живописи}}) is a phenomenon that refers to a large group of painters who developed in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] around the reformed [[Imperial Academy of Arts|Academy of Arts]] in 1930-1950 and was united by the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists]] (1932-1991).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tg-m.ru/articles/%e2%84%962-2013-39/akademiya-khudozhestv-1920-e-nachalo-1930-x ''В.

== History ==

The History of the Leningrad school covers the period from the early 1930s to the early 1990s. Its appearance was the result of a conflict resolution and the desire to reflect prevailing trends in the development of Soviet art and art education at the turn of the 1920s and 1930s. It was accelerated by the adoption in April 1932 by the Politburo of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks]] decree "On the Restructuring of Literary and Artistic Organizations", which, inter alia, provided for the dissolution of the existing literature and arts organizations and groups and the formation of a unified creative union, as well as the adoption in October 1932 by the [[All-Russian Central Executive Committee]] and the [[Council of People's Commissars]] decree "On [the] creation of the Academy of Arts." In accordance with the Institute of proletarian art, it was transformed into the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture]] (since 1944 named after Ilya Repin). It has thus been placed officially instituted by the Soviet Union Government under the 15-year period of the destruction of the old art school and a continuous transformation of the largest art institutions in the country.

Since 1934, the Russian Academy of Arts and Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture were headed by [[Isaak Brodsky]]. The consequence of the decree of the Politburo of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks]] was the formation of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists, ushering a new era of Soviet art.&lt;ref&gt;''Manin Vitaly. Art and Power. Fighting trends in Soviet art 1917-1941 period''. - St. Petersburg: Aurora Publishing, 2008. P. 308—317.&lt;/ref&gt; As the first chairman of the Leningrad Union of Soviet Artists was elected [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]].

Prominent role in the formation of the Leningrad school belongs to famous Russian artists and art educators who worked in Leningrad and those, who, in the past had worked in the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Arts]], having been most notable the students [[Ilya Repin]], [[Pavel Chistyakov]], [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]]. And along them, [[Isaak Brodsky]], [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], [[Alexander Savinov]], [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]], [[Arcady Rylov]], [[Alexander Matveyev]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], [[Semion Abugov]], [[Eugene Lanceray]], Pavel Shillingovsky, Nikolai Radlov, [[Konstantin Yuon]], Pavel Naumov, [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Alexander Lubimov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], Nikolai Petrov, Vasily Shukhaiev, Dmitry Kiplik, [[Nikolay Punin]], [[Mikhail Bernshtein]], Yefim Cheptsov, [[Ivan Bilibin]], [[Piotr Buchkin]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creation of the new school of painting of Leningrad raised many problems of art education in the post-revolutionary Academy, creating a subject for numerous books, magazines and newspaper articles. The then recent Soviet Revolution had created a new government that needed to form and inspire a new form of art in order to represent the socialist elements that had thus arrived through the revolution, and at the same time to glorify the new social establishments that had come along with the socialist and communist elements that the revolutionary leaders wished to bring. It had then become a problem to create and define a particular Leningrad school of painting and art, as that would undermine the idea of the spirit of a union of soviet republics being united by the same core principles and cultural elements. The development of regional differences would become, at least in principle, controversial for the stated objective of a united state of soviet republics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socrealizm.com.ua|title=Socialist Realism|last=|first=|date=|website=Socialist Realism.

Thus, [[Vladimir Lenyashin]], along with his colleague [[Vladimir Gusev (art historian)|Vladimir Gusev]] stated in the Russian Museum: "Of course, it is hardly possible to formulate strictly theoretical features that are specific only to the Leningrad art [school of painting], it is clear that everything in it is inseparable of the common processes of socialist culture. This is, above all - Soviet art! ... But at the same time, with all the difficulties, or rather the impossibility to deduce the «formula» of the Leningrad art, we feel that it exists as an independent, original school."&lt;ref&gt;''Gusev Vladimir, Lenyashin Vladimir. Sixty years of Fine Arts of the Leningrad''. // Gapeeva V. I., Gusev V. A., Tsvetova A. V. The Fine Arts of the Leningrad. Leningrad, Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1981. P. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have nevertheless attempted to go beyond mere feelings and raised questions about the background and characteristics of the phenomenon. "The Leningrad Art School," wrote art historian Nadezhda Leonova in 1979, "was influenced by complex and sometimes conflicting traditions, but was marked, however, by the combining features of citizenship, humanism and high culture. She was influenced by classical architecture of the city, its literature and theater, a special poetic originality of the urban landscape. While at the same time having a strong influence of the great revolutionary tradition."&lt;ref&gt;''Art belongs to people. Exhibition of works by artists of Leningrad''. - Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1979. P. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In European literature term «The Leningrad School» appeared in late 1980 in connection with the well-known series of exhibitions and art auctions of Russian art «L'École de Leningrad» in France in 1989—1992.&lt;ref&gt;''L' École de Leningrad.

A typical example - an article on art of Efim Lyatsky (1929–1977): «Efim Elmanovich Lyatsky belongs to a generation of artists with whom we have associated the very idea of the Leningrad School of Painting».&lt;ref&gt;''Yefim Lyatsky. Painting. Exhibition Catalogue''. St. Petersburg, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions and Heritage ==
Originating in a situation of acute conflict of opinions on how to develop arts and arts education in the USSR, Leningrad school has made a valuable contribution to the restoration and further development of the traditions of national art school and a realistic painting. «Restoring the continuity of traditions of the old school in the walls of the Soviet Academy of Arts, - wrote art historian Olga Rodosskaya, - the preservation of the institution in the same capacity today is certainly a unique phenomenon. Especially in comparison with the general trend of destruction of the traditional European art school».&lt;ref&gt;''Rodosskaya Olga. Academy of Fine Arts in 1920-1930 years''. // Dialog of Arts Magazine, Vol. 5, 2008. P. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; One of its important achievements was the creation in 1930 in Leningrad, the unique system of children's primary and secondary art education, which became soon a model for the whole country.&lt;ref&gt;''Mitrokhina Ludmila, Kirillova Larisa. A History of the Leningrad Secondary Art School''. // St. Petersburg Art History notebook. Vol. 16. St. Petersburg, 2009. P. 48-69.&lt;/ref&gt; By they works the Leningrad artists have made a significant contribution to the national fine arts, the formation of the aesthetic views and the spiritual world of the modern generations. Its artistic heritage amounts to many thousands of paintings and hundreds of art exhibitions, starting with "1st Exhibition of Leningrad artists" in 1935, who have been important events in the cultural life of an era.

[[File:Catalog-Fine-Arts-of-Leningrad-76-bw.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Fine Arts of Leningrad (Exhibition, 1976)|Fine Arts of Leningrad Exhibition Catalog]]. 1976.]]

The works of artists of the Leningrad school are well represented in the collections of major museums of Russia, forming the basis of funds domestic painting 1930-1980 period. The work of artists of the Leningrad school has enriched all the genres and directions of modern art. This gave grounds to speak about the traditions and contributions of the Leningrad school in relation to the development of certain genres of painting, in particular, the Leningrad school of landscape painting.&lt;ref&gt;''Strukova A. I. The Leningrad school of landscape painting and its masters. 1930 - first half of 1940.'' Abstract PhD thesis. Moscow, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibitions of 1960-1970 period, and, in particular, the retrospective exhibition [[Fine Arts of Leningrad (Moscow, 1976)|"The Fine Arts of Leningrad"]] in 1976 in Moscow, showed that the Leningrad school was held as a major phenomenon of artistic life. It became possible to speak of her traits and characteristics inherent in its pupils and showed up as early as their independent work. As well as its place and role in the development of Soviet art and art school as a whole. They confirmed the gravity of Leningrad artists to create works of great public importance, the culture of professional excellence, to the "typical in Leningrad exquisite harmony of color" and a generalized interest in painting and figurative images. Its representatives were characterized by high artistic culture and the fact that, according to Nikolai Punin, can be called "a sense of the Leningrad painting ... with a sort of deeply honest, clean person deep relationship to the means of expression".&lt;ref&gt;''Pages of Memory. Reference Memorial digest. Artists of the Leningrad Union of Soviet artists, who were killed during the Great Patriotic War and the Siege of Leningrad''. St. Petersburg, 2010. P. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same properties indicates another authoritative researcher Leo Mochalov in an article on the artist Shishmareva: «Predominant background of her work - rejection of constriction, the inner poise, tact, finally, understanding the nuances of the role - that without which no and can not be true art. These qualities, as well as high professional culture, a thin, well-placed firmly taste associated Shishmareva art with the tradition of the Leningrad painting and graphics "school" of the 1920-1930s.»&lt;ref&gt;''Mochalov Leo. A Walk of natural nobility'' ...// Petersburg art history notebook. Vol. 3. St. Petersburg, 2001. P. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This observation of Shishmareva, which failed (as well as a number of other interesting artists) to obtain formal art education, can fully understand the criteria for identity as a particular artist to the Leningrad School.

Leningrad school featured kinship with progressive traditions of Russian art schools and pre-Soviet period. the Leningrad school remained in close affinity with every progressive phenomenon of pre-soviet art. It stuck to the best examples of Russian and European painting and learnt from the coryphaei of the post-Revolution period. This made the school artistically independent and immune from unimportant momentary outside influences.

[[Image:Osipov-Cornflowers-7oci10bw.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Sergei Osipov (artist)|Sergei Osipov]]. [[Cornflowers (painting)|Cornflowers]]. 1976]]

With regard to the painterly and plastic language and imagery, the Leningrad school kept to the traditions and general values common to European and Russian art. Ideas of humanism professed by the artists, expressed the national character and the clarity of their culturally informed and quite traditional painterly language made their art highly relevant to the epoch and created a broad field for creative experiments.

The Leningrad school was distinguished by defined professional and moral criteria. This explains the profound skepticism it always felt towards the innovations that often exploited peripheral possibilities of visual art and were generally overestimated. The Leningrad school tended to fuse different art movements and styles but never receded from the Russian traditional understanding of the mission of art.

Another important feature inherited from the old school and St Petersburg tradition was a sincere attentiveness to the informed opinion of the art public. Independent from public authorities and indifferent to ranks and awards, it had a greater influence on the assessment of an artist’s work and personality than official recognition and formal success.

Spreading its traditions and the experience of its founding fathers and adherents all over the country, the Leningrad school itself fed on the heritage and experience of the Moscow art circles and a number of provincial schools. [[Alexander Savinov]] and [[Alexander Matveyev]], natives of Saratov, were among the school’s founders; [[Alexander Osmerkin]] and [[Boris Ioganson]], who lived in Moscow, were among its most important masters. Later, the influence of the Moscow school became more obvious in the works of those artists whose close co-operation with Moscow-based colleagues was complemented by the fact they were neighbors at the [[Academic Dacha]]. This is particularly true about [[Nikolai Timkov]], [[Maya Kopitseva]], and [[Nikolai Pozdneev]] who are considered to be among the best Leningrad colorists. The culture of the Saratov school distinguished by its soulful intonation and a particular sincerity is traceable in the works of [[Vladimir Ovchinnikov (painter)|Vladimir Ovchinnikov]] and [[Gleb Savinov]].

===Department of Interior Murals===
[[File:FWA-PBA-Paintings and Sculptures for Public Buildings-painting depicting race involving people in wagons, on... - NARA - 197273.tif|thumb|500px|right|A black and white rendering of ''The Oklahoma Land Rush, April 22, 1889'' by Curry. The work was commissioned in 1937 and installed in the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] in 1939.]]

The [[United States Department of the Interior]] Murals in Washington D.C., ''The Homestead'', and ''The Oklahoma Land Rush'', were painted with oil and tempera on canvas &lt;ref&gt;Czestochowski 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  and installed November 1938 by [[John Steuart Curry]]. Created during the [[Great Depression]], the murals are the product of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Online Murals Tour|url=http://www.doi.gov/interiormuseum/Online-Murals-Tour.cfm|publisher=US Department of Interior|accessdate=10 April 2014|date=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two murals depict events of the time period, the [[Homestead Acts]] and the Oklahoma [[Land Run of 1889]]. Early sketches of figures and ideas are held by archives located at the [[Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art]] at [[Kansas State University]].&lt;ref name= "Beach"/&gt;

====''The Homestead''====
This mural is nine foot by 19 feet eight inch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Junker|first=Patricia A.|title=John Steuart Curry: Inventing the Middle West|year=1998|publisher=Hudson Hills Press, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-1555951399|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a homestead with the typical features that make up its ideal of blessed peace, happiness, and potential prosperity of ensuring rural life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmeckebier|first=Laurence E.|title=John Steuart Curry's Pageant of America|year=1943|publisher=American Artist's Group, Inc.|isbn=978-0404153687|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Homestead'' features a mother and her daughter paring potatoes near a small garden for the family meal. A young son holds the [[Agricultural fencing|fence posts]] while his father drives them into the ground. An older sister drives the wagon full of spikes while she also cares for the youngest child. Each member of the family is actively working and contributing its energies to the productive whole.&lt;ref&gt;Czestochowski 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Near the bottom left of the mural, roosters, chicks, and chickens peck and feed near the foreground garden as bountiful reminders of their capacity to provide this frontier family with eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Czestochowski 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Oklahoma Land Rush''====

Just two inches taller than its partner painting, this nine feet two inch by 19 feet eight inch &lt;ref&gt;Junker 65&lt;/ref&gt; mural represents another historical event from the time period. ''The Oklahoma Land Rush'' depicts the Westward Migration in the representation of that famous day—twelve o'clock noon on April 22, 1889—when the Oklahoma Territory was opened to homestead settlement and over twenty thousand prospective settlers rushed into the new land to stake their claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmeckebier|first=Laurence E.|title=John Steuart Curry's Pageant of America|year=1943|publisher=American Artists Group|location=New York|isbn=978-0404153687}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2014}} Anxious but looking forward to eventual security, an 1889 pioneer mother, sunbonnet intact, is of greatest importance to the far left foreground of Curry's westward-moving mural. Perched on a broken-down wagon, she clutches her small son while waving and calling out to her certificate-holding husband, who, astride their rearing horse, is to ride on to claim a new farm site. His hellbent competition includes a cyclist riding a high, "ordinary" [[safety bicycle]] from the 1880s and an overweight, overdressed lady in a rocking chair. She rolls back in an open wagon driven frantically by her balding husband, and, if nothing else, lends comic relief to balance the anxious sincerity of the mother on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dennis|first=James M.|title=Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry|year=1998|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0299155841}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2014}}

John Steuart Curry's ''Oklahoma Land Rush'' repeated an important theme of the time: history told through the actions of common people. By emphasizing the rush of figures across the land, Curry shared his concern with capturing the energy and vigor of American pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller|first=Nancy|title=The Regionalists|year=1976|publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications|isbn=978-0823045167|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kansas State Capital Murals===

One of Curry's most famous works are the [[mural]]s designed for the [[Kansas State Capitol]], in [[Topeka, Kansas]]. In June 1937, newspaper editors raised money to commission John Steuart Curry (who was the most famous artist in Kansas) to paint murals in the statehouse. Curry's design was divided into three themes: first the ''Settlement of Kansas'', which depicted the [[Conquistadors]] and the Plainsmen; second the ''Life of a Homesteader'', which would depict John Brown; and third, ''Pastoral Prosperity'' which would include scenes of modern Kansas. Curry wanted to be free to express his own ideas regarding the murals: "I have my own ideas about telling the story of pioneers coming into Kansas. I want to paint this war with nature and I want to paint the things I feel as a native Kansan."&lt;ref name="M. Sue Kendall"&gt;Kendall, M. Sue. ''Rethinking Regionalism: John Steuart Curry and the Kansas Mural Controversy''. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Political controversy stalled the completion of the murals. Expensive Italian marble slabs covered the spot in the rotunda where the eight panels depicting scenes from ''the Life of the Kansas Homesteader'' were to be painted. The legislative committee refused to move them from the wall to make way for Curry's mural. However, behind the refusal were two real issues with Curry's paintings, the first being that Curry's factual details were incorrect. For instance, "they criticized the tails of his animals calling them not natural- like."&lt;ref name="James M. Dennis"/&gt; In Curry's opinion, those problems could be easily fixed. However, with the next issue the committee had an even stronger objection; and that was the image of Kansan [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], John Brown, in front of a crowd of people and a tornado. In particular, the committee objected to the blood on John Brown's hands, the prairie fires, and tornadoes. These inclusions were thought by some to show the state in a negative light due to the fact that Brown, who was executed for leading a [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry, Virginia]], in 1859, was considered by some to be a traitor and a murderer. Curry tried to explain that while the blood on Brown's hands was not literal, his acts caused bloodshed, and that the tornado was a symbol of the abolitionist's passion. However, the people of Kansas saw its inclusion as a negative statement about bad weather.&lt;ref name="KSHS"&gt;[http://www.kshs.org/cool2/curry.htm KSHS "Curry's Statehouse Studies" Kansas State Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt; In his presentation to the people, Curry expressed that he wanted to get into his pictures the irony that is the Kansas people; not a soft, soppy presentation.&lt;ref name="James M. Dennis"&gt;Dennis, James M. ''Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry''. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; When rejected, Curry in anger left the finished murals unsigned at his death in 1946. Since Curry's death, his murals have come to be regarded as on par with similar works done by his contemporary [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]].

==Illustrations==

While studying at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1917, Curry wrote home to his parents about his decision to study illustration. He noted his interest in studying with Harvey Dunn who Curry said was “making the illustrators of today."&lt;ref name=Junker&gt;{{cite book|last=Junker|first=Patricia|title=John Steuart Curry: Inventing the Middle West|year=1998|publisher=Hudson Hills Press|location=New York|isbn=1-55595-139-2|pages=212–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, Curry met Dunn, and while he did not become one of Dunn’s students the established artist became a mentor, helping Curry further his illustration education and career.&lt;ref name="Junker"/&gt; Curry began publishing illustrations in 1921 and continued through 1926 when he took a hiatus from illustration, writing “Came to NY to be an illustrator. Was not a brilliant success. Went to Paris and learned something from M. Schoukhareff of the Russian Academy. Learned something, also, from the Louvre and have been trying since to carry out my ideas of how an American should paint."&lt;ref name="Junker"/&gt;

In 1940 John Curry returned to making illustrations for books and other media, and he contributed to this field until his death in 1946.&lt;ref name="Junker"/&gt; His last illustrations can be found in ''John Brown’s Body: A Poem by Stephen Vincent Benét, published by Limited Editions Club in 1948''.&lt;ref name=Junker/&gt;

''My Friend Flicka'' was originally written as just a short story by Mary O’Hara while she was living on a ranch in Wyoming.  It was later requested by the Lippincott Publishing Company of New York that she make it into a novel.  It was published in 1941 and John Steuart Curry contributed fifteen drawings for the illustrations.  They were rendered in mostly ink with some pencil and conte crayon.  He did one picture with watercolor for the title page of the book.

===Magazine Illustrations===

Curry created illustrations for: 
*''[[Boys' Life]]''
*''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''
*''[[Country Gentleman]]''
*''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''

Important illustrations that are now held by art institutions include: 
*''Hoover and the Flood'', 1940, oil on panel, [[Life magazine|''LIFE'' magazine]] commission, Original at [[Morris Museum of Art]], August, GA &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.themorris.org/ourcollection/curry-flood.html| title = John Steuart Curry (1897–1946) "Hoover and the Flood"| publisher = Morris Museum of Art| work = Permentant Collection| accessdate = 2014-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Country Gentleman''====
In 1941, [[John Steuart Curry]] was commissioned by the [[Associated American Artists]] to create a painting about tobacco for an illustration in the American agricultural magazine, The ''[[Country Gentleman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Curry Family papers, S1-AAA, Series 3, correspondence&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lucky Strike Ads====
Along with other regional artists, Curry was commissioned to create advertisements for a [[Lucky Strike]] ad campaign that spanned from 1942 to 1944. This campaign associated Luckies with the down-home, folksy look of regional art. The [[American Tobacco Company]] did not capitalize on the war or use military themes when advertising for their cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doss|first=Erika| title=Benton, Pollock, and the Politics of Modernism: From Regionalism to Abstract Expressionism |accessdate=2014-04-17|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Google Books|isbn=0226159426 |pages= 232–233, 237|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1tZpr06WPsC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curry only made two Lucky Strike tobacco ads:
*"Grading a Pile of Tobacco After Curing"- The first Lucky Strike ad features a woman wearing a headscarf sorting tobacco leaves.&lt;ref name="Life Magazine,1942"&gt;Life Magazine,1942.&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Grading the Lighter Leaf"- This ad depicts a farmer sorting and examining tobacco leaves inside a barn.&lt;ref name="Life Magazine,1942"/&gt;

There are four original primary sketches of ideas and the layouts for these Lucky Strike ads in the archives located at the [[Marianna Kistler Beach Museum of Art]] at [[Kansas State University]].&lt;ref name = "Beach"/&gt;

===''Hoover and the Flood''===
On May 6, 1940, [[Life (magazine)|''LIFE'' magazine]] released ''Hoover and the Flood: A painting for ''LIFE'''', by John Steuart Curry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hoover and the Flood: A Painting for LIFE by John Steuart Curry|journal=LIFE Magazine|date=May 6, 1940|pages=58–61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0j2w2gyBc94C&amp;pg=PA79 |accessdate=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This editorial was the sixth of eight commissioned installments for ''LIFE Magazine's'' American History Series that featured modern American history paintings.&lt;ref name =Eldridge&gt;{{cite book|last=Eldredge|first=Charles C.|title=Hoover and the Flood: Painting Modern History|year=2007|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill, NC|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Steuart Curry's ''Hoover and the Flood'' painting is an oil on panel and measures 37½ by 63 inches.&lt;ref name="Junker139"&gt;{{cite book|last=Junker|first=Patricia A.|title=John Steuart Curry: Inventing the Middle West|year=1998|publisher=Hudson Hills Press, in association with the Elvehjem Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=1-55595-139-2|pages=138–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting is currently located at [[Morris Museum of Art|The Morris Museum of Art]] in [[Augusta, GA]].&lt;ref name="Junker139"/&gt; Curry's ''LIFE Magazine'' commission was solely for the reproduction rights to the painting.&lt;ref name =Eldridge/&gt; Since the magazine never intended to purchase Curry's painting there has been little success finding documentation regarding the financial aspects of the commission.&lt;ref name =Eldridge/&gt;

Curry's ''Hoover and the Flood'' was created to celebrate the humanitarian and relief efforts of Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] before his presidential election in 1928.&lt;ref name="Junker139"/&gt; Curry's painting demonstrates many of the major scenes and events that were associated during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927|Mississippi Flood]] of 1927 such as flood waters, National Guardsmen, the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] relief, refugees, stranded farm animals, praying African Americans and a Mississippi riverboat.&lt;ref name="Junker139"/&gt; John Steuart Curry's work often supported the mentalities of the African American population that were common during the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Junker139"/&gt; ''Hoover and the Flood'' references several of Curry's previous artworks.&lt;ref name="Junker139"/&gt; His use of a centrally positioned African American male figure appears in other works including ''Freeing of the Slaves'' (1936), ''The Fugitive'' (1924-1936), and ''Mississippi Noah'' (1932).&lt;ref name=Junker139/&gt;

===Background===
{{Main article|American propaganda during World War II}}
The government used posters to advertise as technique during the First World War. The posters bridged a gap between the government and the people by using direct and simple messages. The government’s plan of advertising via posters was to stir the nation into action by engaging its people’s hearts and minds. Quite simply, the posters were meant to inform, influence and guide Americans’ behavior toward a certain political ideology. Because these posters were to be a part of the urban environment, they could be placed anywhere. Moreover, artists were told to use objects that could stand for a whole, like a flag signifying a nation or a bomb meaning war, so that they would not require any text on the poster. No poster text was deemed a more effective and efficient technique of advertising. Specifically, posters were to “tell the truth” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aulich|first=James|title=War Posters: Weapons of Mass Communication|year=2007|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-500-25141-6|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they engaged all Americans and fostered a social movement among Americans. Sympathetic and realistic representations of the common soldier encouraged American nationalism, such that the common lives of persons were made to be heroic during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aulich|first=James|title=War Posters: Weapons of Mass Communication|year=2007|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-500-25141-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2014}} Two different schools of art did work during this time: [[Regionalism (art)|Regionalists]] and [[Social Realist]]. Both groups of art had vastly different views, but they did share the common idea of the championing the common man. Therefore, if either group was to make art to persuade people it needed to be done in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fogel|first=Jared A.|author2=Robert L.

Although he openly opposed the possibility of a Second World War, [[John Steuart Curry]]'s political opinions are not known explicitly. His opinions were a mystery even to his wife. In an interview when asked what Curry's political views were, she told the interviewer that her husband read ''[[The Progressive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waller|first=Bret|title=An Interview with Mrs. John Steuart Curry|journal=Kansas Quarterly|year=1970|volume=2|issue=4|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Matthew Biagell once wrote that "subject matter of an important group of paintings[...]as well as statements that he made, suggest strongly that his interests lay in a liberalism of one sort or another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baigell|first=Matthew|title=The Relevancy of Curry's Paintings of Black Freedom|journal=Kansas Quarterly|year=1970|volume=2|issue=4|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His opinions of military involvement in Europe were believed to be in step with the majority of Americans at this time. "Isolationism may have been most pronounced in the landlocked Midwest, but Americans of both sexes, of all ages, religions, and political  persuasions, from all ethnic groups and all religions, shared in the postwar years a feeling of apathy toward Europe, not to mention the rest of the wretchedly quarrelsome world, that bordered on disgust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David M.|title=Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry was frustrated by the possibility of war. He saw the war only as a setback in the progress the nation had made since that last world war, and thus ending the progress made in the world of art. Curry warned that the entrance into another world war would kill the renaissance that he had seen reborn after the WWI: "After the First World War there began a splendid resurgence in Art in America, and we are in the midst of this movement now--but war will kill it before it can reach its flowering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trout|first=Steven|title=Battlefield of Memory: The First World War and American Remembrance, 1919-1941|year=2010|publisher=University of Alabama Press|location=Tuscaloosa|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry had shown his dread of the coming war through his painting ''The Light of the World'' which depicted onlookers gazing at a coming storm. It wasn't until after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 7, 1941, which caused the shift in American opinion, that inspired a change in Curry's support of the war. Curry was faced with the dilemma on how to make his work matter. He had the desire to reach a broader audience of people, and for the first time in Curry's career, he expressed a desire to utilize his talents in support of American troops. In 1942, he finished his first work in support of a war. Sponsored by [[Abbott Laboratories]] &lt;ref&gt;Junker 236&lt;/ref&gt; to produce government sanctioned war propaganda, Curry finished his first work in support of any war effort. He submitted an oil titled ''Our Good Earth'' to be used in publications.

===''Our Good Earth''===
'''Our Good Earth''' is a painting and war poster by Curry that highlights the symbolic importance of the heartland to the American war effort. When commissioned to do war art, Reeves Lewenthal, director of [[Associated American Artists]] gallery, tried suggesting possible subjects for [[John Steuart Curry]]'s new sponsorship: "Perhaps you can do a heroic figure of a soldier guarding over or fighting for the preservation of all those benefits and advantages we enjoy in our democracy; or perhaps, could be fighting for the preservation of our peaceful, fertile farmlands, can be effectively portrayed in the background; or, perhaps, shadows of out former hero soldiers can drift into the distance behind this forceful foreground figure.... Then again, you might do a nurse-or a flyer-or a marine-or a sailor-in some symbolic composition." &lt;ref&gt;Junker 236-237&lt;/ref&gt; But Curry had other ideas when he responded with: "...it seems very doubtful whether it is strategic or desirable to use fear as the motive in picturing to them the needs of the war program. Our people are patriotic. Thousands of our young men are volunteering before they are drafted. Bond sales are at a high level. Our people expect to win the war and are prepared to pay any price that may be necessary. They do not need to be  threatened by some fear complex in order to do their best. They are responding to incentives that are on a much higher plane and more effective than fear." &lt;ref&gt;Junker 237&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Curry fell into step with his typical subject matter and painted an agricultural subject.

''Our Good Earth'' shows a farmer standing in his field of wheat, flanked on either side by children as wind gusts through the scene. The state of the man, his children, and the bountiful crop register the plenty that the farm is experiencing despite the war overseas. The farmer's face shows his concern for the times ahead, but it does not indicate any intention to depart from his land or his family for the war overseas. Typical of a Curry work, the weather alludes to the underlying stress of the war. As the family stands in the field, a gust of wind rips through the scene trying to uproot the children and disrupt the crops-just as the war threatens the farmer's land and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuykendall|first=Lara|title=By Popular Demand: The Hero in American Art, c. 1929-1945|year=2011|location=University of Kansas|url=http://search.proquest.com.er.lib.k-state.edu/docview/877961738/768E32C0016240CEPQ/3?accountid=11789}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was published as a war bond poster the caption "Our Good Earth...Keep It Ours" was added, inspiring the onlooker to do their part by buying war bonds to "Make Every Market Day, Bond Day." Later, the work was used as the cover for a war bond pamphlet. In addition to the "Keep It Ours" caption, "Long May It Wave" was placed at the bottom of the pamphlet, referencing the "amber waves of grain" of the song "America the beautiful" and the second stanza of the "Star Spangled Banner".

===''The Farm Is a Battleground, Too''===
In October 1942, shortly after he finished ''Our Good Earth'', Curry received an official request from the Office of War Information to make another poster. He was asked to have the poster completed by November 5 of that year.  Based upon The Writers’ War Board’s directive, Curry was to convey that if America lost the war to the Nazis, then the farmers of the nation would become enslaved.  Curry, however, argued that the idea to be expressed was a correct assumption of how life was in rural America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewenthal|first=Reeves|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 3 of John Steuart Curry and Curry family papers from Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-192788|work=Personal Letter|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|format=letter from Lewenthal to Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is quoted in a letter to his dealer, Reeves Lewenthal, as saying, “Farmers are exerting all-out effort and working 70 and 80 hours a week. There is no problem as we see it out here in getting farmers to work as hard as they can, for they are doing exactly this.” Curry then requested that the board consider developing a more positive rural theme and offered to help think of one, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry|first=John Steuart|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 4 of John Steuart Curry Papers and Curry family papers from Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-192788|work=Personal Letter|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|format=Letter from Curry to Lewenthal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In doing so, Curry came up with an idea from a sketch he had used in a previous mural idea for the Wisconsin State Fair called, ''Wisconsin Agriculture Leads to Victory''. He believed such a representation would be a better and more positive idea for a poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry|first=John Steuart|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 5 from John Steuart Curry papers and Curry family papers from Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-192788|work=Personal Letter from Curry|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Archives of American Art at  Smithsonian Institution|format=Letter from Curry to Lewenthal}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Lewenthal agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewenthal|first=Reeves|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 7 in John Steuart Curry Papers and Curry family papers in Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-192788|work=Personal letter from Lewenthal|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|format=Letter from Lewenthal to Curry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in ''The Farm Is a Battleground, Too'', he depicts a gigantic farmer who resembles the one in ''Our Good Earth''. He is holding a pitchfork and is standing before two soldiers. He is visually connecting the activities of the farmer to those on the war front.  In the background, Curry was shown a tractor and tank, both mobile, and therefore representative of the war and their respective missions. Because he wanted to keep his work as authentic as possible, Curry rejected any ideas that might go against the realities of the farmers’ work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuykendall|first=Lara|title="By popular demand": The hero in American art|year=2011|location=University of Kansas|url=http://search.proquest.com.er.lib.k-state.edu/docview/877961738?accountid=11789}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one idea that was suggested by Lewenthal was that the pitchfork be held in the same advancing motion as the soldiers’ guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewenthal|first=Reeves|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 10 in John Steuart Curry Papers and Curry family papers in Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/container/viewer/-192788|work=Personal letter from Lewenthal|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Archives of American Art at Smithsonian Institution|format=Letter from Lewenthal to Curry n}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curry objected and said that farming is a skilled profession. Having the pitchfork in such a way would seem strange and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Curry|first=John Steuart|title=Box 1, Folder 41, Object 11 from John Steuart Curry papers and Curry family papers from Archives of American Art at Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combat Art===

In 1942 the Corps of Engineers established a [[United States Army Art Program|War Art Unit]], to include both military and civilian artists, in an effort to reveal the realities of war to the nation. Artist for the program were recruited in joint effort by the [[Associated American Artists]] organization and the War Department established art committee. Unfortunately a little over six months into the program Congress cut the funds for the art project and the military artists were reassigned to other duties. Some however, continued to produce art through their military career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Renée | last = Klish| title = Art of the American Soldier Documenting Military History Through Artists’ Eyes and in Their Own Words| year =2010| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]| url  = http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/epubs/art_of_the_american_soldier/index.html}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Additional efforts to document the war came from major companies with a history in supporting both soldiers and artists such as [[Abbott Laboratories]]. From 1942-45, Abbott Laboratories helped produce seven different combat art projects. One such project Abbott supported in collaboration with the Surgeon General’s Office, and focused on producing medical related art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Marian R.| last1=  McNaughton| chapter= The Army Art Program| editors= John E. Jessup, Jr., and Robert W. Coakley, eds.| title = A Guide to the Study and Use of Military History| location = Washington, D.C.| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] via the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]| year = 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this they commissioned well-known artists such as [[Peter Blume]], [[Joseph Hirsch]], and [[John Steuart Curry]].

John Steuart Curry started his commission in early 1944 at [[Camp Barkeley]]&lt;ref&gt;James M. Myers, ''CAMP BARKELEY'', Handbook of Texas Online (http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qbc02), Uploaded on June 12, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; eleven miles southwest of [[Abilene, Texas]]. During his stay there, he committed himself to becoming one of the soldiers. He wore a uniform, ate, and went on [[Military camp|bivouacs]] with the soldiers. Curry spent most of his time sketching training battalion units during bivouac problems, as well as following teams through their levels of field medical evacuation. He also commonly sketched the soldiers as they maneuvered their way through obstacle and infiltration courses and demonstrations in the “Nazi Village,” and strafing. While at the camp, Curry produced nearly a hundred sketches covering virtually all training exercises, a crayon portrait of Lieut. Col. Edward A. Zimmerman, and even a large oil portrait of Brig. Gen. Roy C. Heflebower, the commanding general of the medical replacement training center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Sergt. H.

The '''London International Awards''', or '''LIA''' (formerly known as '''London International Advertising Awards''',''' LIAA'''), are a worldwide awards annually honoring "pioneers, and embodiments of excellence" in advertising, digital media, production, design, music &amp; sound and branded entertainment. It was the first truly international advertising award of its kind to acknowledge all media and methods from all over the world to be judged by a diverse global jury.&lt;ref name="AdNews"&gt;[http://www.adnews.com.au/awards/london-international-awards "AdNews: London International Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Awards, founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy, began by celebrating advertising in the realms of cinema, television, print, and radio internationally, evolving since its inception into 22 unique media types: Ambient, Billboard, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health &amp; Wellness, Health &amp; Wellness - Craft, Integration, Medical, Medical - Craft, Music &amp; Sound, Music Video, Non-Traditional, Package Design, Poster, Print, Production &amp; Post-Production, Radio &amp; Audio, Social Influencers, The NEW, Television/Cinema/Online Film and Verbal Identity.&lt;ref name="Categories"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/ "2017 Categories"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the word "Advertising" was removed from the competition's name to reflect the fact that it observes more than just "advertising" in an ever-changing industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyFour"&gt;London International Awards 2004 Winners &amp; Finalists Annual, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, LIA, along with creative Faris Yakob, developed "The NEW,"&lt;ref name="Digital"&gt;Pont, Simon (2013). ''Digital State: How the Internet is Changing Everything''. Kogan Page, {{ISBN|978-0749468866}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medium that takes notice of new ''kinds'' of ideas rather than merely new ideas, for works that demonstrate concepts that don't fit comfortably among the standard media divisions, with a focus in fields of technology.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

In 2014, LIA added Branded Entertainment as a medium. The judging category, first chaired by Jimmy Smith of Amusement Park Entertainment, awards "creativity and the power of the idea across films, television programming, live events, audio, gaming and music videos that engage consumers by entertaining them, rather than through traditional advertising."&lt;ref name="Branded"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-the-inaugural-branded-entertainment-competition-led-by-jimmy-smith-amusement-park-entertainment/ "LIA Announces the Inaugural Branded Entertainment Competition Led by Jimmy Smith, Amusement Park Entertainment"] Press Release, May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, LIA introduced a medium called [[Verbal Identity]],&lt;ref name="LBBVerbal"&gt;[https://lbbonline.com/news/lia-becomes-first-awards-festival-to-introduce-verbal-identity-category/ "LIA Becomes First Awards Festival to Introduce ‘Verbal Identity’ Category"]&lt;/ref&gt; centered on "the long-term verbal assets" of a brand, with sub-categories devoted to naming, taglines, copywriting and tone of voice.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

New developments for 2017 include the addition of a Health &amp; Pharma competition in response to a "large number of requests from creatives";&lt;ref name="HealthPharma"&gt;[https://www.adgully.com/lia-2017-adds-health-pharma-jeremy-perrott-to-chair-inaugural-juries-71201.html "LIA 2017 adds Health &amp; Pharma; Jeremy Perrott to Chair inaugural Juries"]&lt;/ref&gt; a Social Influencers medium "based on Creativity and Engagement",&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/the-influencer-awards/ "Social Influencers"]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Chinese Creativity Show featuring a unique red statue and executed through a first round of judging in [[China]] and a final judging session simultaneous with the annual LIA Judging.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/InBrief/45/12/13293.html "LIA Chinese Creativity Show to recognize works in Chinese"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIAChina"&gt;[http://www.liachina.com/ "LIA China"]&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Judging|Judging]])

== Judging ==
[[File:London International Awards Grand LIA Statue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The statue for the Grand LIA award|Grand LIA Award]]
LIA is one of the largest and most comprehensive awards programs in its field.

As of 2017, the thirteen LIA Jury panels, each one headed by a Jury President, are composed of nearly 100 experienced members of agencies, production companies, design houses, and technology companies. These panels decide on the Gold, Silver and Bronze Statue Winners, as well as the finalists, with each Jury given the non-compulsory opportunity to award a '''Grand LIA''' to a piece of work that has achieved a Gold statue. The judging process is unique in that each Juror sees every piece of work entered within the medium/media that he or she is required to judge.&lt;ref name="2014 Jury Comments"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/jury-comments/2014/ "2014 Archives | LIA Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; Judging is held annually in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] over a 7-to-10-day period in late September/early October.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/ "Key Dates"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
[[File:London International Awards Gold Statue.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The statue for the Gold LIA award|Gold LIA Award]]
For 26 years, LIA held its one-night awards ceremony in London. In 2012, it was decided to allocate the budget for the ceremony in favor of bringing a small group of young International Creatives from around the world together to share their experiences and to discuss the future of advertising, design, production, brand-building and the overall state of the creative global markets.&lt;ref name="PressCreate"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/press/press_archive/press_article.cfm?press_id=370&amp;start=51 "LIA 2012 Judging and Inaugural Creative Conversations"] Press Release, October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Creative LIAisons|Creative LIAisons]])

In 1985, LIA commissioned a British art student named Mary Griffiths to design the LIA statue. The 17" LIA statue is a winged figure that is hand cast in metal prior to a gold, silver, bronze, or black plating (for Grand LIA winners). It stands on a custom black nickel finished base with an engraved plate displaying the year, medium, category, client/brand and the recipient's name and location.&lt;ref name="Statue"&gt;[http://www.rsowens.com/m/Galleries/PrestigeAward "London International Award"] R.S. Owens, Prestige Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in 2010, the same year as the Awards' 25th Anniversary,&lt;ref name="Shoot"&gt;[https://www.shootonline.com/spw/45070 "London International Awards Honours Network of the Year Agency of the Year Production Company of the Year"] Shoot Publicity Wire, November 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; LIA awarded global '''Network of the Year''', '''Agency of the Year''', and '''Production Company of the Year''' designations. Subsequently, in 2011, LIA added '''Post-Production Company of the Year'''.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;[http://www.themill.com/awards "Awards - The Mill"] The Mill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design Company of the Year,''' '''Independent Agency of the Year,''' '''Music &amp; Sound Company of the Year''' and '''Radio &amp; Audio Company of the Year''' have also been recognized in recent years.&lt;ref name="Winners&amp;Finalists"&gt;[http://2016.liaentries.com/winners/ "Winners &amp; Finalists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, LIA gave a [[one-off]] award sponsored by [[JetBlue]] to filmmaker  [[Morgan Spurlock|Morgan Spurlock's]] ''[[POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'', dubbed "The Greatest Award Ever Sold" for its analysis of product placement and the inner workings of the ad industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEleven"&gt;London International Awards 2011 26th Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, LIA added '''Regional 'Of the Year'''' Awards to [[Australia]] / [[New Zealand]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], the [[Middle East]] / [[Africa]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Regional"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-regional-year-awards-recognize-best-region/ "LIA Announces Regional 'Of The Year' Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; as additional components of its global 'Of the Year' honors.

Entries submitted for consideration are required to have been broadcast, published, or released commercially with client approval in order to become part of the competition, accompanied by the payment of a required fee based on the category.&lt;ref name="Fees"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/enter/ "Rules of Entry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, LIA has published a hardbound, full-color Annual showcasing all of the winners and finalists from that given year.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/about/ "About LIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEight"&gt;London International Awards 2008 23rd Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative LIAisons ==
As a way of giving back to the industry, LIA launched the 'Creative Conversations' program in 2012. Composed of educational discussions centered on the future of advertising, brand-building and production, the campaign is enforced through a series of seminars, lunches, and dinners that run concurrent with judging. The organization and expenses, including that of travel and hotel accommodations, are wholly funded by LIA.&lt;ref name="CampaignBrief"&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2013/05/to-do-sunday-pm---london-inter.html "London International Awards Call for Entry Now Open - seven picked for jury duty from Australasia"] Campaign Brief, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the experience's purpose is to bridge relationships between veteran speakers and junior "Young Creatives" from across the globe, the advertising industry's "great teachers" and "young, energetic" minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hang Li|first1=Daniel|title=Comments|url=https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/attendees/2013/|website=www.liaawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural 2012 speakers included: Ted Royer, Susan Credle, Israel Diaz, Sonal Dabral, Tony Calcao, Jeremy Craigen, Faris Yakob, Neil French, Phil Growick, Dörte Spengler-Ahrens, Bob Garfield, Jonathon Ker, Ralph van Dijk, and Scott Elias.

The program was renamed "Creative LIAisons" for the 2015 awards, with just under 100 invited attendees.&lt;ref name="FrontPage"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/ "Creative LIAisons"]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daymond John]] returned as the Keynote Speaker, with other noteworthy speakers such as Amir Kassaei at [[DDB Worldwide]], John Merrifield from [[Google]], and Mark Tutssel of [[Leo Burnett Worldwide]] joining him.&lt;ref name="2015Speakers"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/creative_liaisons/speakers/2015/ "2015 Speakers"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maharashtra Film Company''' was an [[India]]n film production company, established by [[Baburao Painter]] in [[Kolhapur]]. Established in 1918,&lt;ref name="maharashtra film co"/&gt; it was a [[silent film]] studio, which was a pioneer in [[Maharashtra]] and [[Marathi cinema]], under the patronage of the [[Shahu Maharaj]], the [[Maharaja of Kolhapur]]. It released the first significant historical, ''Sairandhari'', released in Pune 7 February 1920. In the coming decade the only other major company was [[Dada Saheb Phalke]]'s Hindustan Film Company. It made numerous films till the advent of [[talkies]] in 1931, but started collapsing after [[V. Shantaram]] left in 1929, to form [[Prabhat Film Company]], it finally closed down in 1931.&lt;ref name="maharashtra film co"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford history of world cinema|author=Geoffrey Nowell-Smith|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-19-811257-2|page=399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4lio0ddha0C&amp;pg=PA399&amp;dq=Maharashtra+Film+Company&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z8x9Tvx0kbesB_nG9PcP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=Maharashtra%20Film%20Company&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Vishnupant Damle was trusted lieutenant of [[Baburao Painter]] in his Maharashtra film Company, [[Kolhapur]]. The company had made a name for itself with its silent films in early 1920s.&lt;ref name=pra/&gt;

Baburao Painter made many silent movies till 1930 however after a few more silent films, the Maharashtra Film Company pulled down its shutters with the advent of sound. Baburao was not particularly keen on the talkies for he believed that they would destroy the visual culture so painfully evolved over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upperstall.com/people/baburao-painter |title=Baburao Painter |publisher=[[Upperstall]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baburao Painter's associates, [[V Shantaram]], [[Keshavrao Dhaibar]], and close friends [[Vishnupant Damle]] and Fateh Lal (Damle Mama and Saheb Mama) held senior posts at the company. Eventually they decided to move out of the Maharashtra Film Company and formed their own [[Prabhat Film Company]] in 1929.&lt;ref name=pra&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19990722/ile22129.html Backing Prabhat Films] ''[[Indian Express]]'', Thursday, 22 July 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Menachem Birnbaum''' (born 1893 in [[Vienna]], died probably 1944), was an [[Austria]]n [[Jewish]] book [[illustrator]] and [[portrait painter]].

== Life ==
Birnbaum was the second son of the Jewish philosopher [[Nathan Birnbaum]] and his wife Rosa Korngut. Birnbaum later married Ernestine (Tina) Esther Helfmann, with whom he had two children: Rafael Zwi and Hana. Birnbaum lived in [[Berlin]] from 1911 until 1914 and again from 1919 until 1933. He then emigrated to the [[Netherlands]]. In the spring of 1943 he was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and with his relatives sent to a [[German Nazi]] concentration camp where he was murdered by the [[Nazism|Nazis]]. Menachem and his family Tina, Rafael Zwi, and Hana Birnbaum died in [[Sobibór extermination camp|Sobibór]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bundesarchiv.de/gedenkbuch/en1038370|title=German Bundesarchiv Memorial Book for Austrian Holocaust Victims|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13694">'''[[Metaphor]]''', the description of one thing as something else, has become of interest in recent decades to both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]], but for different reasons.

== Metaphor in analytic philosophy ==
In the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] (in particular, in the [[philosophy of language]]), [[metaphor]] has attracted interest because it does not conform to accepted [[truth-conditional semantics]], the conditions which determine whether or not a statement is true. Taken literally, the statement "Juliet is the sun" (from ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'') is false, if not nonsensical, yet, taken metaphorically, it is meaningful and may be true, but in a sense which is far from clear. The comparison theory of metaphor asserts that one can express the [[truth value]] of a metaphor by listing all the respects in which the two terms are alike or similar; for example: Juliet is ''like'' the sun because she shares with it qualities such as radiance, brilliance, the fact that she makes the day and that she gets up every morning. However, this results in re-casting metaphor as [[simile]]. Because it can only explain the truth of metaphor by in effect losing metaphor, the comparison theory is rarely defended.

In contrast, two leading theorists emphasize the fact that [[truth conditions]] cannot be specified for a metaphor. [[Max Black]] maintains that metaphors are too open-ended to be able to function as [[referring expression]]s, and so cannot be expressions which have truth conditions {{Harv |Black|1962}}.  If metaphors are used in contexts where precise terminology is expected (for example, in a scientific theory), then their role, Black argues, is purely [[heuristic]], that is, they are means to an end or ways of assisting understanding, rather than being terms which can be tested for truth or falsity {{Harv |Black|1962| p= 37}}.  [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] also thinks it a mistake to look for the truth conditions of a metaphor, since, in his words, "much of what we are caused to notice [in a metaphor] is not propositional in character", that is to say, metaphor is a prompt to thought which cannot be reduced to or contained by a series of [[truth conditions]] {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  What metaphor does, Davidson maintains, is make us see one thing as something else by "making [a] literal statement that inspires or prompts the insight" {{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}.  Seeing one thing as something else is not the recognition of some truth or fact, and so "the attempt to give literal expression to the content of the metaphor is simply misguided".{{Harv |Davidson|1984| p= 263}}

Max Black develops the idea that metaphor actually creates insight or new meaning {{Harv |Black|1979}}. His interactionist theory asserts that at the heart of a metaphor is the interaction between its two subject terms, where the interaction provides the condition for a meaning which neither of the subject terms possesses independently of the metaphorical context. The primary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] in a metaphor, he claims, is coloured by a set of "associated implications" normally predicated of the secondary [[subject (grammar)|subject]] {{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}.    From the number of possible meanings which could result, the primary subject sieves the qualities predicable of the secondary subject, letting through only those that fit. The interaction, as a process, brings into being what Black terms an "[[Logical implication|implication]]-complex", a system of associated implications shared by the linguistic community as well as an impulse of free meaning, free in that it is meaning which was unavailable prior to the metaphor's introduction.{{Harv |Black|1979| p= 28}}

In a different, naturalist, approach, some English-speaking philosophers close to [[cognitive science]], such as [[George Lakoff | Lakoff]], have made metaphor the central aspect of human rationality.

== Metaphor in continental philosophy ==
Whereas analytic philosophy examines metaphor within the philosophy of language, [[continental philosophy]] assigns much wider significance to metaphor. This is because the climate within continental thought has been more favourable to the propagation of new branches of enquiry from nineteenth century German philosophy. Although [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Hegel]] sit quite happily on both analytic and continental curricula, it is only the latter which has seriously addressed the need to rethink how the world appears to us and how it is made manifest to us in the light of their [[metaphysics]]. Metaphor has proven to be extremely important for this rethinking because it is the process of conceptual borrowing or reassignment which revises our perception of the world.

The major shift which occurs in [[Kantian]] continental philosophy, according to Cazeaux, is the departure 'from dualistic thought, i.e. thinking which remains within the boundaries created by oppositions, such as mind—body and subjective—objective' {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007| p=4}}.  The turn away from dualistic thought is made by Kant on account of his representing experience as the subjective determination of an objective world, thereby placing in a relationship terms which normally stand as opposites in a dualism. As a result of this shift, without conventional dualisms to fall back upon, the process of conceptual borrowing and cross-referral presented by metaphor becomes central as the means by which the textures and complexities of experience can be articulated. Theses to this effect, but with significant differences, can be found in [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], [[Heidegger]], [[Merleau-Ponty]], [[Bachelard]], [[Paul Ricoeur]], and [[Derrida]].

To give two examples. According to [[Nietzsche]], we are in metaphor or we are metaphor: our being is not derived from a [[Platonism|Platonic]], eternal [[essence]] or from a [[René Descartes|Cartesian]] thinking substance but (in as much as there is a way of being we can call ours) is emergent from tensional interactions between competing drives or perspectives {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000}}. We customarily hold truth to be a relation of correspondence between knowledge and reality but, Nietzsche declares, it is in fact ‘a movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms’ due to the fundamentally metaphorical nature of concept-formation, a series of creative leaps from nerve [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] to retinal image (first metaphor) to sound as signifier (second metaphor) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=55}}.  Our categories, and the judgments we form with them, can never correspond to things in themselves because they are formed through a series of transformations which ensures that ‘there is no [[causality]], no correctness, and no expression’ connecting the first stage (the stimulus) with the last (the concept) {{Harv |Nietzsche|2000| p=58}}.

For [[Paul Ricoeur|Ricoeur]], metaphor is also ‘living’ – hence the title of his book, ''La Métaphore vive'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1975}} (translated into English as ''The Rule of Metaphor'' {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977}}) – but in a different sense from Nietzsche .  Metaphor is living, Ricoeur claims, in that it is the principle which revives our [[perception]] of the world and through which we become aware of our creative capacity for seeing the world anew. This process, he thinks, is both paradoxical and Kantian in nature: paradoxical in that the creative combination of terms in a metaphor nevertheless produces meaning which has the character of a discovery (how can something be both a creation and a discovery?), and Kantian because the paradox mirrors Kant’s theory of experience in which the subjective application of concepts nevertheless yields perception of an objective world.  The tension between the subjective, creative and the objective, discovery aspects of a metaphor, Ricoeur argues, proceeds ‘from the very structures of the mind, which it is the task of [Kant’s] transcendental philosophy to articulate’ {{Harv |Ricoeur|1977| p=300}}.  Unfortunately, the part of Kant’s philosophy which Ricoeur appeals to is highly problematic: the [[Schema (Kant)|schema]] or schematism,  the operation which Kant dismisses as ‘an art concealed in the depths of the human soul' {{Harv |Kant|1929| p=183, A141, B180-81}}.  Ricoeur’s Kantianism is considered at length by Cazeaux {{Harv |Cazeaux|2007}} and Stellardi {{Harv |Stellardi|2000}}, with the former providing an account of how the schematism might afford a coherent explanation of metaphor.

Another reason for the attention paid by continental philosophy to metaphor is the questioning of boundaries – between subject areas and between the wider concepts of [[ethics]], [[epistemology]] and [[aesthetics]] – which has occurred within [[postmodernism]]. Principal concerns in these debates are the status of knowledge and the way in which the concepts of [[truth]] and objectivity are understood. Philosophy has been under attack on this score with its history of ‘universal truths’, e.g. [[Descartes]]’s cogito, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]’s table of categories, and [[Hegel]]’s Absolute Consciousness. The main arguments against this universalism invoke metaphor on two related accounts: (1) the fact that key epistemological concepts have metaphors at their root, for example, “mirroring”, “[[Communication|correspondence]]”, “[[sense data]]”, is taken as evidence of the contingent, communal, subjective basis of knowledge, and (2) because metaphor (as a form of dislocated or dislocating predication) works by testing the appropriate with the inappropriate, it is seen as a means of challenging the boundaries whereby one subject defines itself in relation to another.

==History==
[[Image:Moores School of Music.jpg|thumb|The Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music]]
The University of Houston was founded in 1927, and the music department was formed in 1940.  In 1969 the department was officially designated as the University of Houston School of Music.  In 1972&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonarchitecture.com/Building/2303/Fine_Arts_Building_(Houston).php Fine Arts Building (Houston)]. Retrieved 2008-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; the School of Music moved into the Fine Arts Building, a facility it shared with the [[University of Houston School of Art|Department of Art]].  A multimillion-dollar gift in 1991 by UH alumni [[John Moores (baseball)|John and Rebecca Moores]] led to renaming of the school in their honor (media references to the "Moores School of Music" appear as early as fall 1995) and to the construction of the present facility, which began operation in 1997.

Artistic directors of the school have included Bruce Spencer King, Earl Moore, Robert Briggs, [[Milton Katims]], David Tomatz, David Ashley White, and Andrew Davis.

Enrollment in the Moores School stands at nearly 600 music majors, who are instructed by a faculty of 80.  Since 1997 the school has been located at the Rebecca and John J. Moores School of Music Building on the University of Houston campus.  A large and varied schedule of concerts and recitals featuring students, faculty, and guest performers serves the concertgoing public of Houston throughout the year.

[[musical ensemble|Ensembles]] at the Moores School include the Wind Ensemble (recipient of multiple Grammy nominations), the Moores School Symphony Orchestra, the Concert Chorale, AURA (a contemporary music ensemble), the Jazz Orchestra, the [[Spirit of Houston Cougar Marching Band]], the Symphonic Winds, the Concert Band, the Cougar Brass, the Choral Artists, the Chamber Singers, the Concert Women's Chorus, the [[Houston Symphony Orchestra|Houston Symphony]] Chorus, the University Men's Chorus, the University Women's Chorus, the Moores School Percussion Ensemble, and Collegium Musicum (early music).  The Edythe Bates Old Moores Opera Center presents productions consistently lauded as being of professional quality.  As a component of the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Center for the Arts, the Moores School also collaborates for some events, programs, and productions with the [[University of Houston School of Art|School of Art]], the [[University of Houston Creative Writing Program|Creative Writing Program]], the School of Theatre and Dance, and the [[Blaffer Gallery]], the art museum of the University of Houston.

The Houston Opera Studio has provided dozens of world-class [[opera]] singers with early professional training and experience.  From its inception in 1977 until 1992, the Studio was a partnership between the University of Houston School of Music and [[Houston Grand Opera]]; it is now administered solely by HGO.&lt;ref&gt;"UH will end its support of Opera Studio" by Charles Ward. ''Houston Chronicle'', 18 February 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moores School of Music Percussion Ensemble, under the direction of Dr. Blake Wilkins, has also performed at three Percussive Arts Society International Conventions.  These showcase concerts were the result of winning three PAS "Call for Tapes" contests.  The Moores School Percussion Ensemble is the second ensemble in history to achieve three PAS Showcase concerts.  The group has recorded three commercially released compact discs:  Surge, released in 2005; Not Here, But There, released in 2009; and the most recent, Everywhere Entangled, which was released in January 2012.

Data indicate that some 80 percent of Moores School graduates stay in the Houston area following graduation, so that a large proportion of the community's professional musical performers and educators are University of Houston alumni.  Nevertheless, Moores School graduates in significant numbers can be found on concert stages, on college faculties, and in other leading professional musical roles worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

==Extracurricular programs and activities==
The Moores School hosts a number of musical activities outside the scope of its basic program of university instruction.  These include the following:
* a Division of Preparatory and Continuing Studies, which offers throughout the academic year private and classroom music instruction to the community at large, especially geared to children and adults
* the Texas Music Festival, an annual month-long summer program of concerts with intensive instruction and coaching for young professionals and highly talented students
* the Cougar Band Camp, a week-long summer program
* the International Piano Festival, an annual weekend of concerts and master classes with world-renowned keyboard artists
* an annual Moores School of Music Jazz Festival
* Floot Fire, an annual five-day festival for flutists

In addition, the Moores School of Music is home to chapters of four collegiate music fraternities and one honor society:
* The Beta Sigma chapter of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]], honorary band fraternity, founded January 21, 1950
* The Tau chapter of [[Tau Beta Sigma]], honorary band sorority, founded March 25, 1950.
* The Beta Pi chapter of [[Sigma Alpha Iota]], music fraternity, chartered March 28, 1953.
* The Omicron Upsilon chapter of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]] fraternity, chartered May 29, 1966.
* The Zeta Tau chapter of [[Pi Kappa Lambda]], music honor society, chartered 1989.

[[File:Internationale Kunstausstellung Muenchen 1897.jpg|thumb|315px|Poster by [[Franz von Stuck]] for the Seventh International Art Exhibition in Munich, 1897]]
The '''Munich Secession''' was an association of visual artists who broke away from the mainstream Munich Artists' Association in 1892, to promote and defend their art in the face of what they considered official paternalism and its conservative policies. They acted as a form of [[cooperative]], using their influence to assure their economic survival and obtain commissions. In 1901, the association split again when some dissatisfied members formed the group [[Phalanx (art group)|Phalanx]]. Another split occurred in 1913, with the founding of the "New Munich Secession".

== Background ==
[[File:Franz von Lenbach.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Franz von Lenbach, the "Prince of Painters". From ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', c.1900]]
By the end of the Nineteenth Century, more artists lived in Munich than lived in Vienna and Berlin put together. However, the art community there was dominated by the conservative attitudes of the Munich Artists' Association and its supporters in the government. These attitudes found expression in the official "mission statements", written by the so-called "Prince of Painters" (Malerfürst) [[Franz von Lenbach]]. Matters came to a head in 1891 when the Prince-Regent  [[Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria|Luitpold of Bavaria]] founded the ''Prinzregent-Luitpold-Stiftung zur Förderung der Kunst, des Kunstgewerbes und des Handwerks in München'', an art foundation devoted to promoting traditional [[history painting]] in the service of the state. This foundation created and maintained a high level of artistic quality and brought world attention to the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Academy of Fine Arts]], but was firmly opposed to [[impressionism]], [[expressionism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] and other contemporary trends in the art world.

Another factor was the complete financial failure of an exhibition in 1888 at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]], organized by the Artists' Association. This led to a bitter debate about responsibility and the exhibition's content which grew so furious, it attracted the attention of the Ministry of State for Science and Art.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Hummel: ''Die Anfänge der Münchener Secession''. Schriften aus dem Institut für Kunstgeschichte der Universität München, Vol. 46, {{ZDB|57236-6}}. Tuduv-Verlags-Gesellschaft, München 1989, {{ISBN|3-88073-345-7}}. (based on a thesis for the [[University of Munich]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

To address this situation, a group of artists with a progressive outlook gathered together in 1892, announced their separation from the official Artists' Association and established the Munich Secession, with an eye toward exhibiting at the upcoming [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. They called for a transformation in the ideas of what constitutes art and promoted the idea of an artists' freedom to present works directly to the public.

{{Zitat|"''Man soll auf unseren Ausstellungen Kunst sehen und jedes Talent, ob älterer oder neuerer Richtung, dessen Werke München zur Ehre gereichen, soll seine Blüte reich entfalten können''." (One should see, in our exhibitions, every form of art, whether old or new, which will redound to the glory of Munich, whose art will be allowed to develop to its full flowering)}}

In this statement of principles, the artists declared their intentions to move away from outmoded principles and a conservative conception of what art is.&lt;ref&gt;Clelia Segieth: ''Memorandum des Vereins Bildender Künstler Münchens''. In: Buhrs, Best: ''Secession 1892–1914'', S.&amp;nbsp;20–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation ==
[[File:Bruno-piglhein.jpg|thumb|150px|Bruno Piglhein, first President of the Secession]]
On April 4, 1892, ninety-six artists who had resigned from the official Association, established the ''Association of Visual Artists of Munich''. [[Bruno Piglhein]] was elected the first President and [[Paul Hoecker]] became the first Secretary. In a few months the original name gave way to the more popular name: ''Munich Secession''.

Financial support initially came from three sources: [[Georg Hirth]], a writer and journalist who coined the word "secession" to describe the spirit of the various art movements at that time. In 1896, he would establish the [[Art-Nouveau]] magazine ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'' ; [[Georg von Vollmar]], editor of the [[Democratic socialism|Democratic Socialist]] party's official organ ; and Hans Viet, Graf von Toerring-Jettenbach (1862-1929), a member of the liberal opposition to the government's policies.

That same year saw the creation of another breakaway association, the ''{{ill|Luitpold-Gruppe|de}}'', composed of more moderate artists who wanted to maintain the high-quality standards of the Academy. The [[Vienna Secession]] followed five years later, and the [[Berlin Secession]] was established in 1898.

== Exhibitions ==
[[File:Ausstellungspalast, Berlin 1885.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The National Exhibition Building (ULAP), c.1885]]
At first, the Secession had some difficulty finding a building for their exhibitions. The city of Frankfurt offered to provide the necessary space and 500,000 [[German gold mark|Gold Marks]], if the group would move there permanently.&lt;ref name="Helmut Kästl"&gt;Helmut Kästl: [http://www.muenchenersecession.de/hist.php ''Historisches zur Münchener Secession''.] In: ''muenchenersecession.de'', abgerufen am 22. Juni 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Their first exhibition actually took place at Berlin's "National Exhibition Building" (now known as "[[Universum Landes-Ausstellungs-Park|ULAP]]") early in 1893.

Baurat (city construction supervisor) Franz von Brandl provided the Secession with some free land at the corner of [[Prinzregentenstraße (Munich)|Prinzregentenstraße]] and Pilotystraße. Construction began immediately and their debut exhibition took place on July 16, 1893, in the first portion of the building to be completed. Over 4,000 visitors came to see 876 works by 297 artists.

The success of this effort eventually allowed them to come to an agreement with Franz von Lenbach and the Artists' Association. As a result, the art exhibition building on the [[Königsplatz, Munich|Königsplatz]] (now the [[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]]) was transferred to the Secession in 1897.

== Later history ==
In 1933, the [[National Socialist]] party began their crusade to bring all forms of artistic expression under their control: a process known as [[Gleichschaltung]] (bringing into line). Artists were eventually required to obtain state endorsement for all of their works. Those who were considered "[[Degenerate art|degenerate]]" were not allowed to paint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Glaser]]: ''Wie Hitler den deutschen Geist zerstörte. Kulturpolitik im Dritten Reich''. Ellert&amp;nbsp;&amp; Richter, Hamburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-8319-0227-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, the Munich Secession was dissolved as part of the "Kulturellen Säuberung" ([[cultural cleansing]]) process.

Following the end of World War II in 1946, the ''{{ill|Neue Gruppe|de}}'' and the ''Neue Münchner Künstlergenossenschaft'' (New Munich Artists' Association) were founded and led to the establishment of the ''Bundesverband Bildender Künstlerinnen und Künstler'' (Federal Association of Visual Artists).

In 1992, the Secession celebrated its centennial and, in March of the following year, the ''Society of Friends and Sponsors of the Munich Secession'' was created to support the Secession's continuing goals, maintain the "Secessionsgalerie" and promote exhibitions.

The '''New Aesthetic''' is a term, coined by [[James Bridle]], used to refer to the increasing appearance of the visual language of digital technology and the Internet in the physical world, and the blending of virtual and physical. The phenomenon has been around for a long time but James Bridle articulated the notion through a series of talks and observations. The term gained wider attention following a panel at the [[SXSW]] conference in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://booktwo.org/notebook/sxaesthetic/|title=#sxaesthetic report|author=James Bridle|date= 15 March 2012|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Developing from a series of collections of digital objects that have become located in the physical, the movement circulates around a blog named "The New Aesthetic" and which has defined the broad contours of the movement without a manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2011a) Waving at the Machines, Web Directions, accessed 05/04/2012, http://www.webdirections.org/resources/james-bridle-waving-at-the-machines&lt;/ref&gt; The New Aesthetic as a concept was introduced at South By South West (SXSW) on March 12, 2012, at a panel organised by James Bridle and included Aaron Cope, [[Ben Terrett]], [[Joanne McNeil]] and Russell Davies.&lt;ref name="imperica"&gt;Berry, D. M. (2012) Computationality and the New Aesthetic, Imperica, http://www.imperica.com/viewsreviews/david-m-berry-computationality-and-the-new-aesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2012b) #sxaesthetic, accessed 06/04/2012, http://booktwo.org/notebook/sxaesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bridle, J. (2011b) Regarding the library with envious eyes, Booktwo.org, accessed 05/04/2012, http://booktwo.org/notebook/books-computational-value&lt;/ref&gt;

An article by Bruce Sterling in Wired Magazine propelled the ideas around the New Aesthetic into critical and public consciousness. Sterling's article described the concept's main outlines but also proposed some key critical areas for development.&lt;ref name="Wired Essay"&gt;Sterling, B. (2012) [https://www.wired.com/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/ "An Essay on the New Aesthetic"], Wired blog, April 2, 2012. Accessed 05/04/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent response from across the web was rapid and engaged with a number of significant contemporaneous contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Battles, M. (2012) But it moves: the New Aesthetic &amp; emergent virtual taste, Metalab, accessed 08/04/2012, http://metalab.harvard.edu/2012/04/but-it-moves-the-new-aesthetic-emergent-virtual-taste/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bogost, I. (2012) The New Aesthetic Needs to Get Weirder, The Atlantic, https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-new-aesthetic-needs-to-get-weirder/255838&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borenstein, G. (2012) What Its Like To Be a 21C Thing?, Creators Project, accessed 07/04/2012, http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/in-response-to-bruce-sterlings-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic&lt;/ref&gt;

The author [[Bruce Sterling]] has said of the New Aesthetic:

:The “New Aesthetic” is a native product of modern network culture. It’s from London, but it was born digital, on the Internet. The New Aesthetic is a “theory object” and a “shareable concept.”
:The New Aesthetic is “collectively intelligent.” It’s diffuse, crowdsourcey, and made of many small pieces loosely joined. It is rhizomatic, as the people at Rhizome would likely tell you. It’s open-sourced, and triumph-of-amateurs. It’s like its logo, a bright cluster of balloons tied to some huge, dark and lethal weight.&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2012/04/an-essay-on-the-new-aesthetic/|title=An Essay on the New Aesthetic|publisher=Wired|date=2 April 2012|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matthew Battles, a contributor to Metalab, a project of the [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]], gives a definition that makes reference to purported paradigmatic examples:

:New Aesthetic is a collaborative attempt to draw a circle around several species of aesthetic activity—including but not limited to drone photography, ubiquitous surveillance, glitch imagery, Streetview photography, 8-bit net nostalgia. Central to the New Aesthetic is a sense that we’re learning to “wave at machines”—and that perhaps in their glitchy, buzzy, algorithmic ways, they’re beginning to wave back in earnest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metalab.harvard.edu/2012/04/but-it-moves-the-new-aesthetic-emergent-virtual-taste/|title=But it moves: the New Aesthetic &amp; emergent virtual taste|author=Matthew Battles|publisher=Metalab|date=8 April 2012|accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more substantive contributions to the notion of the New Aesthetic has been through a development of, and linking to, the way in which the digital and the everyday are increasingly interpenetrating each other. Here, the notion of the unrepresentability of computation, as both an infrastructure and an ecology, are significant in understanding the common New Aesthetic tendency towards pixelated graphics and a retro 8-bit form.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, D. M., Dartel, M. v., Dieter, M., Kasprzak, M. Muller, N., O'Reilly, R., and Vicente, J. L (2012) New Aesthetic, New Anxieties, Amsterdam: V2, accessed 27/06/2012, http://www.v2.nl/publishing/new-aesthetic-new-anxieties&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to the idea of an [[episteme]] (or [[ontotheology]]) identified with relation to computation and computational ways of seeing and doing: ''computationality''.

[[Michael Betancourt]] has discussed the New Aesthetic in relation to digital automation. The ‘new aesthetic’ provides a reference point for the examination of [[Karl Marx]]'s discussion of machines in ‘The Fragment on Machines.’
:The 'new aesthetic' documents is the shift from earlier considerations of machine labor as an amplifier and extension of human action -- as an augmentation of human labor -- to its replacement by models where the machine does not augment but supplant, in the process apparently removing the human intermediary that is the labor that historically lies between the work of human designer-engineers and fabrication following their plans.&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Michael. ''Automated Labor: The 'New Aesthetic' and Immaterial Physicality,'' CTheory, Theory Beyond the Codes: tbc048, http://ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=717&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Betancourt, the New Aesthetic documents a shift in production that is different than that described by Marx. Where the machines Marx described were dependent on human control, those identified with the New Aesthetic work to supplant the human element, replacing it with digital automation, effectively removing living labor from the production process.

One movement that draws parallels to "New Aesthetic" is "[[Seapunk]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lunavega.net/2011/10/seapunk-the-new-web-and-the-evolution-of-the-visual-music-genre/|title=Seapunk: The New Web and the Evolution of the Visual Music Genre|author=Luna Vega|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

A '''poetry slam''' is a [[competition]] in which poets perform [[spoken word poetry]]. Poetry slams began in Chicago in 1984 with its first competition designed to move poetry recitals from academia to a popular audience when American poet [[Marc Smith (poet)|Marc Smith]] began experimenting with existing open microphone venues for poetry readings by making them competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.powerpoetry.org/actions/what-slam-poem|title=History of Slam Poetry – Spoken Word Poetry {{!}} Power Poetry|website=www.powerpoetry.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances at a poetry slam are judged by a panel of judges, typically five, and usually selected from the audience, or sometimes judged by audience response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/brief-guide-slam-poetry|title=A Brief Guide to Slam Poetry|last=aapone|date=2014-02-04|website=A Brief Guide to Slam Poetry|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges usually give each poem a score on a scale of 0–10 (zero being the worst and ten being the best). The highest and lowest scores are dropped and the middle three are kept. The highest score one can receive is 30 and the lowest is zero.

==History==
American poet [[Marc Smith (poet)|Marc Smith]] is credited with starting the poetry slam at the Get Me High Lounge in [[Chicago]] in November 1984. In July 1986, the original slam moved to its permanent home, the [[Green Mill Jazz Club]].&lt;ref name="marc smith"&gt;[http://marckellysmith.com/#/history/ Marc Smith website: History page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216003323/http://marckellysmith.com/#/history/ |date=February 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mehroz-baig/slam-poetry-a-history_b_4944799.html|title=Slam Poetry: A History|last=Baig|first=Mehroz|date=2014-03-12|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 the Ann Arbor Poetry Slam was founded by Vince Keuter and eventually made its home at the Heidelberg (moving later 2010, 2013, and 2015 to its new home at Espresso Royale). In August 1988, the first poetry slam held in New York City was hosted by Bob Holman at the Nuyorican Poet's Cafe.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe|title=Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam|location=New York|publisher=Soft Skull Press|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the first [[National Poetry Slam]] took place at [[Fort Mason]], [[San Francisco]]. This slam included teams from Chicago and San Francisco, and an individual poet from New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.poetryslam.com/faq/nps|title =PSI FAQ: National Poetry Slam|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201141/http://www.poetryslam.com/faq/nps|archivedate =2013-10-29|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, poetry slam increased popularity allowed some poets to make full-time careers in performance and competition, touring the United States and eventually the world.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In 2001, the grounding of aircraft following the [[September 11 attacks]] left a number of performers stranded in cities they had been performing in.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; After the attacks, a new wave of poetry slam started within New York City with a community focus on poets coming together to speak about the terrorist attacks.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

{{As of|2017}}, the National Poetry Slam  featured 72 certified teams, culminating in five days of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2014/08/15/d-c-s-beltway-poetry-slam-triumphs-at-the-national-poetry-slam | title=D.C.'s Beltway Poetry Slam triumphs at the National Poetry Slam | work=Washington Post | date=August 15, 2014 | accessdate=June 4, 2016 | author=Sadie Dingfelder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, there are poetry slam competitions in a number of countries around the globe.

Poetry Slam Inc. sanctions three major annual poetry competitions (for poets 18+) on a national and international scale: the National Poetry Slam (NPS), the individual World Poetry Slam (iWPS), and the Women of the World Poetry Slam (WoWPS)

==Format==
In a poetry slam, members of the audience are chosen by an [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]] or host to act as judges for the event. In the national slam, there are five judges, but smaller slams generally have three. After each poet performs, each judge awards a score to that poem. Scores generally range between zero and ten. The highest and lowest score are dropped, giving each performance a rating between zero and thirty points.

Before the competition begins, the host will often bring up a "[[sacrifice|sacrificial]]" poet, whom the judges will score in order to calibrate their judging.

A single round at a standard slam consists of performances by all eligible poets. Most slams last multiple rounds, and many involve the elimination of lower-scoring poets in successive rounds. An elimination [[rubric]] might run 8-4-2; eight poets in the first round, four in the second, and two in the last. Some slams do not eliminate poets at all. The Green Mill usually runs its slams with 6 poets in the first round. At the end of the slam, the poet with the highest number of points earned is the winner.

The Boston Poetry Slam &lt;ref&gt;=http://bostonpoetryslam.com/perform-your-poetry/poetry-slam/8x8-slam-series/rules-and-format&lt;/ref&gt; takes a different approach; it uses the 8-4-2 three-round rubric, but the poets go head-to-head in separate bouts within the round.

Props, costumes, and music are forbidden in slams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://my.poetryslam.com/nps-rules | title=The Rules of the National Poetry Slam | publisher=Poetry Slam, Inc | work=my.poetryslam.com [beta] | date=2008-02-17 | accessdate=June 4, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207073444/http://my.poetryslam.com/nps-rules | archivedate=February 7, 2012 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which differs greatly from its immediate predecessor, [[performance poetry]]. [[Hedwig Gorski]], the founder of performance poetry as a distinct genre, saw props, costumes, and music as essential for a complete theatrical experience while also following theorist [[Jerzy Grotowski]]'s Poor Theater by blurring lines between the real person, actor, and speakers in scripted literary art.&lt;ref name="Gorski, Hedwig"&gt;. Gorski, Hedwig. (2015) ''Booby, Mama!: Surreal Cut-Up Spoken Word, 1977'' Introduction. CreateSpace. {{ISBN|978-1507829158}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other rules for slams enforce a time limit of three minutes (and a grace period of ten seconds), after which a poet's score may be docked according to how long the poem exceeded the limit. Many youth slams, however, allow the poets up to three and a half minutes on stage.

==Competition types==
[[File:Digiluule Slam Arvamusfestivali kohvikualal 04.jpg|thumb|left|Poetry slam in [[Paide]], [[Estonia]]]]
In an "Open Slam", the most common slam type, competition is open to all who wish to compete, given the number of slots available. In an "Invitational Slam", only those invited to do so may compete.

Poetry Slam, Inc. holds several national and international competitions, including the Individual World Poetry Slam, the National Poetry Slam and The Women of the World Poetry Slam. The current (2013) IWPS champion is Ed Mabrey.&lt;ref name="2012iWPS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwps.poetryslam.com/|title=Individual World Poetry Slam - October 12-15 2016; Flagstaff, AZ #iWPSFLG|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Mabrey is the only three-time IWPS champion in the history of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonvipslam.com/swso/presentation/a-morning-with-ed-mabrey/|title=Workshop: The Three Lives of a Poem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current (2013) National Poetry Slam Team champions are Slam New Orleans (SNO), who have won the competition for the second year in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nps2013.poetryslam.com/|title=National Poetry Slam Championship winners|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current (2014) Women of the World Poetry Slam Champion is Dominique Christina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryslam.com/|title=Poetry Slam Inc|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 10th of December until the 11th of December 2016 [[Salzburg]], [[Austria]] hold a world-record poetry slam competition (28 hours of classic slam poetry) and broke the so-far-record of Nurembourg, Germany (25 hours) by  Michl Jakob.  The winner of the competition (Friedrich Herrmann) scored one point better in the finals then the second ranked (Darryl Kiermeier). The event was organized by Lukas Wagner (Slamlabor) and took place in the SN-Saal of the Salzburger Nachrichten. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sn.at/wiki/Poetry_Slam_Weltrekord|title=Poetry Slam World Record|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://salzburg.orf.at/news/stories/2814009/|title=Austria holds new record|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "Theme Slam" is one in which all performances must conform to a specified theme, genre, or formal constraint. Themes may include [[Nerd]],&lt;ref name="nerd"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gotpoetry.com/News/article/sid=6821.html | title=There Will Be Nerds (History of the Nerd Slam | accessdate=June 4, 2016 | author=J. Bradley | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208193822/http://gotpoetry.com/News/article/sid=6821.html | archivedate=December 8, 2008 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erotica]], [[Queer]], [[Improvisational theatre|Improv]], or other conceptual limitations. In theme slams, poets can sometimes be allowed to break "traditional" slam rules. For instance, they sometimes allow performance of work by another poet (e.g. the "Dead Poet Slam", in which all work must be by a deceased poet). They can also allow changes on the restrictions on costumes or props (e.g. the Swedish "Triathlon" slams that allow for a poet, musician, and dancer to all take the stage at the same time), changing the judging structure (e.g. having a specific guest judge), or changing the time limits (e.g. a "1-2-3" slam with three rounds of one minute, two minutes, and three minutes, respectively).

Although theme slams may seem restricting in nature, slam venues frequently use them to advocate participation by particular and perhaps underrepresented demographics (which vary from slam to slam), like younger poets and women.

==Poetics==

Poetry slams can feature a broad range of voices, styles, cultural traditions, and approaches to writing and performance. The originator of performance poetry, Hedwig Gorski, credits slam poetry for carrying on the poetics of ancient oral poetry designed to grab attention in barrooms and public squares.&lt;ref name="Gorski"&gt;Gorski, Hedwig &amp; Cole, Joy. (2006). ''Intoxication: Heathcliff on Powell Street'' Slough Press. {{ISBN|978-1427604750}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
Some poets are closely associated with the vocal delivery style found in [[hip-hop music]] and draw heavily on the tradition of [[dub poetry]], a rhythmic and politicized genre belonging to black and particularly West Indian culture. Others employ an unrhyming narrative formula. Some use traditional theatrical devices including shifting voices and tones, while others may recite an entire poem in ironic monotone. Some poets use nothing but their words to deliver a poem, while others stretch the boundaries of the format, tap-dancing or beatboxing or using highly choreographed movements.

What is a dominant / successful style one year may not be passed to the next. [[Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz]], slam poet and author of ''Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam'', was quoted in an interview on the Best American Poetry blog as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the more interesting end products (to me, at least) of this constant shifting is that poets in the slam always worry that something—a style, a project, a poet—will become so dominant that it will kill the scene, but it never does. Ranting hipsters, freestyle rappers, bohemian drifters, proto-comedians, mystical shamans and gothy punks have all had their time at the top of the slam food chain, but in the end, something different always comes along and challenges the poets to try something new.&lt;ref name="BAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2008/04/the-life-histor.html|work=Best American Poetry Blog|title=The Life Story of the Death of Art |author=Janice Erlbaum|date=April 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:BobHolmanNewYorkCity2006.JPG|thumb|[[Bob Holman]]]]
One of the goals of a poetry slam is to challenge the authority of anyone who claims absolute authority over literary value. No poet is beyond critique, as everyone is dependent upon the goodwill of the audience. Since only the poets with the best cumulative scores advance to the final round of the night, the structure assures that the audience gets to choose from whom they will hear more poetry. Audience members furthermore become part of each poem's presence, thus breaking down the barriers between poet/performer, critic, and audience.

[[Bob Holman]], a poetry activist and former slammaster of the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]], once called the movement "the democratization of verse".&lt;ref name="Aloud1"&gt;. Algarín, Miguel &amp; Holman, Bob. (1994) ''Aloud: Voices from the Nuyorican Poets Cafe'' Holt. {{ISBN|0-8050-3257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Holman was also quoted as saying: "The spoken word revolution is led a lot by women and by poets of color. It gives a depth to the nation's dialogue that you don't hear on the floor of [[United States Congress|Congress]]. I want a floor of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to look more like a National Poetry Slam. That would make me happy."&lt;ref name="aptowicz1"&gt;Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008). ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam.'' Chapter 26: What the Heck Is Going On Here; The Bowery Poetry Club Opens (Kinda) for Business. Soft Skull Press, 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
At the 1993 National Poetry Slam in San Francisco, a participating team from Canada (Kedrick James, Alex Ferguson and John Sobol) wrote, printed and circulated an instant broadside titled ''Like Lambs to the Slammer'', that criticized what they perceived as the complacency, conformity, and calculated tear-jerking endemic to the poetry slam scene. 

In an interview in the ''[[Paris Review]],'' literary critic [[Harold Bloom]] said about slamming:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I can't bear these accounts I read in the ''Times'' and elsewhere of these poetry slams, in which various young men and women in various late-spots are declaiming rant and nonsense at each other. The whole thing is judged by an applause meter which is actually not there, but might as well be. This isn't even silly; it is the death of art.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold (2009) quoted in Somers-Willett, Susan B.A., ''The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry.'' University of Michigan Press. p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Poet and lead singer of [[King Missile]], [[John S. Hall]] has also long been a vocal opponent, taking issue with such factors as its inherently [[competition|competitive]] nature&lt;ref name="aptowicz290"&gt;Aptowicz (2008), p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;  and what he considers its lack of stylistic diversity.&lt;ref name="aptowicz297"&gt;Aptowicz (2008), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2005 [[interview]] in ''Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam,'' he recalls seeing his first slam, at the [[Nuyorican Poets Café]]: "...I hated it. And it made me really uncomfortable and... it was very much like a sport, and I was interested in poetry in large part because it was like the antithesis of sports.... [I]t seemed to me like a very macho, masculine form of poetry and not at all what I was interested in."

The poet Tim Clare offers a "for and against" account of the phenomenon in ''Slam: A Poetic Dialogue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Slam: A Poetic Dialogue |title=Stress Fractures: Essays on Poetry |editor-last=Chivers |editor-first=Tom |publisher=Penned in the Margins Press |location=London |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9565-4671-5 |oclc=680282058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ironically, slam poetry movement founder Marc Smith has been critical of the commercially successful [[Def Poetry]] television and Broadway live stage shows produced by [[Russell Simmons]], decrying it as "an exploitive entertainment [program that] diminished the value and aesthetic of performance poetry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 | title=The Fall of Slam | work=Vocalo | date=June 3, 2008 | accessdate=June 4, 2016 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011163000/http://www.vocalo.org/explore/content/28448 | archivedate=October 11, 2008 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academia==

As of 2011, four poets who have competed at National Poetry Slam have won [[National Endowment of the Arts]] (NEA) Fellowships for Literature:
* [[Hal Sirowitz]] (who was on the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] Poetry Slam team in 1993&lt;ref name="wiyf1991"&gt;Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008). ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam.'' [[New York City]]: Soft Skull Press. "Chapter 14: First and Always; Graduates from the NYC Poetry Slam's First Wave" p. 122. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 1994&lt;ref name="NEA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arts.gov/pub/NEA_lit.pdf | title=National Endowment of the Arts List of Literature Fellows: 1967–2007 | date=March 2006 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811235711/http://www.arts.gov/pub/NEA_lit.pdf | archivedate=August 11, 2006 | deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Adrienne Su (who was on the [[Nuyorican Poets Cafe]] Poetry Slam team in 1991&lt;ref name="wiyf1991"/&gt;) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2007&lt;ref name="NEA2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/features/Writers/writersCMS/index.php?year=2007|title=National Endowment of the Arts Writer's Corner|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530042213/http://www.nea.gov///features/writers/writersCMS/index.php?year=2007|archivedate=2010-05-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Cristin O'Keefe Aptowicz]] (who was on the NYC-Urbana Poetry Slam team in 1998, 2001, 2003 and 2010) won an NEA Fellowship in Poetry in 2011&lt;ref name="NEA2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/11grants/litFellows.php|title=National Endowment of the Arts 2011 Poetry Fellows|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127065351/http://www.nea.gov/grants/recent/11grants/litFellows.php|archivedate=2010-11-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, one poet who has competed at National Poetry Slam has won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Poetry:
* [[Tyehimba Jess]],&lt;ref name="Pulitzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/winners/tyehimba-jess|title=Olio, by Tyehimba Jess (Wave Books)|first=|last=|website=www.pulitzer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; who competed as a part of Chicago's Green Mill team twice.&lt;ref name="PoetryFoundTJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/tyehimba-jess|title=Tyehimba Jess|date=12 November 2017|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of poets belong to both academia and slam: 
* [[Jeffrey McDaniel]] slammed on several poetry slam teams, and has since published several books and currently teaches at Sarah Lawrence College. 
* Lisa Buscani, the 1992 national slam champion, published ''Jangle'' (Tia Chucha Press) and created three solo shows. Buscani toured the nation as an actor and performance poet; she currently teaches at DePaul University.
* [[Patricia Smith (poet)|Patricia Smith]], a four-time national slam champion, went on to win several prestigious literary awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and an NEA Fellowship, and being inducted into the International Literary Hall of Fame for Writers of African Descent in 2006. 
* [[Bob Holman]] founded the Nuyorican Poetry Slam has taught for years at the New School, Bard, Columbia and NYU. [[Craig Arnold]] won the [[Yale Series of Younger Poets Competition]] and has competed at slams. 
* [[Kip Fulbeck]], a professor of Art at the University of California, Santa Barbara competed in slam in the early-1990s and initiated the first spoken word course to be taught as part of a college art program's core curriculum.&lt;ref name="independent.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.independent.com/news/2012/aug/30/close-kip-fulbeck/ | title=Up Close with Kip Fulbeck | work=The Independent | date=August 30, 2012 | accessdate=June 4, 2016 | author=Gripenstraw, Kelsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Javon Johnson (poet)|Javon Johnson]] was national slam poetry champion in 2003 and 2004, wrote his dissertation on slam poetry and  published an article in text and performance quarterly about black masculinity and sexism in the slam community.&lt;ref name="Johnson, Javon 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Javon|authorlink=Javon Johnson (poet)|title=Manning Up: Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Los Angeles' Slam and Spoken Word Poetry Communities|journal=Text and Performance Quarterly|volume=30|issue=4|year=2010|pages=396–419|doi=10.1080/10462937.2010.511252}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Susan Somers-Willett]] wrote the book ''The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry'', exploring the relationships between slam, identity, and politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Somers-Willett, Susan B. A.|title=The Cultural Politics of Slam Poetry: Race, Identity, and the Performance of Popular Verse in America|location=Ann Arbor|publisher=U of MI P|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Ragan Fox]] writes about his ten years of experience as "a gay slam poet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fox, Ragan|title='Ragan Fox Is A Gay Slam Poet': An Autobiographical Exploration Of Performance Poetry's Performative Implications|journal=Text &amp; Performance Quarterly|volume=30|issue=4|year=2010|pages=420–429|doi=10.1080/10462937.2010.508535}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Marie Fleischmann Timbreza, and [[Karyna McGlynn]] have devoted much attention to the merging of the poetry slam community and the academic community in their respective works.

Some renowned poets have competed in slams, with less successful results.  [[Henry S. Taylor|Henry Taylor]], winner of the 1985 [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]], competed in the 1997 National Poetry Slam as an individual and placed 75th out of 150.

While slam poetry has often been ignored in traditional higher learning institutions, it slowly is finding its way into courses and programs of study. For example, at [[Berklee|Berklee College of Music]], in Boston, slam poetry is now available as a Minor course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berklee.edu/minors/english.html|title=English Minor - Berklee College of Music|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth movement==
Slam poetry has found popularity as a form of self-expression among many teenagers. The World Poetry Bout Association sponsored the earliest slam poetry workshops for teenagers, through its "Poetry Education Project" in Taos, New Mexico, in the early 1990s. The first statewide competition for high school students was held at Taos High School in 1993, with the top teams and individual participants awarded plaques. Members of Taos' competitive teams earned athletic letters annually up until 2008. [cf. The Taos News, Taos, NM, articles, 1993 to present.] Youth Speaks, a non-profit literary organization founded in 1996 by [[James Kass]], patterned the slam competitions at the annual Brave New Voices festival after that seminal Taos event. Youth Speaks serves as one of the largest youth poetry organizations in America, offering opportunities for youth ages 13–19 to express their ideas on paper and stage.

Another group offering opportunities in education and performance to teens is URBAN WORD NYC out of New York City, formerly known as Youth Speaks New York. URBAN WORD NYC holds the largest youth slam in NYC annually, with over 500 young people. The non-profit organization provides free workshops for inner-city youth ran by Hip-Hop poet and mentor, Michael Cirelli.

Young Chicago Authors (YCA) provides workshops, mentoring, and competition opportunities to youth in the Chicago area.  Every year YCA presents [[Louder Than a Bomb|Louder Than A Bomb]], the world's largest team-based youth slam and subject of a documentary by the same name.

The youth poetry slam movement was the focus of a documentary film series produced by HBO and released in 2009.&lt;ref name="HBO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthspeaks.org/pressreleases/HBO%20and%20Youth%20Speaks.doc|title=Press Release Announcing Youth Poetry Slam Documentary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured poets from Youth Speaks, Urban Word, Louder than a Bomb and other related youth poetry slam organizations.

In a 2005 interview, one of slam's best known poets [[Saul Williams]] praised the youth poetry slam movement, explaining:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hip-hop filled a tremendous void for me and my friends growing up... The only thing that prevented all the young boys in the black community from turning into Michael Jackson, from all of us bleaching our skin, from all of us losing it, just losing it, was hip-hop. That was the only counter-existence in the mainstream media. That was essential, and in that same way I think poetry fills a very huge void today [among] youth. And I guess I count myself among the youth.&lt;ref name="wiyf5"&gt;Aptowicz (2008), P. 233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Prehistoric art in Scotland''' is [[visual art]] created or found within the modern borders of Scotland, before the departure of the [[Roman Empire in Britain|Romans]] from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or [[Scotland in the Middle Ages|Medieval era]]. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity often lack a context that would allow them to be understood.

The earliest examples of [[portable art]] from what is now Scotland are highly decorated [[petrosphere|carved stone balls]] from the [[Neolithic]] period, which share patterns with Irish and Scottish stone carvings. Other items from this period include elaborate carved maceheads and figurines from [[Links of Noltland]], including the [[Westray Wife]], which is the earliest known depiction of a human face from Scotland.

From the [[Bronze Age]] there are examples of carvings, including the first representations of objects, and [[cup and ring marks]].  Representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s may be symbolic representations of power. Surviving metalwork includes [[gold lunula]] or neckplates, [[jet (lignite)|jet]] beaded necklaces and elaborate weaponry, such as [[Xiphos|leaf sword]]s and ceremonial shields of sheet bronze.

From the [[Iron Age]] there are more extensive examples of patterned objects and gold work. Evidence of the wider [[La Tène]] culture includes the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]]. The [[Stirling torcs]] demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland and continental workmanship. One of the most impressive items from this period is the boar's head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]]. From the first century CE, as Rome carried out a series of occupations, there are Roman artifacts like the [[Cramond Lioness]] and Roman influence on material culture can be seen in local stone carvings.

==Definitions and meanings==
[[File:Ancient cup and ring stone, Kelvingrove Museum, Glasgow - DSC06245.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Cup and ring marks]] survive in large numbers from Scotland and have been suggested to have a variety of meanings]]
The ability to study [[prehistoric art]] is dependent on surviving artifacts. Art created in mediums such as sand, bark, hides and textiles has not normally endured, while less-perishable materials, such as rock, stone, bone, ivory (and to a lesser extent wood), later pottery and metal, are more likely to be extant. Whether all these artifacts can be defined as works of art is contested between scholars. [[Alexander Marshack]] argued that the earliest, non-representational incisions on rock mark the beginnings of human art. More cautiously, [[Paul Mellars]] suggests that the relative rarity of these works means they cannot be seen as integral to early human society and evidence of an artistic culture.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", in G. Berghaus, ed., ''New Perspectives on Prehistoric Art'' (London: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), {{ISBN|0-2759-7813-3}}, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Renfrew]] has pointed out the dangers of applying modern values of art to past societies and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;R. Bradley, ''Image and Audience: Rethinking Prehistoric Art'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-1915-6955-0}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Günter Berghaus argues that these works have often been approached with a set of post-Renaissance aesthetic values that distinguish between artists and craftsman and art and artifact, although these categories are not universal and may be inappropriate for understanding prehistoric society.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan Garrow has pointed to the difficulties of the modern distinction drawn between form and decoration. The emphasis in studies of prehistoric art tend to be placed on decoration in objects such as ceramics and ignores the importance of form, found in objects such as weapons.&lt;ref&gt;N. Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", in D. Garrow, ed., ''Rethinking Celtic Art'' (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2008), {{ISBN|1-7829-7821-6}}, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many meanings have been suggested for the advent and nature of prehistoric art. It may have helped develop human solidarity in its early stages. Open air [[rock art]] may have acted as signposts for the route of animal migrations. Cave art may have had a ritual role in [[initiation ceremony|rites of initiation]], [[vision quests]] or [[totemic]] ceremonies. Portable objects may have acted as [[notation]] systems and [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] figures may have had a role in religious rituals. However, most artifacts can only be understood in their context, which is often lost or poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;G. Berghaus, "The discovery and study of prehistoric art", p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The decorations include sworls, circular shapes and wavy lines.|An example of a carved stone ball from Towie in Aberdeenshire, dated from 3200–2500 BCE]]
Scotland was occupied by [[Mesolithic]] hunter-gatherers from around 8500 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7992300.stm |title=Signs of Earliest Scots Unearthed |publisher=BBC News |date=9 April 2009 |accessdate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers.&lt;ref&gt;P.

Maxwell, "A History of Scotland’s Masonry Construction" in P. Wilson, ed., ''Building with Scottish Stone'' (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), {{ISBN|1-904320-02-3}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers also introduced [[chambered cairn]] tombs, as at [[Maeshowe]],&lt;ref name=Fry&amp;Fry1992p7&gt;F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, ''The History of Scotland'' (London: Routledge, 1992), {{ISBN|0-7100-9001-3}}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and the many standing stones and circles such as those at [[Standing Stones of Stenness|Stenness]] on the mainland of Orkney, which dates from about 3100 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;C. Wickham-Jones, ''Orkney: A Historical Guide'' (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2007), {{ISBN|0-8579-0591-0}}, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and similar stones to which are found across Europe from about the same time.&lt;ref&gt;F. Lynch, ''Megalithic Tombs and Long Barrows in Britain'' (Bodley: Osprey, 1997), {{ISBN|0-7478-0341-2}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no surviving art from the Mesolithic period in Scotland, probably because the mobile peoples of the period would have made this on perishable organic items.&lt;ref&gt;G. Warren, ''Mesolithic Lives in Scotland'' (Tempus, 2005), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the oldest surviving [[portable art|portable visual art]] from Scotland are carved stone balls, or [[petrosphere]]s, that date from the late Neolithic era. They are a uniquely Scottish phenomenon, with over 425 known examples. Most are from modern Aberdeenshire,&lt;ref name=Towie&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/000-100-033-206-C "Carved stone ball found at Towie, Aberdeenshire"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but a handful of examples are known from [[Iona]], [[Skye]], [[Harris, Outer Hebrides|Harris]], [[Uist]], [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], [[Isle of Arran|Arran]], [[Hawick]], [[Wigtownshire]] and fifteen from [[Orkney]], five of which were found at the Neolithic village of [[Skara Brae]].&lt;ref name="Marshall63"&gt;D. N. Marshall, "Carved Stone Balls", ''Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 108 (1976/77), pp. 62–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many functions have been suggested for these objects, most indicating that they were prestigious and powerful possessions.&lt;ref name=Towie/&gt; Their production may have continued into the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The complex carved circles and spirals on these balls can be seen mirrored in the carving on what was probably a lintel from a chambered cairn at [[Pierowall]] on [[Westray]], Orkney, which seem to be part of the same culture that produced carvings at [[Newgrange]] in Ireland.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, elaborately carved [[Mace (bludgeon)|maceheads]] are often found in burial sites, like that found at Airdens in Sutherland, which has a pattern of interlocking diamond-shaped facets, similar to those found across Neolithic Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000pp10-11/&gt;

Pottery appeared in the Neolithic period once hunters and gatherers transitioned to a sedentary lifestyle, until then they needed to use lightweight, mobile containers.&lt;ref name=Bahn1997p100&gt;P.

Ritchie, "The First Settlers", in C. Renfrew, ed., ''The Prehistory of Orkney BC 4000–1000 AD'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0-85224-456-8}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical are elegant and distinctive shallow bowls with a band of grooved patterning below the rim,&lt;ref&gt;A. Henshall, "The Chambered Cairns", in C. Renfrew, ed., ''The Prehistory of Orkney BC 4000–1000 AD'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1985), {{ISBN|0-85224-456-8}}. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; using a technique known as "stab-and-drag". A second variation consists of undecorated, round-bottomed bowls.&lt;ref&gt;L. Laing, ''Orkney and Shetland: An Archaeological Guide'' (Newton Abbott: David and Charles Ltd, 1974), {{ISBN|0-7153-6305-0}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Unstan ware is mostly found in tombs, specifically tombs of the Orkney-Cromarty type,&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, "The Chambered Cairns", p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; that include the so-called [[Tomb of the Eagles]] at Isbister on [[South Ronaldsay]], and Taversoe Tuick and [[Midhowe Chambered Cairn|Midhowe]] on [[Rousay]], but has occasionally been found outside of tombs, as at the farmstead of [[Knap of Howar]] on [[Papa Westray]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Ritchie, ''Prehistoric Orkney'' (London: B.T. Batsford Ltd, 1995), {{ISBN|0-7134-7593-5}}, pp. 52 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt; There are scattered occurrences of Unstan ware on the Scottish Mainland, as at [[Balbridie]],&lt;ref&gt;N. Reynolds, and I. Ralston, ''Balbridie, Discovery and Excavation in Scotland 1979'' (Edinburgh: Council for British Archaeology: Scottish Regional Group, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Western Isles]], as at [[Eilean Domhnuill]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Henshall, ''The Chambered Tombs of Scotland Vol. 2'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press. 1979), p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Unstan ware may have evolved into the later [[grooved ware]] style,&lt;ref&gt;D. V. Clarke, "Rinyo and the Orcadian Neolithic", in A. O'Connor and D. V. Clarke, eds, ''From the Stone Age to the 'Forty Five: Studies presented to R. B. K. Stevenson'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1983), {{ISBN|0-8597-6046-4}}, pp. 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt; associated with the builders of the [[Maeshowe]] class of chambered tomb, which began on Orkney early in the third millennium BCE, and was soon adopted throughout Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Hedges, ''Tomb of the Eagles: Death and Life in a Stone Age Tribe'' (New York: New Amsterdam, 1985), {{ISBN|0-941533-05-0}}, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Grooved ware vessels are often highly decorated and flat bottomed, often with patterns similar to those on petrospheres and  carved maceheads.&lt;ref&gt;G. Noble, ''Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-7486-2337-X}}, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Westray Wife]], a lozenge-shaped figurine that is believed to be the earliest representation of a human face found in Scotland, was discovered at the site of a Neolithic village at [[Links of Noltland]] near Grobust Bay on the north coast of Westray. The figurine's face has two dots for eyes, heavy brows and an oblong nose and a pattern of hatches on the body could represent clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Urquhart |first=Frank |date=21 August 2009 |title=Face to face with the 5,000-year-old 'first Scot' |location=Edinburgh |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/Face-to-face-with-the.5575575.jp |accessdate=22 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two figurines were subsequently found at the site in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first= |date=28 August 2012 |title=Third 5,000-year-old figurine found at Orkney dig |location= |publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19397929|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bronze Age began in Scotland about 2000 BCE as new techniques of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued.&lt;ref&gt;C. Scarre, ''Monuments and Landscape in Atlantic Europe: Perception and Society during the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age'' (New York: Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|0-4152-7314-5}}, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; There was probably a fall in population in this period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London. Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-5002-8795-3}}, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of cellular round houses of stone on Shetland&lt;ref name=Cunliffe2004p60&gt;B. Cunliffe, ''Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest ''(New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|0-4153-4779-3}}, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; and wooden [[crannog]]s, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands.&lt;ref&gt;N. Dixon ''The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology'' (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), {{ISBN|0-7524-3151-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As elsewhere in Europe, [[hill forts]] were first introduced in this period.&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames &amp; Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-5002-8795-3}}, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

From this period there are extensive examples of rock art. These include [[cup and ring mark]]s, a central depression carved into stone, surrounded by rings, sometimes not completed. These are common elsewhere in Atlantic Europe and have been found on natural rocks and isolated stones across Scotland. The most elaborate sets of markings are in western Scotland, particularly in the [[Kilmartin]] district. The representations of an axe and a boat at the Ri Cruin Cairn in [[Kilmartin Glen|Kilmartin]], and a boat pecked into [[Wemyss Bay|Wemyss Cave]], are probably the oldest two-dimensional representations of real objects that survive in Scotland. Similar carved spirals have also been found on the cover stones of burial [[cist]]s in [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Kincardine]].&lt;ref&gt;V. G. Childe, ''The Prehistory Of Scotland'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1935), p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also elaborate carved stone [[battle-axe]]s found in East Lothian, Aberdenshire and Lanarkshire. These show little sign of use or wear, and so, rather than being practical objects, may be symbolic representations of power.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Forteviot Bronze Age tomb|site at Forteviot]], in Perthshire, produced a unique warrior burial under a giant sandstone slab. The slab is engraved with a spiral and has an axehead pecked into the underside, and underneath there are grave goods of a copper dagger with leather scabbard and a carved wooden bowl.&lt;ref&gt;N.

Surviving metalwork includes personal items like the [[gold lunula]] or neckplates found at Auchentaggart in Dumfriesshire and Southside, Lanarkshire, which date from about 2000 BCE and are similar to those found in relatively large numbers in Ireland, but also with examples across Great Britain and in Portugal.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13&lt;ref&gt;[http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-527-C&amp;scache=3tl8ga9bi2&amp;searchdb=scran "Collar from Southside, Lanarkshire], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jet (lignite)|Jet]] beaded necklaces strung in a crescent shape have been found at sites including Poltalloch and Melfort in Argyll and [[Aberlemno]] in Angus.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p13/&gt;

Sophisticated pottery with impressed designs was found in Scotland during the Bronze Age. One example is a decorated grave food vessel dated from about 1000 BCE that was found at a [[Kincardineshire]] grave group. Two bronze armlets were also found at the site.&lt;ref name=Bahn1997p100/&gt;

The Iron Age began in Scotland from about the seventh century BCE. From this point there are the first finds of iron artifacts in hoards that are consistent containing other items that are consistent with Bronze Age practice. there is also evidence of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouses]] and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit and I. B. M. Ralston, "The Iron Age", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the early part of the period there is relatively little metalwork and a larger amount of ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Sharples, "Comment I. Contextualising Iron Age art", p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The assemblage of early Iron Age ceramics from Atlantic Scotland is large compared with the rest of Britain. There are a wide variety of forms and styles, some which resemble those of southern Britain, particularly those with incised geometric ornament.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this period Scotland had been penetrated by the wider [[La Tène]] culture, which is named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;R. G. Collingwood and J. N. L. Myres, ''Roman, Britain and the English Settlements'' (New York, NY: Biblo &amp; Tannen, 2nd edn., 1936), {{ISBN|978-0-8196-1160-4}}, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] are perhaps the most impressive of the relatively few finds of La Tène decoration from Scotland, and indicate links with Ireland and southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;J. Neil, G. Ritchie and A. Ritchie, ''Scotland, Archaeology and Early History,'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2nd end., 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0291-7}}, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stirling torcs]], found in 2009, are a group of four gold [[torc]]s in different styles, dating from 300 BCE and 100 BCE. Two demonstrate common styles found in Scotland and Ireland, but the other two indicate workmanship from what is now southern France, and the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] worlds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/our_museums/national_museum/past_exhibitions/iron_age_gold.aspx "Iron Age Gold"], ''National Museums of Scotland'', retrieved 14 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are surviving ring-headed pins, which were probably made locally and not imported, and appear to be part of a British and Irish type that was not part of the La Tène culture. There are also spiral finger rings, glass beads and long-handled combs, which are found across Britain, but have local characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Harding, ''The Iron Age in Northern Britain: Celts and Romans, Natives and Invaders'' (London: Routledge, 2004), {{ISBN|1-1344-1787-X}}, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; The bronze [[Stichill]] collar is a large engraved necklace, fastened at the back with a pin. The [[Mortonhall]] [[scabbard]], probably from the first century CE, is elaborately decorated with trumpet curves and "S"-scrolls. Further north there are finds of massive bronze armlets, often with enamelled decoration, like the ones found at [[Culbin Sands]], Moray.&lt;ref&gt;R. Megaw and J. V. S. Megaw, ''Early Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland'' (Bodley: Osprey, 2nd edn., 2008), {{ISBN|0-7478-0613-6}}, pp. 72–4.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most impressive items from this period is the boars head fragment of the Deskford [[carnyx]], a war-trumpet from [[Deskford]] in Banffshire, probably dating from the first century CE. Similar instruments are mentioned in Roman sources and depicted on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]] found in Denmark.&lt;ref name=MacDonald2000p16&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In stone carving there are a number of simple stone heads from Scotland, like that found at [[Coupar Angus]] in Perthshire, that may date from the Iron Age. They are similar to those found across Great Britain and Ireland, although they are difficult to date and may have been made much later.&lt;ref&gt;I. Armit, ''Headhunting and the Body in Iron Age Europe'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012), {{ISBN|0-5218-7756-3}}, pp. 34–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman influence==

[[File:Cramond Lioness.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cramond Lioness]] found near the Roman base of [[Cramond Roman Fort]] near Edinburgh, which was occupied in the second century CE]]
The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation was limited to the [[Southern Uplands]] and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] and [[Solway Firth]].&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hanson, "The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as [[Hadrian's Wall]] from coast to coast.&lt;ref name=Antoninewall&gt;[http://www.antoninewall.org/history.php "History"], ''antoninewall.org'', retrieved 25 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new ''[[limes]]'' between the Firth of Forth and the [[Firth of Clyde]], where they built the fortification known as the [[Antonine Wall]]. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall,&lt;ref name=Antoninewall /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Breeze, ''The Antonine Wall'' (Edinburgh: John Donald, 2006), {{ISBN|0-85976-655-1}}, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Moffat, ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), {{ISBN|0-500-28795-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;297–301.&lt;/ref&gt; until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Hanson, "The Roman presence: brief interludes", in K. J. Edwards and I. B. M. Ralston, eds, ''Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC – AD 1000'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2003), {{ISBN|0-7486-1736-1}}, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antonine Wall and its associated forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and [[Apollo]]. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house in the shape of a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess [[Fortuna]], both found at [[Bearsden]] Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in their style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gla.ac.uk/hunterian/collections/permanentdisplays/theantoninewall/theantoninewallslideshow/#d.en.219761 The Antonine Wall: Rome's Final Frontier: Slideshow], ''Glasgow University, The Hunterian'', retrieved 19 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Away from the wall, Roman sculptures include the marble head of a Roman emperor or general, broken from a larger statue, which was found at [[Hawkshaw, Scottish Borders|Hawkshaw]], Peebleshire in the late eighteenth century. It dates to the second century CE and may have been looted from a Roman monument further to the south.&lt;ref&gt;L. J. F. Keppie, ''Scotland's Roman Remains: an Introduction and Handbook'' (John Donald, 2nd edn., 1998), {{ISBN|0-8597-6157-6}}, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cramond Lioness]] is a sculpture, probably imported, of a lioness devouring a bound prisoner, found near the Roman base of [[Cramond Roman Fort]] near Edinburgh. A [[relief]] of the goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]] found near Birrens in [[Dumfriesshire]], combines elements of native and classical art.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0-5002-0333-4}}, pp. 16–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Newstead Helmet]], found at the Roman fort in Newstead, near Melrose in Roxburghshire, is one of the most impressive of many finds of Roman arms and armour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Parade helmet and face mask | url=http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-815-C&amp;scache=6r7o44xpxl&amp;searchdb=scran | publisher=[[National Museums Scotland]] | accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Staffordshire Moorlands Pan]] is a second-century Romano-British ''[[trulla]]'' apparently decorated as a souvenir for a soldier who had served on Hadrian's Wall, and probably made locally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1577008&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=enamelled+pan&amp;fromDate=1&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toDate=300&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 "The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan"], ''British Museum'', retrieved 28 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of items were also found in the Sculptor's Cave, Coversea in Morayshire, including Roman pottery, rings, bracelets, needles and coins, some of which had been re-used for ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/16278/details/sculptor+s+cave+covesea/ "Site Record for Sculptor's Cave Covesea"], ''Historic Commission on the Ancient and Historic Monuments of Scotland'', retrieved 4 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LogoRAI.png|thumb]]
'''Russian Abstract Art Foundation''' is a noncommercial organization, formed for supporting cultural, educational and social initiatives. The Foundation’s mission is to form correct academic and historical understanding of Russian abstract art in the global context.

== Collection ==
The collection of the '''Foundation''' is based on creative work by members of [[Студия Новая реальность|The New Reality artistic group]], as well as on vast archival material, connected with their art, the Foundation aims at defining and demonstrating the place of this group in particular, and Russian abstraction in general, in the evolvement line of history of art.&lt;ref&gt;http://ruabstract.com/artists&lt;/ref&gt; Foundation is focusing on the artists, who were attending Studio for a long time and formed the very core of it, such as Ely Beliutin, Vladislav Zubarev, Lutsian Gribkov, Vera Preobrazhenskaya, Tamara Ter-Gevondyan, Anatoly Safokhin, Svetlana Nekrasova, Elena Radkevich, Alexander Krukov. The  New Reality Studio was a group of [[abstract art|abstract]] artists, it emerged at end the 1950s and had been existing until the death of their leader Ely Beliutin in 2012. Their aim was the revival and natural development of the [[Russian avant-garde]] and [[abstract art]] of 1920s. Abstract art, having started with works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], did not get development in Russia, and for almost 30 years was excluded from professional vocabulary, but, in spite of this, gained a powerful momentum in the West.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/exhibits/origins-of-the-russian-avant-garde,1080034.html&lt;/ref&gt; Works by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], Larionov, Lisitsky, [[Alexander Rodchenko]] illustrate these artists’ unique experiments with color, shape, space, but, first and foremost, they vividly reflected changing social identities, that is, fulfilled the main purpose of art.

[[Ely Bielutin]] made it his mission to create truly [[contemporary art]], and as a result of his activities, aspired to found a new Academy of Arts. This makes members of his group followers of the early 20th century masters not only from the formal-stylistic point of view, but ideologically as well. That is why their intellectual and creative heritage is indispensable for understanding evolvement of any innovative idea in art.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/culture/8006418/Documentary-on-forbidden-Russian-avant-garde-art-The-Desert-of-Forbidden-Art.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation’s Mission ==
Studies of the system of interaction with artists, devised by Ely  Bielutin and his disciple Vladislav Zubarev, and analysis of Bielutin’s theory of common ability to contact and Zubarev’s theory of temporal art demonstrated that these methods are universal and can be used working with people of various occupations, not only of creative professions. The Foundation developed an educational program based on these theories that includes lectures and workshops, and is being prepared for introduction into Russian higher education institutions.

To realize its goals the Foundation plans to engage into intensive educational activities, including cooperation with Russian and foreign non-profit and academic organizations, public-owned and private museums.

The Foundation’s activities are not limited to collaborating with acknowledged masters, but are oriented towards engaging young artists who dedicate their art to current issues and search for new creative forms. The second goal of the Foundation is to adapt and integrate new methods into educational process in order to help develop original creative thinking in students.&lt;ref&gt;http://ruabstract.com/content/mission{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9361">'''Social justice art''', and [[art]]s for social justice, encompasses a wide range of visual and [[Performing arts|performing art]] that aim to raise [[critical consciousness]], build community, and motivate individuals to promote [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Lee|author2=Desai Dipti |title=Imagining Otherwise: Connecting the Arts and Social Justice to Envision an Act for Change: Special Issue Introduction|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=287–295|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.591672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been used as a means to record history, shape culture, cultivate imagination, and harness individual and [[social transformation]]. It can not only be a means to generate awareness, but it can also be a catalyst to engage community members to take action around a social issue.  '''Social justice art''' consequently allows people to develop [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to interrupt and alter [[Oppression|oppressive]] systemic patterns or individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes by which people create and engage with art equips them with analytic tools to understand and challenge [[Social justice|social injustices]] through [[Teaching for social justice|social justice education]] (teaching for social justice), [[community building]], and social [[activism]]/[[social movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Rosemarie|title=Facing and Transforming Hauntings of Race Through the Arts|journal=Equity and Excellence in education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=330–347|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.591260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of visual and performing social justice art includes: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[murals]], [[graffiti]], [[film]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[spoken word]], etc. [[File:Filipino Community Mural.jpg|thumb|Filipino Community Mural]]

==Background==
Art has played a role in social justice education, community building, and social [[activism]]/[[social movement]]s.  It provides a universal language that gives voice to individuals and communities and is accessible across social boundaries.  These examples can overlap and are not strictly confined to one specific category.

==History==
Two well-known [[art movements]] that have utilized art as a means to work towards social justice are the [[Black Arts Movement]] and [[Chicano art movement]].  Both movements began to enter into public consciousness during the 1960s.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in combination with the [[Black Power Movement]] helped to propel the Black Arts Movement.  One of the main goals of this movement was to support [[Black Nationalism]] and [[Community mobilization|mobilize the community]] towards [[Social Action|social action]].  This period produced an increase in Black poetry, [[African-American literature|literature]], and [[African-American music|music]].  A few key figures of the movement were; author [[Marcus Garvey]], author and artist [[Charles S. Johnson]], revolutionary artist [[Emory Douglas]], and social dancer and choreographer Katrina Hazzard-Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Tony|title=Literary Garveyism: Garvey, Black Arts, and the Harlem Renaissance|year=1983|publisher=The Majority Press|location=Dover, Massachusetts|isbn=0-912469-00-5|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The efforts to incorporate post-[[Mexican Revolution]] notions with current [[Mexican American]] social, political, and cultural issues drove the Chicana/Chicano Arts Movement. [[Murals]] are a form of [[visual art]] that experienced a rise in popularity during this movement.  Chicana/Chicano mural art became a means of working towards political goals, challenging [[stereotype]]s, as well as a way for community members to play an active role in creating community [[memoir]]s.  [[Diego Rivera]] was one prominent figure who helped to establish [[Mexican muralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicanoart.org The Road to Mictlan|url=http://www.chicanoart.org/dia05.html|work=Webpage|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals]]

===Social justice education===
An educational approach that focuses on fostering awareness of social injustices and how [[Social inequality|inequalities]] impact youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Curkovic|title=Art and Social Justice Education Part 1|url=http://frankcurkovic.edublogs.org/2012/07/19/art-social-justice-education-part-1/|work=blog|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice education saw its roots in the ideas of [[Paulo Freire]], author of [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]. In his work, Freire highlights the theoretical ideas of [[critical pedagogy]], which is an approach that combines education and [[critical theory]]. This approach is relevant to social justice art education because it combines the critique of social injustices and the use of art as a mechanism to engage with social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=Elizabeth|title=Social Justice and Art Education|journal=Visual Arts Research|year=2004|volume=30|series=59|issue=2|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culturally relevant arts education ====
Culturally relevant arts education (CRAE) is an education model that emerged from Tubman Theater Project.  The theater project is a culturally relevant [[drama]] program in which African American middle and high school students examine their [[internalized oppression]] and work to create positive racial [[Racial identity|identities]].  The program gives them the opportunity to learn from rehearsing and performing plays based on their lived experiences. This framework incorporates six different [[pedagogies]].  Three of these are art related; arts production, [[aesthetics]], and [[arts integration]] as well as three non-art related; [[multicultural education]], [[critical pedagogy]], and contextual teaching and learning.  CRAE engages both students and educators in a process in which they reflect on their social position in societal liberation and [[Subjugate|subjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice art in higher education===
Universities have employed social justice art education models within the art department.

:[[University of Michigan]] - The Prison Creative Arts Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community building===
Sense of community is built through bridging geographic or interest-driven relationships.  Building community helps individuals come together to challenge inner oppressive dynamics that have been imposed by [[institution]]s, structures and bodies.  These inner oppressive dynamics have been termed “social ghosts” have been referenced in dance literature and function as a key theme within many community building art projects.  Art for community building is a collective effort in which the art making process strengthens community ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=Pamela |title=Hand-in Hand, Building Community on Common Ground|journal=Art Education|date=November 2010|volume=63|issue=6|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Arts''' is an American [[501 (c) (3)]] [[not-for-profit]] arts organization focused on furthering cultural communication between [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. It was established in 1981, and is located in the [[East Village, Chicago|East Village]], what is considered to be one of Chicago's more artistic communities along [[Milwaukee Avenue (Chicago)|Milwaukee Avenue]] in the heart of the old [[Polish Downtown]]. The organization is best known for organizing the [[Chicago International Documentary Festival]].

==Building==
The structure housing the Society was originally designed as a neighborhood bank by the architectural firm of Whitney &amp; Williams. It was built in 1920, and purchased along with adjacent lots for the Society in December 1993. It was officially opened on November 3, 1994. The Society currently operates two galleries within the building, with exhibits ranging from painting, sculpture, graphics and photography to three-dimensional installations, as well as gallery talks, workshops and lectures by visiting artists and scholars.

[[File:CircleN.svg|thumb|right|125px|The international squatters' symbol.]]
{{Anarchism sidebar |Theory}}

'''Squatting''' is the action of occupying an abandoned or unoccupied area of land or a [[building]], usually residential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Chris |last=Roberts |title=Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme |location= |publisher=Thorndike Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-7862-8517-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the '''squatter''' does not [[Land ownership and tenure|own, rent or otherwise have lawful permission to use]].

Author [[Robert Neuwirth]] suggested in 2004 that there were one billion squatters globally.&lt;ref name="neuwirth"&gt;{{Citation |last=Neuwirth |first=R. |year=2004 |title=Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters, A New Urban World |location= |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-93319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, according to Kesia Reeve, "squatting is largely absent from policy and academic debate and is rarely conceptualised, as a problem, as a symptom, or as a social or housing movement."&lt;ref name="Housing and Social Policy"&gt;{{Citation |last=Reeve |first=Kesia |chapter=Squatting Since 1945: The enduring relevance of material need |pages=197–216 |title=Housing and Social Policy |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Somerville |editor2-first=Nigel |editor2-last=Sprigings |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=0-415-28366-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Squatting can be related to political movements, such as [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Autonomism|autonomist]], or [[Socialism|socialist]].&lt;ref name="Squatters occupy building near Buckingham Palace to 'stick two fingers up to Queen'"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/568015/Admiralty-Arch-squatters-anarchists-occupy-Buckingham-Palace-Russell-Brand |last=Barnett |first=Helen |title=Squatters occupy building near Buckingham Palace to 'stick two fingers up to Queen' |publisher=express.co.uk |date=April 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a means to [[Architectural conservation|conserve buildings]] or simply to provide affordable housing.

==Overview==

===Worldwide===
In many of the world's poorer countries, there are extensive [[slum]]s or [[shanty town]]s, typically built on the edges of major [[City|cities]] and consisting almost entirely of self-constructed housing built without the landowner's permission. While these settlements may, in time, grow to become both legalised and indistinguishable from normal residential neighbourhoods, they start off as squats with minimal basic infrastructure. Thus, there is no [[sewerage]] system, [[drinking water]] must be bought from vendors or carried from a nearby tap, and if there is electricity, it is stolen from a passing cable.

During the [[Great Recession]] and increased housing [[foreclosure]]s in the late 2000s, squatting became far more prevalent in Western, developed nations.&lt;ref name="Homesteaders in the Hood"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2214544/ |last=Peñalver |first=Eduardo M. |title=Homesteaders in the Hood |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being residences, some squats are used as [[Social center|social centres]] or host [[give-away shop]]s, [[pirate radio]] stations or cafés. In [[Spanish language|Spanish-speaking]] countries, squatters receive several names, such as ''okupas'' in [[Spain]], [[Chile]] or [[Argentina]] (from the verb ''ocupar'' meaning "to occupy"), or ''paracaidistas'' in [[Mexico]] (meaning "parachuters", because they "parachute" themselves at unoccupied land).

===Typology===
Dutch sociologist Hans Pruijt separates types of squatters into five distinct categories:
&lt;ref name="pruijt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/25656 |last=Pruijt |first=Hans |title='Squatting in Europe' |publisher=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Deprivation-based – i.e., homeless people squatting for housing need
# An alternative housing strategy – e.g., people unprepared to wait on municipal lists to be housed take direct action 
# Entrepreneurial – e.g., people breaking into buildings to service the need of a community for cheap bars, clubs etc.
# Conservational – i.e., preserving monuments because the authorities have let them decay
# Political – e.g., activists squatting buildings as protests or to make social centres

===Legality===
In many countries, squatting is in itself a [[crime]]; in others, it is only seen as a [[private law|civil conflict]] between the owner and the occupants. [[Property law]] and the [[State (polity)|state]] have traditionally favored the property owner. However, in many cases where squatters had ''[[de facto]]'' ownership, laws have been changed to legitimize their status. Squatters often claim rights over the spaces they have squatted by virtue of occupation, rather than ownership; in this sense, squatting is similar to (and potentially a necessary condition of) [[adverse possession]], by which a possessor of [[real property]] without [[Title (property)|title]] may eventually gain legal title to the real property.

[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] comments: "Squatting is the oldest mode of tenure in the world, and we are all descended from squatters. This is as true of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] [of the [[United Kingdom]]] with her {{convert|176000|acre|km2}} as it is of the 54 percent of householders in Britain who are owner-occupiers. They are all the ultimate recipients of stolen land, for to regard our planet as a commodity offends every conceivable principle of natural rights."&lt;ref&gt;Ed. Wates and Wolmar (1980) ''Squatting: The Real Story'' (Bay Leaf Books) {{ISBN|0-9507259-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have a different view. UK [[police]] official Sue Williams, for example, has stated that "Squatting is linked to [[Anti-social behaviour|Anti-Social Behaviour]] and can cause a great deal of nuisance and distress to local residents. In some cases there may also be criminal activities involved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Statement from Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Williams, Borough Commander and Chair of the Community Safety Partnership |url=http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |publisher=London Borough of Redbridge |date=2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516065913/http://www2.redbridge.gov.uk/cms/council_tax_benefits_housing/housing/strategy_and_development/empty_properties/police_statement_on_squatting.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-16 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptions===
The public attitude toward squatting varies, depending on legal aspects, socioeconomic conditions, and the type of housing occupied by squatters. In particular, while squatting of municipal buildings may be treated leniently, squatting of private property often leads to strong negative reaction on the part of the public and authorities.&lt;ref name="Squatting: The need for shelter versus property rights"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-15776450 |last=Elms |first=Robert |title=Squatting: The need for shelter versus property rights |publisher=BBC |date=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squatting, when done in a positive and progressive manner, can be viewed as a way to reduce crime and vandalism to vacant properties, depending on the squatter's ability and willingness to conform to certain socioeconomic norms of the community in which they reside. Moreover, squatters can contribute to the maintenance or upgrading of sites that would otherwise be left unattended, the neglect of which would create (and has created) abandoned, dilapidated and decaying neighborhoods within certain sections of moderately to highly urbanized cities or [[borough]]s, one such example being New York City's [[Lower East Side|Lower Manhattan]] from roughly the 1970s to the [[9/11|post-9/11]] era of the [[New Millennium]].&lt;ref name="Defining Squatter Settlements"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gdrc.org/uem/define-squatter.html |last=Srinivas |first=Hari |title=Squatting: Defining Squatter Settlements |publisher=gdrc.org |access-date=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adverse possession===
[[Adverse possession]] is a method of acquiring title to property through possession for a statutory period under certain conditions. Countries where this principle exists include England and the United States, based on common law. However, some non-common law jurisdictions have laws similar to adverse possession. For example, Louisiana has a legal doctrine called acquisitive prescription, which is derived from French law.

==Africa==
There are large squatter communities in [[Kenya]], such as [[Kibera]] in [[Nairobi]].

An estimated 1,000 people live in the [[Grande Hotel Beira]] in [[Mozambique]].

The [[Zabbaleen]] settlement and the [[City of the Dead (slum)|City of the Dead]] are both well-known squatter communities in [[Cairo]].

In [[South Africa]], squatters tend to live in informal settlements or squatter camps on the outskirts of the larger cities, often but not always near [[township (South Africa)|townships]]. In the mid-1990s, an estimated 7.7 million South Africans lived in informal settlements: a fifth of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Saff |first1=Grant |title=Claiming a Space in a Changing South Africa: The 'Squatters' of Marconi Beam, Cape Town |journal=[[Annals of the Association of American Geographers]] |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=235–255 |date=1996 |doi=10.2307/2564004 |issn=0004-5608 |jstor=2564004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number has grown rapidly in the post-apartheid era. Many buildings, particularly in the [[inner city]] of [[Johannesburg]] have also been occupied by squatters. Property owners or government authorities can usually evict squatters after following certain legal procedures including requesting a court order. In [[Durban]], the city council routinely evicts without a court order in defiance of the law, and there has been sustained conflict between the city council and a shack dwellers' movement known as [[Abahlali baseMjondolo]]. There has been a number of similar conflicts between shack dwellers, some linked with the [[Western Cape Anti-Eviction Campaign]], and the city council in [[Cape Town]]. One of the most high-profile cases was the brutal evictions of squatters in the [[N2 Gateway]] homes in the suburb of [[Delft, Cape Town|Delft]], where over 20 residents were shot, including a three-year-old child. There have been numerous complaints about the legality of the government's actions and, in particular, whether the ruling of the judge was unfair given his party affiliations and the highly politicized nature of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westerncapeantieviction.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/joeslovo_delft-leggasick.pdf |title=Western Cape Housing Crisis: Writings on Joe Slovo and Delft |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the families are now squatting on [[Symphony Way]], a main road in the township of Delft. The City of Cape Town has been threatening them with eviction since February 2008.

==Asia==

===India===
[[File:Street dwellers in Mumbai.jpeg|thumb|left|Street dwellers in Mumbai]]

{{See also|Illegal housing in India}}

In [[Mumbai]], there are an estimated 10 to 12 million inhabitants, and six million of them are squatters. The squatters live in a variety of ways. Some possess two- or three-story homes built out of brick and concrete which they have inhabited for years. [[Geeta Nagar]] is a squatter village based beside the [[Indian Navy]] compound at [[Colaba]]. Squatter Colony in [[Malad|Malad East]] has existed since 1962, and now, people living there pay a rent to the city council of 100 rupees a month. [[Dharavi]] is a community of one million squatters. The stores and factories situated there are mainly illegal and so are unregulated, but it is suggested that they do over $1 million in business every day.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, R (2004) ''Shadow Cities: A Billion Squatters, A New Urban World'', pp. 110–14. Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-93319-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other squatters live in shacks, situated literally on a pavement next to the road, with very few possessions.

Activists such as [[Jockin Arputham]] are working for better living conditions for slum dwellers.

===Malaysia===
Many of Malaysia's squatters live on land owned by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], most notably railway reserve land along railway tracks, as well as at construction sites.

===Philippines===
Squatting is a major issue in the Philippines especially but not exclusively in urban areas of the Philippines. Squatting gained notice right after [[World War II]], when people whose homes were destroyed by war were left homeless. They built makeshift houses called "barong-barong" on abandoned private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Manila#ref360828 |title=Manila {{!}} national capital, Philippines|newspaper=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 20th century, the squatter population largely grew but the Philippine government has made separate attempts over the years to transfer some squatters to low-cost housing projects, such as projects in [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]] (in the former [[Smokey Mountain]] [[landfill]]), [[Taguig]] (BLISS Housing Project), and [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]], [[Rizal]].

Philippine law, and society more generally, distinguishes between squatters who squat because of poverty and "professional squatters" who squat in hopes of getting a payment to leave the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title=Republic Act No. 7279 – An Act to Provide for a Comprehensive and Continuing Urban Development and Housing Program, Establish the Mechanism for its Implementation, and for Other Purposes |publisher=Chan Robles Law Library |type=Republic Act |number=7279 |article=I |date=March 24, 1992 |url=http://www.gov.ph/1992/03/24/republic-act-no-7279/ |accessdate=March 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thailand===
Though eviction has reduced their visibility or numbers in urban areas, many squatters still occupy land near railroad tracks, under overpasses, and waterways.  Commercial squatting is common in Thailand, where businesses temporarily seize nearby public real estate (such as sidewalks, roadsides, beaches, etc.) and roll out their enterprise, and at closing time they fold it in and lock it up, thus avoiding the extra cost of having to rent more property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yasmeen |first1=Gisèle |last2=Narumol |first2=Nirathron |title=Vending in Public Space: The Case of Bangkok |journal=WIEGO Policy Brief |date=2014 |issue=16 |pages=13–15 |url=http://www.wiego.org/sites/default/files/publications/files/Yasmeen-Vending-Public-Space-Bangkok-WIEGO-PB16.pdf |accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many [[Europe]]an countries, there are squatted houses used as residences and also larger squatted projects where people pursue social and cultural activities. Examples of the latter include an old [[Leprosy|leper]] hospital outside [[Barcelona]] called [[Can Masdeu]] and a former military barracks called [[Metelkova]] in [[Slovenia]].

Squats can be run on anarchist or communist principles, for example, [[Fabrika Yfanet (Thessaloniki)|Fabrika Yfanet]], [[Villa Amalia (Athens)|Villa Amalia]] in [[Greece]], [[Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus]] in [[Austria]] (has legal status) or [[Blitz (movement)|Blitz]] in [[Norway]] (has legal status). Young people squat buildings to use as concert venues for alternative types of music such as punk and hardcore. The eviction of one such place, [[Ungdomshuset]], in March 2007 received international news coverage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Others have been legalised.

In England and Wales, squatting in a residential building became illegal in September 2012, with a maximum penalty of six months in jail, a £5,000 fine, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19433674 |work=BBC News |title=Squatting becomes criminal act in England and Wales |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Italy]], there is [[Bussana Vecchia, Liguria|Bussana Vecchia]], a [[ghost town]] in [[Liguria]] which was abandoned in 1887 following an [[earthquake]] and subsequently squatted in the 1960s. In [[France]], there is [[Collectif la vieille Valette]], a self-supporting squat village which has been active since 1991.

===Austria===
There was a big squatting movement in the newly formed state of [[Republic of German-Austria|Austria]] following the [[First World War]]. Famine was a significant problem for many people in Austria and the "Siedler" (settler) movement developed as these people tried to create shelter and a source of food for themselves.&lt;ref name=Vossoughian&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vossoughian |first1=Nader |title=Otto Neurath: The Language of the Global Polis |date=2008 |publisher=NAi |location=The Hague |isbn=978-90-5662-350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
[[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]] is an independent community of almost 900 people founded in 1971 on the site of an abandoned military zone. In [[Copenhagen]], as in other European cities such as Berlin and Amsterdam, the squatter movement was large in the 1980s. It was a [[social movement]], providing housing and alternative culture. A flashpoint came in 1986 with the [[Battle of Ryesgade]].

Another flashpoint came in 2007 when [[Ungdomshuset]] was evicted. While not technically a squat until 14 December 2006, it was a social centre used by squatters and people involved in alternative culture more generally. After a year of protests, the city council donated a new building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Politiken]] |language=Danish |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2008-06-30 |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/article532135.ece |title=Aktivister har overtaget nyt ungdomshus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
[[File:Raeumung Topf und Soehne-09.jpg|thumb|Police during eviction of the [[J.A. Topf &amp; Söhne|Topf &amp; Söhne]] squat, 16 April 2009]]
In the 1970s, squatting in West German cities led to "a self-confident urban counterculture with its own infrastructure of newspapers, self-managed collectives and housing cooperatives, feminist groups, and so on, which was prepared to intervene in local and broader politics".&lt;ref&gt;Mayer M ''The Career of Urban Social Movements in West Germany'' in eds Fisher R and Kling J ''Urban Affairs Annual Review'' volume 41 London (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Autonomen]] movement protected squats against eviction and participated in radical direct action.

After the [[German reunification]], many buildings were vacated due to the demise of former state-run enterprises and migration to the western parts of [[Germany]], some of which were then occupied by squatters. In [[Berlin]], the now-legalised squats are in desirable areas such as [[Mitte]] and [[Prenzlauer Berg]]. Before the reunification, squats in Berlin were mostly located in former [[West Berlin]]'s borough of [[Kreuzberg]]. The squats were mainly for residential and social use. Squatting became known by the term ''instandbesetzen'', from ''instandsetzen'' ("renovating") and ''besetzen'' ("occupying").&lt;ref name="pruijt" /&gt;

Squatters moved into the former factory site of [[J.A. Topf &amp; Söhne]] in [[Erfurt]] in April 2001 and remained there until they were evicted by police in April 2009. The firm made crematoria for [[Nazi concentration camps]]. The squatters ran culture programs which drew attention to the history of the company. The occupation was known simply as ''Das Besetzte Haus'' (the occupied house) and was one of the most well known actions of left-radicals of that period in Germany. A book about the occupation was published in 2012, titled ''Topf &amp; Söhne - Besetzung auf einem Täterort'' (Topf &amp; Söhne - Occupation of a crime scene).&lt;ref name=besetz&gt;Meyerbeer, Karl; Späth, Pascal (eds) (2012) ''Topf &amp; Söhne - Besetzung auf einem Täterort''. Heidelberg: Graswurzel-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being illegal, squats exist in many of the larger cities. Examples are [[Au (building)|Au]] in [[Frankfurt]] and [[Hafenstraße]] and [[Rote Flora]] in [[Hamburg]], though the last open squat of Berlin, [[Brunnenstraße183]], was evicted in November 2009.

Squatting can also take place for campaigning purposes, such as the [[Anatopia]] project, which protested against a [[Mercedes-Benz]] test track.

The [[Free nationalists]] movement (Freie Nationale Strukturen) was born from the "right-wing" squattings of the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=brunila&gt;[http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/ei-ole-yhta-aarioikeistoa-keita-suomen-vastarintaliike-kutsui-helsinkiin Ei ole yhtä äärioikeistoa – keitä Suomen vastarintaliike kutsui Helsinkiin?], Mika Brunila, [[Suomen Kuvalehti]], 21 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from December 2012, [[Greek Police]] initiated extensive raids in a number of squats, arresting and charging with offences all illegal occupants (mostly Anarchists). Notable squats like [[Villa Amalia (Athens)|Villa Amalias]] and "Patision &amp; Skaramaga" in Athens, Parartima, Maragopoulio and Nikolaou Gkizi 33 in Patras, Antibiosi in Ioannina, Orfanotrofio in Thessaloniki and other squats have been evicted. Greek Authorities stated their intent to raid and evict all squats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.in.gr/greece/article/?aid=1231229922 |title=Στον ανακριτή ανά ομάδες οι 92 συλληφθέντες από τη βίλα Αμαλίας |work=[[in.gr]] |date=January 10, 2013 |accessdate=2013-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The exact legal position of squatting in Ireland is ambiguous and the mechanisms for removing squatters from properties varies from case to case, sometimes going through the judicial process, other times not. Trespass and occupation of a property is not illegal, but as a definitive process for dealing with squatters does not exist, unlawful evictions do occur,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/courts/circuit-court/three-men-sentenced-over-forced-eviction-for-landlord-1.2129388 |title=Three men sentenced over forced eviction for landlord |publisher=Irish Times |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes with the support of the [[Garda Síochána]] (Irish Police).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.rabble.ie/2015/03/24/grangegorman-resists-eviction/ |title=Grangegorman resists eviction |publisher=Rabble |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However certain 'squatters rights' do exist and can be invoked in the form of adverse possession. An occupant is entitled to legal possession of the title provided they are in continuous and uninterrupted occupation of the property for 12 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Independent Woman |url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/property/squatters-rights-to-be-reviewed-1083837.html |title=Squatters' rights to be reviewed – Property, Unsorted |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2007-09-19 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; To claim adverse possession the occupant must register an intent to claim the property with the [[Land Registry|land registry]].

Squatting has no major tradition in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], arguably in part due to the perceived strong position of the title holder. It has largely been confined to major cities but with the construction of [[Ghost estate]]s across the country there has also been a rise in occupations of residential spaces in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/squatter-told-he-can-stay-in-nama-ghost-estate-home-2907066.html |title=Squatter told he can stay in NAMA ghost estate home – National News |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been major housing movements and periods of squatting in Ireland, including the activities of the [[Dublin Housing Action Committee|Dublin]] and [[Derry Housing Action Committee]]s of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each had a militant campaign which participated in dozens or hundreds of actions and protests in demand of better housing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Anarchist Writers |url=http://struggle.ws/ws/squat48.html |title=The hidden history of squatting in Ireland |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 activists calling themselves 'Autonomous Community Spaces' entered 'Disco Disco' in Dublin's Parnell Square to turn the space in a social centre. They were violently evicted 24 hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ie.indymedia.org/article/60401 |title=Pictures of attack on Squat |location=Ireland |publisher=Ie.indymedia.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2003 to 2004 the Magpie Squat was a residential space which housed activists in Dublin's Upper Leeson Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://struggle.ws/wsm/ws/2004/82/squat.html |title=Squatting in Dublin : Housing is a Right not a Luxury |publisher=Struggle.ws |date= |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also where the first meeting was held for the opening of what would become Dublin's first autonomous social centre [[Seomra Spraoi]].

In 2010 activists from Occupy Cork squatted a Nama Building in Cork city with the intention of using it as a community resource centre. It was vacated shortly after the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://corkcitycentre.wordpress.com/ |title=Cork City Centre: Community Resource Center &amp;#124; Official Webpage |publisher=Corkcitycentre.wordpress.com |date=2012-01-08 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 activists from Occupy Belfast squatted a Bank of Ireland building in Belfast city centre and used it as a social space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jan/16/belfast-occupy-bank-of-ireland |title=Occupy protesters take over former bank in Belfast |publisher=Corkcitycentre.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The occupation lasted several months before it was evicted.

Squatting has seen a recent surge in Dublin city with frequent occupations of spaces. With squatting becoming more public, Dublin hosted the 2014 'International Squatter Convergence', previously held in cities such as Dijon, Berlin and Brighton. Squatting also became popularised by the successful neighbourhood resistance to an attempted eviction of a large community used squatted space in Grangegorman in Dublin city in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/squatter-supporters-hurt-in-grangegorman-stand-off-1.2150573 |title=Squatter Supporters hurt in Grangegorman stand off |publisher=Irish Times |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news of the eviction attempt and eventual successful resistance spread across social media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.thejournal.ie/grangegorman-squatters-2008487-Mar2015/ |title=Grangegorman squatters welcome "victory" as they resist eviction |publisher=The Journal |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and international news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://stream.aljazeera.com/story/201503231341-0024640 |title=Residents resist eviction, clash with police in Dublin suburb |publisher=Al Jazeera |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squatted complex enjoyed widespread support in the area and was also publicly supported by the city's Lord Mayor, [[Christy Burke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/news/lord-mayor-praises-squatters-work-31095501.html |title=Lord Mayor Praises Squatters Work |publisher=Irish Independent |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by  [[Irish Times]] journalist [[Una Mullally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Exambrief |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/poplife/2015/03/24/the-grangegorman-squat/ |title=The Grangegorman Squat |publisher=Irish Times |date= |accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Squatting Graffiti in Rome.jpg|thumb|Squatting symbol appearing as graffiti in Rome]]

In [[Italy]], squatting has no legal basis, but there are many squats used as [[social centre]]s. The first occupations of abandoned buildings began in 1968 with the left-wing movements [[Lotta Continua]] and [[Potere Operaio]]. Out of the breakup of these two movements was born [[Autonomia Operaia]], which was composed of a Marxist–Leninist and Maoist wing and also an anarchist and more libertarian one. These squats had [[Marxist-Leninist]] (but also [[Stalinist]] and [[Maoist]]) ideals and came from the left wing of Autonomia. The militants of the Italian armed struggle (the New [[Red Brigades]]) were connected to these squats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Steve |title=Storming Heaven: Class Composition and Struggle in Italian Autonomous Marxism |publisher=Pluto |ISBN=978-0745316062 |url=https://libcom.org/library/storming-heaven-class-composition-struggle-italian-autonomist-marxism-steve-wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moldova===
Squatting in [[Moldova]] is pretty new, as it started with [[Centro 73]] in [[Chişinău]] in September 2010. This project is working and starts to be known in media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://centro73.wordpress.com/infomedia/ |title=multimedia &amp;#124; centro 73 chişinău |publisher=Centro 73 |date= |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second project of squatting in Chişinău in the old Turkish embassy (57, Alexei Mateevici street), called [[Ada Kaleh]], was evicted by police in November 2010.

===Netherlands===
[[File:Squattingban.svg|thumb|right|150px|Squatting ban sign]]
{{See also|Dutch squatting ban}}

The Dutch use the term ''krakers'' to refer to people who squat houses with the aim of living in them (as opposed to people who break into buildings for the purpose of vandalism or theft).&lt;ref name="pruijt" /&gt;

After 2010, squatting still continues in many cities. There is often a ''kraakspreekuur'' (squatters' consultation hour), at which people planning to squat could get advice from experienced squatters. In Amsterdam, where the squatting community is still large,{{update-inline|date=November 2018}} there are four ''kraakspreekuur'' sessions in different areas of the city, and so-called "wild" squatting (squatting a building without the help of the local group) is not encouraged.&lt;ref name="autogenerated6"&gt;Wiegand E. (2004) ''Trespass at Will: Squatting as Direct Action, Human Right &amp; Justified Theft''. LiP Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still many residential squats in Dutch cities. There are also some squats in the countryside such as a squatted village called [[Ruigoord]] near Amsterdam. [[Fort Pannerden]] (a military fort built in 1869) was evicted on November 8, 2006, by a massive police operation which used military machinery and cost one million [[euro]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news/878312/10/Politie_hervat_ontruiming_Fort_Pannerden.html |title=Politie hervat ontruiming Fort Pannerden |publisher=Nu.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squatters then re-squatted the fort on November 26 and have since made a deal with the local council which owns the fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news/900535/10/Fort_Pannerden_voorlopig_niet_ontruimd.html |title=Fort Pannerden voorlopig niet ontruimd |publisher=Nu.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.nl/nl/2006/12/41302.shtml |title=Fort Pannerden blijft voorlopig |publisher=Indymedia.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal states that the squatters will receive a large piece of land near the fort to start a community in the rural area in between the city of Nijmegen and [[Arnhem]]. In exchange, the fort was handed over to local authorities, who will turn it into a museum, with help provided by the squatters that used to live in Fort Pannerden.

[[File:Het Poortgebouw (west).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Poortgebouw]] in [[Rotterdam]].]]

In the past, squats sometimes went through a process of legalisation. This is the case with the [[Poortgebouw]] in Rotterdam, which was squatted in 1980. In 1982, the inhabitants agreed to pay rent to the city council. The ORKZ (Oude Rooms-Katholieke Ziekenhuis)[[:nl:Oude Rooms Katholieke Ziekenhuis]] in Groningen, squatted in 1979, is an old Roman Catholic hospital, which was declared legal in the 1980s.

Well-known squats include the [[OT301]], Vrankrijk and the Binnenpret in Amsterdam, Anarres in [[Dordrecht]] (evicted in 2009), [[Het Slaakhuis]] in Rotterdam and the [[Landbouwbelang (squat)|Landbouwbelang]] and Villa Vendex in [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tusman|first1=Lee|title=Really Free Culture:Anarchist Communities, Radical Movements and Publis Practices|publisher=Pedia Press|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uauLZBSGcEIC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=villa+vendex+maastricht&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1pimN0x4c8&amp;sig=q29dQe_K6ZZfHXm2rTcnib_RYaU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj924L07OjVAhVC0GMKHbd_DFsQ6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=villa%20vendex%20maastricht&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[De Blauwe Aanslag]] in [[The Hague]] was evicted in 2003.

Squatting gained a legal basis in the Netherlands in 1971, when the Supreme Court ruled that the concept of domestic peace (''huisvrede'') (which means a house cannot be entered without the permission of the current user) also applied to squatters. Since then, the owner of the building must take the squatters to court (or take illegal action) in order to evict them. A law was passed in 1994 which made it illegal to squat a building which was empty for less than one year.&lt;ref name="pruijt2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://repub.eur.nl/pub/466/ |last=Pruijt |first=Hans |year=2003 |title=Is the institutionalization of urban movements inevitable?

There were several moves to ban squatting in the past. In 1978, the Council of Churches launched a protest which scotched the idea. In June 2006, two ministers from the [[Politics of the Netherlands|Dutch government]] ([[Sybilla Dekker]] and [[Piet Hein Donner]]) proposed a plan to make squatting illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news/750453/11/Kraken_wordt_strafbaar.html |title=Kraken wordt strafbaar |publisher=Nu.nl |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other ministers, such as [[Alexander Pechtold]], were not in favor of this plan. Representatives of the four largest Dutch cities wrote a letter stating that it would not be in their interest to ban squatting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nu.nl/news.jsp?n=742490&amp;c=11 |title=Grote steden tegen verbod op kraken |publisher=Nu.nl |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Squatters nationwide made banners and hung them on their squats in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.nl/nl/2006/06/36908.shtml |title=Landelijke spandoekenaktie kraakverbod |publisher=Indymedia.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2010, [[Netherlands Squatting Ban|the squatting ban]] was accepted by both houses of Parliament. Squatting in the Netherlands became illegal and punishable when a decree was sent out that the law would be enforced from the first of October.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/article1384686.ece/Eerste_Kamer_neemt_antikraakwet_aan |title=Eerste Kamer neemt antikraakwet aan – Binnenland |publisher=Volkskrant.nl |date= |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In protest, squatters in [[Amsterdam]] had occupied a former fire department the week before the law began (returning it to the owners control on 30 September) and a riot occurred on 1 October when the police blocked a protest and led a horse charge upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2010/10/464052.html |title=Indymedia Netherlands Squat Ban Riot |publisher=Indymedia.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nijmegen (on 2 October), there was also a riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whatever.squat.net |title=whatever.squat.net |publisher=whatever.squat.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6RGu2ufeKU |title=Squatters demo in Nijmegen |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-10-02 |accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following legal challenges, on October 28, 2011, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands decided that the eviction of a squat can only occur after an intervention of a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dee |first=E.T.C. |date= |title=The Production of Squatters as Folk Devils: Analysis of a Moral Panic that Facilitated the Criminalization of Squatting in the Netherlands |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01639625.2016.1145019 |journal=Deviant Behavior |publisher=Taylor&amp;Francis |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages= |doi=10.1080/01639625.2016.1145019 |access-date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch government assessed the effectiveness of the new law in 2015, releasing a report giving statistics on arrests and convictions between October 2010 and December 2014. During this time period, 529 people have been arrested for the act of occupying derelict buildings in 213 separate incidents. Of the 529 arrests, 210 were found guilty. Of those convicted, 39 people were imprisoned for the new offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnsjournal.org/the-vacancy-crunch-the-current-housing-crisis-in-the-netherlands-and-the-repression-of-squatting/ |title=The vacancy crunch: The current housing crisis in the Netherlands and the repression of squatting |publisher=CNS Blog |date=2016-05-14 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Rozbrat rowerownia.jpg|thumb|right|Rozbrat squat in [[Poznań]]]]
The oldest squat in Poland, Rozbrat, was created in 1994 in [[Poznań]]. Other squats are widespread across the country: [[Poznań]] (Magadan), (Od:Zysk), [[Wrocław]] (Era Kromera – evicted and closed, Centrum Reanimacji Kultury, Wagenburg Breslau), [[Warsaw]] (Syrena, Przychodnia), [[Kraków]] (Wielicka, Carandiru), [[Gdynia]] (Brovary Hills), [[Gliwice]] (Krzyk), [[Częstochowa]] (Elektromadonna), [[Białystok]] (DeCentrum), [[Grudziądz]] (Szach), [[Sosnowiec]] (M9), [[Gdańsk]] (NKS 3-Jan) and [[Ruda Śląska]] (Berza).

===Spain===

Squatting of empty lots with shanty towns became popular in [[Spain]] in the 1960s and 1970s as a result of the shortage of urban accommodation during the [[Urbanization|rural exodus]].
Gradually it was substituted by high-rise blocks (often built quickly and poorly).
It was revived in the mid-1980s during [[La Movida Madrileña]], under the name of the ''okupa'' (an unofficial spelling applied to ''ocupación'') movement, when thousands of illegal squatted buildings were legalized. Influenced by the British [[Leveller]]s, the movement's popularity rose again during the 1990s, once more due to a housing crisis, this time related to the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] and the concomitant urban regeneration. Property [[speculation#Some side effects|speculation]] and house price [[inflation]] continue to catalyze ''okupa'' [[activism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Games Monitor |url=http://www.gamesmonitor.org.uk/node/224 |title=The 'success' of Barcelona |publisher=Gamesmonitor.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ParcGuellOkupas.jpg|thumb|right|Famous ''okupas'' squat near [[Parc Güell]], overlooking Barcelona – the ''Bloques Fantasmas'' close to kasa de la Muntanya]]
[[File:Feminist squat in spain.jpg|thumb|[[Eskalera Karakola]] A feminist squat in Madrid.]]
Related to the [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist movement]], ''okupas'' support the ideal of [[workers' self-management]] and create social centers, such as [[Patio Maravillas]] in Madrid, which carry out various [[grassroots]] activities. The ''okupa'' movement represents a highly politicized form of squatting, so much so that participants often claim they live in squats as a form of political protest first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casa.manifestor.org/static_pages/participants2005.htm#Miguel%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Lopez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310171145/http://www.casa.manifestor.org/static_pages/participants2005.htm#Miguel%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20Lopez |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-03-10 |title=CASA Participants 2005 |publisher=Casa.manifestor.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement is involved in various other social struggles, including the [[alter-globalization]] movement. In 1996, during [[José María Aznar]]'s presidency, the first specific legislation against squatting was passed and became the prelude to many squat evictions. In the barrio of [[Lavapiés]] in [[Madrid]], the [[Eskalera Karakola]] was a [[Feminism|feminist]] self-managed squat, which was active from 1996 to 2005 and participated in the nextGENDERation network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nextgenderation.net/ |title=nextGENDERation network |publisher=Nextgenderation.net |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples are the Escuela Popular de Prosperidad ([[La Prospe]]) o Minuesa.

As of 2007, there were approximately 200 occupied houses in Barcelona. At least 45 of these, as [[Infousurpa]], a collective event calendar, mentions, are used as social and cultural centers – so-called "open houses".&lt;ref&gt;''Infousurpa – Butlleti setmanal de contr@informació des del 1996.'' Nr. 486, 11 to 17 July 2007 (collective, weekly updated event calendar of 45 occupied houses in Barcelona; hanging out in occupied houses)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of popular [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|groups]] have come out of this kind of venue, such as [[Sin Dios]], [[Extremoduro]], [[Kolumna Durruti]], Refugio and [[Platero y Tú]] in Madrid and [[Ojos de Brujo]] and Gadjo in Barcelona. In 2014, the attempts to evict the long-running social cente of [[Can Vies]] provoked major riots.&lt;ref name=telegraph1&gt;{{cite web |title=Squat demolition called off after four nights of rioting in Barcelona |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/10865311/Squat-demolition-called-off-after-four-nights-of-rioting-in-Barcelona.html |website=The Telegraph |accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] is another area where a high number of houses have been occupied. There are at least 46 squats, or ''[[:eu:Gaztetxe|gaztetxes]]'' ("youth's houses" in [[Basque (language)|Basque]]). During the 1980s, a house was occupied by squatters in virtually every town, with the booming [[Basque Radical Rock|Basque punk rock]] thriving on the squatting movement, as it provided the badly needed premises for concerts, exhibitions, and other events. During the last 10 years, at least 15 ''gaztetxes'' have closed down, often following protests and clashes with the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|0Hp1WfemrRE|Desalojo del gaztetxe Euskal Jai en Iruña}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chabolismo (shanty towns)====
Parallelly there has been a not-ideologized current of shanty towns around big cities.
Initially settled by sedentarized [[Romani people in Spain|Gitanos]] and [[Merchero]]s, they became known after the 1980s as selling points for [[heroin]] and other drugs.
As the Spanish nomads were transferred to public housing, the shanty towns became inhabited by poor immigrants, including Moroccans and [[Romanian Roma]]s.

===Switzerland===
There are squats in the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] cities of [[Bern]], [[Geneva]], [[Nyon]], [[Winterthur]], [[Lausanne]], [[Basel]], [[Biel/Bienne]], [[Zürich]] and [[Lugano]].

The [[RHINO (squat)|RHINO]] ("'''R'''etour des '''H'''abitants dans les '''I'''mmeubles '''N'''on-'''O'''ccupés"; in English, "Return of Inhabitants to Non-Occupied Buildings") was a 19-year-long squat in [[Geneva]]. It occupied two buildings on the Boulevard des Philosophes, a few blocks away from the main campus of the [[University of Geneva]]. The RHINO organisation often faced legal troubles, and Geneva police evicted the inhabitants on July 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swissinfo.org/eng/front/detail/Geneva_s_historic_Rhino_squat_evicted.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=8048017&amp;cKey=1185257646000/ |title=Eviction of squatters from |publisher=SwissInfo |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zurich there were large riots when the [[Binz occupation]] was evicted in 2013. The squatters moved to another building.

====England====
{{Main|Squatting in England and Wales}}

In [[England]], squatting has a long historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2014/05/13/squatting-in-england-heritage-prospects/ |title=Squatting in England: Heritage &amp; Prospects |last= |first= |date=13 May 2014 |website=Crimethinc |publisher=Crimethinc |access-date=9 September 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] states that squatting was "a big issue in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381 and again for the [[Diggers]] in the 17th Century [who] were peasants who cultivated waste and common land, claiming it as their rightful due" and that squatting was a necessity after the [[Second World War]] when so many were homeless.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14030336 ''Squatters: Who are they and why do they squat?''], BBC&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC also reported in 2011 that the British government estimated that there were "20,000 squatters in the UK" and "650,000 empty properties".&lt;ref name=BBC1 /&gt;

On 1 September 2012, under Section 144 of the [[Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012]], squatting in residential property was criminalised by the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Government]], punishable by up to six months in prison or a £5000 fine, or both.&lt;ref name=squattingillegal&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 |title=Squatting set to become a criminal offence |date=31 August 2012 |publisher= |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/legislation/bills-acts/circulars/squatting-circular.pdf Ministry of Justice Circular No. 2012/04 – Offence of Squatting In a Residential Building]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year saw the first successful prosecution for squatting, resulting in a 12-week jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-19753414|title=First person jailed for squatting|date=2012-09-27|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, squatting in a commercial building is still not a criminal offence.

====Scotland====
Squatting is a criminal offence in [[Scotland]], punishable by a fine or even imprisonment, see [[Trespass (Scotland) Act 1865]]. The owner or lawful occupier of the property has the right to evict squatters without notice or applying to the court for an eviction order, although when evicting, they cannot do anything that would break the law, for example, use violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scotland.shelter.org.uk/getadvice/advice_topics/finding_a_place_to_live/squatting |title=Squatting |publisher=Scotland.shelter.org.uk |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wales====
{{Main|Squatting in England and Wales}}

In 2010, a representative of the UK Bailiff Company claimed that the number of people squatting in Wales was at its highest for 40 years.&lt;ref name="rise" /&gt; The high number of businesses failing in urban Wales has led to squatting becoming a growing issue in large cities like Swansea and Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-16807459 |location= |work=BBC News |title=Cwtch community group occupies Swansea's empty Dolphin Hotel |date=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/11/29/wru-bosses-vow-to-fight-occupy-cardiff-squatters-91466-29859619/ |location= |work=Wales Online |title=WRU bosses vow to fight Occupy Cardiff squatters |date=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts said "the majority [of squatters] are forced into the lifestyle by financial pressures." Based on the internal database of UK Bailiff Company, there were 100 cases of squatting in 2009, the highest for 40 years, following trends estimated by the Advisory Service for Squatters that squatting has doubled in England and Wales since 1995.&lt;ref name="rise"&gt;{{cite web |last=Malone |first=Sam |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2010/09/05/rise-in-squatters-puts-more-welsh-homeowners-at-risk-of-huge-eviction-bills-91466-27203034/ |title=Rise in squatters puts more Welsh homeowners at risk of huge eviction bills |publisher=Walesonline.co.uk |date=2010-09-05 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with England, from 1 September 2012, squatting in a residential building was made a criminal offence subject to arrest, fine and imprisonment.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19429936 |work=BBC News |title=Squatting set to become a criminal offence |date=2012-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012 Cardiff Squatters Network was formed, to network together squatters citywide, and host "skill-share" [[workshops]] on squatting legally in commercial buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://yourcardiff.walesonline.co.uk/2012/12/11/squatters-form-cardiff-wide-network/ |title=Squatters form Cardiff-wide network |publisher=Wales Online |date=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle East==

===Turkey===

[[Gecekondu]] (plural gecekondular) is a Turkish word meaning a house put up quickly without proper permissions, a squatter's house, and by extension, a shanty or shack. Gecekondu bölgesi is a neighborhood made of these informal settlements.

Shortly after the eviction of [[Gezi Park]], Don Kişot (Quixote) was occupied and stated to be Istanbul's first occupied and self-managed social centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://roarmag.org/essays/madrid-istanbul-occupy-squat/ |title=From Madrid to Istanbul: Occupying Public Space |publisher=ROAR Magazine |date=2014-01-12 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are, or have been, several other political squats in İstanbul: Caferağa in Kadıköy was a squatted neighbourhood house evicted in December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://en.squat.net/2014/12/19/istanbul-caferaga-mahalle-evi-squatted-community-centre-in-kadikoy-evicted/ |title=Istanbul: Caferağa Mahalle Evi squatted community centre in Kadıköy evicted |publisher=squat.net |date=2014-12-19 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Caferağa brings life, people, and productivity into that old rotting house" said local Turan Yildirim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://2014.istanbulstories.net/squat/ |title=Carrying on Gezi's Legacy, One House at a Time |publisher=Istanbul Project |date=2014-08-22 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Beşiktaş, a place was occupied on March 18, 2014 and named Berkin Elvan Student House after a 15-year-old boy who was shot during the Gezi protests and later died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bianet.org/english/youth/154283-berkin-elvan-student-house-opens-in-istanbul |title="Berkin Elvan Student House" Opens in Istanbul |publisher=BIA news desk |date=2014-03-19 |accessdate=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], squatting laws vary from state to state and city to city. For the most part, it is rarely tolerated to any degree for long, particularly in cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_092608WAB_nickelsville_eviction_LJ.b3b65546.html |title=City moves to evict homeless campers |publisher=KING 5 TV |accessdate=2008-09-26 |first=Roberta |last=Romero |date=2008-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927120518/https://www.king5.com/topstories/stories/NW_092608WAB_nickelsville_eviction_LJ.b3b65546.html |archivedate=2008-09-27 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a few exceptions, notably in 2002 when the New York City administration agreed to turn over eleven squatted buildings in the Lower East Side to an established non-profit group, on the condition that the apartments would later be turned over to the tenants as low-income [[housing cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;{{Citation |last=Ferguson |first=Sarah |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=Better Homes and Squatters: New York's Outlaw Homesteaders Earn the Right to Stay |newspaper=The Village Voice |pages= |date=August 27, 2002 |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-08-27/news/better-homes-and-squatters/1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community organizations have helped the homeless to take over vacant buildings not only as a place to live but also a part of larger campaign to shine a light on inequity in housing and advocate change in housing and land issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iYiDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=yippies+1980&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lPcxncssyB&amp;sig=q07f207qLJylnoWxwhbVAcKwCeI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi30vXr8cvYAhVI9IMKHWbEAeA4ChDoAQguMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=yippies%201980&amp;f=false|title=Ours to Lose: When Squatters Became Homeowners in New York City|author= Amy Starecheski|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these include the [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]], [[Take Back the Land]] and [[Homes not Jails]].

Squatters can be young people living in [[punk house]]s, low-income or homeless people, street gang members, or artists. During the [[Great Recession]] there were increasing numbers of people squatting foreclosed homes.&lt;ref name=Anti&gt;{{Citation |last=Netter |first=Sarah |title=Anti-Government Sovereign Citizens Taking Foreclosed Homes Using Phony Deeds, Authorities Say |newspaper=ABC NEWS |pages= |date=2010-08-23 |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-battling-sovereign-citizens-squatting-foreclosed-homes/story?id=11445382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oregon&gt;{{Citation |last=Bernstein |first=Maxine |title=A homeowner startled to find squatter living in the Portland house he bought out of foreclosure |newspaper=The Oregonian |pages= |date=2011-04-22 |url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2011/04/portland_man_startled_to_find.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also reports of people resquatting their own foreclosed homes.&lt;ref name=fore&gt;{{Citation |last=Roberts |first=Chris |title=After Foreclosure, Woman Breaks Back into, Squats |newspaper=NBC |pages= |date=2011-05-20 |url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/After-Foreclosure-Woman-Breaks-Back-into-Squats-In-Empty-Bank-Owned-Home-122332484.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, there are two systems to register the ownership of land. Under the land title system, squatter rights, formally known as [[adverse possession]], were abolished. However, under the registry system, these rights have been preserved. If a person occupies land for the required period of time as set out in provincial limitation acts and, during that time, no legal action is taken to evict or in trespass, the ownership in the land goes from the legal owner to the squatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalResources/RealEstateTenancy/LawArticle-69/Adverse-Possession.aspx |title=Adverse Possession – The Law Behind Land Squatters |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Frances Street Squats]] in Vancouver were a row of six buildings squatted for nine months in 1990. They were evicted in a large operation and a film was subsequently made, called ''The Beat of Frances Street''.

In recent years there have been a number of public squats which have brought together the two main contemporary reasons for squatting – homelessness and activism. Examples are the Lafontaine squat in [[Overdale]], a district of [[Montréal]] (2001),&lt;ref&gt;Hanes, A. 'Squatters still going strong: Overdale activists vow never to leave new homes at city-owned Centre Prefontaine' in ''The Montréal Gazette'' August 23, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; the Woodward's Squat in [[Vancouver]] (2002), the Infirmary Squat in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] (2002), the Pope Squat in [[Toronto]] (2002), the Seven Year Squat in [[Ottawa]] (2002), the Water Street Squat in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]] (2003) and the [[North Star hotel]] in Vancouver (2006). These were squats organised by anti-poverty groups which tended to have a short life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Squatting and the City"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canadiandimension.com/articles/2004/11/01/113/ |title=Labour Battles in B.C. and Quebec – Canadian Dimension |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Woodward's building was a derelict department store which had stood empty for nine years. After being evicted from the building, two hundred squatters set up a tent city on the pavement outside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://action.web.ca/home/housing/alerts.shtml?x=25702&amp;AA_EX_Session=065e9e52810dacc1d4834fbc9b47e576 Vancouver's Woodwards squatters must go by Monday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524234805/https://action.web.ca/home/housing/alerts.shtml?x=25702 |date=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The action is credited with putting in motion the eventual redevelopment of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, D. 'Anti-Olympic protesters get their game on' ''The Vancouver Sun'' January 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Peterborough Coalition Against Poverty (PCAP) publicly squatted 1130 Water Street, a building which stood empty after a fire. The group offered to repair the place and return it to its use as low-income housing. City officials agreed to the repairs and then the City Council voted to demolish the building. The cost of demolition was $8,900 and the cost of repairs had been projected to be $6,900.&lt;ref name="Squatting and the City" /&gt;

The North Star hotel was temporarily squatted as a protest against emptiness by the Vancouver Anti-Poverty Committee.

In 2011, the 'Occupy Toronto squat team' squatted a basement at 238 Queen Street West and offered to take on a lease for 99 cents a year. They were evicted after eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Sweetman, M.

==South America==
Around many [[South America]]n cities there are [[shanty town]]s. Sometimes, the authorities tear the houses down, but often, the squatters simply rebuild again. The houses are built out of whatever material can be scavenged from the local area or bought cheaply. As time goes by, the squatters start to form communities and become more established. The houses are rebuilt piece by piece with more durable materials. In some cases, a deal is reached with the authorities and connections for sewage, drinking water, cable television and electricity are made.

In [[Peru]], the name given to the squatter settlements is ''[[pueblos jóvenes]]''. In [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] they are called ''invasiones'' (as in "invading a property", as squatting can be related to a building or an empty lot) and in [[Argentina]] they are known as ''[[villa miseria]]''.

In [[Chile]] the correct term used for the squatting is the similar term used in Spain "Casa Okupa". These houses share similar aspects with other squats around the world, such as being political and activist involved places, work as cultural and social centers and have their own subculture involve. They are normally associated with [[Anarchist]] Movement and they openly identify with the squatting movement, particularly the Movimiento Okupa in [[Spain]]. The mayor number of Casas Okupas are located in [[Valparaíso]] and [[Santiago de Chile]].
It must not be confused with another different housing situation which term is ''Tomas''. These are particular situations of squatting that could be defined more like [[Shanty Town]]s, not necessarily involved with the Okupa movement.

===Brazil===
[[File:RiodeJaneiro-Favela.jpg|thumb|right|A favela in Rio de Janeiro]]
In [[Brazil]], some of the squatter communities are called [[favela]]s, and a famous example is [[Rocinha]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], estimated to be home of 100,000 people. Favelas are mostly inhabited by the poorest strata, and usually lack much infrastructure and public services, but in some cases, already have reached the structure needed for a city. They are equivalent to slums or shanty towns, and typically occupy unused land (instead of unused or abandoned buildings). There were 25 million people living in favelas all over Brazil, as of 2004.&lt;ref name="neuwirth" /&gt;

In [[São Paulo]] the largest favela is [[Heliópolis]], with over 200,000 inhabitants. However, its occupied area has been officially recognized as a regular neighborhood of the city. There are also a number of squatter buildings in the inner city, the most famous of which was a 22-story building called [[Prestes Maia (building)|Prestes Maia]], whose inhabitants were finally evicted by the police in 2007 after a long conflict with the city administration. Inspired by this movement and increasing property speculation and gentrification have also emerged various occupations in buildings and unoccupied areas in big cities. (see [[Homeless Workers' Movement]])

There are also rural squatter movements in Brazil, such as the [[Landless Workers' Movement]], which has an estimated 1.5 million members.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
In the 19th century, a squatter was a person who occupied a large tract of Crown land in order to graze livestock –  the phenomenon is referred to in the song [[Waltzing Matilda]]. At first, this was done illegally, and later under license. From the 1820s they were part of the establishment, hence the term ''Squattocracy''. Maps of pastoral lands were also known as squatting maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nla.gov.au/research-guides/australian-maps-for-family-historians/using-pastoral-or-squatting-maps|title=Using pastoral or squatting maps {{!}} National Library of Australia|website=www.nla.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of squatting is covered in greater detail at [[Squatting (pastoral)]].

In more recent times, there have been squats in the major cities. It would be possible for squatters to be charged with criminal trespass under the Enclosed Lands Protection Act, but mainly, squatters are simply evicted when they are discovered. As in the United Kingdom, there is the law of [[adverse possession]], but it is seldom used.

====Sydney====
In [[Sydney]], streets of terraced houses in areas such as [[The Rocks, New South Wales|the Rocks]] and [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] were squatted to prevent their demolition in the 1970s. The Glebe estate in [[Glebe, New South Wales]] was squatted in the 1960s and 1970s, and had an extensive influx of squatters in the 1980s. Also during the 1970s and 1980s, extensive parts of [[Woolloomooloo]] and [[Darlinghurst]] were also squatted, along corridors of houses bought to make way for new road works. Examples of these include "The Compound" in Darlinghurst and along Palmer Street in Woolloomooloo. Punks, political activists, musicians and artists also started squatting in "The Gunnery", a former Navy warehouse and training facility, in Woolloomooloo, during the early-to-mid-1980s. This squat, a large warehouse with several unusual spaces able to be used as theatres or other venues (thanks to its former use by the Navy) became a critical site for the development of arts and music in Sydney in the mid to late 1980s, with independent musical and art events being held there regularly. It is now an arts centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/subjectsearch.aspx?authority=place&amp;id=38158 |title=State Library of NSW Search – Manuscripts, Oral History, and Pictures Catalogue |publisher=Acms.sl.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists squatting empty buildings on Broadway owned by South Sydney City Council were evicted in 2001, a few months after the 2000 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://squatspace.com/history/index.php |title=SquatSpace History – Broadway Squats |publisher=Squatspace.com |date=2000-08-23 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Midnight Star was a squatted theatre used as a [[social centre]], hosting music events, a cafe, a library, a free internet space and a [[Food Not Bombs]] kitchen. It was evicted in December 2002 following its use as a convergence centre for protests against the November [[World Trade Organization]] talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://squatspace.com/history/postcards4.php |title=SquatSpace History – Midnight Star |publisher=Squatspace.com |date=2002-02-10 |accessdate=2012-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303081256/http://squatspace.com/history/postcards4.php |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a legal squat was organised for ten people who moved onto the site of an old incinerator at [[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/1/06/1065292527665.html?from=storyrhs |author=Bryor, Lisa |title=Home for Sydney squatters with fire in its belly |newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald |date=October 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A five-year-old squat was peacefully evicted in March 2008, when an office block in Balmain was demolished to make way for a park. The council voted to allow the squatters to stay in the building, which they called Iceland, until the plans for demolition were in place. One of the squatters said, "About 20 people have lived here over the years and it's been a place for band rehearsals, art projects, people practising dance routines, bike workshops. Squatting gives you a chance to think about things other than how you are going to pay the rent and ways to contribute to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/squatters-out-as-bulldozers-start-engines/2008/05/04/1209839456289.html |title=Creagh, Sunanda ''Squatters out as bulldozer start engines'' |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Squatfest]] film festival began in the Broadway squats in 2001. It is both a celebration of squatting and a protest against the [[corporate capitalism]] of the [[Tropfest]] film festival in [[Sydney]]. Every year, a site is occupied and films screened. The location is announced hours before screening begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.squatspace.com/squatfest/ |title=squatfest |publisher=SquatSpace |date=2010-02-21 |accessdate=2010-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were estimated to be more than 120,000 unoccupied houses in Sydney in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/the-art-of-setting-up-home-for-diddlysquat-20110520-1ewpa.html#ixzz1NHEFTzdZ |title=The art of setting up home for diddly-squat |publisher=Sydney Morning Herald |date=2011-05-21 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Melbourne====
[[Melbourne]] squats are usually located in the inner suburbs, like Footscray, St. Kilda and Coburg. They tend to be houses that are waiting for demolition. A well-known squat in Carlton was organised by international students in 2008. A Squatter's Handbook was produced by activists in 1993, 2001 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://melbournecio.org/?page_id=15 |title=Melb Squatters Guide |publisher=Melbournecio.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social centers==
In Europe, it is common for buildings to be squatted to be used as [[Social center|social centres]]. Cafés, bars, libraries, free shops, swaps shops and gyms have all been created, with many squats also holding [[Free party|parties]] and concerts. Social centers are often a combination of many things that happen in one space with the aim of creating a space for people to meet in a non-commercial setting, whether it be for a party, political workshop, to see a film, have a drink or have breakfast. There are many squatted social centers around the world, but they exist mainly in countries where squatting is legal. Examples include [[Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus]] in Austria, the [[RampART Social Centre]] in England, [[OT301]] in the Netherlands and [[Ungdomshuset]] in [[Denmark]] (evicted on March 1, 2007, and demolished four days later)."

==Urban homesteading==
Urban homesteading is a form of self-help housing where abandoned private properties in urban areas are taken over by the building's usually poor residents.

Sometimes this takes the form of squatting, which is not legal under many jurisdictions. Urban homesteading – in which residents rehabilitate the apartments through their own labor – may depart from squatting in some ways, especially philosophically.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;{{Citation |last=Bearak |first=Barry |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=Turf Wars |newspaper=National Housing Institute |pages=Issue 75 |year= |date=May–June 1994 |url=http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/75/turfwars.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207091555/http://www.nhi.org/online/issues/75/turfwars.html |archivedate=2009-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both groups may work initially with no permits, architectural plans or help from the government, self-help housing aims to manage the buildings cooperatively, and residents may work collaboratively with a non-profit organization or city government to legally obtain ownership of the building.&lt;ref name=Barry /&gt;

In some cases, urban homesteading is an organic phenomenon that evolves as a grassroots strategy of residents for dealing with a lack of affordable housing, or a sizable existence of abandoned, depressed, neglected or foreclosed housing stock. Some cities have used it as a solution to creating affordable housing.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{Citation |last=Penalver |first=Eduardo |author-link= |last2= |first2= |author2-link= |title=Homesteaders in the Hood: Squatters are multiplying in the recession – what should cities do? |newspaper=Slate.com |pages= |year= |date=March 25, 2009 |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2214544/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Syringomas''' are harmless eccrine [[sweat gland|sweat duct]] [[tumors]], typically found clustered on eyelids, although they may also be found in the [[armpit]]s, abdomen, chest, neck, scalp or groin area including genitals in a symmetric pattern.&lt;ref name="Andrews"&gt;{{cite book |author1=James, William D. |author2=Berger, Timothy G. |title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: clinical Dermatology |publisher=Saunders Elsevier |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-2921-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|663|date=June 2009}} They are skin-colored or yellowish firm, rounded bumps, 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, and may be confused with [[xanthoma]], [[Milium (dermatology)|milia]], [[hidrocystoma]], [[trichoepithelioma]], and [[xanthelasma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Skin lesions, tumours and cancers. DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are more common in women and are most commonly found in middle-aged Asian women. While they can present at any time in life, they typically present during adolescence. They are usually not associated with any other symptoms although can sometimes cause itchiness or irritation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Syringoma. DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/lesions/syringoma.html|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types==
* '''Eruptive''' this form typically presents on the anterior chest, abdomen, neck and arms. It presents in successive crops with periods of relief in between times of active rash.
* '''Milia-like'''  this type of syringoma is typically smaller lesions that have a milky white center that can look like [[Milium (dermatology)|milia]].
* '''Plaque type''' this type is more commonly associated with itchiness and chronic scratching that leads to epidermal thickening similar to [[lichen planus]].
* '''Familial''' some cases of syringoma exhibit a familial pattern in an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Chromosome 16q22 has been shown to be involved in the genetic links of syringoma.

=== Associated syndromes ===

Syringomas can be found in association with other symptoms as part of a syndrome. [[Hailey–Hailey disease|Hailey-Hailey]] disease also known as familial benign chronic pemphigus is a blistering disease that can also include syringomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hailey-Hailey disease (benign familial pemphigus). DermNet NZ|url = http://www.dermnetnz.org/systemic/familial-pemphigus.html|website = www.dermnetnz.org|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several systemic syndromes have also been associated with syringoma including [[diabetes mellitus]], [[down syndrome]], Brooke-Spiegler, and Nicolau-Balus. Specifically, diabetes mellitus is strongly associated with clear cell syringoma consisting of nests of clear cells containing glycogen. It is thought that phosphorylase deficiency, resulting from elevated glucose levels seen in diabetes leads to an accumulation of glycogen in the skin and within the clear cells. The incidence of syringomas  has been reported in up to 40 percent of people with Down syndrome and can be associated with a condition [[calcinosis cutis]] which requires prompt medical attention. Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant syndrome with cutaneous manifestations including syringomas and trichoepitheliomas. Nicolau-Balus is a rare autosomal dominant disorder consisting of atrophoderma vermiculata and syringomas.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:SkinTumors-P8080545.JPG|thumb|Syringoma (eccrine)]]
The pathophysiology of syringomas remains largely unknown. Familial patterns presenting in an autosomal dominant pattern suggest a genetic link that can result in varying genetic aberrations in lesions, specifically chromosome 16q22. The most commonly accepted theory is that syringomas are benign growths that arise from the intraepidermal portion of eccrine ducts. Another theory suggests that syringomas are a reactive hyperplasia rather than a true neoplasm resulting after inflammatory processes such as eczema. It has also been suggested that a hamartomatous process could explain eruptive syringomas. A hamartoma of pluripotent stem cells could precede the pathological process. Syringomas may also be under hormonal influence explaining the female predominance.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

== Diagnosis ==
Syringomas can often be diagnosed clinically based on presentation, distribution patterns over the body, lack of associated symptoms and family history. A definitive diagnosis requires a [[skin biopsy]] to allow the tissue to be examined under a microscope. Histologically, syringomas have a characteristic comma ("tadpole") shaped tail of dilated, cystic eccrine ducts.

== Treatment ==
The goal of treatment is to improve the appearance of lesions since they are otherwise not serious and typically do not cause symptoms. Many treatment methods have been attempted however, complete removal is uncommon. No single treatment method has been shown to consistently work. Both medical and surgical treatments have been studied, each with variable success. Common destructive treatment methods include carbon dioxide lasers, dermabrasion, surgical excision, electrocoagulation and chemical peels. Many of these methods are very time consuming and require multiple treatment sessions.Carbon dioxide lasers are the most commonly practiced method; however, can cause thermal damage leading to scarring in the area. Medical therapies include topical [[atropine]], topical retinoids and oral [[tranilast]].

The most common adverse side effects include redness, skin discoloration and pain. Other side effects include blistering and scarring.

'''''The Death of Marat''''' ({{lang-fr|La Mort de Marat}} or ''Marat Assassiné'') is a 1793 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]] of the murdered French revolutionary leader [[Jean-Paul Marat]]. It is one of the most famous images of the [[French Revolution]]. David was the leading French painter, as well as a [[The Mountain|Montagnard]] and a member of the revolutionary [[Committee of General Security]]. The painting shows the radical journalist lying dead in his bath on July 13, 1793 after his murder by [[Charlotte Corday]]. Painted in the months after Marat's murder, it has been described by [[T. J. Clark (art historian)|T. J. Clark]] as the first modernist painting, for "the way it took the stuff of politics as its material, and did not transmute it".

==The murder==
Marat (24 May 1743 – 13 July 1793, 18th century France) was one of the leaders of the Montagnards, the radical faction ascendant in French politics during the [[Reign of Terror]] until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. Charlotte Corday was a [[Girondin]] from a minor aristocratic family and a political enemy of Marat who blamed him for the [[September Massacre]]. She gained entrance to Marat's rooms with a note promising details of a counter-revolutionary ring in Caen.

Marat suffered from a skin condition that caused him to spend much of his time in his bathtub; he would often work there. Corday fatally stabbed Marat, but she did not attempt to flee. She was later tried and executed for the murder.

==David's politics ==
As well as being the leading French painter of his generation, David was a prominent Montagnard, and a [[Jacobin]], aligned with Marat and [[Maximilian Robespierre]]. A deputy of the Museum section at the [[National Convention|Convention]], he voted for the death of the King, and served on the Committee of General Security, where he actively participated in the sentencing and imprisonment of many and eventually presided over the "section des interrogatoires". He was also on the [[:fr:Comité d'instruction publique|Committee of Public Instruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Wildenstein, pp. 43–59.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Style==
[[File:Death of Marat by David (detail).jpg|thumb|Detail of ''The Death of Marat'' showing the paper held in Marat's left hand. The letter reads (in French) "Il suffit que je sois bien malheureuse pour avoir droit a votre bienveillance" or in English, "Given that I am unhappy, I have a right to your help"]]
Marat's figure is idealized.&lt;ref name="smarth"&gt;[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/david-death-of-marat.html Smarthistory], David's Death of Marat, accessed 28 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the painting contains no sign of his skin problems, his skin appears clean and unblemished. David, however, drew other details from his visit to Marat's residence the day before the assassination: the green rug, the papers, and the pen. David promised his peers in the National Convention that he would later depict their murdered friend invocatively as "''écrivant pour le bonheur du peuple''" (writing for the good of the people). ''The Death of Marat'' is designed to commemorate a personable hero. Although the name [[Charlotte Corday]] can be seen on the paper held in Marat's left hand, she herself is not visible. Close inspection of this painting shows Marat at his last breath, when Corday and many others were still nearby (Corday did not try to escape). Therefore, David intended to record more than just the horror of martyrdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | year = 2000  | pages = 16–17 | isbn = 0-521-56337-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, for realistic as it is in its details, the painting, as a whole, from its start, is a methodical construction focusing on the victim, a striking set up regarded today by several critics as an "awful beautiful lie"— certainly not a photograph in the forensic scientific sense and barely the simple image it may seem (for instance, in the painting, the knife is not to be seen where Corday had left it impaled in Marat's chest, but on the ground, beside the bathtub).

''The Death of Marat'' has often been compared to ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's Pietà]]''. Note the elongated arm hanging down in both works. David admired [[Caravaggio]]'s works, especially ''[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]'', which mirrors ''The Death of Marat'''s drama and light.

David sought to transfer the sacred qualities long associated with the monarchy and the Catholic Church to the new French Republic. He painted Marat, martyr of the Revolution, in a style reminiscent of a Christian martyr, with the face and body bathed in a soft, glowing light.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; As Christian art had done from its beginning, David also played with multileveled references to classical art. Suggestions that Paris could compete with Rome as capital and mother city of the Arts and the idea of forming a kind of new [[Roman Republic]] appealed to French Revolutionaries, who often formed David's audience.

== Later history ==
[[File:Charlotte Corday.jpg|thumb|''Charlotte Corday'' by [[Paul Jacques Aimé Baudry]], painted 1860.]]
[[File:MunchDerToddesMarat1907.JPG|thumb|One of two versions of ''Death of Marat'' made by [[Edvard Munch]] in 1907]]
Widely admired during the Terror whose leaders ordered several copies of the original work (copies made in 1793–1794 by David's pupils to serve propaganda), ''The Death of Marat'' slowly ceased to be 'frontpage history' after Robespierre's overthrow and execution. At his request, it was returned to David in 1795, himself being prosecuted for his involvement in the Terror as a member of the Comité de Sureté Général (he would have to wait for Napoleon's rise to become prominent in the arts once more). From 1795 to David's death, the painting languished in obscurity. During David's exile in Belgium, it was hidden, somewhere in France, by [[Antoine Gros]], David's dearest pupil. In 1826 (and later on), the family tried to sell it, with no success at all. It was rediscovered by the critics in the mid-nineteenth century, especially by [[Charles Baudelaire]] whose famous comment in 1846{{elucidate|date=June 2016}} became the starting point of an increased interest among artists and scholars. In the 20th century, the painting inspired several painters (among them Picasso and Munch who delivered their own versions), poets (Alessandro Mozzambani) and writers (the most famous being Peter Weiss with his play ''[[Marat/Sade]]'').

The original painting is currently displayed at the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museum of Fine Arts]] in Brussels, being there as a result of a decision taken by the family to offer it, in 1886, to the city where the painter had lived quietly and died in exile after the fall of Napoleon. Some of the copies (the exact number of those completed remains uncertain) made by David's pupils (among them, [[Gioacchino Giuseppe Serangeli]] and Gérard) survived, notably visible in the museums of Dijon, Reims, and Versailles. The original letter, with bloodstains and bath water marks still visible, has survived and is currently intact in the ownership of [[Robert Lindsay, 29th Earl of Crawford]].&lt;ref&gt;The Earl of Crawford has the largest collection of French revolutionary manuscripts in Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists have also depicted the death of Marat, sometimes long after the facts, whose works refer or not to David's masterpiece. Among these later works, the ''Charlotte Corday'' by [[Paul Jacques Aimé Baudry]], painted in 1860, during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], when Marat's "dark legend" (the angry monster insatiably hungry for blood) was widely spread among educated people, depicts [[Charlotte Corday]] as a true heroine of France, a model of virtue for the younger generations. The versions of Picasso and Munch are less trying to refer to the original context in itself than to confront modern issues with those of David, in terms of style. Brazilian artist [[Vik Muniz]] created a version composed of contents from a city landfill as part of his "Pictures of Garbage&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, ''A Modern Marat'', https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703440004575548581385394008&lt;/ref&gt;" series.

'''''The Miracle of the Holy Fire''''' (1892–99) is a painting by [[William Holman Hunt]] which depicts the [[Greek Orthodox]] rite of the [[Holy Fire]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] Jerusalem. Hunt believed the fire to be a [[pious fraud]] which brought Christianity into disrepute. He intended the painting to be a satire in the manner of [[William Hogarth]]. Hunt published an elaborate keyplate explaining the identity of the various characters depicted.

==Subject==
The miracle of the Holy Fire is an annual event in which the patriarch of the Greek Orthodox church in Jerusalem enters the shrine of the Holy Sepulchre with an unlit lamp and emerges with it lit. The ceremony begins at noon when the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]] or another Orthodox [[Archbishop]] recites a specific [[prayer]]. The congregants will then chant "Lord, have mercy" (''[[Kyrie eleison]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) until the Holy Fire "descends" on a lamp of [[olive]] oil held by the [[patriarch]] while he is alone in the tomb chamber. The patriarch will then reveal himself from the tomb chamber and recite some prayers and light either 33 or 12 candles and distribute them to the congregants. 

Hunt depicts the moment at which the kindled fire is released from the chamber and passed from candle to candle. Lighted candles can be seen emerging from the shrine in the background at the right. Hunt does not concentrate on the event itself, but rather on the social and ethnographic context in which it occurs.

==Meaning==
Along with other Protestants and Catholics, Hunt had no doubt that the fire was not a miracle, so he concentrates on what he considered to be the fanatical and grotesque responses of the participants. He also believed that the interior of the church was the epitome of bad taste, writing that it was "crammed full of trumpery pictures of old Saints, and decorated throughout in that bad taste which Roman Catholics have to themselves in Europe but which here the modern Greeks share with them."&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhurst, J., ''William Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol 1, p.278&lt;/ref&gt;

Hunt depicted the various competing religious groups along with the different races and ethnicities of the region. At the far right a woman who represents Protestant English attitudes hurries to remove her children from the scene as the crowd becomes increasingly excited. Their Greek Orthodox nursemaid in contrast, responds enthusiastically, reaching her candle into the crowd.&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhurst, J., ''William Holman Hunt, A Catalogue Raisonné'', vol 1, p.276&lt;/ref&gt; A number of individuals adopt poses that are designed to mimic the death and resurrection of Jesus. In the background at the far left a figure mimicking Jesus dead is carried by others adopting exaggerated gestures of mourning. In the centre a man places himself against the shrine repeating the gesture of paintings depicting Jesus's resurrection. 

As the crowd becomes unruly, the soldiers representing the occupying forces of the [[Ottoman empire]] attempt to control the more riotous elements. At the centre of the ceremony is the Islamic ruler of the city. Bim Pasha, his second in command, leans on his sword, representing order amid disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/whh/replete/miracle.html Landow, G.P, ''Replete with Meaning: William Holman Hunt and Typological Symbolism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Underdrawing was used extensively by 15th century painters like [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These artists "underdrew" with a brush, using hatching strokes for shading, using water-based black paint, before [[underpainting]] and [[overpainting]] with oils.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[Cennino D'Andrea Cennini]] (14th century most likely) describes a different type of underdrawing, made with graded tones rather than hatching, for [[egg tempera]].

In some cases, underdrawing can be clearly visualized using [[infrared]] reflectography because [[carbon black]] pigments absorb infrared light, whereas opaque pigments such as lead white are transparent with infrared light.  Underdrawing in many works, for example, the [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)]] or the [[Arnolfini Portrait]], reveals that artists made [[pentimento|alterations]], sometimes radical ones, to their compositions.
