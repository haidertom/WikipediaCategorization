In 1945, he founded [[A K Khan &amp; Company]], one of Pakistan's leading [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] until 1971, when it became one of Bangladesh's leading conglomerates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Islam|first1=Sirajul|title=Khan, Abul Kashem|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Khan,_Abul_Kashem|website=banglapedia|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan served as a member of the [[Constituent Assembly of India]] and the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. He was a federal minister of [[Pakistan]] and member in the [[Pakistan National Assembly]].

== Early life ==
Khan was born in the Village of Mohara in [[Panchlaish Thana|Panchlaish]] in [[Chittagong]] in 1905. His father was a government sub-registrar at Fatehabad, Chittagong. He studied law at [[Presidency University, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[Calcutta]]. In 1934 he joined the Kolkata High court as an advocate. He joined the judicial branch of the Bengali Civil service in 1935. He continued in the service till 1944.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Career ==
Khan entered business during the [[Second World War]] in 1945, when Chittagong was a key base for Allied Forces. He step up a number of industries including a match factory, a plywood factory, a textile mill, and dockyard. He was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly of India from the [[All-India Muslim League]] candidate in 1946. He joined the Pakistan Constituent Assembly after the partition of India. In 1951-1952 budget he spoke against the economical discrimination of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

''"Sir, I cannot help' remark ' which I hope will not be misinterpreted as an indication of petty provincial-mindedness. Sir, these are the days of decentralisation and regional self-sufficiency. We find that in this six-year plan, the total sum allocated to East Bengal where 56 percent of your people live is less than 23 percent. Under the head 'Agriculture', provision has been made for 82 crores and a sum total of all the projects envisaged for East Bengal is only 5.6 crores. Under the head 'Development of Hydro-Electric Power', a provision for 45 crores has been made and the share of East Bengal is only 5 crores. Under the head 'Industries', provision has been made for textile industries' [for West Pakistan] to the tune of 30 crores and the provision for jute industry' [for East Bengal] is only 11 crores. Now, Sir, this gives a clear indication that not only in the past, not only in the present, but in the future development plans of the country, East Bengal is not expected to get its legitimate share."''&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Szfqq7ruqWgC|title=Bangladesh: Past and Present|last=Ahmed|first=Salahuddin|date=2004-01-01|publisher=APH Publishing|isbn=9788176484695|page=337|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Growth strategies ==

Ansoff, in his 1957 paper, provided a definition for [[Product marketing|product-market]] strategy as “a joint statement of a product line and the corresponding set of missions which the products are designed to fulfil”.&lt;ref&gt;Ansoff, I.: Strategies for Diversification, Harvard Business Review, Vol. 35 Issue 5,Sep-Oct 1957, pp. 113-124&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four growth alternatives:

===Market penetration===

In [[market penetration]] strategy, the organization tries to grow using its existing offerings (products and services) in existing markets. In other words, it tries to increase its [[market share]] in current market scenario.This involves increasing market share within existing market segments. This can be achieved by selling more products or services to established customers or by finding new customers within existing markets. Here, the company seeks increased sales for its present products in its present markets through more aggressive promotion and distribution.

This can be accomplished by:
* Price decrease
* Increase in promotion and distribution support
* Acquisition of a rival in the same market
* Modest product refinements

===Market development===

In [[market development]] strategy, a firm tries to expand into new markets (geographies, countries etc.) using its existing offerings.

This can be accomplished by:
* Different customer segments
* Industrial buyers for a good that was previously sold only to the households;
* New areas or regions about of the country
* Foreign markets.

This strategy is more likely to be successful where:
* The firm has a unique product technology it can leverage in the new market
* It benefits from economies of scale if it increases output
* The new market is not too different from the one it has experience of
* The buyers in the market are intrinsically profitable.

===Product development===

In [[product development]] strategy, a company tries to create new products and services targeted at its existing markets to achieve growth.
This involves extending the product range available to the firm's existing markets. 
These products may be obtained by:
* Investment in research and development of additional products;
* Acquisition of rights to produce someone else's product;
* Buying in the product and “badging” it as one’s own brand;
* Joint development with ownership of another company who need access to the firm's distribution channels or brands.

===Diversification===

In [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]] an organization tries to grow its market share by introducing new offerings in new markets. It is the most risky strategy because both product and market development is required.

Related Diversification—here there is relationship and, therefore, potential synergy, between the firms in existing business and the new product/market
space. {{clarify |date=November 2018|reason=Not a proper sentence, and (b) has no corresponding (a) part.|text=Concentric diversification, and (b) Vertical integration.}}

Unrelated Diversification: This is otherwise termed conglomerate growth because the resulting corporation is a conglomerate, i.e. a collection of businesses without any relationship to one another. A strategy for company growth through starting up or acquiring businesses outside the company’s current products and markets.

== Criticisms ==

=== Logical consistency challenges ===
The logic of the Ansoff matrix has been questioned. The logical issues pertain to interpretations about newness. If one assumes a new product really is new to the firm, in many cases a new product will simultaneously take the firm into a new, unfamiliar market. In that case, one of the Ansoff quadrants, diversification, is redundant. Alternatively, if a new product does ''not'' necessarily take the firm into a new market, then the combination of new products into new markets does not always equate to diversification, in the sense of venturing into a completely unknown business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3130530|title=The Ansoff Matrix: a legendary tool, but with two logical problems|last=Dawes|first=John|date=2018|website=Social Science Research Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundations==
The Birla family belongs to the [[Maheshwari]] subcaste of the [[Vaishya]] (trader) caste, and are [[Marwari people|Marwari]] since they hail from the [[Marwad]] region of present-day [[Rajasthan]]. Specifically, the family originates from the town of [[Pilani]] in the [[Shekhawati]] region lying between Marwad.

===Shiv Narayan Birla===
In Pilani during the early 19th century lived Seth Shobharam, grandson of Seth Bhudharmal, a local tradesman of modest means.&lt;ref&gt;Maheshwari Jati Ka Itihas, Maheshwari History Office, Bhanpura,   Birla, June 1940, p. 183–190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDlj7rwlDK0C&amp;pg=PT684&amp;lpg=PT684&amp;dq=birla+daughters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c8DJbj8f7J&amp;sig=iLvCokhf2N03_-OBQhAlHW6X5dM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Q1JJVa28AoiZyATZ54GQCQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBDge#v=onepage&amp;q=birla+daughters&amp;f=false|title=Brushes With History|first=Krishna Kumar|last=Birla|date=17 April 2009|publisher=Penguin UK|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his son, Seth Shiv Narayana (1840–1909), who first ventured outside Pilani. At this time, Ahmedabad was the railhead which serviced trade from a large region of northwest India. Goods (mainly cotton) would be brought from the hinterland to the city and sent from there by train to Bombay for export to England and other countries. Several cotton ginning units were also set up in Ahmedabad, to clean the cotton before shipment to England. Shiv Narayana  Birla was one of the early Indian traders to participate in this cotton trade. Later, Britain vigorously fostered the trade of opium with China and developed the cultivation of poppy in India. The [[Ratlam]]-[[Mandsaur]] region (not far from Ahemdabad) became prime poppy cropland due to suitable soil and climate. Shiv Narayan Birla and his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, made an enormous fortune by trading opium with China, and this formed the basis of the family's fortune.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; With growing wealth and increasing confidence, Shiv Narayana Birla moved up the value chain and began chartering cargo ships in partnership with other Marwadi tradesmen to trade opium with China, thus by-passing British middlemen. To facilitate this, he moved to Bombay in 1863.

===Baldeo Das Birla===
Shiv Narain Birla had one overwhelming sorrow in his life: he had no children. By the early 1880s, Shiv narayan (Narain) had passed on the baton of his business interests to his adopted son, Baldeo Das Birla, established Shivnarayan Baldevdas, a trading house based in Bombay. His son, Baldeo Das Birla moved to Calcutta set up Baldevdas Jugalkishor in 1887.
Baldeo Das was succeeded by four sons&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhe3-G5aBkg|title=The story of the Birla empire by Talveen Singh- Part I|first=|last=Aditya Birla Group|date=31 May 2011|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;– Jugal Kishore, Rameshwar Das, [[Ghanshyam Das Birla|Ghanshyam Das]] and Braj Mohan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20Strategy3/BSTA034.htm The Birla Family Crisis - Case Studies, Case Study in Business, Management|Case Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714221045/http://www.icmrindia.org/casestudies/catalogue/Business%20Strategy3/BSTA034.htm |date=July 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/battle-for-m.p.-birla-fortune-icai-indicts-lodhas/1/175181.html|title=Battle for Billions: Birlas vs Lodhas|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/books/What-keeps-the-Marwaris-thriving/articleshow/35380786.cms|title=What keeps the Marwaris thriving? - Times of India|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baldeo Das was awarded the Raibahadur title in 1917. In 1920 he retired from business and started living in Banares pursuing religious studies. In 1925 he was awarded the title of "Raja" by the government of Bihar and Orissa.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Entrepreneurship of Shekhawati Marwaris, D.K. Taknet, Kumar Prakashan, Jaipur, 1987, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded D. Litt. by Beneras Hindu University.

===Ghanshyam Das Birla===
Ghanshyam Das Birla laid the foundation of his industrial empire by establishing GM Birla Company, trading in [[jute]], in 1911. The [[First World War]] began in 1914 greatly increasing the demand for jute sacks. During the war the Birla's worth is estimated to have risen from 2 million rupees to 8 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcbBEHHI-90C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=India's Industrialists|first1=Margaret|last1=Herdeck|first2=Gita|last2=Piramal|date=9 July 1985|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, he became among the first group of Indian entrepreneurs to become owner of a Jute mill named [[Birla Corporation|Birla Jute]].&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/corporate-dossier/family-spirit-and-frugality-help-the-birlas-keep-pace-with-changing-times/articleshow/41702203.cms?intenttarget=no|title='Family' spirit and frugality help the Birlas keep pace with changing times|date=6 September 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017|via=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next few years he acquired several cotton mills. He later started several sugar mills. The publication [[Hindustan Times]] was co-founded by GD Birla in 1924 and fully acquired by him in 1933.  [[Hindustan Motors]] was started in 1942. After India's independence in 1947 he started [[Grasim]] (Gwalior Rayon Silk Manufacturing, 1948) and [[Hindalco]] (Hindustan Aluminium Company 1958) among others.

Baldeo Das, as well his sons were among the key supporters of the [[swaraj]] movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, in addition to being dedicated Hindu activists. They were active supporters of the [[Banaras Hindu University]] founded by Pt. [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and were also financial supporters of activities initiated by Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref&gt;Business Legends, Gita Piramal, Penguin UK, Dec 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The landmark [[Laxminarayan Temple]] in Delhi was built by Jugal Kishore Birla and was inaugurated by Mahatma Gandhi and as asked by Mahatma, all Hindus, including [[harijan]]s were welcomed in this temple.

In the few decades before India's independence, Indian merchants, including the Birlas, made successful attempts to enter and acquire industries in India which were once dominated by [[Scot]]s from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1943/01/02/archives/british-investors-see-peril-in-india-managing-agents-fear-loss-of.html|title=British Investors See Peril in India – Managing Agents Fear Loss of Immense Profits on Half of Country's Industries – Natives Seek Business – Huge Sterling Credits Already Available to Buy Out the Foreign Companies|first=Herbert L.|last=Matthews|date=2 January 1943|page=5| work=New York Times|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became a part of Mahatma Gandhi's [[Swadeshi]] movement.

Birlas remained close to some of the leaders of India, like [[Sardar Patel]] after India's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Debajyoti Burman, Mystery of Birla House, Jugabani Hahitya Chakara, 3rd reprint 1951, P. 111&lt;/ref&gt; As leading industrialists, they were often accused by the leftists of exploiting their workers and aspiring to be among the richest in the world. Still when [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]] became the chief minister of Kerala (1957–59), as a result of the first elected Marxist government anywhere, Birlas were invited to establish a pulp factory there.&lt;ref&gt;Phrases And Facts: About Kerala, Partha Choudhuri, Liberation, Vol. II, No. 3 (January 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent past, the Birlas, as well as several other Indian industrialists have expanded overseas.

==Philanthropy==

Birla philanthropy began in the 1880s, when the Birla family donated over 100,000 rupees for setting up goshalas (shelters for the protection of cows) in Kolkata. By early 1900, the Birla family began to support education, influenced by  Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya. They supported educational charities in Kolkata and in Mumbai teaming up with [[Jamnalal Bajaj]]. In 1918, the family established the first high school in Pilani which evolved into [[BITS Pilani]], which now has branches in Hyderabad, Goa and Dubai. They also opened a Sanskrit library in Benares and a library in Kolkata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Specials/XaccWERecP1ckwaJ4spx5O/Rajashree-Birla--Giving-is-in-fact-living.html|title=Rajashree Birla - Giving is in fact living|first=Rajashree|last=Birla|date=3 October 2014|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is well known for the financial support of Indian's freedom struggle and for building temples (see [[Birla Temple]]) in several major Indian cities.

==Birla values==

In a letter, Ghanshaym Das offered this advice to Aditya (his grandson) when he was studying at MIT: 
:“eat only vegetarian food, never drink alcohol or smoke, keep early hours, marry young, switch-off lights when leaving the room, cultivate regular habits, go for a walk everyday, keep in touch with the family, and above all, don’t be extravagant.” &lt;ref&gt;India's Industrialists, Volume 1,

GD Birla instructed his son Basant Kumar to 'never utilize wealth only for fun and frolic,' to 'spend the bare minimum on yourself,' and to deride 'worldly pleasures.'&lt;ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com"/&gt;

This  advice symbolised the ethic of the rising Marwari community, with restraint and austerity its defining attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gurcharandas.org/node/634|title=Marwari ethic and the spirit of Capitalism - Gurcharan Das|website=gurcharandas.org|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birla Family ties==

Although the Birlas are perceived as a single entity, the different branches of the family are now financially independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2004/08/26/stories/2004082602130600.htm|title=The Hindu Business Line : `Mahatma was witness  to Birla clan partition'|first=|last=cakml|website=www.thehindubusinessline.com|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/after-months-of-tension-birlas-part-ways-amicably/1/337575.html|title=After months of tension, Birlas part ways amicably|publisher=|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they have continued to maintain family relationships that go back to the times when "Birla Brothers" were an actual entity and Raja Baldevdas was still alive.

Both of GD Birla's wives died early because of tuberculosis (He remarried after the death of his first wife), a common affliction at that time. The families of his brothers [[Ghanshyam Das Birla#Family history|Brij Mohan and Rameshwar Das Birla helped in raising his children]].

=="Tata-Birla" word pair==
For many decades the extreme wealth in India was associated with the Tatas and Birlas.

'''Robert L. Turner''' (born May 2, 1941) is an American businessman and politician who served as the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for [[New York's 9th congressional district]], in the United States' 112th Congress (containing parts of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Queens]]), from 2011 to 2013. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Turner was elected in September 2011 to complete the term of Democrat [[Anthony Weiner]], who had [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal|resigned following allegations of improper behavior.]]

Turner had been a media executive known for his success in the television talk show segment of the industry. Six years after retiring from his business career, he entered politics to run against Weiner in the November 2010 election—losing, receiving 39 percent of the vote. Less than one year later, he defeated Democrat [[David Weprin]] 52–47 in the [[New York's 9th congressional district special election, 2011|special election]] battle for Weiner's seat—becoming the first Republican to represent the area since 1923.&lt;ref name="behind win"/&gt; In [[United States Senate election in New York, 2012|2012]], after his district was eliminated in redistricting, Turner ran for the [[United States Senate]], but was defeated in the primaries.&lt;ref name="cpnys.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpnys.org/posts/wendy-long-receives-conservative-party-endorsement|title=Wendy Long Receives Conservative Party Endorsement - Conservative Party of New York State|work=cpnys.org|accessdate=June 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402174102/http://www.cpnys.org/posts/wendy-long-receives-conservative-party-endorsement|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesledger.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2012/26/turnerprimary_all_2012_06_28_q.html|title=Long beats Turner in Republican contest for Senate|work=TimesLedger|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner was named chairman of the Queens County chapter of the Republican Party in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Campanile, Carl (March 9, 2015).

==Early life and education==
Born in 1941,&lt;ref name="bioguide"/&gt; Turner grew up in the [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]] and [[Richmond Hill, Queens|Richmond Hill]] neighborhoods of Queens, the eldest of three sons.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; His father was a taxi driver, and [[machinist]]; his mother a homemaker.&lt;ref name="op-ed"/&gt; Turner has described his parents as "[[New Deal|New Deal Democrats]] who began splitting their tickets in the post-[[John Kennedy|Kennedy]] years."&lt;ref name="op-ed"/&gt; He attended St. Thomas The Apostle School in [[Woodhaven, Queens|Woodhaven]] and [[Richmond Hill High School (Queens, New York)|Richmond Hill High School]]. He served in the Army at the rank of [[Specialist (rank)#Technician|SP5]], then graduated from [[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University in Hillcrest]] with a [[B.A.]] in history, after working his way through college.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; As a college student, he took part in the conservative activist group [[Young Americans for Freedom]].&lt;ref name="taps Weiner"/&gt;

==Business career==
[[File:Turner wins award from us chamber of commerce.jpg|thumb|right|Congressman Turner was awarded the United States Chamber of Commerce “Spirit of Enterprise Award” by [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]] President and CEO [[Tom J. Donohue]] for his support of pro-business issues.]]
Turner worked in the advertising and television industries for more than four decades.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; In 1984, he co-founded and ran Orbis Communications, a distributor of [[advertiser funded programming]].&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="all american"/&gt; He then headed the North American operations of Pearson LLC, where he exported the television [[talk show]] format to Europe, launching six shows in two years.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; In addition, Turner reorganized and redirected the successful program ''[[Baywatch]]'' and launched new versions of the game shows ''[[Family Feud]]'' and ''[[To Tell the Truth]]''.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="protest vote"/&gt;

Turner's most notable position was president of [[Multimedia Entertainment]], a division of media conglomerate Multimedia, Inc., from 1991 to 1995.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharp drop"/&gt; He created ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]''.,&lt;ref name="put rush"/&gt; he oversaw the production of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]]'' and ''[[Sally (1983 TV series)|The Sally Jesse Raphael Show]]'',&lt;ref name="cowboy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="man who created"/&gt; and launched the [[Rush Limbaugh]] show on television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/01/bob-turner-rush-limbaugh-tv-show_n_944949.html|title= Bob Turner Put Rush Limbaugh On Television, He's Proud To Say|author=Elise Foley|work=Huffington Post|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Springer]] recalled that he and Turner had a friendly, businesslike relationship though their politics differed.&lt;ref name="cowboy"/&gt; Turner shelved several Springer show episodes as inappropriate but kept the show on the air despite heavy criticism and calls from Congress to regulate the show's raunchy content.&lt;ref name="man who created"/&gt;&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt; Limbaugh recalled of Turner: "it was Bob Turner that chased Roger Ailes and me down one night at [[21 Club|21]] with the idea of doing a show.

He has also been President of LBS Communications, a division of [[Grey Global Group|Grey Advertising]], where he created a daytime "barter network" for the distribution and syndication of the series ''[[Family (1976 TV series)|Family]]'' and ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]''.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; He served as Director of Advertising for [[Bristol-Myers Squibb|Bristol-Myers]] Company, where he began the production of the Leonard Nimoy series, ''[[In Search of... (TV series)|In Search of...]]'', and was the first General Manager of [[CBS Cable]].&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;
During his active business career, Turner founded and served as the president of the Association of Syndicated Television Advertisers and was on the boards of the National Association of Television Programming Executives and the Advertising Research Council. He served on the television committee of the [[Association of National Advertisers]].&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;

While in his early 60s, Turner retired from full-time business activities but continued to manage his own investments including a hotel business in Orlando, Florida.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; He sat on several Boards of Directors, including Readspeak Inc., Liberty Imaging Inc., the Achilles Track Club and Family Focus Adoption Services.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt;

==Political career==
Bob Turner recalled that he was motivated to join politics because of his opposition to the [[Obamacare|Health care bill]] and a perceived "radical left turn" that he felt the [[Obama administration]] was taking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2010/10/18/the-man-who-brought-rush-limbaugh-to-television-looks-to-bring-down-liberal-new-york-rep-anthony-weiner/ |title=The man who brought Rush Limbaugh to television looks to bring down liberal New York Rep. Anthony Weiner |publisher=The Daily Caller |date=October 18, 2010 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first ran for Congress in [[United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010|November 2010 against Anthony Weiner]] in New York's ninth congressional district, losing in a 60–40 split.&lt;ref name="Tomasky"/&gt; During the 2010 campaign, he ran on a platform favoring minimal regulation of business and signed the [[Grover Norquist]] / [[Americans for Tax Reform]] pledge of "no new taxes under any circumstances".&lt;ref name="tax pledge"/&gt;

===U.S. House of Representatives (2011–2013)===
Following the resignation of Anthony Weiner, Turner ran for the vacant seat in [[New York's 9th congressional district special election, 2011|a special election]] held on September 13, 2011—beating his Democratic opponent, [[David Weprin]], by a margin of more than 4,000 votes.&lt;ref name="Officialresult"/&gt; His campaign consultant was strategist [[Bill O'Reilly (political consultant)|Bill O'Reilly]]. Turner's campaign ran ads showing images of the [[World Trade Center site]] in flames, accusing Weprin of commemorating the attack by defending the right of Sufi Muslims to build the Islamic community center [[Park51]].&lt;ref name="queenstribune"/&gt;&lt;ref name="daily news endorses"/&gt; Turner also said that Weprin would merely toe the Democratic Party line if elected&lt;ref name="gop hopeful"/&gt; and emphasized that Weprin had said the national debt was $4 trillion when the correct number was $14 trillion.&lt;ref name="juniper civic"/&gt; Turner, according to the ''New York Times'', "aggressively courted observant Jewish voters",&lt;ref name="fearing loss"/&gt; and painted Weprin as a puppet of President Obama, who would not stand up for Israel.&lt;ref name="fearing loss"/&gt;&lt;ref name="banks on"/&gt; Turner won strong support from Orthodox Jewish leaders, and won crossover endorsements, two key ones being New York Assemblyman [[Dov Hikind]],&lt;ref name="hikind endorses"/&gt; and former New York Mayor [[Ed Koch]], both Democrats and Jews.&lt;ref name="NYT2011/09/15"/&gt;&lt;ref name="turner offers"/&gt;

Turner began the campaign with a disadvantage in fundraising because the national and state Republican parties had spent heavily in previous special elections in New York state.&lt;ref name="weprin leads"/&gt; Turner turned down [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] support and offers to help during his special election campaign.&lt;ref name="brown in queens"/&gt; Regardless, Turner rose in the polls from an underdog to an eight-point advantage days before the election.&lt;ref name="fearing loss"/&gt; The Democratic Party contributed heavily to Weprin in the last weeks of the race, as Turner's odds of winning increased.&lt;ref name="late help"/&gt; Turner's win was publicized as a large upset victory, and made national headlines because Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 3-to-1 in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honan |first=Edith |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/us-usa-politics-newyork-idUSBRE82J04220120320 |title=New York Republican wins key 3rd-party nod in Senate bid |publisher=Reuters |date=March 19, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Joshua |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/bob_turner_upsets_democrat_david_weprin_new_york_special-208699-1.html |title=Bob Turner Upsets Democrat David Weprin in New York Special |publisher=Roll Call |date=September 14, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His win was also unexpected because his district had a large Jewish constituency (up to one quarter of registered voters are Jewish), and Turner beat Weprin, an Orthodox Jew, with a majority of the Jewish vote.&lt;ref name="banks on"/&gt;

Turner's campaign manager, E. O'Brien Murray, was later named 2012 GOP campaign manager of the year, by the [[American Association of Political Consultants]] for his role in the win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katz |first=Celeste |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/2012/04/bob-turner-touts-e-obrien-murray-street-cred |title=Bob Turner Touts E.

This included a special election for [[New York State Assembly]] on the same day as Turners election, within his congressional district, where the democrat won with 76% of the vote. Further Governor Cuomo easily won the congressional district in his run for Governor of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2009/results/city-council.html | work=The New York Times | title=Election 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109185422/http://elections.nytimes.com/2009/results/city-council.html | archivedate=November 9, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2011/by_county/NY_State_Assembly_0913.html?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=POLITICS|title=News from The Associated Press|work=ap.org|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/results/new-york/state-legislature | work=The New York Times | title=New York State Legislature Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-election-2012-results-article-1.1197541 | location=New York | work=Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal spending cuts====
One of Turner's campaign themes was fiscal recovery through cuts in federal spending.&lt;ref name="gop hopeful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="draws hecklers"/&gt; He said that the federal budget needed to be cut by as much as a third,&lt;ref name="NYTMagician"/&gt; that capital gains taxes should be eliminated, and corporate and individual income taxes reduced.&lt;ref name="Dailycaller"/&gt; He opposed what Democrats said were Republican plans to privatize Medicare and Social Security and turn Medicaid into a block-grant program, reportedly at the request of former New York mayor [[Ed Koch]], who supported him.&lt;ref name="koch endorses"/&gt; In endorsing Turner's opponent, ''The New York Times'' said that Turner's economic plan to reduce taxes without reducing benefits for current Medicare and Social Security recipients was unrealistic. "That would take a magician, not a businessman", said the Times.&lt;ref name="NYTMagician"/&gt; One month before the election, Turner admitted that an op-ed he written for the ''[[National Review]]'' calling for a one third reduction in federal spending and "an end to government dependencies" was "blatant pandering" to "a particular audience".&lt;ref name="gop hopeful"/&gt;

During his 2011 campaign, Turner stated he came out of retirement to run for Congress "to fix what's broken and go home. End subsidies. End government dependencies. Dramatically cut the budget by 30 or 35 percent. Slash capital-gains taxes down to zero. Cut taxes across the board. The rest of America's economic healing will happen naturally as a consequence", he said.&lt;ref name="nationalreview1"/&gt;  In 2011 he chose not to sign "the pledge," citing the need to compromise in the critical area of reducing the debt. In his 2011 campaign he cited illegal immigration as a major cause of U.S. unemployment.&lt;ref name="loud and clear"/&gt; To resolve the U.S. debt, he proposed eliminating the U.S Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency and reducing the size of the Department of Education.&lt;ref name="gop hopeful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="draws hecklers"/&gt;

====Tenure====
[[File:Turner Cross Bay.jpg|thumb|left|Turner at the [[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]], where he argued for the elimination of its tolls]]
Turner was sworn in on September 15, 2011.&lt;ref name="takes office"/&gt; Turner was mentored by Homeland Security Chair, [[Peter T. King]] (R-NY) in his transition to his new job.&lt;ref name="taps Weiner"/&gt; He met with his former rival, Anthony Weiner, discussing open constituent files and issues facing the district, including noise pollution and eroding beaches.&lt;ref name="taps Weiner"/&gt; He had a cordial and businesslike meeting with Weiner, though the two men have been described as polar opposites.&lt;ref name="taps Weiner"/&gt;

Within weeks of taking office, Turner was attacked by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC) for his no new tax pledge, and painted by the DCC as representing wealthy individuals and corporations rather than the average district voter.&lt;ref name="democrats attack"/&gt; Turner expressed support for [[hydrofracking]] in upstate New York, and would allow states to opt out of [[No Child Left Behind]].&lt;ref name="new congressman"/&gt; Remarking on the tenth anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Turner said he would "leave our military commitment in Afghanistan up to the generals in the field," adding that, "If they believe the sacrifice of our soldiers continues to be necessary to prevent attacks on U.S. soil, then we have no choice but to let them finish the task."&lt;ref name="no closure"/&gt; Turner was an advocate for removing the tolls on the [[Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge]], and applauded Gov. Cuomo for his motions towards changing the policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bobturner.house.gov/photo-gallery/congressman-bob-turner |title=Representative Robert Turner |publisher=Bobturner.house.gov |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916150525/http://bobturner.house.gov/photo-gallery/congressman-bob-turner |archive-date=September 16, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, a protester affiliated with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement shouted during Turner's ceremonial swearing-in.&lt;ref name="protester"/&gt;&lt;ref name="boots"/&gt; Turner then criticized the OWS demonstrators as socialist and praised America's capitalist system as a "beacon to the world".&lt;ref name="protester"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2011/46/turnerinauguration_fh_2011_11_17_q.html|title=Protester crashes Turner inauguration|author=Rebecca Henely|work=TimesLedger|location=Queens|date=|accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="boots"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/queens/take_out_the_trasher_TuMpvuv7PYzeL0vKMOjS4H|title=Ex-cop boots OWS heckler from congressman's swearing-in|author=Frank Rosario, Doug Auer and Bob Fredericks|date=November 14, 2011|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner voted for Paul Ryan's revised [[Ryan Plan#Roadmap for America's Future|budget plan]] in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pillifant |first=Reid |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/03/5586797/new-york-republicans-prepare-defend-paul-ryans-budget-plan-or-not |title=New York Republicans prepare to defend Paul Ryan's budget plan, or not |publisher=Capital New York |date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite reluctance that it would privatize [[Health care reforms proposed during the Obama administration#Privatize Medicare with a voucher system|Medicare and Social Security]].

Turner introduced The TEACH Act of 2012, which would provide a [[federal tax credit]] of up to $5,000 per year to families who send their children to non-public K-12 schools. Congressman Turner has said his goal with the TEACH Act is to ameliorate the “double taxation” burdening on parents paying for local school taxes and private schooling tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berke |first=Ned |url=http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2012/03/turner-pushes-bill-providing-5000-tax-credit-to-private-school-parents/ |title=Turner Pushes Bill Providing $5,000 Tax Credit To Private School Parents |publisher=Sheepshead Bay News |date=March 2, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal received wide support from the [[Orthodox Union]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ou.org/index.php/news/article/96158/ |title=OU Commends Representative Bob Turner’s Intro of "TEACH" Act for Schools |publisher=Orthodox Union |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeshiva congregations in Queens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishvoiceny.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=636:turner-proposes-tax-credit-for-parents&amp;catid=102:education&amp;Itemid=285 |title=Turner Proposes Tax Credit For Parents |publisher=The Jewish Voice |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fraser |first=Lisa A. |url=http://www.licjournal.com/view/full_story/17772125/article-Turner-s-TEACH-Act-could-save-parents-thousands-?instance=most_viewed |title=Turner's TEACH Act could save parents thousands |publisher=LIC/Astoria Journal |date=March 7, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetablet.org/?p=11151 |title=Tuition Tax Credits – Local Congressman Supports Relief for Parents Who Choose Parochial Schools |publisher=The Tablet |date=March 9, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is currently in [[House Committee on Ways and Means|committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr4075 |title=Tax and Education Assistance for Children (TEACH) Act of 2012 (H.R. 4075) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Committee assignments====
[[File:Turner Foreign Affairs committee.JPG|thumb|right|Turner seated at the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]]. On foreign affairs, he supported Israel and voted to restrict the threat of a nuclear Iran]]
The House Republican Steering Committee assigned Turner to three committees in the House, including '''[[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]''', '''[[United States House Committee on Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]]''', and '''[[United States House Committee on Homeland Security|Homeland Security]]'''. When asked about the news, Turner said he was "very excited to be appointed to three important House committees." Rep. [[Peter T. King|Peter King]] commended Turner's involvement in homeland security, saying Turner knew that "New York is the number one target." Turner sided with the [[Scandals and allegations of the New York City Police Department#NYPD Muslim surveillance controversy|NYPD's intelligence gathering of Arab-Americans]], and supported more funding for defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berke |first=Ned |url=http://www.sheepsheadbites.com/2012/04/video-turner-saber-rattles-on-iran-at-manhattan-beach-neighborhood-association/ |title=Video: Turner Saber Rattles On Iran At Manhattan Beach Neighborhood Association |publisher=Sheepshead Bay News |date=April 5, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being chosen to serve on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he stated, "I intend to forward my beliefs that it is in our national interest to defend our Middle East ally, Israel, and I will oppose further attempts by the U.N. to recognize a Palestinian state."&lt;ref name="foreign affairs"/&gt; He co-sponsored H.R. Bill 556, which condemned Iran for human rights abuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hres556 |title=Condemning the Government of Iran for its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of Youcef Nadarkhani on the charge of apostasy.

[[Harry Reid]] for stalling H.R. 1905, which would have allowed the U.S. to restrict Iran's trade internationally and bar U.S.-Iran diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turner |first=Bob |url=http://www.brooklyneagle.com/articles/iran-fast-approaching-point-no-return |title=Iran: Fast Approaching the Point of No Return |publisher=Brooklyn Daily Eagle |date=January 26, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tierney |first=Dominic |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/12/prepare-for-war-the-insane-plan-to-outlaw-diplomacy-with-iran/249478/ |title=Prepare for War: The Insane Plan to Outlaw Diplomacy with Iran |publisher=The Atlantic |date=December 6, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Brooklyn Daily'' opined that the assignments would not allow Turner to make use of his business experience and offered little opportunity for him to deliver on his promises of bringing "fiscal sanity" to Washington.&lt;ref name="committee assignments"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tracy |first=Thomas |url=http://www.brooklyndaily.com/stories/2011/41/mm_turnercommittees_2011_10_14_bd.html |title=His Turner: Bob named to vets, security committees |publisher=Brooklyn Daily |date=October 13, 2011 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His predecessor, Anthony Weiner, had served in the '''[[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]]''', which had the broadest jurisdiction of the committees.&lt;ref name="committee assignments"/&gt;

====Redistricting====
Following the 2010 Census, New York State lost two congressmen in its delegation, and Turner's district was split. ''Crain's New York Business''  said that Turner's win would make the New York Republican Party more likely to push for a "super Jewish" congressional district, extending the influence of Brooklyn's Orthodox Jewish community.&lt;ref name="crains"/&gt;  Under the new congressional district lines, he would possibly have faced [[Gregory Meeks]] in a more African-American and heavily Democratic constituency; Turner was not optimistic about his chances, telling reporters, "That’s a district that really can’t be moved. That’s not a legitimate shot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karlin |first=Rick |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/capitol/archives/121113/turner-thats-life-in-the-big-city/ |title=Capitol Confidential » Turner: ‘That’s life in the Big City’ |publisher=Blog.timesunion.com |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 U.S. Senate election===
{{Main|United States Senate election in New York, 2012}}
In March 2012, he announced he would challenge Democratic incumbent U.S. Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. Turner faced attorney [[Wendy E. Long]], and Nassau County Comptroller [[George Maragos]] in a primary election to face Gillibrand.  The 2012 New York State Republican convention split the endorsement among the three candidates, with enough support for each candidate to automatically appear on the ballot.  Turner lost the primary election to Long on June 26, 2012.&lt;ref name="timesledger.com"/&gt; He additionally sought the endorsement of New York's [[New York Conservative Party|Conservative Party]], which he also lost to Long.&lt;ref name="cpnys.org"/&gt;

===Queens County GOP Chairman===
On March 12, 2015, Turner was named chairman of the [[Queens]] borough Republican Party.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qchron.com/editions/central/bob-turner-to-head-queens-republican-party/article_6ec1ee80-c69f-11e4-a901-c76fe2c0835a.html&lt;/ref&gt; He was endorsed for the position by New York state Republican chairman [[Edward F. Cox|Ed Cox]], and voted in unanimously.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesledger.com/stories/2015/12/goprally_tl_2015_03_20_q.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Turner has been married to Peggy Turner, a foster care nurse for special needs children, for 48 years.&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; The couple has five adult children and 13 grandchildren and resides in [[Rockaway Point, Queens]].&lt;ref name="campaign site"/&gt; In August 2011, Turner revealed the couple's 1994 adoption of C.J. Holmstrom, an orphan whose parents had died from AIDS.&lt;ref name="adopted"/&gt; C.J.'s mother, Rosemary Holmstrom, had been on daytime talk shows in the 1980s discussing the death of her husband from AIDS, and her own HIV positive status.&lt;ref name="adopted"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CJ"/&gt; The Turners helped her and C.J. from that time on, adopting C.J after her death.&lt;ref name="adopted"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A movie, [[A Mother's Prayer]], was produced in 1995 based on Rosemary's life.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner’s home was flooded and subsequently burned to the ground during [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/us/after-storms-destruction-halting-return-in-northeast.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=James | last=Barron | title=In Storm's Wake, Rescues, Looting, and a Rising Death Toll | date=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century a '''captain of industry''' was a business leader whose means of amassing a personal fortune contributed positively to the country in some way. This may have been through increased productivity, expansion of markets, providing more jobs, or acts of [[philanthropy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scranton, Philip. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24287 "Fine Line Between Thief and Entrepreneur"]. Teachinghistory.org. Retrieved 12 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This characterisation contrasts with that of the [[robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]], a business leader using political means to achieve personal ends.

==Versus "robber baron"==

Some 19th-century industrialists who were called "captains of industry" overlap with those called "[[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]". These include people such as [[J. P. Morgan]], [[Andrew Carnegie]], [[Andrew W. Mellon]], [[Henry Ford]], and [[John D. Rockefeller]]. The term was coined by [[Thomas Carlyle]] in his 1843 book, ''[[Past and Present (book)|Past and Present]]''.

The education division of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] has prepared a lesson plan for schools asking whether "robber baron" or "captain of industry" is the better terminology. The lesson states that it attempts to help students "establish a distinction between robber barons and captains of industry. Students will uncover some of the less honorable deeds as well as the shrewd business moves and highly charitable acts of the great industrialists and financiers. It has been argued that only because such people were able to amass great amounts of capital could our country become the world's greatest industrial power. Some of the actions of these men, which could only happen in a period of economic [[laissez faire]], resulted in poor conditions for workers, but in the end, may also have enabled our present day standard of living."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/industrial-age-america-robber-barons-and-captains-industry#sect-preparation "The Industrial Age in America: Robber Barons and Captains of Industry" ''EDSITEment!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1777">'''Charles Sheldon Hislop''' (1908 - 12 June 1984) was a [[Cayman Islands|Caymanian]] [[entrepreneur]] who, in 1932, began the first public supply of [[electricity]] to [[Grand Cayman]].

Hislop was born in 1908, in the district of Bodden Town in the Cayman Islands to parents Lawrence Henry Hislop and Ella Hislop. He was the third of six children. Hislop and his brother, Edward, traveled to [[Tampa, Florida]] many times bringing new luxuries back to Grand Cayman. They purchased an electric generator, the Ruston 9HRC, with which they set up the company Cayman Ice and Electric. The two were also responsible for the first ice cream shop{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}. The store was first located on Harbour Drive near [[Hog Sty Bay]] and later moved to the corner of Cardinall Avenue and Harbour Drive. It was later relocated again to Shedden Road, where Mike’s Ice now is. At the shop, the public was also able to enjoy the island’s first jukebox, brought back from one of the many Tampa trips.

Hislop married Claire Watler in 1932. Together they had seven children: Rose-Marie, Mary-Lee, Charles Delano, James Lawrence Sheldon, Ella-Kaye, Philip Clayton and René Karl.

It is bounded on the east by Canal Street and the [[Providence River]], to the north by Smith Street, to the west by [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]], and to the south by Henderson Street. [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|I-95]] serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods of [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]], [[West End, Providence, Rhode Island|West End]], and [[Upper South Providence, Providence, Rhode Island|Upper South Providence]].  Most of the downtown is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Downtown Providence Historic District'''.

==History==
Originally known as 'Weybossett Neck' or 'Weybossett Side,' Downtown was first settled by religious dissidents from the First Congregational Society in 1746. Their settlement was located near present-day Westminster Street.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providenceri.com/Neighborhoods/downtwn.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060314100037/http://www.providenceri.com/Neighborhoods/downtwn.html |archivedate=2006-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown did not witness substantial development until the early 19th century, when Providence began to compete with [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. British forces had destroyed much of Newport during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War for Independence]], making the city's merchants vulnerable to competition from Providence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This prevented the development of a commercial district along the western bank of the Providence River.

During the industrialization of the late 19th century, an ever-expanding railroad industry emanating from [[Union Station (Providence)|Union Station]], eventually resulted in the complete paving over of the Great Salt Cove and the two branches of the [[Providence River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Cianci_City_07-29-07_EN6HKE5.382643c.html|title=Home – providencejournal.com – Providence, RI|work=providencejournal.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of decades of expansion was the isolation of [[Rhode Island State House|the state capitol]] from the rest of downtown by an imposing mass of railroad tracks, often called locally the "Chinese Wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As rail traffic dropped off, 75 percent by 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinruins.com/arch/stillinuse/unionstation/|title=Union Station|work=artinruins.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; city planners saw an opportunity to open up central land for development and unify downtown with the Capitol.  A [[Providence (Amtrak station)|new, smaller train station]] was built in 1986 a half mile north of its predecessor, and tracks were removed or routed underground.

The new land precipitated a massive remaking of the character of the city's downtown. From 1975 until 1982, under Mayor [[Vincent Cianci, Jr]], [[United States dollar|$]]606 million of local and national Community Development funds from were invested.  Roads were removed and the city's natural rivers were opened up and lined with a cobblestone-paved park called [[Waterplace Park]] in 1994, which is now host to popular [[WaterFire]] festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfire.org/|title=WaterFire Providence|work=WaterFire Providence|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private and public developments followed and the new area adjacent to the Capitol became known as Capitol Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Providence-Economy.html|title=Providence: Economy|work=city-data.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushered in by the construction of the new train station (1986), the development of the new land brought new buildings: The Gateway Building (1990), [[One Citizens Plaza]] (1991), Center Place (1992), a [[The Westin Providence|Westin hotel]] and Providence Convention Center (1993), [[Providence Place Mall]] (1999), Courtyard Marriott (2000), [[GTECH Corporation|GTECH]] headquarters (2006), [[The Residences at the Westin]] (2007), [[Waterplace]] condominiums (2007), and Capitol Cove still under construction.

In 2007, the Renaissance Providence Hotel opened in [[Masonic Temple (Providence)|Masonic Temple]] building, which had been abandoned amidst the [[Great Depression]] a half century prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/pvdbr-renaissance-providence-hotel/|title=Downtown Providence RI Hotels – Hotels in Providence Rhode Island – The Renaissance Providence|work=Marriott|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the Providence Plan, a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life, 64% of residents are white and 8.6% are Asian, both above the citywide averages of 54.4% and 6.2% respectively. 12% of the population is [[African-American]], 11% is [[Hispanic]], and 1% is [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. 43% of public school children speak a language other than English as their primary language.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://204.17.79.244/profiles/dtn_main.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004532/http://204.17.79.244/profiles/dtn_main.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The median family income is $42,558, over $10,000 above the citywide average. 14% of families live below the [[poverty threshold|poverty line]] while nearly 3.7% receive some form of public assistance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

15% of children under the age of six have been exposed to high quantities of lead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Government==
From north to south, Downtown includes portions of Wards 12, 13, 11. These wards are represented in the [[Providence City Council]] by Terrance Hassett, [[John J. Lombardi]], and Balbina A. Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://providenceri.com/CityCouncil/councilpage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061113193720/http://www.providenceri.com/CityCouncil/councilpage.html |archivedate=2006-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three councillors are [[Democratic Party (USA)|Democrats]]. Hassett currently serves as the majority leader.

Providence City Hall is located at 25 Dorrance Street, at the corner of Dorrance and Washington Street. It is immediately next to Kennedy Plaza and the Biltmore Hotel. It houses the City Council, the Mayor's Office, and the offices of some municipal agencies.

The [[Rhode Island State House]] is located on Smith Street at the northern edge of Downtown. It includes the chambers of the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] and the Governor's Office.

The Rhode Island Department of Education is headquartered in the Shepard Building at 255 Westminster Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ridoe.net/ |title=RiDOE |work=RiDOE |accessdate=31 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107050856/http://ridoe.net/ |archivedate=7 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
Various universities have facilities in Downtown Providence. These include:

*[[Brown University]] has recently bought several properties in the Jewelry District.

These include the RISD Library, founded in 1878. It is located at 15 Westminster Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.risd.edu/risd_library.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811044340/http://www.risd.edu/risd_library.cfm |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roger Williams University]] includes a small campus in Downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://50th.rwu.edu/history/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818212350/http://50th.rwu.edu/history/history.aspx |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[University of Rhode Island]]'s Feinstein Providence campus is centered at 80 Washington Street with other facilities in the Shepard building. The program is named for Rhode Island [[philanthropist]] [[Alan Shawn Feinstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://autocrat.uri.edu/prov.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811145125/http://autocrat.uri.edu/prov.html |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]] and the [[Providence College]] Friars men's basketball team play out of the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]] (formerly the Providence Civic Center) at 1 LaSalle Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/teams.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811233915/http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/teams.html |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
As part of the revitalization of Providence, the administrations of Mayors [[Vincent Cianci]] and [[David Cicilline]] have promoted Providence, especially Downtown, as an artistic center.  WaterFire has become perhaps the most visible symbol of Providence's development into an artistic center. Waterfire is an environmental art event created by [[Barnaby Evans]] that includes bon fires, [[gondolas]], and music. This event has become a major attraction for both Rhode Islanders and tourists.

Downtown includes two centers for the performing arts, the [[Providence Performing Arts Center]] and [[Trinity Repertory Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppacri.org/|title=Providence Performing Arts Center :: Home|author=Providence Performing Arts Center|work=ppacri.org|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityrep.com/|title=Welcome to Trinity Rep – The State Theater of Rhode Island|website=Trinityrep.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown is also home to [[AS220]], a non-profit community [[arts center]] that includes fifty-three artist live/work studios, four galleries, a performance space, a black box theatre, a dance studio, a bar and restaurant, a makerspace consisting of a printshop, fab lab, media arts lab and darkroom, and a free after-school arts education program for youth.

==Architecture==
Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings that are located throughout this area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. Fountain Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.

==Parks==
[[Image:Waterplacepark.JPG|right|280px|thumb|[[Waterplace Park]]]]

Downtown Providence contains three parks:

* [[Burnside Park, Providence|Burnside Park]] is located adjacent to [[Kennedy Plaza]]. At its center is an [[equestrian statue]] of [[American Civil War]] general, Rhode Island governor, [[United States Senator]] [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Adjacent to the park is an outdoor [[ice skating]] rink, the Alex and Ani City Center.
* [[Waterplace Park]] extends from the Great Salt Cove to the Riverwalk along the [[Providence River]]. The park hosts WaterFire festivals.
* Station Park, a green space adjacent to the [[Providence (Amtrak station)|Providence Amtrak Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo_20051123_polo23.e35e333.html|title=Home – providencejournal.com – Providence, RI|work=providencejournal.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Veterans Memorial Park and Market Square, along the border between Downtown and College Hill, are sometimes counted as Downtown parks.

==Central Downtown==
[[Image:Providence big three.jpg|thumb|Downtown Providence at [[Burnside Park, Providence, Rhode Island|Burnside Park]]]]

The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Most of the state's tallest buildings are found in this area. The [[List of tallest buildings in Providence|largest structure]], to date, is the art-deco-styled [[Industrial National Bank Building]] (formerly Industrial Trust Tower), at 426 feet (130 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380 |title=Bank of America Building, Providence| publisher=Emporis | year=2007 |accessdate = 2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest [[Sovereign Bank Tower (Providence)|One Financial Center]] (Sovereign Bank Tower), designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 | title=One Financial Plaza| year=2006 | publisher=Emporis | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the two is [[50 Kennedy Plaza]]. The [[Textron Tower]] is another core building in the Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the [[Providence Biltmore]] hotel and the [[Westminster Arcade]], the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 |title=Providence Buildings, Real Estate, Architecture, Skyscrapers, and Construction Database |year=2005 |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=2005-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529062647/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 |archivedate=2005-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kennedy Plaza]] is a major business and transportation hub. Surrounding the plaza are Providence City Hall, Burnside Park, the Bank of America Building, One Financial Center, 50 Kennedy Plaza, Bank of America Ice Skating Rink, and the US District Court building. The plaza itself includes the central station for the [[Rhode Island Public Transit Authority]] (RIPTA) and a police substation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripta.com/news/index.php?section%3D10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810200920/http://www.ripta.com/news/index.php?section=10 |archivedate=2007-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providencepolice.com/dist1sub.html|title=Police Department – Districts – District 1 – City of Providence|website=Providencepolice.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3890">The '''duty of loyalty''' is often called the cardinal principal of [[Fiduciary|fiduciary relationships]], but is particularly strict in the law of [[Equity (law)|trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Restatement of Trusts, Third ed.|date=2003–2008|publisher=American Law Institute|location=Chapter 15|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that context, the term refers to a [[trustee]]'s [[duty]] to administer the [[Trust law|trust]] solely in the interest of the [[beneficiaries]], and following the [[Trust Law|terms of the trust]].   It generally prohibits a trustee from engaging in transactions that might involve [[self-dealing]] or even an appearance of [[conflict of interest]].   Furthermore, it requires a fiduciary to deal with [[Transparency_(behavior)|transparency]] regarding [[Materiality_(law)|material facts]] known to them in interactions with beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Restatement of Trusts, Third ed.|date=2003–2008|publisher=American Law Institute|location=Section 78|pages=93-94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

{{Companies law}}
Duty of loyalty in [[corporation law]] to describe a fiduciaries' "conflicts of interest and requires fiduciaries to put the corporation's interests ahead of their own."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"&gt;''Corporations.'' Fifth Edition. Examples and Explanations. Alan R. Palmiter. ASPEN. New York. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; "Corporate fiduciaries breach their duty of loyalty when they divert corporate assets, opportunities, or information for personal gain."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;

It is generally acceptable if a director makes a decision for the corporation that profits both him and the corporation.  The duty of loyalty is breached when the director puts his or her interest in front of that of the corporation.

==Conditions of self-dealing transaction==
* ''Flagrant Diversion'': corporate official stealing tangible corporate assets - "a plain breach of the fiduciary's duty of loyalty since the diversion was unauthorized and the corporation received no benefit in the transaction."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;
* ''Self-Dealing'': A key player and the corporation are on opposite sides of the transaction or the key player has helped influence the corporation's decisions to enter the transaction. "When a fiduciary enters into a transaction with the corporation on unfair terms, the effect is the same as if he had appropriated the difference between the transaction's fair value and the transaction's price."&lt;ref name="E&amp;E1"/&gt;
*''Executive Compensation''
*''Usurping [[Corporate opportunity|Corporate Opportunity]]''
*''Disclosure to Shareholders''
*''Trading on Inside Information''
*''Selling out''

==Ways the proponent of a self-dealing transaction can avoid invalidation==
* By showing approval by a majority of disinterested directors
* Showing ratification by shareholders (MBCA 8.63)
* Showing transaction was inherently fair (MBCA 8.61)

==U.S. Model Business Corporation Act==
Section 8.60 of the [[Model Business Corporation Act]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/library/onlinepublications/mbca2002.pdf#page=92 |title=Model Business Corporation Act, Section 8.60 (PDF) |publisher=American Bar Foundation |accessdate=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; states there is a [[conflict of interest]] when the director knows that at the time of a commitment that he or a related person is 1) a party to the transaction or 2) has a beneficial financial interest in the transaction that the interest and exercises his influence to the detriment of the corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7550">'''Financial intelligence''' is a type of [[business intelligence]] constituted of the knowledge and skills gained from understanding [[finance]] and [[accounting]] principles in the business world. Although a fairly new term, financial intelligence has its roots in [[organizational development]] research,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6570.1985.tb00538.x | last1 = Lawler | first1 = E.E. III | year = 1985 | title = Education, Management Style, and Organizational Effectiveness | url = | journal = Personnel Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 1–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in the field of employee participation.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E.E. III (1986). ''High Involvement Management''. Jossey-Bass:San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial intelligence has emerged as a [[best practice]] and [[core competency]] in many organizations leading to improved financial results, increased employee morale, and reduced employee turnover. Many organizations include financial intelligence programs in their leadership development curriculum. Financial intelligence is not an innate skill, rather it is a learned set of skills that can be developed at all levels.&lt;ref name="Berman"&gt;Berman, K., Knight, J., Case, J., (2006). ''Financial Intelligence: A Managers Guide to Knowing What the Numbers Really Mean''. Massachusetts: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of understanding ==
The four areas of understanding&lt;ref name="Berman" /&gt; that make up financial intelligence are:
 
''Understanding the foundation.'' Financial intelligence requires an understanding of the basics of financial measurement including the [[income statement]], the [[balance sheet]], and the [[cash flow statement]]. It also requires knowing the difference between [[cash]] and [[profit (accounting)|profit]] and why a balance sheet balances.

''Understanding the art.'' Finance and accounting are an art as well as a science. The two disciplines must try to quantify what can't always be quantified, and so must rely on rules, estimates, and assumptions. Financial intelligence ensures people are able to identify where the artful aspects of finance have been applied to the numbers, and know how applying them differently might lead to different conclusions.

''Understanding analysis.'' Financial intelligence includes the ability to analyze the numbers in greater depth. This includes being able to calculate profitability, leverage, liquidity and efficiency ratios and understanding the meaning of the results. Conducting ROI analysis and interpreting the results are also part of financial intelligence.

''Understanding the big picture.'' Financial intelligence also means being able to understand a business's financial results in context - that is, within the framework of the big picture. Factors such as the [[economy]], the competitive environment, regulations and changing customer needs and expectations as well as new technologies all affect how the numbers are interpreted.

Financial intelligence is not just theoretical book learning. It also requires practice and real world application. In the [[corporate]] world, managers can display financial intelligence by speaking the language, that is, asking questions about the numbers when something doesn't make sense, reviewing financial reports and using the information to understand the company's strengths and weaknesses, using ROI analysis, [[working capital management]], and [[ratio analysis]] to make decisions, and identifying where the art of finance has been applied.

== Roots of financial intelligence ==
In 1954, Peter F. Drucker, in his groundbreaking book, ''The Practice of Management'', wrote the following. &lt;blockquote&gt;
"[The worker] should know how his work relates to the work of the whole. He should know what he contributes to the enterprise...if he lacks information, he will lack both incentive and means to improve his performance."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is in the best interest of the organization that the worker have the information."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The concept of financial intelligence in organizations comes from the research of several well-known organizational development academics, including Dennis Denison, Edward Lawler and Jeffrey Pfeffer. For example, the research of Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford &lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. E. III, Mohrman, S.A., Ledford, G.E. Jr. (1995)., ''Creating High Performance Organizations''. (1995) Jossey -Bass: San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the indices that have the most impact on both direct performance outcomes in organizations (productivity, customer satisfaction, quality and speed) and on profitability and competitiveness were sharing information and developing knowledge.

Karen Berman's research,&lt;ref&gt;Karen R. Berman, "Information and the Effectiveness of Employee Participation in Organizations" (PhD dissertation, [[California School of Professional Psychology]], 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; asked specifically if information (operationalized by teaching business basics to improve financial intelligence and sharing information on a regular basis) improves the results of employee participation, as seen through organizational performance improvement and employee attitude improvement. The results of the study found that certain financial performance measures improved and that employee turnover decreased. &lt;br /&gt;
Financial literacy also has its roots in open book management.&lt;ref&gt;Case, John. (1995) ''Open Book Management: The Coming Business Revolution''. HarperBusiness:New York&lt;/ref&gt; A core tenet of [[open-book management]] is business literacy, that is, ensuring everyone understands how the business measures financial success.

== Financial intelligence in organizations ==
Many companies, (Southwest Airlines being a prime example) consider financial intelligence a core competency or best practice. Several universities, including [[Harvard Business School]], [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania|Wharton]] and [[Stanford]] have programs targeted at the corporate world, mostly at the leadership level, to increase the financial intelligence in organizations. There are a variety of methods to increase financial intelligence in organizations, including classroom training, webinar training, and business simulations. Training companies have supported these efforts as well, including Business Literacy Institute, Paradigm Learning, and Workplace Development.

Proponents of financial intelligence in organizations believe that if employees, managers and leaders understand financial information and how financial success is measured, they will make decisions and take action based on an understanding of the financial impact of those decisions. If everyone knows the financial goals of the company, for example, and knows how to make decisions that support those financial goals, then the company is going to be more financially successful.&lt;ref&gt;Dolezalek, H, "Working Smart", Training Magazine, April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Employee owned companies are one group of organizations that are focused on ensuring everyone in the company is financially intelligent, as employees are owners and therefore must understand the financial side of the business.

'''Flat Rock Assembly Plant''', formerly known as Ford's Michigan Casting Center (MCC) (1972–81), Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA (1987–92) and '''AutoAlliance International''' (1992–2012), is a [[Ford Motor Company]] assembly plant located at {{nowrap|1 International}} Drive in [[Flat Rock, Michigan]] in [[Metro Detroit]]. 

The plant currently comprises {{convert|2900000|sqft|m2}} of production space and employs 3,510 hourly workers and 140 salaried workers &amp;mdash; and currently manufactures the [[Ford Mustang]] coupe and the tenth generation [[Lincoln Continental#Tenth generation (2017–present)|Lincoln Continental]].

==History==
[[File:FORD MOTOR COMPANY'S NEW CASTING PLANT AT FLAT ROCK - NARA - 549726.jpg|thumb|right|Casting plant, 1973.]]
Following three years of work and the largest single investment by Ford, the Michigan Casting Center (MCC) opened in January 1972, at the time one of the most technologically advanced casting facilities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Opens a Giant Casting Centre|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6GwtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4YkFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=2695%2C4464032|work=Schenectady Gazette|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=20 January 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the sizable capital investment, frequent union labor problems and work injuries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit plant|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jTQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=d1EMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20opened&amp;pg=1110%2C375353|work=Windsor Star|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=1 November 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and declining demand for the V8 engine blocks produced there led to the facility's closure in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ford Will Close Unit in Flat Rock|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/15/business/ford-will-close-unit-in-flat-rock.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=15 September 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flat Rock Mayor Hopeful|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IFwiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AasFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=michigan%20casting%20center%20closed&amp;pg=1337%2C2901659|work=The Argus-Press|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=3 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worker, [[Robert Williams (robot fatality)|Robert Williams]], was killed by an [[industrial robot]] arm on January 25, 1979. He is the first known human to be killed by a robot.

[[Mazda|Mazda Motor Corporation]] started construction of a new building on the site of the Michigan Casting Center in 1985 and cars started production at Mazda Motor Manufacturing USA in September 1987 with the [[Mazda MX-6]] and [[Ford Probe]] coupes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manji|first=James F.|title=Building cars with Mazda quality.

Ford repurchased a 50% share in the plant on April 15, 1992, and it officially became a joint-venture and was renamed AutoAlliance International on July 1, 1992.&lt;ref name=Mazda2008&gt;{{cite web|title=North American All-New Mazda6 Production Begins at AutoAlliance International|url=http://www.mazda.com/publicity/release/2008/200807/080723.html|work=Mazda|accessdate=11 April 2013|date=23 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The plant began production of all models of the [[Mazda 626]] sold in America starting in 1993.  During this era, [[Deepak Ahuja]] was Chief Financial Officer of the joint venture.&lt;ref name="star-20111111"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/magazine/fall-2011/PDF/alumni-profile-deepak-ahuja.pdf|title=Alumni profile: Deepak Ahuja|work=McCormick Magazine|issue=Fall 2011|page=42|date=11 November 2011|accessdate=18 September 2018|first=Leanne|last=Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ford Contour]]-derived [[Mercury Cougar]] was produced at the plant from 1998 to 2002. Production of North American [[Mazda 6]] began in the 2003 model year, followed by the [[Ford Mustang]] starting in 2005.

The last Mazda 6 rolled off the line on Friday, August 24, 2012, with Mazda discontinuing production on American soil, effectively ending the 20 year joint-venture between Mazda and Ford. Mazda moved production of the Mazda 6 back to the [[Hofu (Mazda factory)|Hofu factory]] in Japan and opened a new factory in Salamanca, Mexico to build the [[Mazda 2]] and [[Mazda 3]] subcompact and compact cars.

On September 10, 2012, Ford Motor Company re-took full management control of the plant, renaming it the Ford Flat Rock Assembly Plant, and confirming $555 million in investments designed to retool the plant for the production of the 2013 [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] midsize sedan.&lt;ref name="media.ford.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112164832/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=37067 |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 15, 2015, Ford confirmed that the new 2017 [[Lincoln Continental]] sedan would be produced at the Flat Rock plant starting in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lincoln Continental to be made at Ford Flat Rock plant|url=http://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2015/07/15/ford-confirms-lincoln-continental-production-flat-rock-michigan-plant/30197835|date=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2017, Ford announced that it will begin manufacturing an electric small SUV by 2020, and a high passenger volume autonomous vehicle designed for commercial ride hailing or ride sharing by 2021, both to be built at Flat Rock.&lt;ref&gt;https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2017/01/03/ford-adding-electrified-f-150-mustang-transit-by-2020.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">'''Focused improvement''' in the Theory of Constraints is an ensemble of activities aimed at elevating the performance of any system, especially a business system, with respect to its goal by eliminating its constraints one by one and by ''not'' working on non-constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focused improvement|url = http://informationquickfind.com/f/fo/focused_improvement.html|website = informationquickfind.com|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Focused improvement''' can also be defined in simpler terms as a process that identifies the systems problems and then modifies the whole system in order to find the most cost effective,time saving and least disruptive solutions in order to optimize the system.

'''"Focused Improvement''' is the process of applying systematic problem solving methods to manufacturing. The process relies on aligning the correct method to the correct scenario".

== Development and Apparition  ==
Focused improvement was developed as a working part of the Theory of Constraints management philosophy by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] in his 1984 book titled ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'', that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals. Unlike other popular performance improvement methods, such as [[Total quality management|TQM]] or [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]], '''F.I.''' focuses on solving real life problems and not on increasing the costs and distractions for the management's attention.

== Focused improvement V.S. Total Quality Management (TQM) ==
No general agreement has been reached about the characteristics of F.I. or TQM but to some extent we can observe similar traits in implementations of these processes.

=== Traits of Focused improvement ===
# Identify the system's constraint(s).
# Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
# Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
# Elevate the system's constraint(s). 
# Communicate the new approach and move to the next improvement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focused Improvements for Management Methods|url = http://www.manageprojectsbetter.com/focused-improvements.html|website = Mark Waldof Consulting LLC|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traits of TQM ===
# "Quality is defined by customers' requirements."
# "Top management has direct responsibility for quality improvement."
# "Increased quality comes from systematic analysis and improvement of work processes."
# "Quality improvement is a continuous effort and conducted throughout the organization." 
These two philosophies have the same main goal but they go about achieving it two different ways. The Fi delivers short term results that can be translated into long term success if the process is repeated correctly without allowing it to lose momentum. The TQM has at its base client satisfaction but it only yields long term results. When choosing one of these two processes management has to take into account what are the company needs.

== Uses and potential ==
Products that are based on embedded computer systems has seen a rapid increase. During this time the features that are controlled or supported by software systems that are embedded have suffered an increase in their role becoming crucial. All these developments make it necessary to create and innovate new approaches for software process improvement that focus on improving specific product traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Product Focused Process Improvement: Experiences of Applying the PROFES Improvement Methodology at DRÄGER|url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=2A0769CB6F04B48AE8DC14EBBEB3304F?doi=10.1.1.136.8336&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|author=Adriana Bicego, Pieter Derks, Pasi Kuvaja, Dietmar Pfahl|citeseerx=10.1.1.136.8336|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focused improvement can be used not only in business systems but in any type of system be it healthcare, education, waste management, space exploration systems(NASA etc.)

== Functioning principles ==
The  FI is based on the [[Thinking processes (theory of constraints)|Five Thinking Processes]] that enable it to work in any cognitive system. The working principle of the five thinking processes is represented by the users ability to answer the following questions:
# ''What to change?''
# ''What to change it into?''
# ''How to cause the change?''
# ''Why Change?''
# ''How to maintain the process of ongoing improvement ?''
If all questions have an answer then the Focused improvement&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = focused improvement «|url = http://www.kcts.co.uk/blog/tag/focused-improvement|website = www.kcts.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-02|last = Oxton|first = Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be applied with relative ease

== Useful quotes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = http://www.tpmconsulting.org/english_show.php?id=8|url = http://www.tpmconsulting.org/english_show.php?id=8|website = www.tpmconsulting.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ==
"Focused improvement includes all activities that maximize the overall effectiveness of equipment, processes, and plants through uncompromising elimination of losses'''*''' and improvement of performance."&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki, T., Ed. (1994). TPM in Process Industries. Portland, OR, Productivity Press.Tajiri, M. and F. Gotoh (p.1992). TPM Implementation - A Japanese Approach. New York, McGrawHill.&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of Focused Improvement is to assure that the equipment maintains a peak performance all the time.

"The fact is machines do virtually 100 percent of the product manufacturing work. The only thing we people do, whether we’re operators, technicians, engineers, or managers, is to tend to the needs of the machines in one way or another. The better our machines run, the more productive our shop floor, and the more successful our business."&lt;ref&gt;Leflar, J. (2001) p.15. Practical TPM. Portland, OR, Productivity Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The driving concept behind Focused Improvement is bringing your losses as close to zero as possible.

"Maximizing equipment effectiveness requires the complete elimination of failures, defects, and other negative phenomena – in other words, the wastes and losses incurred in equipment operation."&lt;ref&gt;Nakajima, S. (1988) p.19 Introduction to Total Productive Maintenance. Cambridge, MA, ProductivityPress.&lt;/ref&gt;

'Franchise consulting' traditionally meant the same consultant-to-client relationship as any other industry wherein the consultant charges a 'fee for services'. But, as of the late 1990s the term 'consultant' was adopted by franchise salesmen and brokers that began representing themselves as "free" consultants to prospective franchise buyers. These 'free consultants' provide introduction services for franchise opportunity sellers with whom they have worked out a pay-for-sale agreement. Therefore, they are driven by the desire to connect the 'client' to a particular franchise.

There are still franchise consultants who charge clients for input whether the client desires advice on buying a franchise or assistance becoming a franchisor of their own (hopefully quality) business. Know the difference between a commissioned salesperson and a fee-for-service consultant.

==Overview==

BROKER VS. CONSULTANT - a struggle to be appreciated:

Especially since the Federal Trade Commission Franchise Rule on Franchising&lt;ref&gt;16 CFR 437 and 437, Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunities&lt;/ref&gt; changed the requirement that representatives of franchisors as salespeople disclose their past personal and professional history, there has been an onslaught of salespeople titling themselves 'consultants', and that includes several firms offering to train new members in as little as two weeks to become franchise experts prepared to advise new buyers as to the best opportunity in which to invest their available funds. Certainly there are competent 'franchise brokers' that understand the industry who can help advise buyers, but for the most part, a freshly minted broker (self-titled 'franchise consultant') is not equipped to assist a buyer with decisions concerning their entrepreneurial future.

The following is the way that some may describe the broker, or in their language, a consultant:

Much like a real estate agent, the franchise "recruitment consultant" typically charges no upfront fees to "buyers" (franchisees); instead, he or she receives the bulk of his or her income from "sellers" (franchisers) and thus operates as a biased conduit between the two.  It is important to understand that franchisors do not employ franchise consultants, but they do employ franchise brokers who call themselves franchise consultants.  They establish relationships with these franchise consulting firms.  The role of the franchise consultant is to build a win-win relationship between the franchisor and the potential franchisee.  Quality franchise consulting firms that have a large footprint in the franchising industry and help screen out the franchises that don't meet the high standards that are set by franchise experts.

Consultants' services are "free" to the potential buyer or franchisee only to the extent payment goes from the franchisee to the franchise company then into the brokers pocket, but these franchise brokers receive a substantial commission of up to 50% or more of the franchise fee the buyer pays to the franchise company.  The potential buyer would pay exactly the same franchise fee as he or she would pay if they had contacted the same franchise on their own.  It is illegal for the franchisor to charge anything additional for the use of a Franchise Consultant, unless this is disclosed in the Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD).  So why would a franchisors work with franchise consultants?  They do because franchise consultants screen out all of the under qualified candidates and only introduce to them highly screened quality candidates that fit their business model.  Quality franchises are not concerned with paying the consultant a percentage of the initial franchise fee because they are looking at the long term residual value of on-going royalties from the franchisee. Of course, there are a substantial number of franchises that use franchise brokers (misleadingly called "franchise consultants") as a way to sell a large number of franchises in a network where maximizing franchise sales is paramount over franchise network survival.

There are many licensed attorneys who act as franchise consultants and who center their practices on their expertise in franchising and who will consult/represent the franchisee or the franchisor under a fee agreement.  Attorneys cannot take fees from franchisors and consult with the franchisee at the same time because this would represent a conflict of interest for an attorney under state laws.  A consultant package from an attorney will, of course, be expensive, but the attorney has the incentive and the duty under the law to "vet" the franchisor and perform "due diligence" on the offering on behalf of his/her client when he/she offers a consultant package to a client. It is critical to use a franchise attorney who also has an MBA, as this will ensure due diligence from both a legal and business perspective.

A few larger franchise consulting firms have branched out themselves, essentially "franchising" their franchise consulting businesses.  And industry publications such as [[Franchise Business Review]] and [[Entrepreneur]] regularly quote high performing franchise consultants as reliable article sources. High performing franchise consultants are those who have a past performance record of providing quality matches for clients and a high success rate of their clients. But buyer beware applies - many of these highly touted franchise consultants represent franchise companies that have little, if any, name recognition.

In addition however, smaller and more pragmatic consultancy practices may work much closer with smaller businesses and work with them to franchise their business over time.  This enables the business to begin franchising their business much sooner, often within 2 years of successful operation of a local model and for much less money - therefore risk, than using some of the larger consultancy practices.  Franchise consultancies of this kind are paid for by the franchisor not the franchisee - therefore mitigates risk on behalf of the franchisee of being sold something which is not necessarily "right for them" but rather gives the franchise consultants a nice commission.

He obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Chiao Tung University]] and later moved to Hong Kong in 1952. He became the director and managing director of Ryoden (Holdings) Ltd and other companies.

He was appointed to various public positions, including chairman of the Transport Tribunal, the Financial Committee of the [[Hong Kong Housing Authority]] and the Council for Recreation and Sport and a promoter of sport activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hong Kong Housing Authority annual report | publisher=Hong Kong Housing Authority|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also member of the Transport Advisory Committee. He was also member of the [[Urban Council]] and the [[Wan Chai District Council|Wan Chai District Board]].

Hu was first appointed [[unofficial member]] of the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong]] in 1979. He went on to serve in the council until 1991. In 1990, Hu became the founding chairman of the [[Liberal Democratic Federation of Hong Kong]] (LDF) which consisted of businesspeople to contest against the liberal [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 first direction election]]. The Federation won three seats in the end and was defeated by pro-democracy camp. The LDF quickly went decline as the pro-business [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] and pro-Beijing [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB) were formed in the early 1990s. In 1997, LDF was merged into another pro-business party [[Hong Kong Progressive Alliance]].

During the 1990s, Hu took part in negotiation and preparatory works for the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He was a member of the [[Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR]] and a delegate to the Chinese [[People's Political Consultative Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=105|title=Seeing Red: China's Uncompromising Takeover of Hong Kong|last=Allen|first=Jamie|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Rose Young Sai-cheung and had two sons. One of his sons, [[Herman Hu]], was also a businessman and politician.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="812">'''Interlineation''' is a [[legal]] term that signifies writing has been inserted between earlier language. &lt;ref&gt;''Black's Law Dictionary'' interlineation (9th ed. 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to indicate the insertion of new language between previous sentences in a [[contract]], though it may also be used in other contexts. &lt;ref&gt;71 C.J.S. Pleading § 437 ("Mode of making amendment—By interlineation"); 3B C.J.S. Alteration of Instruments § 87.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, interlineations can help to clarify specific points of a legal contract, and are useful if some of the terms of a contract become unclear later. They are typically initialed and dated, so as to make a record of changes and agreements to a particular contract.

'''InternetNZ''' ("Internet New Zealand Inc." and originally formed as the '''Internet Society of New Zealand''') is a not-for-profit open membership organisation dedicated to protecting and promoting the Internet for New Zealand. Its vision is for a better world through a better Internet and it promotes the Internet’s benefits and protect its potential. InternetNZ focuses on advancing an open and uncaptureable Internet for New Zealand.
 
It provides a voice for the Internet in New Zealand. It lobbies the government. And it gives a helping hand to Internet users across New Zealand.

InternetNZ is the designated manager for the .nz Internet domain, and through this role it represents New Zealand at a global level. It provides community funding to promote research and the discovery of ways to improve the Internet. It informs people about the Internet and ensures it is well understood by those making decisions that help shape it. Every year it brings the Internet community together at NetHui to share wisdom and best practice on the state of the Internet.

== Current Councillors ==

The elected InternetNZ council as at 26 July 2018 are  Jamie Baddeley (President), Joy Liddicoat (Vice President), Sarah Lee, Kate Pearce, Dave Moskovitz, Richard Wood, Amber Craig, Kelly Buehler, Richard Hulse, Don Stokes, Kate Pearce, and Keith Davidson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=InternetNZ Council | url=https://internetnz.nz/internetnz-council | accessdate=2015-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Internet Society of New Zealand was originally formed in 1995 in order to take responsibility for the [[.nz]] [[ccTLD]].

At the annual meeting on 4 August 2008, InternetNZ's [[Peter Dengate Thrush]] was made an InternetNZ Fellow because of his record of contribution to Internet policy issues in New Zealand and internationally.&lt;ref name="Dengate Thrush Fellow"&gt;{{cite web | title=Peter Dengate Thrush named InternetNZ Fellow | url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/SC0808/S00012.htm | accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Internet Society===
Despite sharing many aims with the [[Internet Society]], InternetNZ has never been a chapter of that organisation.  In April 2008, the organisation formally changed its official name to "Internet New Zealand Inc." to recognise common usage and to specifically reflect these differences.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  InternetNZ did, however, join the Internet Society in 2006 as an organisational member.&lt;ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ichikowitz was born in the mining town of [[Springs, Gauteng|Springs]], South Africa, where he experienced first-hand the country's transition.&lt;ref name="Tilley2012"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Can-Do Man of Action |first=Les |last=Tilley |url= |magazine=Forbes |page=54  |date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Louis, imported [[Suzuki]] motorcycles, setting the foundation on which Ichikowitz would later build his own company.&lt;ref name="Tilley2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arms and the Man |first=Alex |last=Duval Smith |url= |magazine=Monocle |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
During the past twenty years, Ichikowitz has developed a number of businesses including  [[defence industry|defence]] and [[aerospace]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligenceonline.com/insiders/INT/AFRICA%2FCENTRAL%20ASIA%2FMIDDLE%20EAST/2016/09/07/ivor-ichikowitz-the-worldwide-connections-of-the-south-african-arms-magnate,108179801-BE1 |title=Ivor Ichikowitz, the worldwide connections of the South African arms magnate |publisher=intelligenceonline.com |date=7 September 2016 |accessdate=2016-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; mining, oil and gas, agriculture and sustainable development, [[property]], retail and tourism.&lt;ref name="Tilley2012" /&gt;

In addition to his role at Paramount Group, Ichikowitz is the executive chairman of private equity group TransAfrica Capital, which invests in scientific research and development projects.&lt;ref name="Tilley2012" /&gt;

== Controversy ==
Ichikowitz has been criticised for being a "close ally" of the ruling [[African National Congress]] (ANC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephan Hofstatter, Rob Rose And Mzilikazi Wa Afrika |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/specialreports/stinvestigations/2013/03/27/arms-and-the-man-who-would-be-king |title=Arms and the man who would be king |publisher=Times LIVE |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for providing President [[Jacob Zuma]] with an aircraft to use for an ANC fundraising and business trip to Lebanon and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypress.co.za/features/ivor-the-invincible-20101010/ |title=Ivor the invincible |publisher=City Press |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2010-03-05-crony-capitalists-on-jzs-coattails |title=Crony capitalists on JZ's coat-tails &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; National &amp;#124; Mail &amp; Guardian |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another flight by Zuma to the United States on an aircraft owned by Ichikowitz in 2011 caused considerable controversy when the cost ([[South African rand|R]]6.3 million) was questioned in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/da-wants-answers-on-zuma-s-us-trip-1.1141559 |title=DA wants answers on Zuma's US trip – The Star |publisher=IOL.co.za |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official presidential aircraft, operated by the [[South African Air Force]], was not available for the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ewn.co.za/2011/11/24/Zumas-R63m-US-flight |title=Eyewitness News: Zuma's R6.3m US flight |publisher=Ewn.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ewn.co.za/2011/09/20/More-questions-raised-over-Zumas-hired-jet |title=Eyewitness News: More questions raised over Zuma's hired jet |publisher=Ewn.co.za |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19294:zuma-flies-qair-ichikowitzq&amp;catid=35:Aerospace&amp;Itemid=107 |title=Zuma flies "Air Ichikowitz" |publisher=DefenceWeb |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ichikowitz has also been criticised for his involvement in the controversial [[Oil-for-Food Programme]] in the aftermath of the [[Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sareporter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=490&amp;Itemid=41 |title=The arms dealer who flies Zuma |publisher=sareporter.com |date=13 March 2009 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Assaf''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: جوزيف عساف; born 1944) is an Australian businessman and expert in the field of communication to multicultural audiences. He became a Member (AM) of the [[Order of Australia]] in the Queen’s birthday 2010 honour list for his work in this field.&lt;ref&gt;Nakhoul, Ghassan 'Generosity of the spirit rewarded', SBS Arabic, 16 June 2010. retrieved at http://www.sbs.com.au/yourlanguage/arabic/highlight/page/id/90837/t/Generosity-of-the-spirit-rewarded/in/english&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known for being the founder of the [[Ethnic Business Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Ethnic Business Awards 2005 Winners Announced, Small Business Owners Guide | accessdate=29 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
In 1977 Joseph established Ethnic Communications, the world’s first agency to specialize in [[multicultural marketing]]. He also founded Multicultural Marketing News, a free specialist magazine. Assaf has been an advisor for many public and private institutions on Multicultural Communication, including a three-year term as a member of the National Multicultural Advisory Council from 1994–1997, a member of the Australia Foundation for Culture and the Humanities where he served a 2-year term in 1995, and more recently, a member of a four-person External reference group appointed by the Federal Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs to review the points test to assess skilled migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Day 2- The Present, 50th Anniversary of Australian Citizenship Conference | accessdate=30 July 2010 | url=http://www.law.unimelb.edu.au/events/citizen/Present.html#Assaf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Joseph Assaf founded the Ethnic Business Awards, which today stands as the longest running business awards in Australia. Acting as "a continuous reminder and celebration of [...] the great and positive contributions of migrants to our country."&lt;ref&gt;Nakhoul, as above at n 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Joseph Assaf published ''In Someone Else’s Shoes'', a memoir detailing his experiences as a migrant in Australia and also exploring his understanding of the nature of Australian society in the context of multiculturalism. Former Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] said of the book that it "is a great story writ large about the lives of so many who have come to this country from afar and made this country great.".&lt;ref&gt;Speech by Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, 2008 Ethnic Business Awards, retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hcifbqqkn3k&amp;feature=player_embedded#! on 06/08/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2338">'''Juan Carlos Lectoure''' (June 10, 1936{{spaced ndash}}March 2, 2002), nicknamed "Tito", was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] businessman, mainly involved in [[boxing]] events and former owner of [[Buenos Aires]]'s [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park]] stadium.

He was born and raised in the [[Balvanera]] section of [[Buenos Aires]], and at the age of 14, took up boxing at the Buenos Aires Gymnastics and Fencing Club; an injury, however, resulted in his mother's insistence that he abandon the pastime.&lt;ref name=gente&gt;[http://www.gente.com.ar/nota.php?ID=2604 ''Gente'': ''Adiós, Tito'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lectoures had been partners in the Luna Park coliseum since 1941, and he inherited the lucrative business from his father, who died in 1950. Mentored by Juan Manuel Morales, Lectoure took control of the venue at age 20, and during the era from 1956 to 2000, well-known figures in Argentine boxing, such as [[Horacio Accavallo]], [[Ringo Bonavena]], [[Pedro Ruben Decima|Pedro Décima]], [[Víctor Galíndez]], [[Nicolino Locche]], [[Carlos Monzón]], [[Pascual Pérez (boxer)|Pascual Pérez]] and [[Juan Roldán]] all either debuted or fought title bouts promoted by Lectoure at Luna Park. The venue was also well known for its variety of music recitals, hosting musicians from [[Argentine tango]] [[bandoneon]]ist [[Aníbal Troilo]] to the Godfather of [[Soul music|Soul]], [[James Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=377644 ''La Nación'': ''Murió Tito Lectoure'' {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lectoure later promoted boxing in [[Miami, Florida]].

A chain smoker until 1982, Lectoure developed heart disease and underwent four [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|bypasses]] in 1990, performed by noted cardiac specialist Dr. [[René Favaloro]]. He died in 2002, at age 65.&lt;ref name=gente/&gt;

'''Lin Hsin-i''' ({{zh|t=林信義 |s=林信义 |first=t |p=Lín Xìnyì}}), a [[Taiwan]]ese businessman. He served in the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] administration as Minister of Economic Affairs between 2000 and 2002, then as Vice Premier between 2002 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Premier asks deputy, secretary to stay |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2004/04/17/2003136998 |work=[[Taipei Times]] |date=17 April 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, while a Senior Presidential Adviser, Lin attended the [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) forum in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]], in place of Taiwan's President [[Chen Shui-bian]]. Because of opposition from the [[People's Republic of China]], Taiwan's senior leaders are unable to attend APEC events in person and must send a [[List of Chinese Taipei Representatives to APEC|ministerial-level envoy]]. He was Chairman of the [[Industrial Technology Research Institute]] from 2004 to 2008.

A graduate of [[Taiwan Provincial Cheng Kung University]], Lin was an executive in the car industry before entering politics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="778">'''Manager without portfolio''' is a manager in title only, that is, one who manages a ''function'', but does not manage a ''staff''.

The term often applies to those holding managerial titles in small companies.  ''E.g.,'' the [[marketing manager]] or [[human resources]] manager in a small enterprise may be wholly responsible for the marketing or human resources functions respectively, but may not in fact manage any staff.  It may also be applied to one granted a title for purposes of prestige, or for a [[wikt:lame duck|lame duck]] or "short-timer" (one whose tenure is scheduled to end soon, and whose authority is consequently in transition to someone else).

Derived by analogy from the British term [[Minister without Portfolio]].

'''L. Marc Zell''' (born February 25, 1953) is an Israeli-American lawyer, and the chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel and is a Vice President of Republicans Overseas, Inc.

==Early life==
Marc Zell was born on February 25, 1953. He graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Princeton University]] (1974) in Germanic Languages and Literatures with a concentration in theoretical linguistics and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] with honors from the [[University of Maryland at Baltimore]] (1977).&lt;ref name="zellaronbio"&gt;{{cite web|title=L. Marc Zell, Adv.|url=http://www.fandz.com/l-marc-zell/|website=Zell, Aron &amp; Co.|accessdate=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After clerking at the Maryland Court of Appeals for a year (1977–1978), Zell joined ''Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Kampelman'' as an associate (1978–1981). In 1986 he formed the law firm Feith &amp; Zell, P.C. with [[Douglas Feith]], who served later as [[Undersecretary of Defense]] for Policy from 2001-2005.&lt;ref name="guardianfriendsofthefamily"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitaker|first1=Brian|title=Friends of the family|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/sep/24/worlddispatch.usa|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=September 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Douglas Feith left law practice to work at the Pentagon in 2001, Zell partnered with Bernel Goldberg to form Zell, Goldberg &amp; Co with offices in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Tel Aviv]] and affiliate offices in [[Washington, DC]], Russia and Europe.&lt;ref name="guardianfriendsofthefamily"/&gt;

In 2003 he joined the [[Iraqi International Law Group]], the first international law firm in Iraq.&lt;ref name="theguardianzionistsettlerjoins"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Whitaker|first1=Brian|title=Zionist settler joins Iraqi to promote trade|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/07/iraq.israel|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=October 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is currently a partner in the multinational law firm of Zell, Aron &amp; Co., based in Jerusalem, Israel with branches offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.  He is currently serving as Chairman of the Executive Committee of Ariel University in Samaria.

==Political views==
In August 2017, Zell condemned counterprotesters at a gathering of hundreds of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.806586|title=Republican Leader in Israel Hails Robert E.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s Zell developed an interest in [[Zionism]] and after a series of visits to Israel, moved his family in 1988 to the [[Judean Mountains|Judean mountain]] town of [[Alon Shvut]].&lt;ref name="theguardianzionistsettlerjoins"/&gt; As of 2016, he lives in [[Tekoa, Gush Etzion|Tekoa]].&lt;ref name="jtadonaldtobin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tobin|first1=Andrew|title=Donald Trump supporters launch push for American ‘swing state’ votes in Israel|url=http://www.jta.org/2016/08/05/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/donald-trump-supporters-launch-push-for-american-swing-state-votes-in-israel|accessdate=August 5, 2016|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|date=August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported [[Donald Trump]] for President of the United States in 2016.&lt;ref name="jtadonaldtobin"/&gt;

'''Coin debasement''' is the act of decreasing the amount of precious metal in a coin, while continuing to circulate it at face value. This was frequently done by governments in order to [[inflation|inflate]] the amount of currency in circulation; typically, some of the precious metal was replaced by a cheaper metal when the coin was minted. But when done by an individual, precious metal was physically removed from the coin, which could then be passed on at the original face value, leaving the debaser with a profit. Coin debasement was effected by several methods, including '''clipping''' (shaving metal from the coin's circumference) and '''sweating''' (shaking the coins in a bag and collecting the dust worn off).

Until the mid-20th century, coins were often made of [[silver]] or [[gold]], which were quite soft and prone to wear. This meant coins naturally got lighter (and thus less valuable) as they aged, so coins that had lost a small amount of [[bullion]] would go unnoticed. Modern coins are made of hard, cheap metals such as [[steel]], [[copper]], or a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, reducing wear and making it difficult and unprofitable to debase them.

Clipping is the act of shaving off a small portion of a precious metal coin for profit. Over time, the precious metal clippings could be saved up and melted into bullion or used to make new coins.&lt;ref name="cooper-2008"&gt;

Coin clipping was usually considered by the law to be of a similar magnitude to [[counterfeit]]ing, and was occasionally punished by [[capital punishment|death]],&lt;ref name="cooper-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example the English [[Treason Act 1415]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=71}} a fate which befell English counterfeiters [[Thomas Rogers and Anne Rogers]] in 1690.

Coin clipping is why many coins have the rim of the coin [[reeding|marked with stripes]] (''milling'' or ''reeding''), text (''[[engraving]]'') or some other pattern that would be destroyed if the coin were clipped. This practice is attributed to [[Isaac Newton]], who was appointed [[Master of the Mint]] in 1699.&lt;ref name="Division1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Treasury.

In the process of sweating, coins were placed in a bag and shaken. The bits of metal that had worn off the coins were recovered from the bottom of the bag.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=70}} Sweating tended to wear the coin in a more natural way than clipping, and so was harder to detect.{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=72}}

If the coin was large, a hole could be punched out of the middle, and the face of the coin hammered to close up the hole.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=70–71}} Or the coin could be sawed in half, and a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be welded back together again.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=71}} Verbal references to plugged quarters and plugged dimes eventually yielded the common phrase ''"not worth a plugged nickel"'' (or 'plug nickel', or even a plugged cent), emphasizing the worthlessness of such a tampered coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/260800.html|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Not worth a plugged nickel|publisher=Phrase Dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410020340/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/260800.html|archivedate=2016-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Personal life and education===

Pascal Cagni was born in Cernay (Haut-Rhin), France on October 28, 1961.

He graduated from [[Sciences Po]] Paris in Political Sciences (1984), MBA [[HEC Paris]] (1986) and the Robert Schumann University in Strasburg in business law (1984).

Pascal Cagni also attended the [[Stanford]] Executive Program for Growing Companies (EPCG) in 1997 and the 63rd promotion of the Institut des Hautes Études de Défense Nationale ([[IHEDN]]) in 2010.

He is married and has four children: Inès, Diane, Paul, Charles.

===Early career===

In 1986, Pascal Cagni joined [[Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton]] in Paris and San Francisco, as a management consultant, prior to joining [[Compaq]] France as Marketing Manager in 1988. 

In 1991, he joined the [[Software Publishing Corporation]] (SPC) to establish a new South Europe Division in Nice, before running the European Strategy and Business Development from London.

===Packard Bell NEC===

In 1995, he was hired by [[Packard Bell]] to create new R&amp;D, manufacturing and operational divisions. He established a highly successful pan-European sales and marketing structure, and was promoted to Vice President of Europe for Packard Bell in 1997 after its merger with [[NEC]] Computer International.

===Apple===

In 2000, [[Steve Jobs]] hired Pascal Cagni as General Manager and Vice President of Apple Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA). Under his 12-year tenure, Apple's EMEIA region consistently delivered the highest revenue growth rates within Apple for several years.

The term '''productivity alpha''' describes above [[benchmarking|benchmark]] [[productivity]] resulting from operations that have been optimized through the use of [[technology]].

Productivity alpha is essential to helping today’s [[asset management]] organizations remain competitive. It leads to cost savings, increased [[efficiency]] and a more satisfied work force.

==Background==

[[Alpha (investment)|Alpha]] is a word used in the [[investment]] process. A positive alpha means that a fund has performed better than the benchmark or better than average.

There is a direct correlation between a firm’s operations and productivity. When operations are automated and operational processes are streamlined, productivity increases. This can help a firm to see a significant improvement in their overall business. Well-run operations will, in fact:

* Enable the [[front office]] to address new sources of alpha
* Protect the generated alpha
* Minimize the cost of operations
* Provide accurate and transparent information to investors

By allowing the [[asset manager]] to execute his or her [[investment strategy]] faster or smarter, the operations can have a direct impact on the fund’s alpha.

Highly automated and efficient operations enable a firm to more quickly accommodate new instruments, strategies and markets, thus directly contributing to the development of new sources of alpha.

By avoiding errors and delays in operations the [[Chief operating officer|COO]] helps to protect the alpha that the [[Fund management|fund manager]] has created. 
Errors in the [[Middle office|middle]] or [[back office]] can result in additional costs for reversing trades or even penalties. Furthermore, inadequate technology can increase an organization’s risk exposure. Operations which are tightly and efficiently managed can contribute to the protection of investment alpha.

By being more efficient in operations, an organization can reduce the cost of operations, directly benefitting the fund or the asset manager’s P&amp;L.
Every dollar spent on administrative expenses is a dollar less in additional [[revenue]] performance. In order to create and protect alpha, you must be able to reduce expenses and streamline processes.

By leveraging efficient operations for enhanced client service and reporting, an organization can spend more productive time with its clients. 
[[Investor]]s today demand accurate and well-presented information in a timely manner. This requires that operational processes and systems be aligned and skillfully managed to successfully feed downstream reporting applications and produce credible investor reports.  Clearer reporting and increased [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] enables a higher quality and more satisfying client interactions, and directly contributes to the productivity of client-facing staff in both the front and back office.

==The role of technology==

Technology is essential in helping to optimize operations and increase productivity.  The strategic deployment of technology allows investment firms to manage complexity, increase efficiency, and reduce costs and operational risk. Technology also enables investment firms to respond to changing business and regulatory requirements such as [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank Act]], [[UCITS]] and [[MiFID]]. In TowerGroup’s report on the Top 10 Technology Initiatives for 2011, it is predicted that the areas that will see the most technology investment in 2011 will be [[risk management]], [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]], [[data management]], [[analytics]], and reporting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Productivity software''' (also called '''personal productivity software''' or '''office productivity software'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=office productivity software|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/66246/office-productivity-software|website=[[PC Magazine]] Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is application software used for producing information (such as [[document]]s, [[presentation]]s, [[worksheet]]s, [[database]]s, [[chart]]s, [[Information graphics|graphs]], [[digital paintings]], [[electronic music]] and [[digital video]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=productivity software|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/49780/productivity-software|website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its names arose from the fact that it increases [[productivity]], especially of individual [[white-collar worker|office workers]], from [[Data entry clerk|typists]] to [[knowledge worker]]s, although its scope is now wider than that. [[#Office suite|Office suite]]s, which brought [[word processor|word processing]], [[spreadsheet]], and [[relational database]] programs to the [[desktop computer|desktop]] in the 1980s, are the core example of productivity software. They revolutionized the office with the magnitude of the productivity increase they brought as compared with the pre-1980s office environments of typewriters, paper filing, and handwritten lists and ledgers. Some 78% of "middle-skill" occupations (those that call for more than a [[high school]] diploma but less than a [[bachelor's degree]]) now require the use of productivity software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burning-glass.com/research/digital-skills-gap/ Crunched by the Numbers: The Digital Skills Gap in the Workforce], Burning Glass Technologies, March 2015 &lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, productivity software has become even more [[consumerization|consumerized]] than it already was, as computing becomes ever more integrated into daily personal life.

==Details==
Productivity software traditionally runs directly on a computer. For example, [[Commodore Plus/4]] model of computer contained in [[Read-only memory|ROM]] for applications of productivity software. Productivity software is one of the reasons people use [[personal computer]]s.

Productivity software can fall into the following categories:

'''Time Management Software''': With time management software, one is able to track time on a desktop without any user intervention. This allows the person to analyse how much time is spent on each task and what one can do to re-prioritise his tasks and spend time on the most important tasks. 

'''Project Management Software''': With project management software, one is able to delegate, track major projects and have a quick overview of the progress made by each team member.

==Office suite==
[[File:LibreOffice Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw.png|thumb|[[LibreOffice]], an example of office suite, showing Writer, Calc, Impress and Draw]]
An '''office suite''' is a collection of bundled productivity software (a [[software suite]]) intended to be used by [[knowledge worker]]s. The components are generally distributed together, have a consistent [[user interface]] and usually can interact with each other, sometimes in ways that the [[operating system]] would not normally allow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=office suite|url=https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/48311/office-suite|website=PC Magazine Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest office suite for personal computers was [[Starburst (office suite)|Starburst]] in the early 1980s, comprising the word processor [[WordStar]], together with companion apps CalcStar (spreadsheet) and DataStar (database).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvorak.org/blog/whatever-happened-to-wordstar-2/ |title=Whatever Happened to Wordstar? |author=John C. Dvorak |authorlink=John C. Dvorak |accessdate=2015-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other suites arose in the 1980s, and over the course of the 1990s [[Microsoft Office]] came to dominate the market,&lt;ref&gt;''A Brief History of Computing,'' by Gerard O'Regan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=X7kWyJXB7z0C&amp;pg=PA87 p. 87]&lt;/ref&gt; a position it retains {{as of|2018|lc=yes}}.

=== Typical office suite components ===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5529">The project controller is a key member of the project team and works directly with the project manager to help define the project's goals and objectives; create and maintain a project's budget and schedule, analyse progress reported against the work schedules; and recommend actions to improve progress. In order to ensure accurate documentation and reporting on a consistent basis, many organisations are positioning the project manager and project controller as part of a centralised project support organisation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-role-of-project-controller-10704.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Job==
Project controllers are often employed by consulting firms that perform management, [[technology]], and/or [[human capital]] work for an external client. Although titles vary from firm to firm, most large consulting firms such as [[Accenture]], [[PWC]], [[Deloitte]] and [[Bearing Point]] have individuals who perform project controller duties. The project controller is responsible for overseeing the financial health of the project by analyzing costs, revenue, risks, and pricing for the consulting firm. The role of the project controller can vary depending on the type and scale of the project, but most all project controllers maintain budget tracking tools, issue invoices and billings, manage fee structures, and forecast potential gains and losses in pursuing future work with a client.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanresources.hrvinet.com/project-controller-job-description Project Controller Key Duties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918213920/http://www.humanresources.hrvinet.com/project-controller-job-description/ |date=2010-09-18 }} HR Management. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all projects have a project controller. Smaller projects that are expected to be shorter in duration typically may have no project controller overseeing the daily financial activity of the project. The responsibility will usually be assumed by the [[project manager]] of the project. For larger scale projects or projects requiring on-site interaction with the external client (typically [[public sector]] projects), there may be one or several project controllers to ensure that staffing levels and billing rates are appropriate for the budgetary scope of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/the-role-of-project-controller-10704.html The Role of a Project Controller] Arabian Business. November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Because most project controllers are serving the internal project management team, they are typically considered non-billable to the client. However, in projects where client staff and the consulting firm work in the same unit, some clients have agreed to be billed for project controllers to facilitate financial transactions and communications between the [[Consultant|consulting]] firm and the client. Some project controllers will also perform [[expense audits]] for the project to ensure that all expenses to the project are in compliance with the consulting firm's and the client's expense policies.

Along with profit/loss analysis and budgeting, project controllers are often involved in the original pricing of a project. The pricing of a project occurs before the work begins and is meant decide the best fee structure and overall cost to the client for the service that will be provided. The project controller helps determine the optimal price to charge the client in order to retain profit at the end of the engagement. 

==Qualification==
Although there are no formal qualification criteria, project controllers usually have graduate level training in project management or finance such as [[master of science in finance|MSF]] or [[MBA]] degrees, or are [[qualified accountant]]s (i.e. CIMA, CCA, ACCA, CGA, [[Certified Management Accountant|CMA]], or CA designation). "Industry experience" is often a pre-requisite and so controllers often have undergraduate degrees in related fields. Also, many analysts originally enter this domain through their practice as consultants or accountants and so a very wide range of qualifications is common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usjobs.deloitte.com/jobs/306827-Consulting-Project-Controller-Project-Financial-Analyst.aspx Deloitte Project Controller Qualifications]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Deloitte November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some firms, it is (additionally) preferred that analysts earn a professional certification such as the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) [[Chartered Financial Analyst]] (CFA) designation, or the [[Certified International Investment Analyst]] (CIIA) designation. However, professional designation is rarely a requirement, and many have reached the peak of the profession without ever sitting for the CFA or the CIIA exam. 

Basic [[analytical skills]], and strong numerical skills are necessary and a proficient understanding of and experience with [[Microsoft Excel]] is usually required.

==History==
In 1990, Nigel Oakes, who had a background in TV production and [[advertising]], founded the '''Behavioural Dynamics Institute (BDI)''' as a research facility for [[strategic communication]].&lt;ref name=bb/&gt; The study of [[mass behavior]] and how to change it led him to establish '''Strategic Communication Laboratories''' in 1993.&lt;ref name=scl/&gt; Oakes thought that in order to shift [[mass opinion]], academic insights as gained through psychologists and anthropologists at BDI should be applied, and would be more successful than traditional advertising methods.&lt;ref name=issenberg&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-11-12/is-the-republican-party-s-killer-data-app-for-real-| author=[[Sasha Issenberg]] |title=Cruz-Connected Data Miner Aims to Get Inside U.S. Voters' Heads |publisher=Bloomberg| date=12 November 2015 |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BDI became a non-profit affiliate of SCL.

==Activities==
After an initial commercial success, SCL expanded into military and political arenas. It became known for alleged involvement "in military [[disinformation campaign]]s to [[social media]] [[Brand management|branding]] and [[voter targeting]]".&lt;ref name=politico&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/ted-cruz-donor-for-data-119813#ixzz3zR4A2d8U|author=Vogel, Kenneth P |title=Cruz partners with donor's 'psychographic' firm |publisher=Politico| date=7 July 2015 |accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2005, “with a glitzy exhibit” at Defence and Security Equipment International ([[DSEI]]), “the United Kingdom's largest showcase for military technology”, SCL demonstrated its capacity in “[[influence operations]]”: “to help orchestrate a sophisticated campaign of mass deception” on the public of a big city like London.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;
According to its website, SCL has participated in over 25 international political and [[electoral campaign]]s since 1994.&lt;ref name=scl/&gt;

SCL’s involvement in the political world has been primarily in the [[developing world]] where it has been used by the military and politicians to study and [[Crowd manipulation|manipulate]] [[public opinion]] and political will. It uses what have been called “psy ops” to provide insight into the thinking of the target audience.&lt;ref name=issenberg/&gt; SCL claimed to be able to help foment coups.&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/09/you_cant_handle_the_truth.single.html |author=Weinberger, Sharon |author-link= Sharon Weinberger |title=You Can't Handle the Truth |publisher=Slate| date=19 September 2005 |accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to its website, SCL has influenced elections in Italy, Latvia, Ukraine, Albania, Romania, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Mauritius, India, Indonesia, The Philippines,&lt;ref name="scmpCADuterte"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robles|first1=Raissa|title=How Cambridge Analytica’s parent company helped ‘man of action’ Rodrigo Duterte win the 2016 Philippines election|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/2140303/how-cambridge-analyticas-parent-company-helped-man-action|publisher=South China Morning Post|date=4 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thailand, Taiwan, Colombia, Antigua, St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago.&lt;ref name=scl/&gt; While the company initially got involved in elections in the United Kingdom, it ceased to do so after 1997 because staff members did not exhibit the same "aloof sensibility" as with projects abroad.&lt;ref name=issenberg/&gt;

== Life and career ==
Saif Durbar was born in 1962 in [[Gujarat]], India, close to the [[Pakistan]] border.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/431591/politique/proche-de-mobutu-bozize-conde-saifee-durbar-businessman-discret/|title=Proche de Mobutu, Bozizé, Condé… Qui est Saifee Durbar, ce businessman discret ? – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2017-05-08|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family remained close to the British after decolonisation, and was also connected to Gulf monarchies. Durbar is the grandson of one of the last nawab. His father owns factories of plastics, textiles and steel.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After studying in England and then in Pakistan, Durbar joined the family business prior to starting his own business in 1987. It involved import, export, bond trading and banking.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 1995 after the loss of nearly a billion dollars he branched out into mining and investments in Africa and started property development with large capitalization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1993, he started working in Africa, developing businesses in infrastructure and real estate in [[Zaire]] until the fall of Mobutu in 1997. He continued in Central African Republic, creating businesses in mining and bringing international investors to the region. It made him an economic adviser to president Ange Felix Patasse whom he represented at the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/204960/politique/un-ministre-en-cavale/|title=Un ministre en cavale – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2009-02-23|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the became an advisor to president François Bozizé, and later in 2009 his deputy foreign minister.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/economie/20140605.OBS9633/exclusif-la-dcri-a-enquete-des-2009-sur-le-rachat-d-uramin-par-areva.html|title=EXCLUSIF.

Saif Durbar is the founder and CEO of Girc, Bridge Africa Counselage, and founder of philanthropic organisation Kutamani, which provides educational tools for students in Africa.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

He started a property fund and was involved in a few large property deals in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and [[Europe]], including [[Southern France]]. He also took part in setting up the Saudi Construction Group. Together with [[Paul Blomfield|Paul Bloomfield]] and Sheikh Faisal al-Sharif, chairman of DGI, they announced in 2009 the partnership with [[Lend Lease Project Management &amp; Construction|Bovis Lend Lease]] and [[Foster and Partners|Foster &amp; Partners]] on a $13 billion (£7.4 billion) plan to develop a new city of 750,000 new homes in [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2009/08/436833.html|title=Bovis Lend Lease and Saifee Dubar: The Saudi Experiment - UK Indymedia|website=www.indymedia.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Controversies ==
Durbar was the adviser of Bozize, when the Canadian company [[:fr:UraMin|Uramin]] acquired 90% of the [[Bakouma]] uranium mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lecho.be/dossier/choixredac/comment-areva-a-transforme-uramin-en-gouffre-financier/9869588.html|title=Comment Areva a transformé UraMin en gouffre financier|date=2017-03-06|work=L'Echo|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the French state-owned [[nuclear power]] company [[Orano|Areva]] purchased Uramin and its mines for 1.8 billion euros. According to Durbar, the acquisition took place without notification of change of ownership to the CAR government who owned 15% of Uramin, Durbar got the government to appoint lawyers and request justification for the transaction. The mines were later proved unusable for their low uranium concentration and expensive logistics, which Areva’s CEO [[Anne Lauvergeon]] was aware of. This brought out allegations of a possible corruption operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/mag/476433/culture/quand-la-litterature-nous-eclaire-sur-le-trafic-duranium-entre-la-france-et-lafrique/|title=Quand la littérature nous éclaire sur le trafic d’uranium entre la France et l’Afrique – JeuneAfrique.com|date=2017-10-02|work=JeuneAfrique.com|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 2014, Vincent Crouzet published a book ‘Radioactive’ about the Uramin scandal with Saif Durbar as one of the main protagonists and a key witness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nouvelobs.com/rue89/rue89-temoignage/20140606.RUE4288/affaire-uramin-comment-j-ai-ete-plonge-dans-ce-dossier-radioactif.html|title=Affaire UraMin : comment j’ai été plongé dans ce dossier radioactif|work=L'Obs|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Livres/Affaire-Areva-Un-ecrivain-entendu-par-la-Brigade-financiere-570540|title=Affaire Areva - Un écrivain entendu par la Brigade financière|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1033442203|title=Radioactif|last=Vincent.|first=Crouzet,|date=2014|publisher=Belfond|isbn=9782714456526|location=Paris|oclc=1033442203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, the French government issued a warrant against Durbar following his conviction on appeal for fraud on a 1995 case, a month after the CAR government issued a notice to Areva for justification.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.franceinter.fr/justice/exclusif-affaire-uramin-les-preuves-de-l-escroquerie-seraient-a-monaco|title=EXCLUSIF {{!}} Affaire UraMin : les preuves de l&amp;rsquo;escroquerie seraient &amp;agrave; Monaco|last=Monin|first=Jacques|date=2017-01-28|work=France Inter|access-date=2018-06-27|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In October 2008 the [[United States|US]] ambassador to [[Bangui]] reported France’s desire “to limit the influence of Saiffee Durbar, including by using the legal proceedings against him”. To protect Durbar, Bozize appointed him Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, offering him diplomatic immunity. Following pressure from [[France]] he left the position. At the end of 2009, after his resignation as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, he went to France to defend himself and to negotiate his extradition. After a three-month stay in the VIP the Sante district in Paris, he was placed on probation for six months under house arrest in a [[Paris]] apartment. When the probation period was over, in September 2010 he left France. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.immobilierfr.org/journal-immobilier/actualite_economique_finance_immobiliere/actualite_economique_immobiliere/saif_durbar_s_explique_et_accuse_je_suis_un_probl_me_pour_la_fra.html|title=Immobilier France: location vente appartements immobilier, agence immobiliere, credit immobilier - Saif Durbar  s’explique et accuse: je suis un problème pour la France !|website=www.immobilierfr.org|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Sexual harassment in the workplace''' in [[US labor law]] has been considered a form of [[sex discrimination|discrimination on the basis of sex]] in the United States since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name="mcelroy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wendymcelroy.com/ifeminists/2004/1027.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|last1=McElroy|first1=Wendy|date=27 October 2004|website=iFeminists.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siegel"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IhYip0PqV4EC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=lin+farley#v=onepage&amp;q=lin%20farley&amp;f=false|title=Directions in Sexual Harassment Law|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Catharine A.|last2=Siegel|first2=Reva I.|publisher=Yale University|year=2004|isbn=0-300-09800-6|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two forms of sexual harassment recognized by United States law: [[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|quid pro quo sexual harassment]] (requiring an employee to tolerate sexual harassment to keep their job, receive a tangible benefit, or avoid punishment) and behavior that creates a [[hostile work environment]] (persistent sexual behavior that unreasonably interferes with an employee's ability to work). It has been noted that a number of the early sexual harassment cases were brought by [[African Americans|African American]] women and girls.

The term "sexual harassment" was coined and popularized by [[Lin Farley]] in 1975, based on a pattern she recognized during a 1974 [[Cornell University]] class she taught on women and work.&lt;ref name="Siegel" /&gt; It's been noted that a number of the original sexual harassment cases were on behalf of black women and girls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law recognizes two forms of sexual harassment:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/employment/sexual_harassment.html|title=Sexual Harassment Law|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|date=10 January 2017|website=ExpertLaw|publisher=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Sexual harassment#Quid pro quo sexual harassment|Quid pro quo sexual harassment]]''': an employee is required to tolerate sexual harassment in exchange for employment, a raise or job benefit, or promotion.
*'''[[Hostile work environment]]''': sexual harassment in the workplace results in an offensive work environment or unreasonably interferes an employee's work performance.

=== Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
In the US, the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] prohibits [[employment discrimination]] based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], sex, color, [[national origin]] or religion. Initially only intended to combat sexual harassment of women, (42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2) the prohibition of [[sex discrimination]] covers both females and males. This discrimination occurs when the sex of the worker is made as a condition of employment (i.e. all female waitpersons or male carpenters) or where this is a job requirement that does not mention sex but ends up preventing many more persons of one sex than the other from the job (such as height and weight limits). This act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/sexual_harassment.cfm|website=EEOC|publisher=U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equal Employment Opportunity Commission regulations (1980) ===
In 1980, the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) issued regulations defining sexual harassment and stating it was a form of sex discrimination prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 

=== Civil Rights Act of 1991 ===
The [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]] added provisions to Title VII protections including expanding the rights of women to sue and collect compensatory and punitive [[damages]] for sexual discrimination or harassment

=== Case Law ===
==== ''Barnes v Train'' (1974) ====
''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) is commonly viewed as the first sexual harassment case in America, even though the term "sexual harassment" was not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2004/10/27/sad-evolution-sexual-harassment.html|title=The Sad Evolution of Sexual Harassment|date=2004-10-27|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paulette Barnes, an African American woman, was a payroll clerk who worked for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]. She brought the case after losing her job for refusing the advances of a male supervisor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peirce|first=Michelle Ridgeway|date=1989|title=Sexual Harassment and Title VII: A Better Solution|url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1897&amp;context=bclr|journal=Boston College Law Review, Volume 30, Issue 4, Number 4|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed, but was appealed in ''Barnes v Costle'' (1977).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) ====
In 1976, ''[[Williams v. Saxbe]]'' was the first case in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]] to establish that [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment constitutes sex discrimination under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. A male supervisor was found to have retaliated against [[Diane R. Williams]] by firing her after she refused to have sex with him. The court found that it was form of sex discrimination when a condition of employment is to submit to the sexual advances of a superior. Additionally, there was evidence that other female employees had been subjected to similar conditions. It was ruled that William B. Saxbe had only required women to submit to his advances, which created an artificial barrier to employment for one gender but not the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/413/654/1660985/|title=Williams v.

''Williams v Saxbe'' established a clear-cut type of sexual harassment, [[quid pro quo]], and was the first to establish it in a [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]]. In response to the findings of this case, several earlier decisions against sex discrimination in lower courts were reversed on appeal, including ''Barnes v Train.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977) ====
Although ''[[Barnes v. Train]]'' (1974) was initially dismissed, Paulette Barnes won on appeal in ''Barnes v. Costle'' (1977). During this case, the [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] ruled it was sex discrimination for a woman to suffer tangible employment losses (for example losing her job) for refusing to submit to requests for sexual favors. The appeals ruling was based in part on the ''Williams v. Saxbe'' (1976) decision.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIM88_WwJCsC&amp;pg=PA431&amp;lpg=PA431&amp;dq=williams+v.+saxbe+appeal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yatO7SUcs9&amp;sig=EEDntusmtqcqnq4GMPSeAHCXKgs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjM3bO98dvcAhXVCTQIHbMMDM84ChDoATAAegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=williams%20v.%20saxbe%20appeal&amp;f=false|title=Law, Gender, and Injustice: A Legal History of U.S. Women|last=Hoff|first=Joan|date=1994-04-01|publisher=NYU Press|year=|isbn=9780814744864|location=|pages=431-432|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court also found that companies are liable for not stopping sexual harassment if they know it is being conducted by supervisors.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As part of the ruling of ''Barnes v. Costle,'' Barnes received around $18,000 for back pay and the loss of promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wenzelfenton.com/blog/2018/01/01/history-sexual-harassment-laws-united-states/|title=History of Sexual Harassment Laws in the United States|date=2018-01-01|work=Wenzel Fenton Cabassa, P.A.|access-date=2018-08-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'' (1986) ====
In the 1986 case of ''[[Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson]]'', the Supreme Court first recognized "sexual harassment" as a violation of Title VII, established the standards for analyzing whether the conduct was welcome and levels of employer [[legal liability|liability]], and that speech or conduct in itself can create a "[[hostile environment sexual harassment|hostile environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{caselaw source |case=''Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson'', 477 U.S. 57 (1986) |findlaw=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=477&amp;page=57 |justia=http://supreme.justia.com/us/477/57/case.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case filed by Mechelle Vinson ruled that the sexual conduct between the subordinate and supervisor could not be deemed voluntary due to the hierarchical relationship between the two positions in the workplace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53284947|title=Sexual harassment and the law : the Mechelle Vinson case|last=1946-|first=Cochran, Augustus B.,|date=2004|publisher=University Press of Kansas|isbn=0700613234|location=Lawrence, Kan.|oclc=53284947}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the ruling of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, reported sexual harassment cases grew from 10 cases being registered by the EEOC per year before 1896 to 624 case being reported in the subsequent following year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This number of reported cases to the EEOC rose to 2,217 in 1990 and then 4,626 by 1995.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== ''Ellison v. Brady'' (1991) ====
The case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' resulted in rejecting the [[reasonable person]] standard in favor of the "reasonable woman standard" which allowed for cases to be analyzed from the perspective of the complainant and not the defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Profio|first1=Debra A.|title=Ellison v. Brady: Finally, a Woman's Perspective|journal=UCLA Women's Law Journal|date=1992|volume=2|issue=0|page=249|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/3206643c|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== ''Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.'' (1991) ====
Also in 1991, ''[[Jenson v. Eveleth Taconite Co.]]'' became the first sexual harassment case to be given [[class action]] status paving the way for others.

Seven years later, in 1998, through that same case, new precedents were established that increased the limits on the "[[Discovery (law)|discovery]]" process in sexual harassment cases, that then allowed psychological injuries from the [[litigation]] process to be included in assessing damages awards. 

==== ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''Burlington v. Ellerth'' (1998) ====
In the same year, the courts concluded in ''Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, Florida'', and ''[[Burlington v. Ellerth]]'', that employers are liable for harassment by their employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=97-282 |title=U.S Supreme Court: Beth Ann Faragher, petitioner v.

Ellerth |publisher=FindLaw |date=June 26, 1998 |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== ''Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services (1998)'' ====
Moreover, ''[[Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services]]'' set the precedent for same-sex harassment, and sexual harassment without motivation of "sexual desire", stating that any discrimination based on sex is actionable so long as it places the victim in an objectively disadvantageous working condition, regardless of the gender of either the victim, or the harasser.

==== ''Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White'' (2006) ====
In the 2006 case of ''[[Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White]]'', the standard for retaliation against a sexual harassment complainant was revised to include any adverse employment decision or treatment that would be likely to dissuade a "reasonable worker" from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.

==== ''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'' (2010) ====
The 2010 case, [[Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.|''Reeves v. C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc.'']] ruled that a hostile work environment can be created in a workplace where sexually explicit language and pornography are present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conte|first1=Alba|title=Sexual Harassment in the Workplace|date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer|isbn=9780735597655|pages=3–278|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Hostile work environment|hostile workplace]] may exist based upon the treatment of employees as a group, even if it is not targeted at any particular employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hegar|first1=Kathryn W.|title=Modern Human Relations at Work|date=2012|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=0538481064|page=34|edition=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prevalence ==
During 2007 alone, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and related state agencies received 12,510 new charges of sexual harassment on the job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kmblegal.com/index.php/160/Sexual_Harassment_Law_A_Brief_Introduction_for_New_Practitioners|title=Sexual Harassment Law: A Brief Introduction for New Practitioners|last=Marshall|first=David|author2=Andronici, Justine|date=October 23, 2008|publisher=Katz, Marshall &amp; Banks|accessdate=March 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 through 2016, men made approximately 17% of sexual harassment complaints filed with the EEOC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charges Alleging Sex-Based Harassment (Charges filed with EEOC) FY 2010 - FY 2016|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/sexual_harassment_new.cfm|website=Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=15 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 MSN poll it was found that 31% of people in the U.S have been sexually harassed in the workplace; 45% of women said they were sexually harassed and 15% percent of men said they were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/sexual-harassment-affects-nearly-everyone-2017-11|title=Sexual harassment isn't a Hollywood, tech, or comedy world issue — in fact, it affects everyone|last=Gillett|first=Rachel|date=2017-11-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-11-23|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment in government===

The California legislature in Sacramento is known to have paid at least $850,000 in sexual harassment settlements in the period 1996-2017, though the [[New York Times]] notes often settlements are unknown to the public because of the terms of the settlements themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=JESS BIDGOOD|last2=MIRIAM JORDAN|last3=ADAM NAGOURNEY|title=Sexual Misconduct in California’s Capitol Is Difficult to Escape|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/29/us/sacramento-sexual-harassment-california.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;smtyp=cur&amp;_r=0|accessdate=30 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=29 October 2017|quote=many harassment cases disappear into the court system, where the outcomes are often sealed as women sign nondisclosure agreements.

'''Seán FitzPatrick''' (born 25 May 1948) was former chairman of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] until he resigned in December 2008 amid [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|mounting revelations over hidden loans]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean FitzPatrick Anlgo Irish Bank loan book http://www.sneachta.org/index.php?title=Sean_FitzPatrick&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal precipitated a collapse of the bank's share price which in turn led to its [[nationalisation]] on 21 January 2009.

In an [[RTÉ Radio 1]] interview on ''[[The Marian Finucane Show]]'' in October 2008, FitzPatrick denied critics' charges that the bank had been reckless in making too many big loans to property developers as Ireland's [[property bubble]] grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Marian Finucane]]; Sean FitzPatrick|date=October 2008|title=Sean FitzPatrick on "The Marian Finucane Show"|url=http://www.rte.ie/podcasts/2008/pc/pod-v-071008-37m24s-marian.mp3|format=[[MP3]]|medium=Radio Broadcast|publisher=[[RTÉ Radio 1]]|location=[[Donnybrook, Dublin]]|accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While saying he was grateful for the state's help, he refused to offer taxpayers an apology, saying

== Career ==
FitzPatrick was chief executive of [[Anglo Irish Bank]] from 1986 until 2005, when he became its chairman.  He resigned from that position in December 2008 when details of secret loans he had taken out with the bank were revealed.

FitzPatrick was appointed to a number of positions by  [[Fianna Fáil]] politicians. In 1998 the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government [[Noel Dempsey]] appointed FitzPatrick to the [[Dublin Docklands Development Authority]] where he served until 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, C.

== Resignation ==
When news of his secret loans became public and FitzPatrick resigned as chairman, the resulting furore also swept from office Ireland's chief banking regulator, [[Patrick Neary]]. FitzPatrick, while Anglo Irish chairman, had borrowed more than €100 million from the bank and hid the loans from auditors for eight years. The former multi-millionaire banker defaulted on the loans following a series of major business setbacks, valuable shareholding in Anglo Irish Bank once worth €80 million is now worthless followed by a failed oil venture in Africa and a stake in a casino in Asia stalled. His property investments in Ireland and Hungary were also hit by the international slump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/fitzpatrick-not-paying-off-euro100m-loan-interest-1901222.html|title=FitzPatrick not paying off €100m loan interest|date=1 October 2009|work=[[Irish Independent]]|publisher=[[Independent News &amp; Media]]|accessdate=18 March 2010|first=Sam|last=Smyth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both FitzPatrick and the bank said in statements on his resignation that his handling of the loans was neither illegal nor a breach of Irish banking regulations. But an apologetic new chairman O'Connor told shareholders that FitzPatrick's loans were "wrong and unacceptable".

The following day, headlines in the Irish papers illuminated the popular mood: "Seán FitzPatrick Should Go To Jail" competed with "If FitzPatrick Lived in New York, He'd Have Been Arrested By Now".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/world/2009-01-28-sean-fitzpatrick-irish-bank_N.htm?csp=34 | title=Irish stand united in hatred of banker Seán FitzPatrick | work=[[USA Today]] | accessdate=18 March 2010 | date=30 January 2009 | author=David J.

'''Internationale Spieltage SPIEL''', often called the '''Essen Game Fair''' after the city where it is held, is an annual four-day [[boardgame]] [[trade fair]] which is also open to the public held in October&lt;ref name="Economist2015"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2015-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Thursday to the following Sunday) at the [[Messe Essen]] exhibition centre in [[Essen]]. With 1,021 exhibitors from 50 nations (in 2016) SPIEL is the worldwide biggest fair for [[board game|board games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/31/board-gamers-germany-essen-spiel-exhibition|title=For board gamers, heaven is a place on earth – located in Germany|last=Duffy|first=Owen|date=2015-10-31|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many new games are released at the fair each year, especially (but not exclusively) [[European-style board game]]s.

[[File:Messe-Essen-Eingang-Sued-2016.jpg|thumb|Messe Essen, the event venue]]
At SPIEL board games are offered which are hard to find in retail because a lot of international and small exhibitors present their products. While the prices for buying the games at the fair do not tend to be significantly lower than those in retail, the games are typically available sooner than in regular board game shops, come with promotional materials (mostly extra cards or tokens with a few more game mechanics, but also T-shirts and similar merchandise) and it is an occasion where passionate board gamers can meet and chat with [[Game design|game designers]], illustrators, and famous game reviewers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The fair began in 1983.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stewart Woods|title=Eurogames: The Design, Culture and Play of Modern European Board Games|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdRVOl8fU0C&amp;pg=PA64|date=16 August 2012|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6797-6|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telman Mardanovich Ismailov''' ({{lang-az|Telman Mərdan oğlu İsmayılov}}, {{lang-ru| Те́льман Марда́нович Исмаи́лов}}; born 26 October 1956) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i-born [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[History of the Jews in Azerbaijan|Mountain Jew]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gzt.ru/people/teljman-ismailov/243349.html На взятие Исмаилова] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Azerbaijan does not allow [[Azerbaijani nationality law|dual citizenship]], he holds [[Russia]]n-[[Turkey|Turkish]] citizenship. He is the [[chairman]] of the Russian AST Group of companies, which is active in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorskie.ru/personalii/person36.htm РЕЗИДЕНТ ГРУППЫ АСТ ТЕЛЬМАН ИСМАИЛОВ: У НАС РУБЛЬ СЪЕШЬ - ТРИ ОТДАШЬ] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, Ismailov owned the Europe's then-largest marketplace, [[Cherkizovsky Market]], located in Moscow, Russia.

==Early life and family==
Telman Ismailov was born in [[Baku]], [[USSR]] in 1956, to a business family from Baku. He is the 10th child of a family with 12 children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/undertake/founder/telman_ismailov/ Тельман Марданович Исмаилов - Peoples.ru] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his father's and mother's family include Muslims and [[Mountain Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.gazetevatan.com/haberdetay.asp?Categoryid=1&amp;Newsid=244668]{{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
===Current assets===
In 1989, he registered the brand "AST" (initials of his two sons (Alekper, Sarkhan) and himself).&lt;ref name="Telman"&gt;[http://pragent.ru/prostopr/ismailov/ PR-кампания Тельмана Исмаилова] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the lavish opening of a hotel resort in [[Antalya]], Russia's prime minister [[Vladimir Putin]] was reportedly enraged that Ismailov invested so much abroad and flaunted his riches while Russia was being hit by a credit crunch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/oligarch-pays-for-party-that-enraged-putin-1748289.html&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the angry Putin ordered the closing of Cherkizovsky Market in 2009, causing 100,000 traders at the famous bazaar to lose their jobs.

==Lifestyle==
Known for his extravagant life style, Ismailov is famous for spending millions of dollars on [[singers]] like [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and others. Ismailov paid [[Lopez]] $1.4 million for her to sing 10 minutes worth of songs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The video of her singing "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" song to him is available on YouTube. Ismailov befriended plenty of other celebrities such as [[actors|actresses]] like [[Sharon Stone]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Paris Hilton]], and numerous other performers just to appear at his lavish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/fashion/2009/06/03/glitz-and-glamour-for-all-in-turkey-100252-23776517/ Glitz and glamour for all in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Biz''''' is a management simulation game published by [[Virgin Group|Virgin Games]] for the [[ZX Spectrum]] in 1984. In ''The Biz'', the player manages a [[rock music|rock]] band. The price of the game on release was £6.95, which is equivalent to £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|6.95|1984|r=2}}}} today. The tape cassette contained the program, an interview with [[Frank Sidebottom]] and [[Chris Sievey]], and eight singles.&lt;ref name="zxspectrumreviews"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:TheBizZXSpectrumScreenshot.jpg|250px|left|In this screeenshot, the player's father has won £40,000 while gambling on football. Unfortunately, the player only gets £10 as a way to keep the game balanced.]]

Players set up their rock band with [[Gig (musical performance)|gig]]s, make them [[rehearsal|rehearse]] new [[song]]s, and hire a [[recording studio]] for producing new [[album]]s. The player starts out with no talent or [[pound sterling|money]] and an [[talent agent|agent]] must be hired in order to better co-ordinate the band. The stage presence of the band and the [[fandom|fanbase]] are improved with every gig performed. School [[Dance party|dance]]s and [[YMCA]]s are the first places that accept the player's newly formed band. Real television stations are included: a band from either [[Swansea]] or [[Cardiff]] would perform on [[S4C]] while a local band from [[Coventry]] would get promoted on [[Central Independent Television|Central Television]]. Players can sometimes record a [[List of Peel sessions|session]] with [[John Peel]]; whose broadcasting influence opened up new bands to people between the ages of 20 and 60 years of age.

Mundane details such as [[insurance]], standard [[musical instrument]]s and transportation [[expense]]s are all tabulated against the player's savings in the game. The game also contains an anti-[[drug]] message for bands who consider experimenting with them.

==Reviews==
The game only contains sound effects and no music, although eight singles were included on the cassette.  There are no graphics to speak of and the game is [[text-based game|text-based]].  A [[Crash (magazine)|Crash]] review in March 1985 praised the game, stating that it was ''"[a]n unusually absorbing and addictive strategy/simulation with a sense of humour that represents good value."''&lt;ref name="zxspectrumreviews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zxspectrumreviews.co.uk/Review.aspx?rid=5429&amp;gid=661| title = Criticism of game | publisher = ZX Spectrum Reviews| date = | accessdate = 2011-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Twitter Power: How to Dominate Your Market One Tweet at a Time''''' is a book about [[Twitter]] by [[Joel Comm]] published in [[2009 in literature|2009]]. It introduces readers to [[Twitter]], explaining how to create a Twitter account, market their brands, and gain Twitter followers.

Published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], the book generally received positive reviews. It was criticized by a [[CNET]] reviewer for giving readers "a phony formula where you just paint by the numbers" to attempt to ensnare Twitter followers as customers.&lt;ref name="Cooper2009-02-13"&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Charles |date=2009-02-13 |title=Twitter power? For real? |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-power-for-real/ |publisher=[[CNET]] |accessdate=2015-09-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bVHhh97L |archivedate=2015-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book aims to teach business owners how to use [[microblogging]] service [[Twitter]] to network and build a community around their services, and to use tweets for [[viral marketing]].&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news |last=Elliott |first=Christopher |date=2009-01-16 |title=Changing travel one tweet at a time |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/28623823/ |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |accessdate=2015-09-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6bVQT2xhF |archivedate=2015-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comm describes and provides examples of five tweet groups: "classic, mission-accomplished, question, entertainment and picture tweets".&lt;ref name="Dill2010-01-10"&gt;{{cite news |last = Dill|first = Margo L.|date = 2010-01-10|title = The Power of Twitter|url = http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/12D82CDBDF28E208?p=AWNB|newspaper = [[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]]|accessdate = 2015-09-13|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6bVErAkuW|archivedate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Twitter Power''{{'}} resources section, Comm includes a list of "Power Twitterers". He also lists Twitters tools like [[TweetDeck]], a dashboard, and [[Twellow]], a user directory.&lt;ref name="Dill2010-01-10"/&gt; [[Tony Robbins]] wrote the book's preface.&lt;ref name="Cooper2009-02-13"/&gt;

==Reception==
''[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|The News-Gazette]]''{{'}}s Margo L. Dill said the book is best suited for Internet marketers who want people to view a website or to sell merchandise. She said that reading articles about Twitter instead of the book would be preferable for people using Twitter for personal use like keeping up to date with celebrities. Dill praised the book for being an "easy read for a book about technology and social marketing".&lt;ref name="Dill2010-01-10"/&gt;

In [[CNET]] article titled "Twitter power? For real?", journalist Charles Cooper criticized the book for providing a "phony formula where you just paint by the numbers".&lt;ref name="Cooper2009-02-13"/&gt; He said the book is "devoted to doling out tips on how to game the system to reel in 'loyal customers and more sales overall'".&lt;ref name="Cooper2009-02-13"/&gt; Cooper found ''Twitter Power'' contradictory because it says that Twitter is "not a place where people come to sell—and pushing sales hard on Twitter just isn't going to work", but almost immediately after says that following people on Twitter could get them to become customers.&lt;ref name="Cooper2009-02-13"/&gt;

Mike Werling of ''[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]'' described ''Twitter Power'' as "Joel Comm's ode to the haiku of blogging".&lt;ref name="Werling2009-02-10"&gt;{{cite news |last = Werling|first = Mike|date = 2009-02-10|title = Twitter Gets Its Own Book|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/218355|newspaper = [[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]]|accessdate = 2015-09-13|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6bVHFP3gw|archivedate = 2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linda L. Richards]] wrote in ''[[January Magazine]]'' that ''Twitter Power'' was a "blazingly lucid book" that is "well thought out, friendly and entirely easy to follow".&lt;ref name="Richards2009-03-18"&gt;{{cite news |last=Richards |first=Linda L. |authorlink=Linda L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3680">'''Waiariki Institute of Technology''' ({{lang-mi|Whare Takiura o Waiariki}}&lt;span style="margin-left:2.5px;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; was a tertiary institution based in the city of [[Rotorua]], [[New Zealand]], in the [[Bay of Plenty]] region in the central North Island. In May 2016, it merged with [[Bay of Plenty Polytechnic]] to form [[Toi Ohomai Institute of Technology]].

Regional campuses existed in [[Taupo]], [[Tokoroa]] and [[Whakatane]], and formerly [[Turangi]] and [[Kawerau]]. These were backed by a variety of specialist campuses and buildings, such as the Waipa Campus just south of Rotorua and the newly established offerings available from Waiariki in the [[Tauranga]] suburb of Windermere.

Waiariki was divided into three faculties, which offered masters, graduate, postgraduate and degree qualifications, as well as diplomas and certificates in several subject areas. They were the Faculty of Applied Technology and Primary Industries - Te Kura Takawāo, the Faculty of Business, Information Technology and Creative Arts - Te Kura Taki, and Te Pākaro a Ihenga: Faculty of Health, Education and Humanities.

Qualification subject areas included [[nursing]], [[teaching]], [[social work]], [[art]], [[sustainability]], [[Māori culture|Māori]], [[forestry]], [[business]], [[computing]], [[tourism]] and [[hospitality]]. These were backed by an equally diverse range of trade-based qualifications, in areas such as [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[horticulture]], [[fashion]], [[carpentry]] and [[hairdressing]].

== Tangatarua Marae ==
Waiariki has an on-site [[marae]] named Tangatarua, which translates as "two peoples" to reflect their [[bicultural]] nature. Tangatarua Marae was officially opened on 5 October 1996 and is named after a Túhourangi ancestor, Ihenga, who lived on the land where the Mokoia Campus is today.

== Academies ==
The Waiariki Academy of Sport offered talented athletes the opportunity to prioritise their sporting careers while gaining a tertiary education. Similarly, the Waiariki Academy of Singing and Music supported talented young singers and musicians to reach their musical goals while studying.

Waiariki also offered teenagers interested in trade areas the Bay of Plenty Trades Academy, which allowed secondary students to get a taste of trade subjects and tertiary life while still at high-school.

== History ==

Waiariki Community College was born in 1976, after the Rotorua Boys’ High School Technical Institute Division was merged with the Rotorua Girls' High School Business College to form a Senior Technical Division under the Rotorua High Schools' Board of Governors. Building on the Mokoia Drive site commenced that year, and the Waiariki Community College was opened two years later on 1 April 1978.

Tokoroa's 'outpost' opened in 1973, and subsequently became Waiariki’s first regional campus in 1978.

By the time Waiariki Community College changed its name to Waiariki Polytechnic in 1987, it was the largest polytechnic outside of the main city centres. The first two degree-level qualifications in tourism management and nursing were launched in 1995, and three years later, the name finally changed to Waiariki Institute of Technology.

Empain was born at [[Belœil]], [[Belgium]], and was the son of schoolteacher&lt;ref name="THE BELGIANS OF EGYPT, May 13, 1995"&gt;[http://www.egy.com/community/95-05-13.shtml THE BELGIANS OF EGYPT, 13 May 1995&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719234702/http://egy.com/community/95-05-13.shtml |date=19 July 2006 }} at www.egy.com&lt;/ref&gt; François Julien Empain and his wife Catherine (née Solivier). He went into business with his brother, [[Baron François Empain]] and other family members, and amassed a great fortune.

Empain began his career a draughtsman at a metallurgical company, Société métallurgique, in 1878,&lt;ref name="EMPAIN Edouard"&gt;[http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/1995_Cent_Wallons/Empain_Edouard.htm EMPAIN Edouard&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] at www.wallonie-en-ligne.net&lt;/ref&gt; and became involved in railway construction when he noticed that transport infrastructure in the countryside was inadequate. After success in Belgium with the [[Liège (city)|Liège]]-[[Jemappes|Jemeppe]] line,&lt;ref name="EMPAIN Edouard"/&gt; his companies developed several railway lines in France, including the creation of the [[Paris Métro]].

Because he felt that he depended too much on the banks for his industrial plans, in 1881 he founded his own bank, Banque Empain, which later became the Belgian Industrial Bank (''"Banque Industrielle Belge"'').&lt;ref name="EMPAIN Edouard"/&gt; The Empain group of companies expanded greatly throughout the 1890s, constructing electric urban tramlines in Europe, [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Qing Dynasty|China]], the [[Belgian Congo]], and in [[Cairo]], [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]]. Desiring to also be independent of electricity producers, Empain also was involved in forming a number of electricity companies to power his projects.&lt;ref name="EMPAIN Edouard"/&gt;

==Egypt==

Édouard Empain arrived in Egypt in January 1904, intending to rescue one of the projects of his company [[Chemins de Fer de la Basse-Egypte|''S.A. des Chemins de Fer de la Basse-Egypte'']]; being the construction of a railway line linking [[Mansoura, Egypt|Mansourah]] (on the [[Nile]] river) to [[El Matareya|Matariya]] (on the far side of [[Lake Manzala]] from [[Port Said]]).&lt;ref name="BELGIAN COMPANIES IN EGYPT*"&gt;[http://www.booneshares.com/BELGIANCOMPANIESINEGYPT.htm BELGIAN COMPANIES IN EGYPT*&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314030229/http://www.booneshares.com/BELGIANCOMPANIESINEGYPT.htm |date=14 March 2007 }} at www.booneshares.com&lt;/ref&gt; Despite losing the railway contract to the British, [[Empain]] stayed on in Egypt.

In 1906, Empain established the [[Cairo Electric Railways and Heliopolis Oases Company]], which bought a very large stretch of desert (25&amp;nbsp;square kilometres) to the northeast of Cairo at a low price from the Egyptian government.&lt;ref name="BELGIAN COMPANIES IN EGYPT*"/&gt; Commencing in 1906 this company proceeded with the building of the new town of [[Heliopolis (Cairo Suburb)|Heliopolis]], in the desert ten kilometers from the center of [[Cairo]]. It was designed as a "city of luxury and leisure", with broad avenues and equipped with all necessary conveniences and infrastructure; water, drains, electricity, hotel facilities, such as the Heliopolis Palace Hotel&lt;ref name="BELGIAN COMPANIES IN EGYPT*"/&gt; (formerly the [[presidential palace]] of ex-President [[Hosni Mubarak]]) and Heliopolis House, and recreational amenities including a golf course, racetrack and park. In addition, there was housing for rent, offered in a range of innovative design types targeting specific social classes with detached and terraced villas, apartment buildings, tenement blocks with balcony access and workers' bungalows.

Today, Baron Empain is perhaps best known by modern visitors to Egypt for the building of a palace (the ''Palais Hindou'') in the Avenue des Palais (renamed Orouba Avenue following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]]) [[Heliopolis (Cairo Suburb)|Heliopolis]], Egypt. Inspired by [[Angkor Wat]] in Cambodia and the [[Hindu]] temples of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]],{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, the [[Baron Empain palace]] was designed by French architect [[Alexandre Marcel]] (1860–1928) and decorated by Georges-Louis Claude (1879–1963), with construction being completed in 1911.&lt;ref name="THE BELGIANS OF EGYPT, May 13, 1995"/&gt;

In 1905, Empain assisted the Belgian government in the purchase of an [[Old Kingdom]] [[mastaba]] for the royal museum in [[Brussels]], of which he was a benefactor. In 1907 he received the title of [[Baron]], and also suggested to Belgian Egyptologist [[Jean Capart]] that he excavate at Heliopolis, where his building constructions were underway. He also made it possible for Capart to acquire some fine ancient artefacts for the Brussels Museum.

==Military Career==

During [[World War I]], he was given the rank of general and directed armaments production at Paris and [[Le Havre]] for the Belgian army.

He died in [[Woluwe]], [[Belgium]], and was buried in the Our Lady of Heliopolis Basilica (''Basilique Notre-Dame d'Héliopolis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=William|title=Surrounded by barbed wire and shrouded in superstition: The crumbling Egyptian palace of tragic Belgian millionaire who raised a city from the desert|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2201662/Baron-Empain-Palace-A-Belgian-millionaire-Egyptian-palace-shrouded-superstition.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was succeeded as baron by his son, Jean Empain, who married American [[burlesque]] performer Rozell Rowland (sometimes Rozelle Rowland). They entertained frequently at the Heliopolis. Jean, 2nd Baron Empain, was succeeded by their son, [[Édouard-Jean Empain]].
