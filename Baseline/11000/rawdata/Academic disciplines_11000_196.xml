[[File:Amazon rain forest2.JPG|thumb|Amazon rain forest biotope]]

A '''biotope''' is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a living place for a specific assemblage of [[flora (plants)|plants]] and [[fauna (animals)|animals]]. ''Biotope'' is almost synonymous with the term ''[[habitat (ecology)|habitat]]'', which is more commonly used in English-speaking countries. However, in some countries these two terms are distinguished: the subject of a habitat is a [[population]], the subject of a biotope is a ''[[biocoenosis]]'' or ''biological community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.si.gunma-u.ac.jp/t/ishikawa/bachlers2003/HoshinoHP/hajimeni.htm Toshiyuki Hoshino. ''Fundamental research in nurtural management of large biotope aiming for regeneration of nature: Introduction''.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is an English [[loanword]] derived from the German ''[[:de:Biotop|Biotop]]'', which in turn came from the Greek ''bios'', "life" and ''topos'', "place". (The related word ''[[geotope]]'' has made its way into the English language by the same route, from the German ''[[:de:Geotop|Geotop]]''.) The word ''biotope'', literally translated, means an "area where life lives".

==Ecology==
The concept of a biotope was first advocated by [[Ernst Haeckel]] (1834-1919), a German zoologist famous for the [[recapitulation theory]]. In his book ''General Morphology'' (1866), which defines the term "[[ecology]]", he stresses the importance of the concept of habitat as a prerequisite for an organism's existence. Haeckel also explains that with one ecosystem, its [[biota (ecology)|biota]] is shaped by environmental factors (such as water, soil, and geographical features) and interaction among living things; the original idea of a biotope was closely related to evolutional theory. Following this, F. Dahl, a professor at the Berlin Zoological Museum, referred to this ecological system as a "biotope" (biotop) (1908).&lt;ref&gt;Atushi Iwasawa.(2005). ''Preservation of biotope from zoological view point: Introduction: What is biotope?'', from [http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 The January, 2005, issue of ''Biological Science News''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |date=December 9, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotope restoration==
Although the term "biotope" is considered to be a technical word with respect to ecology, in recent years the term is more generally used in administrative and civic activities. Since the 1970s the term "biotope" has received great attention as a keyword throughout Europe (mainly Germany) for the preservation, regeneration, and creation of natural environmental settings.&lt;ref&gt;''School biotope is a subject matter for environmental and lifelong learning''. Retrieved October 24, 2006, from [http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html Eco Culture Lab Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070307144430/http://www4.ocn.ne.jp/~fujimiya/biotope1.html |date=2007-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this context, the term "biotope" often refers to a smaller and more specific ecology and is very familiar to human life. In Germany especially, activities related to regenerating biotopes are enthusiastically received. These activities include —
* making [[roof garden]]s,
* reconstructing rivers to restore their natural qualities,
* leaving bushes or trees on farms,
* building nature parks along motorways "[[Autobahn]],"
* making school [[garden]]s or [[pond]]s by considering the [[ecosystem]], and
* bearing in mind ecological considerations in private gardens.

Various sectors play a part in these activities, including architecture, civil engineering, urban planning, traffic, agriculture, river engineering, [[limnology]], [[biology]], education, [[landscape gardening]], and domestic gardening. In all fields, all sorts of people are seeking a viable way for humans to respect other living things. The term "biotope" would include a complete environmental approach.&lt;ref&gt;Masahiro Matsuda.(n.d.) ''What is biotope?'' Retrieved December 10, 2006, from [http://www.tiara.cc/~germany/index_biotope.html Pages of environmental information in Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The following four points are the chief characteristics of biotopes.&lt;ref&gt;Shin Mizukoshi.(2005). ''Media Biotope: Characteristics of biotope'', p. 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Microscale===
A biotope is generally not considered to be a large-scale phenomenon. For example, a biotope might be a neighbouring park, a back garden, even potted plants or a fish tank on a porch. In other words, the biotope is not a macroscopic but a microscopic approach to preserving the ecosystem and biological diversity. So biotopes fit into ordinary people's daily activities and lives, with more people being able to take part in biotope creation and continuing management.

===Biotope networks===
It is commonly emphasised that biotopes should not be isolated. Instead biotopes need to be connected to each other and other surrounding life for without these connections to life-forms such as animals and plants, biotopes would not effectively work as a place in which diverse organisms live. So one of the most effective strategies for regenerating biotopes is to plan a ''stretch'' of biotopes, not just a ''point'' where animals and plants come and go. (Such an organic traffic course is called a [[Wildlife corridor|corridor]].) In the stretch method, the centre of the network would be large green tracts of land: a forest, natural park, or cemetery. By connecting parcels of land with smaller biotope areas such as a green belt along the river, small town parks, gardens, or even roadside trees, biotopes can exist in a network. In other words, a biotope is an open not a closed system and is a practicable strategy.

===Human daily life===
The term "biotope" does not apply to [[biosphere reserves]], which are completely separate from humans and become the object of human admiration. Instead, it is an active part of human daily life. For example, an ornamental flower bed may be considered a biotope (though rather a small one) since it enhances the experience of daily life. An area that has many functions, such as human living space, and is home to other living things, whether plant or animal, can be considered a biosphere reserve.

===Artificial===
When artificial items are introduced to a biotope setting, their design and arrangement is of great importance for biotope regeneration. Tree-planting areas where the surface is uneven results in plants that sprout and the nesting of small insects. A mat or net made from natural fibres will gradually biodegrade as it is exposed to the weather. So there is no binomial opposition between the natural and the artificial in a biotope. Rather, such artificial materials are widely used.

==Germany==
It is especially characteristic in Germany, which is the birthplace of the term biotope, that the authorities take the initiative in conserving biotopes, maintaining consistency with urban or rural planning and considering the regions' history and landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209103645/http://wwwsoc.nii.ac.jp/zsj/news/znews200501/zn200501.html#2 |archivedate=2007-12-09 |df= }} Atsushi.I.(2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal basis===
The federal nature protection law ([[Bundesnaturschutzgesetz or BNUM]], since 1976) requires that wild animals and plants and their community should be protected as part of the ecosystem in the specific diversity that has grown naturally and historically, and their biotope and other living conditions should be protected, preserved, developed, and restored. (Number 9, Clause 1, Article 2). The law also requires that some kinds of biotope that are full of a specific variety should not be harmed by development. So there is a law that mandates the protection of biotopes. There is also a provincial law corresponding to the federal one. Such developments were uncommon in those times.

===Landscape plan===
Many German states are obliged by law to produce a landscape plan ([[Landschaftsplan]]) as part of their urban planning, though these plans vary somewhat from place to place. The purpose of the "Landschaftsplan" is to protect the region's environment and landscape. These plans use text and figures to describe the present environmental state and proposed remedies. They consider, for example, the regional lie of the land, climate, wind direction, soil, ground water, type of biotope, distribution of animals and plants, inhabitants' welfare and competition with development projects.

===Citizen welfare===
Biotope preservation in cities also emphasises recreation and relaxation for citizens and improving the urban environment. For example, in the reserve of [[Karlsruhe]] in [[Baden-Württemberg]] people can cycle on the bike path or walk the dog, although it is forbidden to gather plants and animals there or walk in the exclusion zone. At the core of biotope preservation is the idea that if civic life is surrounded by a rich profusion of nature whose background is in local history and culture, it is improved by protecting nature and preserving the landscape.

==Aquaria==
The term "biotope" is also used by [[aquarium]] hobbyists to describe an [[aquascaping|aquarium setup]] that tries to simulate the natural [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] of specific fish. The idea is to replicate conditions such as water parameters, natural plants, water type ([[Freshwater aquarium|fresh]], [[Marine aquarium|saline]] or [[Brackish-water aquarium|brackish]]), lighting, and to include other native fish which usually live together in nature and as such, represent a particular real-world biotope. An example of one [[South American]] biotope type might be lots of [[bog-wood]], a few native plants, dark substrata and subdued lighting with floating plants, along with [[Marbled hatchetfish|marbled hatchets]], [[Pterophyllum|angels]], [[Cardinal tetra|cardinals]], [[Otocinclus|otos]], [[Corydoras|corys]] and [[Hypostomus plecostomus|plecostomus]].

== Applications ==
By comparing diseased connectome and healthy connectomes, we should gain insight into certain psychopathologies, such as [[neuropathic pain]], and potential therapies for them. Generally, the field of [[neuroscience]] would benefit from standardization and raw data. For example, connectome maps can be used to inform computational models of whole-brain dynamics.&lt;ref name="sporns"&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Connectome{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2011}}{{Self-published inline|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current neural networks mostly rely on probabilistic representations of connectivity patterns.&lt;ref name=pmid19662159&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nordlie |first1=Eilen |last2=Gewaltig |first2=Marc-Oliver |last3=Plesser |first3=Hans Ekkehard |editor1-last=Friston |editor1-first=Karl J. |title=Towards Reproducible Descriptions of Neuronal Network Models |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=5 |issue=8 |pages=e1000456 |year=2009 |pmid=19662159 |pmc=2713426 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000456|bibcode=2009PLSCB...5E0456N }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Connectogram]]s (circular diagrams of connectomics) have been used in [[traumatic brain injury]] cases to document the extent of damage to neural networks.&lt;ref name="Van Horn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Horn|first=John D.|author2=Irimia, A. |author3=Torgerson, C.M. |author4=Chambers, M.C. |author5=Kikinis, R. |author6=Toga, A.W. |title=Mapping connectivity damage in the case of Phineas Gage|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0037454|pmid=22616011|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0037454|pmc=3353935|pages=e37454|bibcode=2012PLoSO...737454V}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Irimia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irimia|first=Andrei |author2=Chambers, M.C. |author3=Torgerson, C.M. |author4=Filippou, M. |author5=Hovda, D.A. |author6=Alger, J.R. |author7=Gerig, G. |author8=Toga, A.W. |author9=Vespa, P.M. |author10=Kikinis, R. |author11=Van Horn, J.D. |title=Patient-tailored connectomics visualization for the assessment of white matter atrophy in traumatic brain injury|journal=Frontiers in Neurology|date=6 February 2012|doi=10.3389/fneur.2012.00010|pmid=22363313|pmc=3275792|volume=3|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human connectome can be viewed as a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)| graph]], and the rich tools, definitions and algorithms of the [[Graph theory]] can be applied to these graphs. Comparing the connectomes (or braingraphs) of healthy women and men, Szalkai et al.&lt;ref name=":47"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0130045|title = Graph Theoretical Analysis Reveals: Women’s Brains Are Better Connected than Men’s|last1 = Szalkai |first1 = Balazs|last2 = Varga |first2 = Balint |last3 = Grolmusz |first3 = Vince||date = 2015|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0130045|volume=10|number=7|pages=e0130045|pmid=26132764|pmc=4488527|arxiv=1501.00727|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1030045S}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Szalkai2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szalkai|first1=Balázs|last2=Varga|first2=Bálint|last3=Grolmusz|first3=Vince|title=Brain size bias compensated graph-theoretical parameters are also better in women’s structural connectomes|journal=Brain Imaging and Behavior|year=2017|issn=1931-7565|doi=10.1007/s11682-017-9720-0|pmid=28447246}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that in several deep graph-theoretical parameters, the structural connectome of women is significantly better connected than that of men. For example, women's connectome has more edges, higher minimum bipartition width, larger [[eigengap]], greater minimum [[vertex cover]] than that of men. The minimum bipartition width (or, in other words, the minimum balanced [[Cut (graph theory)| cut]]) is a well-known measure of quality of computer [[multistage interconnection networks]], it describes the possible bottlenecks in network communication: The higher this value is, the better is the network. The larger eigengap shows that the female connectome is better [[expander graph]] than the connectome of males. The better expanding property, the higher minimum bipartition width and the greater minimum [[vertex cover]] show deep advantages in network connectivity in the case of female braingraph.

Human connectomes have an individual variability, which can be measured with the [[cumulative distribution function]], as it was shown in &lt;ref name="Kerepesi2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kerepesi|first1=Csaba|last2=Szalkai|first2=Balázs|last3=Varga|first3=Bálint|last4=Grolmusz|first4=Vince|title=Comparative connectomics: Mapping the inter-individual variability of connections within the regions of the human brain|journal= Neuroscience Letters|year=2018||volume=662|issue=1|pages=17-21|doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2017.10.003|pmid=28988973|arxiv=1507.00327}}&lt;/ref&gt;. By analyzing the individual variability of the human connectomes in distinct cerebral areas, it was found that the frontal and the limbic lobes are more conservative, and the edges in the temporal and occipital lobes are more diverse. A “hybrid” conservative/diverse distribution was detected in the paracentral lobule and the fusiform gyrus. Smaller cortical areas were also evaluated: precentral gyri were found to be more conservative, and the postcentral and the superior temporal gyri to be very diverse.

Scholarpedia.org.{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2011}}{{Self-published inline|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coinage of the word is seen in two sources, in an article by Olaf Sporns&lt;ref name=pmid16201007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sporns |first1=Olaf |last2=Tononi |first2=Giulio |last3=Kötter |first3=Rolf |title=The Human Connectome: A Structural Description of the Human Brain |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=e42 |year=2005 |pmid=16201007 |pmc=1239902 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010042|bibcode=2005PLSCB...1...42S }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a PhD thesis by Patric Hagmann.&lt;ref name="vpaa.epfl.ch"&gt;Hagmann, Patric (April 21, 2005).

Ph.D. Thesis. pp. 1, 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have criticized attempts towards a microscale connectome, arguing that we don't have enough knowledge about where to look for insights, or that it cannot be completed within a realistic time frame.&lt;ref name="Seeking the Connectome, a Mental Map, Slice by Slice"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/28/science/28brain.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ashlee | last=Vance | title=Seeking the Connectome, a Mental Map, Slice by Slice | date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to genomics ==
The [[human genome project]] initially faced many of the above criticisms, but was nevertheless completed ahead of schedule and has led to many advances in genetics. Some have argued that analogies can be made between genomics and connectomics, and therefore we should be at least slightly more optimistic about the prospects in connectomics.&lt;ref name=pmid18801435&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lichtman |first1=J |last2=Sanes |first2=J |title=Ome sweet ome: what can the genome tell us about the connectome? |journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=346–53 |year=2008 |pmid=18801435 |pmc=2735215 |doi=10.1016/j.conb.2008.08.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crescograph''' is a device for measuring the growth in [[plants]]. It was invented in the early 20th century by Sir [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]].

The Bose crescograph uses a series of clockwork gears and a [[smoked glass]] plate to record the movement of the tip of a plant (or its roots) at magnifications of up to 10,000. Marks are made on the plate at intervals of a few seconds, demonstrating how the rate of growth varies under varying stimuli. Bose experimented with temperature, chemicals, gases, and electricity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jagadis Bose Research on Measurement of Plant Growth (reproductions of Bose Research Institute books from the Hanscom AFB Geophysical Research Library)|url=http://www.edsanders.com/bose|accessdate=April 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electronic crescograph plant movement detector is capable of measurements as small as 1/1,000,000 of an inch. However, its normal operating range is from 1/1000 to 1/10,000 of an inch. The component which actually measures the movement is a differential transformer along with a movable core hinged between two points. A [[micrometer]] is used to adjust and calibrate the system. It could record plant growth, magnifying a small movement as much as 10,000,000 times.

[[File:Saccharum_officinarum_red_canes.JPG|thumb|right|alt=A tuft of sugarcane with red, thick stems|Culms of [[sugarcane]]]]

A '''culm''' is the aerial (above-ground) stem of a [[grass]] or [[sedge]]. It is derived from {{wikt-lang|la|culmus}}, the Latin word for "stalk", and it originally referred to the [[plant stem|stem]] of any type of [[plant]].&lt;ref&gt;MacGillavray, William ''A Manual of Botany'' London 1840. p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malting==
In the production of malted grains the culms refer to the rootlets of the germinated grains. The culms are normally removed in a process known as "deculming" after kilning when producing [[barley]] malt, but form an important part of the product when making [[sorghum]] or [[millet]] malt. These culms are very nutritious and are sold off as animal feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGA/AGAP/FRG/AFRIS/Data/467.HTM | title=Malt culms, malt sprouts, malt coombs | publisher=Animal Feed Resources Information System | accessdate=December 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two DNA strands are also known as [[polynucleotide]]s as they are composed of simpler [[monomer]]ic units called [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |vauthors= Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P |title= Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition= 6th |publisher= Garland |year= 2014 |url= http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |page= Chapter 4: DNA, Chromosomes and Genomes |isbn= 9780815344322 |deadurl= no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714210549/http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815344322 |archive-date= 14 July 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Purcell|first1=Adam|name-list-format=vanc|title=DNA|url=http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna|website=Basic Biology|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105045651/http://basicbiology.net/micro/genetics/dna/|archive-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each nucleotide is composed of one of four [[nitrogenous base|nitrogen-containing]] [[nucleobase]]s ([[cytosine]] [C], [[guanine]] [G], [[adenine]] [A] or [[thymine]] [T]), a [[monosaccharide|sugar]] called [[deoxyribose]], and a [[Organophosphate|phosphate group]]. The nucleotides are joined to one another in a chain by [[covalent bond]]s between the sugar of one nucleotide and the phosphate of the next, resulting in an alternating [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]]. The nitrogenous bases of the two separate polynucleotide strands are bound together, according to [[base pair]]ing rules (A with T and C with G), with [[hydrogen bond]]s to make double-stranded DNA.

The complementary nitrogenous bases are divided into two groups, [[pyrimidine]]s and [[purine]]s. In DNA, the pyrimidines are thymine and cytosine; the purines are adenine and guanine.

Both strands of double-stranded DNA store the same biological [[information]]. This information is replicated as and when the two strands separate. A large part of DNA (more than 98% for humans) is [[non-coding DNA|non-coding]], meaning that these sections do not serve as patterns for protein sequences.

The two strands of DNA run in opposite directions to each other and are thus [[antiparallel (biochemistry)|antiparallel]]. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of nucleobases (informally, ''bases''). It is the [[Nucleic acid sequence|sequence]] of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes genetic information. [[RNA]] strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Under the [[genetic code]], these RNA strands specify the sequence of [[amino acid]]s within proteins in a process called [[translation (genetics)|translation]].

Within eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized into long structures called [[chromosome]]s. Before typical [[cell division]], these chromosomes are duplicated in the process of [[DNA replication]], providing a complete set of chromosomes for each daughter cell. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic organisms]] ([[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[protist]]s) store most of their DNA inside the [[cell nucleus]] and some in [[organelle]]s, such as [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] or [[chloroplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Russell |first= Peter | name-list-format = vanc | title= iGenetics |publisher= Benjamin Cummings |location= New York |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-8053-4553-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]) store their DNA only in the [[cytoplasm]]. Within eukaryotic chromosomes, [[chromatin]] proteins, such as [[histone]]s, compact and organize DNA. These compact structures guide the interactions between DNA and other proteins, helping control which parts of the DNA are transcribed.

DNA was first isolated by [[Friedrich Miescher]] in 1869. Its molecular structure was first identified by [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1953, whose model-building efforts were guided by [[X-ray diffraction]] data acquired by [[Raymond Gosling]], who was a post-graduate student of [[Rosalind Franklin]]. DNA is used by researchers as a molecular tool to explore physical laws and theories, such as the [[ergodic theorem]] and the theory of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]. The unique material properties of DNA have made it an attractive molecule for material scientists and engineers interested in micro- and nano-fabrication. Among notable advances in this field are [[DNA origami]] and DNA-based hybrid materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mashaghi A, Katan A |title=A physicist's view of DNA |journal=De Physicus|volume=24e |issue=3 |pages=59–61 |year=2013 |arxiv= 1311.2545v1 |bibcode=2013arXiv1311.2545M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a [[polynucleotide]].&lt;ref name="IUPAC"&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html Abbreviations and Symbols for Nucleic Acids, Polynucleotides and their Constituents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205191106/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iupac/misc/naabb.html |date=5 February 2007 }} IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical Nomenclature (CBN).

The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form [[phosphodiester bond]]s between the third and fifth carbon [[atom]]s of adjacent sugar rings, which are known as the 3′ and 5′ carbons, the prime symbol being used to distinguish these carbon atoms from those of the base to which the deoxyribose forms a [[glycosidic bond]]. When imagining DNA, each phosphoryl is normally considered to "belong" to the nucleotide whose 5′ carbon forms a bond therewith. Any DNA strand therefore normally has one end at which there is a phosphoryl attached to the 5′ carbon of a ribose (the 5′ phosphoryl) and another end at which there is a free hydroxyl attached to the 3′ carbon of a ribose (the 3′ hydroxyl). The orientation of the 3′ and 5′ carbons along the sugar-phosphate backbone confers directionality (sometimes called polarity) to each DNA strand. In a double helix, the direction of the nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are ''antiparallel''. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a [[directionality (molecular biology)|directionality]] of ''five prime'' (5′) and ''three prime'' (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and [[RNA]] is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar [[ribose]] in RNA.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt;

===Nucleobase classification===
The nucleobases are classified into two types: the [[purine]]s, A and G, which are fused five- and six-membered [[heterocyclic compound]]s, and the [[pyrimidine]]s, the six-membered rings C and T.&lt;ref name=berg/&gt; A fifth pyrimidine nucleobase, [[uracil]] (U), usually takes the place of thymine in RNA and differs from thymine by lacking a [[methyl group]] on its ring. In addition to RNA and DNA, many artificial [[nucleic acid analogue]]s have been created to study the properties of nucleic acids, or for use in biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Verma S, Eckstein F | title = Modified oligonucleotides: synthesis and strategy for users | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 67 | pages = 99–134 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759484 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.99 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-canonical bases===

Uracil is not usually found in DNA, occurring only as a breakdown product of cytosine.

The reason for the presence of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that at least part of the reason for their presence in bacterial viruses (phages) is to avoid the [[restriction enzyme]]s present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.

===Grooves===
Twin helical strands form the DNA backbone. Another double helix may be found tracing the spaces, or grooves, between the strands. These voids are adjacent to the base pairs and may provide a [[binding site]]. As the strands are not symmetrically located with respect to each other, the grooves are unequally sized. One groove, the major groove, is 22&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]] wide and the other, the minor groove, is 12&amp;nbsp;Å wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wing R, Drew H, Takano T, Broka C, Tanaka S, Itakura K, Dickerson RE | title = Crystal structure analysis of a complete turn of B-DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 287 | issue = 5784 | pages = 755–8 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7432492 | doi = 10.1038/287755a0 | bibcode = 1980Natur.287..755W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The width of the major groove means that the edges of the bases are more accessible in the major groove than in the minor groove. As a result, proteins such as [[transcription factor]]s that can bind to specific sequences in double-stranded DNA usually make contact with the sides of the bases exposed in the major groove.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pabo CO, Sauer RT | title = Protein-DNA recognition | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 53 | pages = 293–321 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6236744 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.53.070184.001453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This situation varies in unusual conformations of DNA within the cell ''(see below)'', but the major and minor grooves are always named to reflect the differences in size that would be seen if the DNA is twisted back into the ordinary B form.

===Base pairing===
{{further|Base pair}}

In a DNA double helix, each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand. This is called complementary [[base pair]]ing. Here, purines form [[hydrogen bond]]s to pyrimidines, with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds. This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a Watson-Crick base pair. Another type of base pairing is Hoogsteen base pairing where two hydrogen bonds form between guanine and cytosine.&lt;ref name="pmid23818176"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nikolova EN, Zhou H, Gottardo FL, Alvey HS, Kimsey IJ, Al-Hashimi HM |title=A historical account of Hoogsteen base-pairs in duplex DNA |journal=Biopolymers |volume=99 |issue=12 |pages=955–68 |year=2013 |pmid=23818176 |pmc=3844552 |doi=10.1002/bip.22334 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As hydrogen bonds are not [[covalent bond|covalent]], they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily. The two strands of DNA in a double helix can thus be pulled apart like a zipper, either by a mechanical force or high [[temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clausen-Schaumann H, Rief M, Tolksdorf C, Gaub HE | title = Mechanical stability of single DNA molecules | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 78 | issue = 4 | pages = 1997–2007 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10733978 | pmc = 1300792 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(00)76747-6 | bibcode = 2000BpJ....78.1997C }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this base pair complementarity, all the information in the double-stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand, which is vital in DNA replication. This reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

The two types of base pairs form different numbers of hydrogen bonds, AT forming two hydrogen bonds, and GC forming three hydrogen bonds (see figures, right).
DNA with high [[GC-content]] is more stable than DNA with low GC-content.

{{Anchor|ssDNA}}
As noted above, most DNA molecules are actually two polymer strands, bound together in a helical fashion by noncovalent bonds; this double-stranded ('''dsDNA''') structure is maintained largely by the intrastrand base stacking interactions, which are strongest for G,C stacks. The two strands can come apart&amp;nbsp;– a process known as melting&amp;nbsp;– to form two single-stranded DNA ('''ssDNA''') molecules. Melting occurs at high temperature, low salt and high [[pH]] (low pH also melts DNA, but since DNA is unstable due to acid depurination, low pH is rarely used).

The stability of the dsDNA form depends not only on the GC-content (% G,C basepairs) but also on sequence (since stacking is sequence specific) and also length (longer molecules are more stable). The stability can be measured in various ways; a common way is the "melting temperature", which is the temperature at which 50% of the ds molecules are converted to ss molecules; melting temperature is dependent on ionic strength and the concentration of DNA. As a result, it is both the percentage of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines the strength of the association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chalikian TV, Völker J, Plum GE, Breslauer KJ | title = A more unified picture for the thermodynamics of nucleic acid duplex melting: a characterization by calorimetric and volumetric techniques | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 96 | issue = 14 | pages = 7853–8 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10393911 | pmc = 22151 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.96.14.7853 | bibcode = 1999PNAS...96.7853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT [[Pribnow box]] in some [[promoter (biology)|promoters]], tend to have a high AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = deHaseth PL, Helmann JD | title = Open complex formation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase: the mechanism of polymerase-induced strand separation of double helical DNA | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 817–24 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7476180 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1995.tb02309.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, the strength of this interaction can be measured by finding the temperature necessary to break the hydrogen bonds, their [[DNA melting|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value). When all the base pairs in a DNA double helix melt, the strands separate and exist in solution as two entirely independent molecules. These single-stranded DNA molecules have no single common shape, but some conformations are more stable than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Isaksson J, Acharya S, Barman J, Cheruku P, Chattopadhyaya J | title = Single-stranded adenine-rich DNA and RNA retain structural characteristics of their respective double-stranded conformations and show directional differences in stacking pattern | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 43 | issue = 51 | pages = 15996–6010 | date = December 2004 | pmid = 15609994 | doi = 10.1021/bi048221v | url = http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | deadurl = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070610205112/http://www.boc.uu.se/boc14www/thesis/johan2005/Paper%20V/Paper%20V.pdf | archive-date = 10 June 2007 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sense and antisense===
{{further|Sense (molecular biology)}}

A DNA sequence is called "sense" if its sequence is the same as that of a [[messenger RNA]] copy that is translated into protein.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html Designation of the two strands of DNA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015915/http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/newsletter/misc/DNA.html |date=24 April 2008 }} JCBN/NC-IUB Newsletter 1989. Retrieved 7 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence on the opposite strand is called the "antisense" sequence. Both sense and antisense sequences can exist on different parts of the same strand of DNA (i.e. both strands can contain both sense and antisense sequences). In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, antisense RNA sequences are produced, but the functions of these RNAs are not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hüttenhofer A, Schattner P, Polacek N | title = Non-coding RNAs: hope or hype? | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 289–97 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15851066 | doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2005.03.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposal is that antisense RNAs are involved in regulating [[gene expression]] through RNA-RNA base pairing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Munroe SH | title = Diversity of antisense regulation in eukaryotes: multiple mechanisms, emerging patterns | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 93 | issue = 4 | pages = 664–71 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15389973 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20252 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few DNA sequences in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and more in [[plasmid]]s and [[virus]]es, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having [[overlapping gene]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makalowska I, Lin CF, Makalowski W | title = Overlapping genes in vertebrate genomes | journal = Computational Biology and Chemistry | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–12 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15680581 | doi = 10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2004.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read in the opposite direction along the other strand. In [[bacteria]], this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson ZI, Chisholm SW | title = Properties of overlapping genes are conserved across microbial genomes | journal = Genome Research | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 2268–72 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15520290 | pmc = 525685 | doi = 10.1101/gr.2433104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lamb RA, Horvath CM | title = Diversity of coding strategies in influenza viruses | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 8 | pages = 261–6 | date = August 1991 | pmid = 1771674 | doi = 10.1016/0168-9525(91)90326-L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supercoiling===
{{further|DNA supercoil}}
DNA can be twisted like a rope in a process called [[DNA supercoil]]ing. With DNA in its "relaxed" state, a strand usually circles the axis of the double helix once every 10.4 base pairs, but if the DNA is twisted the strands become more tightly or more loosely wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Benham CJ, Mielke SP | title = DNA mechanics | journal = Annual Review of Biomedical Engineering | volume = 7 | pages = 21–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16004565 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bioeng.6.062403.132016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the DNA is twisted in the direction of the helix, this is positive supercoiling, and the bases are held more tightly together. If they are twisted in the opposite direction, this is negative supercoiling, and the bases come apart more easily. In nature, most DNA has slight negative supercoiling that is introduced by [[enzyme]]s called [[topoisomerase]]s.&lt;ref name=Champoux&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Champoux JJ | title = DNA topoisomerases: structure, function, and mechanism | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 70 | pages = 369–413 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11395412 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.70.1.369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are also needed to relieve the twisting stresses introduced into DNA strands during processes such as [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang JC | title = Cellular roles of DNA topoisomerases: a molecular perspective | journal = Nature Reviews.

===Alternative DNA chemistry===
For many years, [[Astrobiology|exobiologists]] have proposed the existence of a [[shadow biosphere]], a postulated microbial biosphere of Earth that uses radically different biochemical and molecular processes than currently known life. One of the proposals was the existence of lifeforms that use [[Arsenic DNA|arsenic instead of phosphorus in DNA]].

===Quadruplex structures===
{{further|G-quadruplex}}

At the ends of the linear chromosomes are specialized regions of DNA called [[telomere]]s. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme [[telomerase]], as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Greider&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greider CW, Blackburn EH | title = Identification of a specific telomere terminal transferase activity in Tetrahymena extracts | journal = Cell | volume = 43 | issue = 2 Pt 1 | pages = 405–13 | date = December 1985 | pmid = 3907856 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(85)90170-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the [[DNA repair]] systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected.&lt;ref name=Nugent&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nugent CI, Lundblad V | title = The telomerase reverse transcriptase: components and regulation | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 1073–85 | date = April 1998 | pmid = 9553037 | doi = 10.1101/gad.12.8.1073 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[List of distinct cell types in the adult human body|human cells]], telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright WE, Tesmer VM, Huffman KE, Levene SD, Shay JW | title = Normal human chromosomes have long G-rich telomeric overhangs at one end | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 11 | issue = 21 | pages = 2801–9 | date = November 1997 | pmid = 9353250 | pmc = 316649 | doi = 10.1101/gad.11.21.2801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These guanine-rich sequences may stabilize chromosome ends by forming structures of stacked sets of four-base units, rather than the usual base pairs found in other DNA molecules. Here, four guanine bases form a flat plate and these flat four-base units then stack on top of each other, to form a stable [[G-quadruplex]] structure.&lt;ref name=Burge&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Burge S, Parkinson GN, Hazel P, Todd AK, Neidle S | title = Quadruplex DNA: sequence, topology and structure | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 34 | issue = 19 | pages = 5402–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17012276 | pmc = 1636468 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures are stabilized by hydrogen bonding between the edges of the bases and [[chelation]] of a metal ion in the centre of each four-base unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parkinson GN, Lee MP, Neidle S | title = Crystal structure of parallel quadruplexes from human telomeric DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 417 | issue = 6891 | pages = 876–80 | date = June 2002 | pmid = 12050675 | doi = 10.1038/nature755 | bibcode = 2002Natur.417..876P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other structures can also be formed, with the central set of four bases coming from either a single strand folded around the bases, or several different parallel strands, each contributing one base to the central structure.

In addition to these stacked structures, telomeres also form large loop structures called telomere loops, or T-loops. Here, the single-stranded DNA curls around in a long circle stabilized by telomere-binding proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griffith JD, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, Stansel RM, Bianchi A, Moss H, de Lange T | title = Mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop | journal = Cell | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–14 | date = May 1999 | pmid = 10338214 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80760-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the very end of the T-loop, the single-stranded telomere DNA is held onto a region of double-stranded DNA by the telomere strand disrupting the double-helical DNA and base pairing to one of the two strands. This [[Triple-stranded DNA|triple-stranded]] structure is called a displacement loop or [[D-loop]].&lt;ref name=Burge/&gt;

===Branched DNA===
{{further|Branched DNA|DNA nanotechnology}}

In DNA, [[DNA end#Frayed ends|fraying]] occurs when non-complementary regions exist at the end of an otherwise complementary double-strand of DNA. However, branched DNA can occur if a third strand of DNA is introduced and contains adjoining regions able to hybridize with the frayed regions of the pre-existing double-strand. Although the simplest example of branched DNA involves only three strands of DNA, complexes involving additional strands and multiple branches are also possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seeman NC | title = DNA enables nanoscale control of the structure of matter | journal = Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16515737 | pmc = 3478329 | doi = 10.1017/S0033583505004087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Branched DNA can be used in [[nanotechnology]] to construct geometric shapes, see the section on [[DNA#Uses in technology|uses in technology]] below.

===Base modifications and DNA packaging===
{{further|DNA methylation|Chromatin remodeling}}
The expression of genes is influenced by how the DNA is packaged in chromosomes, in a structure called [[chromatin]]. Base modifications can be involved in packaging, with regions that have low or no gene expression usually containing high levels of [[methylation]] of [[cytosine]] bases. DNA packaging and its influence on gene expression can also occur by covalent modifications of the [[histone]] protein core around which DNA is wrapped in the chromatin structure or else by remodeling carried out by chromatin remodeling complexes (see [[Chromatin remodeling]]). There is, further, [[Crosstalk (biology)|crosstalk]] between DNA methylation and histone modification, so they can coordinately affect chromatin and gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu Q, Rosenfeld MG | title = Epigenetic regulation of human embryonic stem cells | journal = Frontiers in Genetics | volume = 3 | pages = 238 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23133442 | pmc = 3488762 | doi = 10.3389/fgene.2012.00238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For one example, cytosine methylation produces [[5-Methylcytosine|5-methylcytosine]], which is important for [[X-inactivation]] of chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klose RJ, Bird AP | title = Genomic DNA methylation: the mark and its mediators | journal = Trends in Biochemical Sciences | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 89–97 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16403636 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibs.2005.12.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The average level of methylation varies between organisms&amp;nbsp;– the worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' lacks cytosine methylation, while [[vertebrate]]s have higher levels, with up to 1% of their DNA containing 5-methylcytosine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bird A | title = DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–21 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11782440 | doi = 10.1101/gad.947102 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the importance of 5-methylcytosine, it can [[deamination|deaminate]] to leave a thymine base, so methylated cytosines are particularly prone to [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walsh CP, Xu GL | title = Cytosine methylation and DNA repair | journal = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology | volume = 301 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16570853 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-31390-7_11 | isbn = 3-540-29114-8 | series = Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other base modifications include adenine methylation in bacteria, the presence of [[5-hydroxymethylcytosine]] in the [[brain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kriaucionis S, Heintz N | title = The nuclear DNA base 5-hydroxymethylcytosine is present in Purkinje neurons and the brain | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 929–30 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19372393 | pmc = 3263819 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169786 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..929K }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[glycosylation]] of uracil to produce the "J-base" in [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ratel D, Ravanat JL, Berger F, Wion D | title = N6-methyladenine: the other methylated base of DNA | journal = BioEssays | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 309–15 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16479578 | pmc = 2754416 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gommers-Ampt JH, Van Leeuwen F, de Beer AL, Vliegenthart JF, Dizdaroglu M, Kowalak JA, Crain PF, Borst P | title = beta-D-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil: a novel modified base present in the DNA of the parasitic protozoan T. brucei | journal = Cell | volume = 75 | issue = 6 | pages = 1129–36 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 8261512 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(93)90322-H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNA can be damaged by many sorts of [[mutagen]]s, which change the DNA sequence. Mutagens include [[oxidizing agent]]s, [[Alkylation|alkylating agents]] and also high-energy [[electromagnetic radiation]] such as [[ultraviolet]] light and [[X-ray]]s.

Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs, this is called ''[[intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalation]]''. Most intercalators are [[aromaticity|aromatic]] and planar molecules; examples include [[ethidium bromide]], [[acridine]]s, [[Daunorubicin|daunomycin]], and [[doxorubicin]].

The set of chromosomes in a cell makes up its [[genome]]; the [[human genome]] has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes.&lt;ref name = "Venter_2001"/&gt; The information carried by DNA is held in the [[DNA sequence|sequence]] of pieces of DNA called [[gene]]s. [[Transmission (genetics)|Transmission]] of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the DNA and the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then used to make a matching [[Peptide sequence|protein sequence]] in a process called [[Translation (biology)|translation]], which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here the focus is on the interactions between DNA and other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.

===Genes and genomes===
{{further|Cell nucleus|Chromatin|Chromosome|Gene|Noncoding DNA}}
Genomic DNA is tightly and orderly packed in the process called [[DNA condensation]], to fit the small available volumes of the cell. In eukaryotes, DNA is located in the [[cell nucleus]], with small amounts in [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the [[nucleoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanbichler M, Wang SC, Shapiro L | title = The bacterial nucleoid: a highly organized and dynamic structure | journal = Journal of Cellular Biochemistry | volume = 96 | issue = 3 | pages = 506–21 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 15988757 | doi = 10.1002/jcb.20519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete set of this information in an organism is called its [[genotype]]. A gene is a unit of [[heredity]] and is a region of DNA that influences a particular characteristic in an organism. Genes contain an [[open reading frame]] that can be transcribed, and [[regulatory sequence]]s such as [[promoter (biology)|promoters]] and [[enhancer (genetics)|enhancers]], which control transcription of the open reading frame.

In many [[species]], only a small fraction of the total sequence of the [[genome]] encodes protein. For example, only about 1.5% of the human genome consists of protein-coding [[exon]]s, with over 50% of human DNA consisting of non-coding [[repeated sequence (DNA)|repetitive sequences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolfsberg TG, McEntyre J, Schuler GD | title = Guide to the draft human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 824–6 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11236998 | doi = 10.1038/35057000 | bibcode = 2001Natur.409..824W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the presence of so much [[noncoding DNA]] in eukaryotic genomes and the extraordinary differences in [[genome size]], or ''[[C-value]]'', among species, represent a long-standing puzzle known as the "[[C-value enigma]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gregory TR | title = The C-value enigma in plants and animals: a review of parallels and an appeal for partnership | journal = Annals of Botany | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 133–46 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15596463 | doi = 10.1093/aob/mci009 | pmc = 4246714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some DNA sequences that do not code protein may still encode functional [[non-coding RNA]] molecules, which are involved in the [[regulation of gene expression]].&lt;ref name = "Birney_2007" /&gt;

Some noncoding DNA sequences play structural roles in chromosomes. [[Telomere]]s and [[centromere]]s typically contain few genes but are important for the function and stability of chromosomes.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pidoux AL, Allshire RC | title = The role of heterochromatin in centromere function | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

===Transcription and translation===
{{further|Genetic code|Transcription (genetics)|Protein biosynthesis}}
A gene is a sequence of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the [[phenotype]] of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a [[messenger RNA]] sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the [[amino acid|amino-acid]] sequences of proteins is determined by the rules of [[Translation (biology)|translation]], known collectively as the [[genetic code]]. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called ''codons'' formed from a sequence of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).

In transcription, the codons of a gene are copied into messenger RNA by [[RNA polymerase]]. This RNA copy is then decoded by a [[ribosome]] that reads the RNA sequence by base-pairing the messenger RNA to [[transfer RNA]], which carries amino acids. Since there are 4 bases in 3-letter combinations, there are 64 possible codons (4&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;combinations). These encode the twenty [[list of standard amino acids|standard amino acids]], giving most amino acids more than one possible codon. There are also three 'stop' or 'nonsense' codons signifying the end of the coding region; these are the TAA, TGA, and TAG codons.

[[File:DNA replication en.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|DNA replication. The double helix is unwound by a [[helicase]] and [[topoisomerase]]. Next, one [[DNA polymerase]] produces the [[Replication fork|leading strand]] copy. Another DNA polymerase binds to the [[Replication fork|lagging strand]]. This enzyme makes discontinuous segments (called [[Okazaki fragment]]s) before [[DNA ligase]] joins them together.]]

===Replication===
{{further|DNA replication}}

[[Cell division]] is essential for an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]]. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's [[complementary DNA]] sequence is recreated by an [[enzyme]] called [[DNA polymerase]]. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a DNA strand in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Albà M | title = Replicative DNA polymerases | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS3002 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11178285 | pmc = 150442 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2001-2-1-reviews3002 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.

===Extracellular nucleic acids===
Naked extracellular DNA (eDNA), most of it released by cell death, is nearly ubiquitous in the environment. Its concentration in soil may be as high as 2 μg/L, and its concentration in natural aquatic environments may be as high at 88 μg/L.&lt;ref name=Tani_2010&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tani |first1=Katsuji |last2=Nasu |first2=Masao |editor-last1=Kikuchi|editor-first1=Yo |editor-last2=Rykova |editor-first2=Elena Y. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Extracellular Nucleic Acids |publisher=Springer |date=2010 |pages=25–38 |chapter=Roles of Extracellular DNA in Bacterial Ecosystems |isbn=978-3-642-12616-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various possible functions have been proposed for eDNA: it may be involved in horizontal gene transfer;&lt;ref name="Vlassov_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlassov VV, Laktionov PP, Rykova EY | title = Extracellular nucleic acids | journal = BioEssays | volume = 29 | issue = 7 | pages = 654–67 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17563084 | doi = 10.1002/bies.20604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it may provide nutrients;&lt;ref name="pmid11591672"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Finkel SE, Kolter R | title = DNA as a nutrient: novel role for bacterial competence gene homologs | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 183 | issue = 21 | pages = 6288–93 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11591672 | pmc = 100116 | doi = 10.1128/JB.183.21.6288-6293.2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it may act as a buffer to recruit or titrate ions or antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Mulcahy_2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mulcahy H, Charron-Mazenod L, Lewenza S | title = Extracellular DNA chelates cations and induces antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 4 | issue = 11 | pages = e1000213 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19023416 | pmc = 2581603 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Extracellular DNA acts as a functional extracellular matrix component in the [[biofilm]]s of several bacterial species.

==Interactions with proteins==
All the functions of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These [[protein interactions]] can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.

Structural proteins that bind DNA are well-understood examples of non-specific DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA is held in complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called [[chromatin]]. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called [[histone]]s, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandman K, Pereira SL, Reeve JN | title = Diversity of prokaryotic chromosomal proteins and the origin of the nucleosome | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 54 | issue = 12 | pages = 1350–64 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9893710 | doi = 10.1007/s000180050259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dame RT | title = The role of nucleoid-associated proteins in the organization and compaction of bacterial chromatin | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 56 | issue = 4 | pages = 858–70 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15853876 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04598.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a [[nucleosome]], which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface.

A distinct group of DNA-binding proteins is the DNA-binding proteins that specifically bind single-stranded DNA. In humans, replication [[protein A]] is the best-understood member of this family and is used in processes where the double helix is separated, including DNA replication, recombination, and DNA repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iftode C, Daniely Y, Borowiec JA | title = Replication protein A (RPA): the eukaryotic SSB | journal = Critical Reviews in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 141–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10473346 | doi = 10.1080/10409239991209255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These binding proteins seem to stabilize single-stranded DNA and protect it from forming [[stem-loop]]s or being degraded by [[nuclease]]s.

In contrast, other proteins have evolved to bind to particular DNA sequences. The most intensively studied of these are the various [[transcription factor]]s, which are proteins that regulate transcription. Each transcription factor binds to one particular set of DNA sequences and activates or inhibits the transcription of genes that have these sequences close to their promoters. The transcription factors do this in two ways. Firstly, they can bind the RNA polymerase responsible for transcription, either directly or through other mediator proteins; this locates the polymerase at the promoter and allows it to begin transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Myers LC, Kornberg RD | title = Mediator of transcriptional regulation | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 69 | pages = 729–49 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10966474 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.69.1.729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, transcription factors can bind [[enzyme]]s that modify the histones at the promoter. This changes the accessibility of the DNA template to the polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spiegelman BM, Heinrich R | title = Biological control through regulated transcriptional coactivators | journal = Cell | volume = 119 | issue = 2 | pages = 157–67 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15479634 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2004.09.037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these DNA targets can occur throughout an organism's genome, changes in the activity of one type of transcription factor can affect thousands of genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li Z, Van Calcar S, Qu C, Cavenee WK, Zhang MQ, Ren B | title = A global transcriptional regulatory role for c-Myc in Burkitt's lymphoma cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 14 | pages = 8164–9 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12808131 | pmc = 166200 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1332764100 | bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.8164L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these proteins are often the targets of the [[signal transduction]] processes that control responses to environmental changes or [[cellular differentiation]] and development. The specificity of these transcription factors' interactions with DNA come from the proteins making multiple contacts to the edges of the DNA bases, allowing them to "read" the DNA sequence. Most of these base-interactions are made in the major groove, where the bases are most accessible.&lt;ref name="Pabo1984" /&gt;

===DNA-modifying enzymes===

====Nucleases and ligases====
[[Nuclease]]s are [[enzyme]]s that cut DNA strands by catalyzing the [[hydrolysis]] of the [[phosphodiester bond]]s. Nucleases that hydrolyse nucleotides from the ends of DNA strands are called [[exonuclease]]s, while [[endonuclease]]s cut within strands. The most frequently used nucleases in [[molecular biology]] are the [[restriction enzyme|restriction endonucleases]], which cut DNA at specific sequences. For instance, the EcoRV enzyme shown to the left recognizes the 6-base sequence 5′-GATATC-3′ and makes a cut at the horizontal line. In nature, these enzymes protect [[bacteria]] against [[Bacteriophage|phage]] infection by digesting the phage DNA when it enters the bacterial cell, acting as part of the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = June 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In technology, these sequence-specific nucleases are used in [[molecular cloning]] and [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA fingerprinting]].

Enzymes called [[DNA ligase]]s can rejoin cut or broken DNA strands.&lt;ref name=Doherty&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Doherty AJ, Suh SW | title = Structural and mechanistic conservation in DNA ligases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 4051–8 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11058099 | pmc = 113121 | doi = 10.1093/nar/28.21.4051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligases are particularly important in [[Replication fork|lagging strand]] DNA replication, as they join together the short segments of DNA produced at the [[replication fork]] into a complete copy of the DNA template. They are also used in [[DNA repair]] and [[genetic recombination]].&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt;

====Topoisomerases and helicases====
[[Topoisomerase]]s are enzymes with both nuclease and ligase activity. These proteins change the amount of [[DNA supercoil|supercoiling]] in DNA. Some of these enzymes work by cutting the DNA helix and allowing one section to rotate, thereby reducing its level of supercoiling; the enzyme then seals the DNA break.&lt;ref name=Champoux/&gt; Other types of these enzymes are capable of cutting one DNA helix and then passing a second strand of DNA through this break, before rejoining the helix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schoeffler AJ, Berger JM | title = Recent advances in understanding structure-function relationships in the type II topoisomerase mechanism | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 33 | issue = Pt 6 | pages = 1465–70 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16246147 | doi = 10.1042/BST20051465 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Topoisomerases are required for many processes involving DNA, such as DNA replication and transcription.&lt;ref name=Wang/&gt;

[[Helicase]]s are proteins that are a type of [[molecular motor]]. They use the chemical energy in [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s, predominantly [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP), to break hydrogen bonds between bases and unwind the DNA double helix into single strands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuteja N, Tuteja R | title = Unraveling DNA helicases. Motif, structure, mechanism and function | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 271 | issue = 10 | pages = 1849–63 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15128295 | doi = 10.1111/j.1432-1033.2004.04094.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes are essential for most processes where enzymes need to access the DNA bases.

====Polymerases====
[[Polymerase]]s are [[enzyme]]s that synthesize polynucleotide chains from [[nucleoside triphosphate]]s. The sequence of their products is created based on existing polynucleotide chains—which are called ''templates''. These enzymes function by repeatedly adding a nucleotide to the 3′ [[hydroxyl]] group at the end of the growing polynucleotide chain. As a consequence, all polymerases work in a 5′ to 3′ direction.&lt;ref name=Joyce&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Joyce CM, Steitz TA | title = Polymerase structures and function: variations on a theme? | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 177 | issue = 22 | pages = 6321–9 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 7592405 | pmc = 177480 | doi=10.1128/jb.177.22.6321-6329.1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active site]] of these enzymes, the incoming nucleoside triphosphate base-pairs to the template: this allows polymerases to accurately synthesize the complementary strand of their template. Polymerases are classified according to the type of template that they use.

In DNA replication, DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]s make copies of DNA polynucleotide chains. To preserve biological information, it is essential that the sequence of bases in each copy are precisely complementary to the sequence of bases in the template strand. Many DNA polymerases have a [[Proofreading (biology)|proofreading]] activity. Here, the polymerase recognizes the occasional mistakes in the synthesis reaction by the lack of base pairing between the mismatched nucleotides. If a mismatch is detected, a 3′ to 5′ [[exonuclease]] activity is activated and the incorrect base removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hubscher U, Maga G, Spadari S | title = Eukaryotic DNA polymerases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 133–63 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045093 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.090501.150041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most organisms, DNA polymerases function in a large complex called the [[replisome]] that contains multiple accessory subunits, such as the [[DNA clamp]] or [[helicase]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Johnson A, O'Donnell M | title = Cellular DNA replicases: components and dynamics at the replication fork | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 74 | pages = 283–315 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15952889 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.73.011303.073859 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RNA-dependent DNA polymerases are a specialized class of polymerases that copy the sequence of an RNA strand into DNA. They include [[reverse transcriptase]], which is a [[virus|viral]] enzyme involved in the infection of cells by [[retrovirus]]es, and [[telomerase]], which is required for the replication of telomeres.&lt;ref name=Greider/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tarrago-Litvak L, Andréola ML, Nevinsky GA, Sarih-Cottin L, Litvak S | title = The reverse transcriptase of HIV-1: from enzymology to therapeutic intervention | journal = FASEB Journal | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 497–503 | date = May 1994 | pmid = 7514143 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, HIV reverse transcriptase is an enzyme for AIDS virus replication.&lt;ref name=Tarrago-Litvak1994/&gt; Telomerase is an unusual polymerase because it contains its own RNA template as part of its structure. It synthesizes [[telomeres]] at the ends of chromosomes. Telomeres prevent fusion of the ends of neighboring chromosomes and protect chromosome ends from damage.&lt;ref name=Nugent/&gt;

Transcription is carried out by a DNA-dependent [[RNA polymerase]] that copies the sequence of a DNA strand into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a [[messenger RNA]] transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]], where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, [[RNA polymerase II]], the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates as part of a large [[protein complex]] with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martinez E | title = Multi-protein complexes in eukaryotic gene transcription | journal = Plant Molecular Biology | volume = 50 | issue = 6 | pages = 925–47 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12516863 | doi = 10.1023/A:1021258713850 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Genetic recombination}}
[[File:Chromosomal Recombination.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Recombination involves the breaking and rejoining of two chromosomes (M and F) to produce two rearranged chromosomes (C1 and C2).]]

A DNA helix usually does not interact with other segments of DNA, and in human cells, the different chromosomes even occupy separate areas in the nucleus called "[[chromosome territories]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cremer T, Cremer C | title = Chromosome territories, nuclear architecture and gene regulation in mammalian cells | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 292–301 | date = April 2001 | pmid = 11283701 | doi = 10.1038/35066075 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This physical separation of different chromosomes is important for the ability of DNA to function as a stable repository for information, as one of the few times chromosomes interact is in [[chromosomal crossover]] which occurs during [[sexual reproduction]], when [[genetic recombination]] occurs. Chromosomal crossover is when two DNA helices break, swap a section and then rejoin.

Recombination allows chromosomes to exchange genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, which increases the efficiency of [[natural selection]] and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pál C, Papp B, Lercher MJ | title = An integrated view of protein evolution | journal = Nature Reviews. Genetics | volume = 7 | issue = 5 | pages = 337–48 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16619049 | doi = 10.1038/nrg1838 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Driscoll M, Jeggo PA | title = The role of double-strand break repair - insights from human genetics | journal = Nature Reviews.

The most common form of chromosomal crossover is [[homologous recombination]], where the two chromosomes involved share very similar sequences. [[Non-homologous recombination]] can be damaging to cells, as it can produce [[chromosomal translocation]]s and genetic abnormalities. The recombination reaction is catalyzed by enzymes known as [[recombinase]]s, such as [[RAD51]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vispé S, Defais M | title = Mammalian Rad51 protein: a RecA homologue with pleiotropic functions | journal = Biochimie | volume = 79 | issue = 9–10 | pages = 587–92 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9466696 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(97)82007-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first step in recombination is a double-stranded break caused by either an [[endonuclease]] or damage to the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neale MJ, Keeney S | title = Clarifying the mechanics of DNA strand exchange in meiotic recombination | journal = Nature | volume = 442 | issue = 7099 | pages = 153–8 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16838012 | doi = 10.1038/nature04885 | bibcode = 2006Natur.442..153N | pmc = 5607947 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of steps catalyzed in part by the recombinase then leads to joining of the two helices by at least one [[Holliday junction]], in which a segment of a single strand in each helix is annealed to the complementary strand in the other helix. The Holliday junction is a tetrahedral junction structure that can be moved along the pair of chromosomes, swapping one strand for another. The recombination reaction is then halted by cleavage of the junction and re-ligation of the released DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dickman MJ, Ingleston SM, Sedelnikova SE, Rafferty JB, Lloyd RG, Grasby JA, Hornby DP | title = The RuvABC resolvasome | journal = European Journal of Biochemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 22 | pages = 5492–501 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12423347 | doi = 10.1046/j.1432-1033.2002.03250.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only strands of like polarity exchange DNA during recombination. There are two types of cleavage: east-west cleavage and north-south cleavage. The north-south cleavage nicks both strands of DNA, while the east-west cleavage has one strand of DNA intact. The formation of a Holliday junction during recombination makes it possible for genetic diversity, genes to exchange on chromosomes, and expression of wild-type viral genomes.

DNA contains the genetic information that allows all modern living things to function, grow and reproduce.

Methods have been developed to purify DNA from organisms, such as [[phenol-chloroform extraction]], and to manipulate it in the laboratory, such as [[restriction digest]]s and the [[polymerase chain reaction]].

[[Forensic science|Forensic scientists]] can use DNA in [[blood]], [[semen]], [[skin]], [[saliva]] or [[hair]] found at a [[crime scene]] to identify a matching DNA of an individual, such as a perpetrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=29 August 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=22 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022033110/http://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|archive-date=22 October 2017|dead-url=no|last2=Hereward|first2=James | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is formally termed [[DNA profiling]], but may also be called "[[genetic fingerprinting]]". In DNA profiling, the lengths of variable sections of repetitive DNA, such as [[short tandem repeat]]s and [[minisatellite]]s, are compared between people. This method is usually an extremely reliable technique for identifying a matching DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collins A, Morton NE | title = Likelihood ratios for DNA identification | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 13 | pages = 6007–11 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8016106 | pmc = 44126 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.91.13.6007 | bibcode = 1994PNAS...91.6007C }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, identification can be complicated if the scene is contaminated with DNA from several people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weir BS, Triggs CM, Starling L, Stowell LI, Walsh KA, Buckleton J | title = Interpreting DNA mixtures | journal = Journal of Forensic Sciences | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–22 | date = March 1997 | pmid = 9068179 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA profiling was developed in 1984 by British geneticist Sir [[Alec Jeffreys]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeffreys AJ, Wilson V, Thein SL | title = Individual-specific 'fingerprints' of human DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 316 | issue = 6023 | pages = 76–9 | year = 1985 | pmid = 2989708 | doi = 10.1038/316076a0 | bibcode = 1985Natur.316...76J }}&lt;/ref&gt; and first used in forensic science to convict Colin Pitchfork in the 1988 [[Colin Pitchfork|Enderby murders]] case.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061214004903/http://www.forensic.gov.uk/forensic_t/inside/news/list_casefiles.php?case=1 Colin Pitchfork&amp;nbsp;— first murder conviction on DNA evidence also clears the prime suspect] Forensic Science Service Accessed 23 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of forensic science and the ability to now obtain genetic matching on minute samples of blood, skin, saliva, or hair has led to re-examining many cases. Evidence can now be uncovered that was scientifically impossible at the time of the original examination. Combined with the removal of the [[double jeopardy]] law in some places, this can allow cases to be reopened where prior trials have failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince a jury. People charged with serious crimes may be required to provide a sample of DNA for matching purposes. The most obvious defense to DNA matches obtained forensically is to claim that cross-contamination of evidence has occurred. This has resulted in meticulous strict handling procedures with new cases of serious crime.

DNA profiling is also used successfully to positively identify victims of mass casualty incidents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |title=DNA Identification in Mass Fatality Incidents |date=September 2006 |publisher=National Institute of Justice |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061112000837/http://massfatality.dna.gov/Introduction/ |archive-date=12 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; bodies or body parts in serious accidents, and individual victims in mass war graves, via matching to family members.

DNA profiling is also used in [[DNA paternity testing]] to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent of a child with the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal [[DNA sequencing]] methods happen after birth, but there are new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html "Paternity Blood Tests That Work Early in a Pregnancy" New York Times June 20, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624231639/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/health/paternity-blood-tests-that-work-early-in-a-pregnancy.html |date=24 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA nanotechnology===
[[File:DNA nanostructures.png|thumb|upright=1.8|The DNA structure at left (schematic shown) will self-assemble into the structure visualized by [[Atomic force microscope|atomic force microscopy]] at right. [[DNA nanotechnology]] is the field that seeks to design nanoscale structures using the [[molecular recognition]] properties of DNA molecules. Image from {{doi-inline|10.1371/journal.pbio.0020073|Strong, 2004}}.]]

{{further|DNA nanotechnology}}
DNA nanotechnology uses the unique [[molecular recognition]] properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothemund PW | title = Folding DNA to create nanoscale shapes and patterns | journal = Nature | volume = 440 | issue = 7082 | pages = 297–302 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16541064 | doi = 10.1038/nature04586 | bibcode = 2006Natur.440..297R }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA is thus used as a structural material rather than as a carrier of biological information. This has led to the creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the ''[[DNA origami]]'' method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of [[Polyhedron|polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Andersen ES, Dong M, Nielsen MM, Jahn K, Subramani R, Mamdouh W, Golas MM, Sander B, Stark H, Oliveira CL, Pedersen JS, Birkedal V, Besenbacher F, Gothelf KV, Kjems J | title = Self-assembly of a nanoscale DNA box with a controllable lid | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7243 | pages = 73–6 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19424153 | doi = 10.1038/nature07971 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459...73A }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA machine|Nanomechanical devices]] and [[DNA computing|algorithmic self-assembly]] have also been demonstrated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishitsuka Y, Ha T | title = DNA nanotechnology: a nanomachine goes live | journal = Nature Nanotechnology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 281–2 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19421208 | doi = 10.1038/nnano.2009.101 | bibcode = 2009NatNa...4..281I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as [[Colloidal gold|gold nanoparticles]] and [[streptavidin]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aldaye FA, Palmer AL, Sleiman HF | title = Assembling materials with DNA as the guide | journal = Science | volume = 321 | issue = 5897 | pages = 1795–9 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18818351 | doi = 10.1126/science.1154533 | bibcode = 2008Sci...321.1795A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History and anthropology===
{{further|Phylogenetics|Genetic genealogy}}
Because DNA collects mutations over time, which are then inherited, it contains historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wray GA | title = Dating branches on the tree of life using DNA | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = REVIEWS0001 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11806830 | pmc = 150454 | doi = 10.1046/j.1525-142X.1999.99010.x | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; This field of phylogenetics is a powerful tool in [[evolutionary biology]]. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, [[population genetics|population geneticists]] can learn the history of particular populations. This can be used in studies ranging from [[ecological genetics]] to [[anthropology]].

===Information storage===
{{main|DNA digital data storage}}
In a paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in January 2013, scientists from the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and [[Agilent Technologies]] proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information as a means of digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text files and audio files. A prior experiment was published in August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at [[Harvard University]], where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman N, Bertone P, Chen S, Dessimoz C, LeProust EM, Sipos B, Birney E | title = Towards practical, high-capacity, low-maintenance information storage in synthesized DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7435 | pages = 77–80 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23354052 | pmc = 3672958 | doi = 10.1038/nature11875 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494...77G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Naik|first=Gautam|title=Storing Digital Data in DNA|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|accessdate=24 January 2013|newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=24 January 2013|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150124080051/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324539304578259883507543150|archive-date=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in living cells, the storage can be turned active by enzymes. Light-gated protein domains fused to DNA processing enzymes are suitable for that task ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;Comment by Dandekar, T., Lopez, D., Schaack, D.

DNA was first isolated by the Swiss physician [[Friedrich Miescher]] who, in 1869, discovered a microscopic substance in the pus of discarded surgical bandages. As it resided in the nuclei of cells, he called it "nuclein".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miescher | first = Friedrich | name-list-format = vanc | year = 1871 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YJRTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA441#v=onepage | title = Ueber die chemische Zusammensetzung der Eiterzellen | language = German | trans-title = On the chemical composition of pus cells | journal = Medicinisch-chemische Untersuchungen | volume = 4 | pages = 441–460 | quote = Ich habe mich daher später mit meinen Versuchen an die ganzen Kerne gehalten, die Trennung der Körper, die ich einstweilen ohne weiteres Präjudiz als lösliches und unlösliches Nuclein bezeichnen will, einem günstigeren Material überlassend.

In 1909, [[Phoebus Levene]] identified the base, sugar, and phosphate nucleotide unit of the RNA (then named "yeast nucleic acid").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene PA, Jacobs WA | year = 1909 | title = Über Inosinsäure | language = German | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 42 | pages = 1198–203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene PA, Jacobs WA | year = 1909 | title = Über die Hefe-Nucleinsäure | language = German | journal = Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 2474–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levene P |title=The structure of yeast nucleic acid| journal=J Biol Chem |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=415–24 |year=1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929, Levene identified deoxyribose sugar in "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen JS, Portugal FH | year = 1974 | title = The search for the chemical structure of DNA | journal = Connecticut Medicine | volume = 38 | issue = 10 | pages = 551–2, 554–7 | url = https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/CCAAHW.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levene suggested that DNA consisted of a string of four nucleotide units linked together through the phosphate groups ("tetranucleotide hypothesis"). Levene thought the chain was short and the bases repeated in a fixed order.
In 1927, [[Nikolai Koltsov]] proposed that inherited traits would be inherited via a "giant hereditary molecule" made up of "two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template".&lt;ref&gt;Koltsov proposed that a cell's genetic information was encoded in a long chain of amino acids.

In 1933, while studying virgin [[sea urchin]] eggs, [[Jean Brachet]] suggested that DNA is found in the [[cell nucleus]] and that [[RNA]] is present exclusively in the [[cytoplasm]]. At the time, "yeast nucleic acid" (RNA) was thought to occur only in plants, while "thymus nucleic acid" (DNA) only in animals. The latter was thought to be a tetramer, with the function of buffering cellular pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brachet J | year = 1933 | title = Recherches sur la synthese de l'acide thymonucleique pendant le developpement de l'oeuf d'Oursin | language = Italian | journal = Archives de Biologie | volume = 44 | pages = 519–576 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Burian R | year = 1994 | chapter = Jean Brachet's Cytochemical Embryology: Connections with the Renovation of Biology in France? | veditors = Debru C, Gayon J, Picard JF | title = Les sciences biologiques et médicales en France 1920–1950 | volume = 2 | series = Cahiers pour I'histoire de la recherche | location = Paris | publisher = CNRS Editions | pages = 207–220 | url = http://www.histcnrs.fr/ColloqDijon/Burian-Brachet.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in 1951, [[Francis Crick]] started working with [[James Watson]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] within the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1953, Watson and Crick suggested what is now accepted as the first correct double-helix model of [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|DNA structure]] in the journal ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=FWPUB/&gt; Their double-helix, molecular model of DNA was then based on one [[X-ray diffraction]] image (labeled as "[[Photo 51]]")&lt;ref&gt;The B-DNA X-ray pattern [http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html on the right of this linked image] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120525030457/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/sci9.001.5.html |date=25 May 2012 }} was obtained by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952 at high hydration levels of DNA and it has been labeled as "Photo 51"&lt;/ref&gt; taken by [[Rosalind Franklin]] and [[Raymond Gosling]] in May 1952, and the information that the DNA bases are paired. On 28 February 1953 Crick interrupted patrons' lunchtime at [[The Eagle, Cambridge|The Eagle]] [[pub]] in Cambridge to announce that he and Watson had "discovered the secret of life".&lt;ref&gt;Regis, Ed (2009) ''What Is Life?: investigating the nature of life in the age of synthetic biology''.

Months earlier, in February 1953, [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Robert Corey]] proposed a model for nucleic acids containing three intertwined chains, with the phosphates near the axis, and the bases on the outside.&lt;ref name="pmid16578429"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L, Corey RB | title = A Proposed Structure For The Nucleic Acids | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 39 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–97 | date = February 1953 | pmid = 16578429 | pmc = 1063734 | doi = | url = http://scarc.library.oregonstate.edu/coll/pauling/dna/papers/1953p.9-084.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimental evidence supporting the Watson and Crick model was published in a series of five articles in the same issue of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name=NatureDNA50&gt;{{cite web | work = Nature Archives | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | title = Double Helix of DNA: 50 Years | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150405140401/http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/archive.html | archive-date=5 April 2015 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, Franklin and Gosling's paper was the first publication of their own X-ray diffraction data and original analysis method that partly supported the Watson and Crick model;&lt;ref name=NatFranGos/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | title = Original X-ray diffraction image | publisher = Oregon State Library | access-date = 6 February 2011 | dead-url = no | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090130111849/http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/dna/pictures/franklin-typeBphoto.html | archive-date=30 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this issue also contained an article on DNA structure by [[Maurice Wilkins]] and two of his colleagues, whose analysis and ''in vivo'' B-DNA X-ray patterns also supported the presence ''in vivo'' of the double-helical DNA configurations as proposed by Crick and Watson for their double-helix molecular model of DNA in the prior two pages of ''Nature''.&lt;ref name="NatWilk" /&gt; In 1962, after Franklin's death, Watson, Crick, and Wilkins jointly received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962 | work = Nobelprize.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel Prizes are awarded only to living recipients.

In an influential presentation in 1957, Crick laid out the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which foretold the relationship between DNA, RNA, and proteins, and articulated the "adaptor hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech |last= Crick |first= F.H.C. | name-list-format = vanc |author-link= |title=A Note for the RNA Tie Club | date= 1955 | location = Cambridge, England |url= http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001223217/http://genome.wellcome.ac.uk/assets/wtx030893.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 1 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Final confirmation of the replication mechanism that was implied by the double-helical structure followed in 1958 through the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Stahl FW | title = THE REPLICATION OF DNA IN ESCHERICHIA COLI | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 671–82 | date = July 1958 | pmid = 16590258 | pmc = 528642 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.44.7.671 | bibcode = 1958PNAS...44..671M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further work by Crick and coworkers showed that the genetic code was based on non-overlapping triplets of bases, called codons, allowing [[Har Gobind Khorana]], [[Robert W.

{{About|the music term|other uses}}
[[Image:Da Capo al fine example short.png|thumb|A contrived example of D.C. al Fine. {{audio|Da Capo al fine example short.mid|Play}} Use of Da Capo prevents the need to write out extra measures, often many more than in this example. The notes are played as: G A B B C, G A B B C, low-C|340x340px]]
'''Da capo''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|d|ɑː|_|ˈ|k|ɑː|p|oʊ}}; {{IPA-it|da kˈkaːpo|lang}}) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] [[musical term]] that means "from the beginning"&lt;ref&gt;Randel, Don Michael; ed. (2003). ''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p. 234. Harvard. {{ISBN|9780674011632}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (literally, "from the head"). It is often abbreviated as '''D.C.''' The term is a directive to [[repetition (music)|repeat]] the previous part of music, often used to save space, and thus is an easier way of saying to repeat the music from the beginning.

In small pieces, this might be the same thing as a [[Repeat sign|repeat]]. But in larger works, D.C. might occur after one or more repeats of small [[section (music)|sections]], indicating a return to the very beginning. The resulting [[musical form|structure]] of the piece is generally in [[ternary form]]. Sometimes, the composer describes the part to be repeated, for example: ''Menuet da capo''.{{Explanation needed|date=January 2018}} In [[opera]], where an [[aria]] of this structure is called a ''[[da capo aria]]'', the repeated section is often adorned with [[grace note]]s.

{{Sustainable energy}}

'''Efficient energy use''', sometimes simply called '''energy efficiency''', is the goal to reduce the amount of energy required to provide products and services. For example, [[building insulation|insulating a home]] allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing [[LED lamp|LED lighting]], [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent lighting]], or natural [[skylight|skylight windows]] reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Improvements in energy efficiency are generally achieved by adopting a more efficient technology or production process&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Diesendorf|Diesendorf, Mark]] (2007). ''[[Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy]]'', UNSW Press, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; or by application of commonly accepted methods to reduce energy losses.

There are many motivations to improve energy efficiency. Reducing energy use reduces energy costs and may result in a financial cost saving to consumers if the energy savings offset any additional costs of implementing an energy-efficient technology. Reducing energy use is also seen as a solution to the problem of reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. According to the [[International Energy Agency]], improved energy efficiency in [[energy-efficient buildings|buildings]], industrial processes and [[sustainable transportation|transportation]] could reduce the world's energy needs in 2050 by one third, and help control global emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sophie Hebden |url=http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=2929&amp;language=1 |title=Invest in clean technology says IEA report |publisher=Scidev.net |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important solution is to remove government-led energy subsidies that promote high energy consumption and inefficient energy use in more than half of the countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Indra Overland (2010) ‘Subsidies for Fossil Fuels and Climate Change: A Comparative Perspective’, International Journal of Environmental Studies, Vol. 67, No. 3, pp. 203-217.

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the ''twin pillars'' of [[sustainable energy]] policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Prindle |first1= Bill |last2= Eldridge |first2= Maggie |last3= Eckhardt |first3= Mike |last4= Frederick |first4= Alyssa |title= The twin pillars of sustainable energy: synergies between energy efficiency and renewable energy technology and policy |date= May 2007 |publisher= American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) |place= Washington, DC, USA |url= http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.545.4606&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |access-date= 2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are high priorities in the sustainable [[energy hierarchy]]. In many countries energy efficiency is also seen to have a national security benefit because it can be used to reduce the level of energy imports from foreign countries and may slow down the rate of energy at which domestic energy resources are depleted.

==Overview==
{{Further|Domestic energy consumption}}
Energy efficiency has proved to be a cost-effective strategy for building economies without necessarily increasing [[energy consumption]]. For example, the state of [[California]] began implementing energy-efficiency measures in the mid-1970s, including building code and appliance standards with strict efficiency requirements. During the following years, California's energy consumption has remained approximately flat on a per capita basis while national US consumption doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=UNP|location=London|pages=180–181|url=http://greenillusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its strategy, California implemented a "loading order" for new energy resources that puts energy efficiency first, renewable electricity supplies second, and new fossil-fired power plants last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.ca.gov/2005publications/CEC-400-2005-043/CEC-400-2005-043.PDF |title=Loading Order White Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; States such as Connecticut and New York have created quasi-public [[Green bank (financial institution)|Green Banks]] to help residential and commercial building-owners finance energy efficiency upgrades that reduce emissions and cut consumers' energy costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kennan, Hallie. "Working Paper: State Green Banks for Clean Energy" http://energyinnovation.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WorkingPaper_StateGreenBanks.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovin's [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] points out that in industrial settings, "there are abundant opportunities to save 70% to 90% of the energy and cost for lighting, fan, and pump systems; 50% for electric motors; and 60% in areas such as heating, cooling, office equipment, and appliances." In general, up to 75% of the electricity used in the US today could be saved with efficiency measures that cost less than the electricity itself, the same holds true for home settings. The US Department of Energy has stated that there is potential for energy saving in the magnitude of 90 Billion kWh by increasing home energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |title=Weatherization in Austin, Texas |publisher=Green Collar Operations |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090803235602/http://www.greencollaroperations.com/weatherization-austin-tx.html |archivedate=2009-08-03 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have emphasized this. A report published in 2006 by the [[McKinsey Global Institute]], asserted that "there are sufficient economically viable opportunities for energy-productivity improvements that could keep global energy-demand growth at less than 1 percent per annum"—less than half of the 2.2 percent average growth anticipated through 2020 in a business-as-usual scenario.&lt;ref name= NYT292006&gt;{{cite news|title= Energy Use Can Be Cut by Efficiency, Survey Says.... |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/business/29energy.html |accessdate= November 29, 2006|newspaper=The New York Times |date= November 29, 2006|author= Steve Lohr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy productivity, which measures the output and quality of goods and services per unit of energy input, can come from either reducing the amount of energy required to produce something, or from increasing the quantity or quality of goods and services from the same amount of energy.

The [[Vienna Climate Change Talks 2007]] Report, under the auspices of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), clearly shows "that energy efficiency can achieve real emission reductions at low cost."&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/files/press/news_room/press_releases_and_advisories/application/pdf/20070831_vienna_closing_press_release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International standard]]s ISO{{nbsp}}17743 and ISO{{nbsp}}17742 provide a documented methodology for calculating and reporting on energy savings and energy efficiency for countries and cities.&lt;ref name="iso-17743"&gt;

==Appliances==
{{See also|green computing|solar lamp|energy saving lamp|power usage effectiveness}}

Modern appliances, such as, [[freezers]], [[oven]]s, [[stove]]s, [[dishwasher]]s, and clothes washers and dryers, use significantly less energy than older appliances. Installing a clothesline will significantly reduce one's energy consumption as their dryer will be used less. Current energy-efficient refrigerators, for example, use 40 percent less energy than conventional models did in 2001. Following this, if all households in Europe changed their more than ten-year-old appliances into new ones, 20 billion kWh of electricity would be saved annually, hence reducing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by almost 18 billion kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |title=Ecosavings |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806070945/http://ecosavings.electrolux.com/#int_en |archivedate=2011-08-06 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, the corresponding figures would be 17 billion kWh of electricity and {{convert|27000000000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electrolux.com/ecosavings_us |title=Ecosavings (Tm) Calculator |publisher=Electrolux.com |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2009 study from [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] the replacement of old appliances is one of the most efficient global measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=McKinsey Global Institute|title=Pathways to a Low-Carbon Economy: Version 2 of the Global Greenhouse Gas Abatement Cost Curve|url=http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/dotcom/client_service/sustainability/cost%20curve%20pdfs/pathways_lowcarbon_economy_version2.ashx|accessdate=February 16, 2016|page=7|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern power management systems also reduce energy usage by idle appliances by turning them off or putting them into a low-energy mode after a certain time. Many countries identify energy-efficient appliances using [[energy input labeling]].&lt;ref name=app&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://www.eesi.org/buildings_efficiency_0506 |title=Energy-Efficient Buildings: Using whole building design to reduce energy consumption in homes and offices |publisher=Eesi.org |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impact of energy efficiency on peak demand depends on when the appliance is used. For example, an air conditioner uses more energy during the afternoon when it is hot. Therefore, an energy-efficient air conditioner will have a larger impact on peak demand than off-peak demand. An energy-efficient dishwasher, on the other hand, uses more energy during the late evening when people do their dishes. This appliance may have little to no impact on peak demand.

Buildings are an important field for energy efficiency improvements around the world because of their role as a major energy consumer. However, the question of energy use in buildings is not straightforward as the indoor conditions that can be achieved with energy use vary a lot. The measures that keep buildings comfortable, lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation, all consume energy. Typically the level of energy efficiency in a building is measured by dividing energy consumed with the floor area of the building which is referred to as specific energy consumption (SEC) or energy use intensity (EUI)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=buildingcontest.eui]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac \text{Energy consumed}\text{Built area}&lt;/math&gt;

However, the issue is more complex as building materials have [[embodied energy]] in them. On the other hand, energy can be recovered from the materials when the building is dismantled by reusing materials or burning them for energy. Moreover, when the building is used, the indoor conditions can vary resulting in higher and lower quality indoor environments. Finally, overall efficiency is affected by the use of the building: is the building occupied most of the time and are spaces efficiently used — or is the building largely empty? It has even been suggested that for a more complete accounting of energy efficiency, SEC should be amended to include these factors:&lt;ref&gt;Juha Forsström, Pekka Lahti, Esa Pursiheimo, Miika Rämä, Jari Shemeikka, Kari Sipilä, Pekka Tuominen &amp; Irmeli Wahlgren (2011): [http://www.vtt.fi/inf/pdf/tiedotteet/2011/T2581.pdf Measuring energy efficiency]. VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\text{Embodied energy} + \text{Energy consumed} - \text{Energy recovered}}{\text{Built area} \times \text{Utilization rate} \times \text{Quality factor}}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a balanced approach to energy efficiency in buildings should be more comprehensive than simply trying to minimize energy consumed. Issues such as quality of indoor environment and efficiency of space use should be factored in. Thus the measures used to improve energy efficiency can take many different forms. Often they include passive measures that inherently reduce the need to use energy, such as better insulation. Many serve various functions improving the indoor conditions as well as reducing energy use, such as increased use of natural light.

A building's location and surroundings play a key role in regulating its temperature and illumination. For example, trees, landscaping, and hills can provide shade and block wind. In cooler climates, designing northern hemisphere buildings with south facing windows and southern hemisphere buildings with north facing windows increases the amount of sun (ultimately heat energy) entering the building, minimizing energy use, by maximizing [[passive solar heating]]. Tight building design, including energy-efficient windows, well-sealed doors, and additional thermal insulation of walls, basement slabs, and foundations can reduce heat loss by 25 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Most heat is lost through the walls of your building, in fact about a third of all heat losses occur in this area. [https://www.simplybusinessenergy.co.uk/news/electricity-and-energy-cost-savings-for-small-businesses~188/ Simply Business Energy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dark roofs may become up to 39&amp;nbsp;°C (70&amp;nbsp;°F) hotter than the most [[reflective surfaces (climate engineering)|reflective white surfaces]]. They transmit some of this additional heat inside the building. US Studies have shown that lightly colored roofs use 40 percent less energy for cooling than buildings with darker roofs. White roof systems save more energy in sunnier climates. Advanced electronic heating and cooling systems can moderate energy consumption and improve the comfort of people in the building.&lt;ref name=app/&gt;

Proper placement of windows and skylights as well as the use of architectural features that reflect light into a building can reduce the need for artificial lighting. Increased use of natural and task lighting has been shown by one study to increase productivity in schools and offices.&lt;ref name=app/&gt; [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s use two-thirds less energy and may last 6 to 10 times longer than [[incandescent light bulb]]s. Newer fluorescent lights produce a natural light, and in most applications they are cost effective, despite their higher initial cost, with payback periods as low as a few months. [[LED lamp]]s use only about 10% of the energy an incandescent lamp requires.

Effective energy-efficient building design can include the use of low cost Passive Infra Reds (PIRs) to switch-off lighting when areas are unnoccupied such as toilets, corridors or even office areas out-of-hours. In addition, lux levels can be monitored using daylight sensors linked to the building's lighting scheme to switch on/off or dim the lighting to pre-defined levels to take into account the natural light and thus reduce consumption. Building Management Systems (BMS) link all of this together in one centralised computer to control the whole building's lighting and power requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Creating Energy Efficient Offices - Electrical Contractor Fit-out Article&lt;/ref&gt;

In an analysis that integrates a residential bottom-up simulation with an economic multi-sector model, it has been shown that variable heat gains caused by insulation and air-conditioning efficiency can have load-shifting effects that are not uniform on the electricity load. The study also highlighted the impact of higher household efficiency on the power generation capacity choices that are made by the power sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s12053-015-9392-9 |title=Beyond the end-consumer: how would improvements in residential energy efficiency affect the power sector in Saudi Arabia? |year=2015 |last1=Matar |first1=W |journal=Energy Efficiency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of which space heating or cooling technology to use in buildings can have a significant impact on energy use and efficiency. For example, replacing an older 50% efficient [[furnace#Household furnaces|natural gas furnace]] with a new 95% efficient one will dramatically reduce energy use, carbon emissions, and winter natural gas bills. [[Ground source heat pump]]s can be even more energy-efficient and cost-effective. These systems use pumps and compressors to move refrigerant fluid around a thermodynamic cycle in order to "pump" heat against its natural flow from hot to cold, for the purpose of transferring heat into a building from the large thermal reservoir contained within the nearby ground. The end result is that heat pumps typically use four times less electrical energy to deliver an equivalent amount of heat than a direct electrical heater does. Another advantage of a ground source heat pump is that it can be reversed in summertime and operate to cool the air by transferring heat from the building to the ground. The disadvantage of ground source heat pumps is their high initial capital cost, but this is typically recouped within five to ten years as a result of lower energy use.

[[Smart meter]]s are slowly being adopted by the commercial sector to highlight to staff and for internal monitoring purposes the building's energy usage in a dynamic presentable format. The use of Power Quality Analysers can be introduced into an existing building to assess usage, harmonic distortion, peaks, swells and interruptions amongst others to ultimately make the building more energy-efficient. Often such meters communicate by using [[wireless sensor network]]s.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the [[Building Information Modeling]] efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines. But with the development of modern computer technology, a large number of [[building performance simulation]] tools are available on the market. When choosing which simulation tool to use in a project, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=A |last2=Dong |first2=B |last3=Leite |first3=F |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |page=612}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

[[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) is a rating system organized by the [[US Green Building Council]] (USGBC) to promote environmental responsibility in building design. They currently offer four levels of certification for existing buildings (LEED-EBOM) and new construction (LEED-NC) based on a building's compliance with the following criteria: [[Sustainable sites]], [[water efficiency]], energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, and innovation in design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LEED v4 for Building Design and Construction Checklist |url=http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150226000022/http://www.usgbc.org/sites/default/files/LEED%20v4%20for%20Building%20Design%20and%20Construction%20_1%20PAGE_0.xlsx |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 February 2015 |website=USGBC |accessdate=29 April 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, USGBC developed the LEED Dynamic Plaque, a tool to track building performance against LEED metrics and a potential path to recertification. The following year, the council collaborated with [[Honeywell]] to pull data on energy and water use, as well as indoor air quality from a BAS to automatically update the plaque, providing a near-real-time view of performance. The USGBC office in [[Washington, D.C.]] is one of the first buildings to feature the live-updating LEED Dynamic Plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honeywell, USGBC Tool Monitors Building Sustainability|url=http://www.environmentalleader.com/2014/10/22/honeywell-usgbc-tool-monitors-building-sustainability/|website=Environmental Leader|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[deep energy retrofit]] is a whole-building analysis and construction process that uses to achieve much larger energy savings than conventional [[green retrofit|energy retrofits]]. Deep energy retrofits can be applied to both residential and non-residential (“commercial”) buildings. A deep energy retrofit typically results in energy savings of 30 percent or more, perhaps spread over several years, and may significantly improve the building value.&lt;ref&gt;http://jeancarassus.zumablog.com/images/2128_uploads/Fuerst_New_paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Empire State Building]] has undergone a deep energy retrofit process that was completed in 2013. The project team, consisting of representatives from [[Johnson Controls]], [[Rocky Mountain Institute]], [[Clinton Climate Initiative]], and [[Jones Lang LaSalle]] will have achieved an annual energy use reduction of 38% and $4.4 million.&lt;ref name=ESB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esbnyc.com/sustainability_energy_efficiency.asp |title=Visit &gt; Sustainability &amp; Energy Efficiency &amp;#124; Empire State Building |publisher=Esbnyc.com |date=2011-06-16 |accessdate=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 6,500 windows were remanufactured onsite into [[superwindow]]s which block heat but pass light. [[Air conditioning]] operating costs on hot days were reduced and this saved $17 million of the project's capital cost immediately, partly funding other retrofitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137246/amory-b-lovins/a-farewell-to-fossil-fuels |title=A Farewell to Fossil Fuels |author=Amory Lovins |date=March–April 2012 |work=Foreign Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving a gold [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)]] rating in September 2011, the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States.&lt;ref name="inhabitat1"/&gt;
The [[Indianapolis City-County Building]] recently underwent a deep energy retrofit process, which has achieved an annual energy reduction of 46% and $750,000 annual energy saving.

Energy retrofits, including deep, and other types undertaken in residential, commercial or industrial locations are generally supported through various forms of financing or incentives. Incentives include pre-packaged rebates where the buyer/user may not even be aware that the item being used has been rebated or "bought down". "Upstream" or "Midstream" buy downs are common for efficient lighting products. Other rebates are more explicit and transparent to the end user through the use of formal applications. In addition to rebates, which may be offered through government or utility programs, governments sometimes offer tax incentives for energy efficiency projects. Some entities offer rebate and payment guidance and facilitation services that enable energy end use customers tap into rebate and incentive programs.

To evaluate the economic soundness of energy efficiency investments in buildings, [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] or CEA can be used. A CEA calculation will produce the value of energy saved, sometimes called ''[[negawatt]]s'', in $/kWh. The energy in such a calculation is virtual in the sense that it was never consumed but rather saved due to some energy efficiency investment being made. Thus CEA allows comparing the price of negawatts with price of energy such as electricity from the grid or the cheapest renewable alternative. The benefit of the CEA approach in energy systems is that it avoids the need to guess future energy prices for the purposes of the calculation, thus removing the major source of uncertainty in the appraisal of energy efficiency investments.&lt;ref&gt;Pekka Tuominen, Francesco Reda, Waled Dawoud, Bahaa Elboshy, Ghada Elshafei, Abdelazim Negm: [http://doi.org/10.1016/S2212-5671(15)00195-1 Economic Appraisal of Energy Efficiency in Buildings Using Cost-effectiveness Assessment].

==Energy efficiency by country==

===Europe===

Energy efficiency targets for 2020 and 2030.

The first EU-wide target was set in 1998. Member states agreed to improve energy efficiency by 1 percent a year over twelve years. In addition, legislation about products, industry, transport and buildings has contributed to a general energy efficiency framework. More effort is needed to address heating and cooling: there is more heat wasted during electricity production in Europe than is required to heat all buildings in the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.heatroadmap.eu/|title=Heat Roadmap Europe|website=www.heatroadmap.eu|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in all, EU energy efficiency legislation is estimated to deliver savings worth the equivalent of up to 326 million tons of oil per year by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU set itself a [[EU Energy Efficiency Directive 2012|20% energy savings target]] by 2020 compared to 1990 levels, but member states decide individually how energy savings will be achieved. At an EU summit in October 2014, EU countries agreed on a new energy efficiency target of 27% or greater by 2030. One mechanism used to achieve the target of 27% is the 'Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suppliers Obligations &amp; White Certificates|url=http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/energyefficiency/white-certificates|website=Europa.EU|publisher=Europa.eu|accessdate=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongoing debate around the 2016 Clean Energy Package also puts an emphasis on energy efficiency, but the goal will probably remain around 30% greater efficiency compared to 1990 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.boell.de/en/2018/04/24/energy-atlas-2018-figures-and-facts-about-renewables-europe?dimension1=ds_energyatlas|title=Energy Atlas 2018: Figures and Facts about Renewables in Europe {{!}} Heinrich Böll Foundation|work=Heinrich Böll Foundation|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that this will not be enough for the EU to meet its Paris Agreement goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared to 1990 levels.

===Australia===
The [[Australian national government]] is actively leading the country in efforts to increase their energy efficiency, mainly through the government's [[Department of Industry and Science]]. In July 2009, the [[Council of Australian Governments]], which represents the individual states and territories of Australia, agreed to a National Strategy on Energy Efficiency (NSEE).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=National Strategy on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Industry.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913191712/http://www.industry.gov.au/Energy/EnergyEfficiency/Pages/NationalStrategyEnergyEfficiency.aspx |archivedate=13 September 2015 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a ten-year plan accelerate the implementation of a nationwide adoption of energy-efficient practices and a preparation for the country's transformation into a [[low carbon]] future. There are several different areas of energy use addressed within the NSEE. But, the chapter devoted to the approach on energy efficiency that is to be adopted on a national level stresses four points in achieving stated levels of energy efficiency. They are:
*To help households and businesses transition to a low carbon future
*To streamline the adoption of efficient energy
*To make buildings more energy-efficient
*For governments to work in partnership and lead the way to energy efficiency

The overriding agreement that governs this strategy is the National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Partnership Agreement on Energy Efficiency |publisher=Fif.gov.au |date=16 August 2015 |url=http://www.federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312005515/http://federalfinancialrelations.gov.au/content/npa/environment/energy_efficiency/national_partnership.pdf |archivedate=2015-03-12 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This document also explains the role of both the [[commonwealth]] and the individual states and territories in the NSEE, as well provides for the creation of benchmarks and measurement devices which will transparently show the nation's progress in relation to the stated goals, and addresses the need for funding of the strategy in order to enable it to move forward.

===Canada===

In August 2017, the Government of Canada released [https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/emmc/pdf/Building_Smart_en.pdf Build Smart - Canada's Buildings Strategy], as a key driver of the [https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/pan-canadian-framework.html Pan Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change], Canada's national climate strategy.

The Build Smart strategy seeks to dramatically increase the energy-efficiency performance of existing and new Canadian buildings, and establishes five goals to that end:
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work to develop a model code for existing buildings by 2022, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt the code.
*Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019.
*The federal government will set new standards for heating equipment and other key technologies to the highest level of efficiency that is economically and technically achievable.
*Provincial and territorial governments will work to sustain and expand efforts to retrofit existing buildings by supporting energy efficiency improvements and by accelerating the adoption of high-efficiency equipment while tailoring their programs to regional circumstances.

The strategy details a range of activities the Government of Canada will pursue, and investments it will make, in support of the goals. As of early 2018, only one of Canada's 10 provinces and three territories, British Columbia, has developed a policy in support of federal government's goal to reach net zero energy ready ambitions: the [[BC Energy Step Code]].

Local British Columbia governments may use the BC Energy Step Code, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. The regulation and standard is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032.

Efforts to reduce final energy consumption in transport sector have not been successful, with a growth of 1.7% between 2005–2014. This growth is due to both road passenger and road freight transport. Both sectors increased their overall distance travelled to record the highest figures ever for Germany. Rebound effects played a significant role, both between improved vehicle efficiency and the distance travelled, and between improved vehicle efficiency and an increase in vehicle weights and engine power.&lt;ref name="loeschel-etal-2015"&gt;

The areas covered are the energy efficiency of buildings, energy conservation for companies, consumer energy efficiency, and transport energy efficiency. The policy contains both immediate and forward-looking measures. The central short-term measures of NAPE include the introduction of competitive tendering for energy efficiency, the raising of funding for building renovation, the introduction of tax incentives for efficiency measures in the building sector, and the setting up energy efficiency networks together with business and industry. German industry is expected to make a sizeable contribution.

On 12 August 2016, the German government released a [[green paper]] on energy efficiency for public consultation (in German).&lt;ref name="bmwi-2016-press-release"&gt;

A 2011 [[Energy Modeling Forum]] study covering the United States examines how energy efficiency opportunities will shape future fuel and electricity demand over the next several decades. The US economy is already set to lower its energy and carbon intensity, but explicit policies will be necessary to meet climate goals. These policies include: a carbon tax, mandated standards for more efficient appliances, buildings and vehicles, and subsidies or reductions in the upfront costs of new more energy-efficient equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Industry==
Industries use a large amount of energy to power a diverse range of manufacturing and resource extraction processes. Many industrial processes require large amounts of heat and mechanical power, most of which is delivered as [[natural gas]], [[petroleum|petroleum fuels]], and [[electricity]]. In addition some industries generate fuel from waste products that can be used to provide additional energy.

Because industrial processes are so diverse it is impossible to describe the multitude of possible opportunities for energy efficiency in industry. Many depend on the specific technologies and processes in use at each industrial facility. There are, however, a number of processes and energy services that are widely used in many industries.

Various industries generate [[steam]] and electricity for subsequent use within their facilities. When electricity is generated, the heat that is produced as a by-product can be captured and used for process steam, heating or other industrial purposes. Conventional electricity generation is about 30% efficient, whereas combined heat and power (also called [[co-generation]]) converts up to 90 percent of the fuel into usable energy.&lt;ref name=indust&gt;{{cite web|author=Environmental and Energy Study Institute |url=http://ladoma.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Energy-Efficiency-Fact-Sheet.pdf |title=Industrial Energy Efficiency: Using new technologies to reduce energy use in industry and manufacturing |accessdate=2015-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advanced boilers and furnaces can operate at higher temperatures while burning less fuel. These technologies are more efficient and produce fewer pollutants.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

Over 45 percent of the fuel used by US manufacturers is burnt to make steam. The typical industrial facility can reduce this energy usage 20 percent (according to the [[US Department of Energy]]) by insulating steam and condensate return lines, stopping steam leakage, and maintaining steam traps.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

[[Electric motor]]s usually run at a constant speed, but a [[variable speed drives|variable speed drive]] allows the motor's energy output to match the required load. This achieves energy savings ranging from 3 to 60 percent, depending on how the motor is used. Motor coils made of [[superconducting]] materials can also reduce energy losses.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt; Motors may also benefit from [[voltage optimisation]]. {{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Industry uses a large number of [[pumps]] and [[compressors]] of all shapes and sizes and in a wide variety of applications. The efficiency of pumps and compressors depends on many factors but often improvements can be made by implementing better [[process control]] and better maintenance practices. Compressors are commonly used to provide [[compressed air]] which is used for sand blasting, painting, and other power tools. According to the US Department of Energy, optimizing compressed air systems by installing variable speed drives, along with preventive maintenance to detect and fix air leaks, can improve energy efficiency 20 to 50 percent.&lt;ref name=indust/&gt;

==Transportation==

===Automobiles===
{{Main|Fuel economy in automobiles}}

[[File:NYPD Traffic Enforcement RMP In White.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Toyota Prius]] used by [[NYPD#Traffic Enforcement|NYPD Traffic Enforcement]]]]

The estimated energy efficiency for an automobile is 280 Passenger-Mile/10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; Btu.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Dorf, ''The Energy Factbook'', McGraw-Hill, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; There are several ways to enhance a vehicle's energy efficiency. Using improved [[aerodynamics]] to minimize drag can increase vehicle [[fuel efficiency]]. Reducing vehicle weight can also improve fuel economy, which is why [[composite materials]] are widely used in car bodies.

More advanced tires, with decreased tire to road friction and rolling resistance, can save gasoline. Fuel economy can be improved by up to 3.3% by keeping tires inflated to the correct pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/maintain.shtml |title=Tips to improve your Gas Mileage |publisher=Fueleconomy.gov |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Replacing a clogged air filter can improve a cars fuel consumption by as much as 10 percent on older vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On newer vehicles (1980s and up) with fuel-injected, computer-controlled engines, a clogged air filter has no effect on mpg but replacing it may improve acceleration by 6-11 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/pdfs/Air_Filter_Effects_02_26_2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aerodynamics also aid in efficiency of a vehicle. The design of a car impacts the amount of gas needed to move it through air. Aerodynamics involves the air around the car, which can affect the efficiency of the energy expended. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.carsdirect.com/car-buying/what-makes-a-car-fuel-efficient|title=What Makes a Fuel Efficient Car? The 8 Most Fuel Efficient Cars|work=CarsDirect|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turbocharger]]s can increase fuel efficiency by allowing a smaller displacement engine. The 'Engine of the year 2011' is a Fiat 500 engine equipped with an MHI turbocharger. "Compared with a 1.2-liter 8v engine, the new 85 HP turbo has 23% more power and a 30% better performance index. The performance of the two-cylinder is not only equivalent to a 1.4-liter 16v engine, but fuel consumption is 30% lower."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiat 875cc TwinAir named International Engine of the Year 2011|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/05/fiat-20110520.html|website=Green Car Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy-efficient vehicles may reach twice the fuel efficiency of the average automobile. Cutting-edge designs, such as the diesel [[Mercedes-Benz Bionic]] concept vehicle have achieved a fuel efficiency as high as {{convert|84|mpgus}}, four times the current conventional automotive average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eesi.org/files/auto_efficiency_0506.pd{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream trend in automotive efficiency is the rise of [[electric vehicle]]s (all@electric or hybrid electric). Hybrids, like the [[Toyota Prius]], use [[regenerative braking]] to recapture energy that would dissipate in normal cars; the effect is especially pronounced in city driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nom * |url=https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |title=La Prius de Toyota, une référence des voitures hybrides &amp;#124; L'énergie en questions |publisher=Lenergieenquestions.fr |date=2013-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017080726/https://www.lenergieenquestions.fr/prius-toyota-modele-reference-voitures-hybrides/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plug-in hybrid]]s also have increased battery capacity, which makes it possible to drive for limited distances without burning any gasoline; in this case, energy efficiency is dictated by whatever process (such as coal-burning, hydroelectric, or renewable source) created the power. Plug-ins can typically drive for around {{convert|40|mi}} purely on electricity without recharging; if the battery runs low, a gas engine kicks in allowing for extended range. Finally, all-electric cars are also growing in popularity; the [[Tesla Model S]] sedan is the only high-performance all-electric car currently on the market.

===Street lighting===
Cities around the globe light up millions of streets with 300 million lights.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/2763639/global_led_and_smart_street_lighting_market&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities are seeking to reduce [[street light]] power consumption by dimming lights during off-peak hours or switching to LED lamps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edmonton.ca/transportation/on_your_streets/street-lighting.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the high luminous efficiency of LEDs will lead to real reductions in energy, as cities may end up installing extra lamps or lighting areas more brightly than in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kyba|first1=C.

===Aircraft===
{{Main|Fuel economy in aircraft|Environmental impact of aviation}}

There are several ways to reduce energy usage in air transportation, from modifications to the planes themselves, to how air traffic is managed. As in cars, turbochargers are an effective way to reduce energy consumption; however, instead of allowing for the use of a smaller-displacement engine, turbochargers in jet turbines operate by compressing the thinner air at higher altitudes. This allows the engine to operate as if it were at sea-level pressures while taking advantage of the reduced drag on the aircraft at higher altitudes.

Air traffic management systems are another way to increase the efficiency of not just the aircraft but the airline industry as a whole. New technology allows for superior automation of takeoff, landing, and collision avoidance, as well as within airports, from simple things like HVAC and lighting to more complex tasks such as security and scanning.

==Energy conservation==
{{Main|Energy conservation}}
[[File:Illust passive solar d1.gif|thumb|250px|right|Elements of [[Passive solar building design|passive solar energy design]], shown in a direct gain application]]

[[Energy conservation]] is broader than energy efficiency in including active efforts to decrease energy consumption, for example through [[behavior change (public health)|behaviour change]], in addition to using energy more efficiently. Examples of conservation without efficiency improvements are heating a room less in winter, using the car less, air-drying your clothes instead of using the dryer, or enabling energy saving modes on a computer. As with other definitions, the boundary between efficient energy use and energy conservation can be fuzzy, but both are important in environmental and economic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, T. et al. (2009).[http://www.pnas.org/content/106/44/18452.full Household actions can provide a behavioral wedge to rapidly reduce US carbon emissions]. PNAS. 106(44).&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case when actions are directed at the saving of [[fossil fuels]].&lt;ref&gt;Diesendorf, Mark (2007). ''Greenhouse Solutions with Sustainable Energy'', UNSW Press, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy conservation is a challenge requiring policy programmes, technological development and behavior change to go hand in hand. Many energy [[intermediary]] organisations, for example governmental or non-governmental organisations on local, regional, or national level, are working on often publicly funded programmes or projects to meet this challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Breukers, Heiskanen, et al.

==Sustainable energy==
{{Main|Sustainable energy}}

Energy efficiency and [[renewable energy]] are said to be the “twin pillars” of a sustainable [[energy policy]]. Both strategies must be developed concurrently in order to stabilize and reduce [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. Efficient energy use is essential to slowing the energy demand growth so that rising [[clean energy]] supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use. If energy use grows too rapidly, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total carbon emissions; a reduction in the carbon content of energy sources is also needed. A sustainable energy economy thus requires major commitments to both efficiency and renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111000420/http://www.paenergyfuture.psu.edu/pubs/aceee_reports/aceee2007sustainable.pdf |archivedate=2015-01-11 |df=}}([[American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as Lieef (www.Lieef.com) have started reporting ESG metrics on behalf of companies, and investment funds, in an effort to increase transparency in the space which to date has increased in importance, but has not found a unified measurement tool. In addition, the majority of companies that report sustainability do so on a 'net' basis, and do not reflect their carbon emissions, and separate those emissions from their activities that offset those emissions, such as buying renewable credits and green power..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Lieef.com/ |title=Lieef.com; Lieef inc |publisher=Lieef.com |date=2018-05-28 |accessdate=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebound effect==
{{Further|Rebound effect (conservation)|Jevons' paradox}}
If the demand for energy services remains constant, improving energy efficiency will reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, many efficiency improvements do not reduce energy consumption by the amount predicted by simple engineering models. This is because they make energy services cheaper, and so consumption of those services increases. For example, since fuel efficient vehicles make travel cheaper, consumers may choose to drive farther, thereby offsetting some of the potential energy savings. Similarly, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that energy efficiency improvements were almost always outpaced by economic growth, resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won't Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 5, "In Search of Solutions II: Efficiency Improvements", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; These are examples of the direct [[rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]].&lt;ref name=direct&gt;[http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf The Rebound Effect: an assessment of the evidence for economy-wide energy savings from improved energy efficiency] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910051917/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/Downloads/PDF/07/0710ReboundEffect/0710ReboundEffectReport.pdf |date=2008-09-10}} pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Ego-dystonic sexual orientation''' is an [[ego-dystonic]] [[mental disorder]] characterized by having a [[sexual orientation]] or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation.  It describes not innate sexual orientation itself, but a conflict between the sexual orientation one wishes to have and the sexual orientation one actually possesses.

==Classifications==
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) lists ego-dystonic sexual orientation in the [[ICD-10]], as a disorder of sexual development and orientation. The WHO diagnosis covers when gender identity or sexual orientation is clear, yet a patient has another behavioural or psychological disorder which makes that patient want to change it. {{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}} The diagnostic manual notes that a sexual orientation is not a disorder in itself.&lt;ref name = F66note&gt;[http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf60.htm+f661 ICD-10]: See part F66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[American Psychological Association]] has officially opposed the category of ego-dystonic homosexuality since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/policy/diagnoses.html Use of Diagnoses "Homosexuality" &amp; "Ego-Dystonic Homosexuality"] August 27 &amp; 30, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, a task force of the American Psychological Association undertook a thorough review of the existing research on the efficacy of reparative therapy for. Their report noted that there was very little methodologically sound research on [[sexual orientation change efforts]] (SOCEs) and that the "results of scientifically valid research indicate that it is unlikely that individuals will be able to reduce same-sex attractions or increase other-sex sexual attractions through SOCE." In addition, the task force found that "there are no methodologically sound studies of recent SOCE that would enable the task force to make a definitive statement about whether or not recent SOCE is safe or harmful and for whom."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbt/resources/therapeutic-response.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostic category of "ego-dystonic homosexuality" was removed from the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] in 1987 (with the publication of the DSM-III-R). Sexual disorders are still present in the DSM under the category of "sexual disorder not otherwise specified". One of the disorders under this category is "persistent and marked distress about one’s sexual orientation”, which can be considered similar to what WHO describes as ego-dystonic sexual orientation.&lt;ref name = newdirections&gt;{{cite book | last = Kleinplatz | first = Peggy J.  | title = New directions in sex therapy: innovations and alternatives | publisher = Psychology Press | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=dY4GentkJY0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage  | isbn = 978-0-87630-967-4 | page = 100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Working Group looking at changes for the [[ICD-11]] (due for implementation in 2018) reports that the classifications in section F66 are not clinically useful and recommends its deletion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Proposed declassification of disease categories related to sexual orientation in the ''International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems'' (ICD-11)|first1 = Susan D.|last1 = Cochran|first2 = Jack|last2 = Drescher|authorlink2 = Jack Drescher|first3 = Eszter|last3 = Kismödi|first4 = Alain|last4 = Giami|first5 = Claudia|last5 = García-Moreno|first6 = Elham|last6 = Atalla|first7 = Adele|last7 = Marais|first8 = Elisabeth|last8 = Meloni Vieira|first9 = Geoffrey M.|last9 = Reed|journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]]|year = 2014|volume = 92|issue = 9|pages = 672–679|doi = 10.2471/BLT.14.135541|pmc = 4208576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Medical Council of India]] uses the WHO classification of ego-dystonic sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pucl.org/Topics/Gender/2003/sexual-minorities.pdf|title=Human rights violations against sexuality minorities in India|publisher=[[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]|date=February 2001|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chinese Classification and Diagnostic Criteria of Mental Disorders]]'' includes ego-dystonic homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm CSSSM&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815232436/http://www.csssm.org/English/e7.htm |date=2007-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
When the WHO removed the diagnosis of homosexuality as a mental disorder in ICD-10, it included the diagnosis of ''ego-dystonic sexual orientation'' under "Psychological and behavioural disorders associated with sexual development and orientation". The WHO's ICD-10 diagnoses ego-dystonic sexual orientation thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The gender identity or sexual preference ([[heterosexual]], [[homosexual]], [[bisexual]], or [[pedophilia|prepubertal]]) is not in doubt, but the individual wishes it were different because of associated psychological and behavioural disorders, and may seek treatment in order to change it. ({{ICD10|F|66|1|f|60}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The WHO notes that for codes under F66: "Sexual orientation by itself is not to be regarded as a disorder."&lt;ref name = F66note/&gt;

Patients are sometimes still diagnosed as having this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/14/matthew-moore-homosexuality-suing_n_5678601.html|title=Gay Man Suing Doctor After His 'Homosexual Behavior' Is Diagnosed As 'Chronic Problem'|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=3 February 2015|author=James Nichols|date=August 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is often a result of unfavorable and intolerant attitudes of the society or a conflict between sexual urges and religious belief systems.&lt;ref name="Kar2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kar|title=Comprehensive Textbook of Sexual Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YxcjMPbGHQIC&amp;pg=PA177|date=1 January 2005|publisher=Jaypee Brothers Publishers|isbn=978-81-8061-405-7|pages=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Treatments ==
There are many ways a person may go about receiving therapy for ego-dystonic sexual orientation associated with homosexuality. There is no known therapy for other types of ego-dystonic sexual orientations. Therapy can be aimed at changing [[sexual orientation]], [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]], or helping a client become more comfortable with their sexual orientation and behaviours. Human rights groups have accused some countries of performing these treatments on [[egosyntonic]] homosexuals.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.infochangeindia.org/agenda4_24.jsp|title = Prayer, punishment or therapy?

=== LGB affirming ===
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}
[[Gay affirmative psychotherapy]] helps LGB people to examine and accept their [[sexual orientation]] and related sexual relationships. Psychologists and the whole of mainstream medical professionals endorse that [[homosexuality]] and [[bisexuality]] are not indicative of mental illness.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"/&gt; Countering psychiatry, which considered homosexuality to be a [[mental illness]] until 1973, current guidelines instead encourage psychotherapists to assist patients in overcoming the stigma of homosexuality rather than the sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/guidelines.html APA:Guidelines for Psychotherapy with Lesbian, Gay, &amp; Bisexual Clients]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some mental health professionals are unfamiliar with the social difficulties of the [[coming out]] process, particular to other factors such as age, race, ethnicity, or religious affiliation, they are encouraged by the APA to learn more about how gay, lesbian, and bisexual clients face discrimination in its various forms. Many gays and lesbians are rejected from their own families and form their own familial relationships and support systems that may also be unfamiliar to mental health professionals, who are encouraged to take into account the diversity of extended relationships in lieu of family.&lt;ref name="apa-guidelines"/&gt;  In gay affirmative psychotherapy, psychologists are encouraged to recognize how their attitudes and knowledge about homosexual and bisexual issues may be relevant to assessment and treatment and seek consultation or make appropriate referrals when indicated. Psychologists strive to understand the ways in which social stigmatization (i.e., prejudice, discrimination, and violence) poses risks to the mental health and well-being of homosexual and bisexual clients. Psychologists strive to understand how inaccurate or prejudicial views of homosexuality or bisexuality may affect the client's presentation in treatment and the therapeutic process.

For some clients, acting on [[same-sex attraction]] may not be a fulfilling solution as it may conflict with their religious beliefs; licensed mental health providers may approach such a situation by neither rejecting nor promoting [[celibacy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/pi/lgbc/publications/therapeutic-response.pdf Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt; Douglas Haldeman has argued that for individuals who seek therapy because of frustration surrounding "seemingly irreconcilable internal differences" between "their sexual and religious selves... neither a gay-affirmative nor a conversion therapy approach [may be] indicated," and that "[just as] therapists in the religious world [should] refrain from pathologizing their LGB clients... so, too, should gay-affirmative practitioners refrain from overtly or subtly devaluing those who espouse conservative religious identities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haldeman |first=Douglas |url=http://tcp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/5/691?ck=nck |title=When Sexual and Religious Orientation Collide:Considerations in Working with Conflicted Same-Sex Attracted Male Clients |publisher=The Counseling Psychologist |volume=32 |issue=5 |year=2004 |doi=10.1177/0011000004267560 |journal=The Counseling Psychologist |pages=691–715}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Data suggest that clients generally judge therapists who do not respect religiously-based identity outcomes to be unhelpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url         = http://www.drthrockmorton.com/jpcreorientation.pdf |title       = Counseling practices as they relate to ratings of helpfulness by consumers of sexual reorientation therapy |last        = Throckmorton |first       = Warren |author2     = Welton |date        = Winter 2005 |publisher   = Journal of Psychology and Christianity |volume      = 24 |issue       = 4 |pages       = 332–42 |format      = PDF |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081001214830/http://www.drthrockmorton.com/jpcreorientation.pdf |archivedate = 2008-10-01 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the emerging areas of research regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy is related to the process of assisting LGBTQ individuals from religious backgrounds feel comfortable with their sexual and gender orientation. Narrative analyses of clinicians' reports regarding gay affirmative psychotherapy suggest that the majority of conflicts discussed within the therapeutic context by gay men and their relatives from religious backgrounds are related to the interaction between family, self, and religion. Clinicians report that gay men and their families struggle more frequently with the institution, community, and practices of religion rather than directly with God. Chana Etengoff and Colette Daiute report in the Journal of Homosexuality that clinicians most frequently address these tensions by emphasizing the mediational strategies of increasing self-awareness, seeking secular support (e.g., PFLAG), and increasing positive communication between family members.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2015).

==== LGB support groups ====
LGB groups help counteract and buffer [[minority stress]], marginalization, and isolation.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; They focus on helping a person with ego-dystonic sexual orientation accept their sexual orientation.

=== Sexual orientation change efforts ===
{{Main|Sexual orientation change efforts}}
A task force commissioned by the APA found that religious identity and how one outwardly identifies one's sexual orientation (see [[sexual orientation identity]]) can develop through life.  [[Psychotherapy]], [[support group]]s, and life events can influence how one identifies privately and publicly. Similarly, self-awareness, and self-conception may evolve during treatment.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Some practitioners insist that improvement may be seen in emotional adjustment (self-stigma and shame reduction), and personal beliefs, values and norms (change of religious and moral belief, behaviour and motivation).&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;&lt;ref name="Psych"&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.aglp.org/pages/cfactsheets.html#Anchor-Gay-14210 |title       = Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Issues |author      = [[American Psychiatric Association]] |publisher   = Association of Gay and Lesbian Psychiatrics |date        = May 2000 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090103200307/http://www.aglp.org/pages/cfactsheets.html#Anchor-Gay-14210 |archivedate = 2009-01-03 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such an approach to treatment is widely regarded as poorly-advised, risky and potentially damaging to the individual.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/10/orientation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Psychological Association "encourages mental health professionals to avoid misrepresenting the efficacy of sexual orientation change efforts by promoting or promising change in sexual orientation when providing assistance to individuals distressed by their own or others’ sexual orientation and concludes that the benefits reported by participants in sexual orientation change efforts can be gained through approaches that do not attempt to change sexual orientation".&lt;ref name=apa2009&gt;American Psychological Association: [http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx Resolution on Appropriate Affirmative Responses to Sexual Orientation Distress and Change Efforts, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The APA reviewed research into the efficacy of efforts to change sexual orientation, and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to show whether these were effective or not.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Participants have reported both harm and benefit from such efforts, but no causal relationship has been determined between either the benefit or the harm.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; According to a recent APA study, participants who reported harm generally reported "anger, anxiety, confusion, depression, grief, guilt, hopelessness, deteriorated relationships with family, loss of social support, loss of faith, poor self-image, social isolation, intimacy difficulties, intrusive imagery, suicidal ideation, self-hatred, and sexual dysfunction. These reports of perceptions of harm are countered by accounts of perceptions of relief, happiness, improved relationships with God, and perceived improvement in mental health status".&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

No major mental health professional organization has sanctioned efforts to change sexual orientation and virtually all of them have adopted policy statements cautioning the profession and the public about treatments that purport to change sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Herek"&gt;[http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-herek.pdf Expert affidavit of Gregory M.

==== Conversion therapy ====
{{Main|Conversion therapy}}
The APA has roundly dismissed so-called conversion therapy (sometimes called "ex-gay" therapy) as unproductive and potentially harmful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apa.org/about/policy/sexual-orientation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of conversion therapy, Gender Wholeness Therapy was designed by an ex-gay [[Licensed Professional Counselor]], David Matheson.&lt;ref name="nytconversion"&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Luo | title = Some Tormented by Homosexuality Look to a Controversial Therapy | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/12/nyregion/12group.html | publisher = The New York Times | page = 1 | date = 2007-02-12 | accessdate = 2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The emphasis in Mr. Matheson's counselling is on helping men — all his clients are male — develop 'gender wholeness' by addressing emotional issues and building healthy connections with other men. He says he believes that helps reduce homosexual desires.&lt;ref name="nytconversion"/&gt;

Another variation of conversion therapy, "gender-affirmative therapy" has been described by [[A. Dean Byrd]] as follows: "The basic premise of gender-affirmative therapy is that social and emotional variables affect gender identity which, in turn, determines sexual orientation. The work of the therapist is to help people understand their gender development. Subsequently, such individuals are able to make choices that are consistent with their value system. The focus of therapy is to help clients fully develop their masculine or feminine identity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url         = http://www.regent.edu/acad/schlaw/academics/lawreview/articles/14_2Byrd.pdf |format      = &amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?q=author%3AByrd+intitle%3AHomosexuality%3A+Innate+and+Immutable%3F&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=2002&amp;as_yhi=2002&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |title       = Homosexuality: Innate and Immutable? |first       = A.

Several organizations have started retreats led by coaches aimed at helping participants diminish same-sex desires. These retreats tend to use a variety of techniques. Journey into Manhood, put on by [[People Can Change]], uses "a wide variety of large-group, small-group and individual exercises, from journaling to visualizations (or guided imagery) to group sharing and intensive emotional-release work."&lt;ref name=weekends&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.narth.com/docs/weekends.html |title       = Journey Into Manhood: A Healing Weekend Hosted by People Can Change |accessdate  = 2007-10-01 |date        = 2006-04-20 |publisher   = NARTH |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080121180438/http://www.narth.com/docs/weekends.html |archivedate = 2008-01-21 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Weekends put on by Adventure in Manhood support "healthy bonding with men, through masculine activity, teamwork, and socialization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.adventureinmanhood.com|title = Adventure in Manhood homepage|accessdate = 2007-10-29|publisher = Self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not specific to gay men, several gay men attended the New Warrior Training Adventure, a weekend put on by [[ManKind Project]], which is a "process of initiation and self-examination that is designed to catalyse the development of a healthy and mature masculine self."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mkpnm.org/weekend.html|title = The New Warrior Weekend|accessdate = 2007-10-29|publisher = Self-published}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Dallas]], a prominent ex-gay, leads a monthly five-day men's retreat on sexual purity titled, Every Man's Battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title       = 'Love Won Out' conference coming to Southern California |publisher   = Christian Examiner |url         = http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Sep07/Art_Sep07_13.html |date        = September 2007 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929155104/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Sep07/Art_Sep07_13.html |archivedate = 2011-09-29 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several reparative therapies have been established, including:

*Sexual identity therapy was designed by [[Warren Throckmorton]] and Mark Yarhouse, and was endorsed by [[Robert L. Spitzer]],&lt;ref name="New Ground"&gt;{{cite news |url         = http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy |title       = New ground in debate on 'curing' gays |last        = Simon |first       = Stephanie |publisher   = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date        = 2007-06-18 |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081013174508/http://wthrockmorton.com/2007/06/18/la-times-article-features-ex-gay-debate-and-sexual-identity-therapy/ |archivedate = 2008-10-13 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; prior to Spitzer's backing away from this belief that he had proven reparative therapy at times successful.&lt;ref name="truthwinsout.org"/&gt; Its purpose is to help patients line up their sexual identity with their beliefs and values. Therapy involves four phases: (1) assessment, (2) advanced or expanded informed consent, (3) psychotherapy, and (4) social integration of a valued sexual identity.
*[[Group psychotherapy]] uses group sessions led by a single psychologist and focuses on conflict surrounding homosexual expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wolf TJ |title=Group psychotherapy for bisexual men and their wives |journal=J Homosex |volume=14 |issue=1–2 |pages=191–9 |year=1987 |pmid=3655341 |doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Context Specific Therapy was designed by Jeffrey Robinson. It does not work with any one theory of homosexuality, but uses several theoretical backgrounds according to the client's need,&lt;ref name="What is RT"&gt;{{cite web |last        = Throckmorton |first       = Warren |url         = http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 |title       = What is reparative therapy? |publisher   = Self-published |year        = 2004 |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224422/http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=4 |archivedate = 2007-09-26 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on phenomenological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.narth.com/docs/2003conference.html |title = NARTH 2003 Annual Conference schedule |publisher = NARTH |date = 2004-04-14 |accessdate = 2007-10-29| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061115075723/http://www.narth.com/docs/2003conference.html| archivedate = November 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not seek to change the client's orientation, but instead focuses on diminishing homosexual thoughts and behaviours. It works within the client's own view of God, noting that "individuals who are successful at overcoming homosexual problems are motivated by strong religious values".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://www.theguardrail.com/whatis.htm |title       = What is Context Specific Therapy? |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |last        = Jeffrey |first       = Robinson |publisher   = Self-published |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107172359/http://www.theguardrail.com/whatis.htm |archivedate = 2007-11-07 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*MAP Therapy is designed for both the individual with ego-dystonic sexual orientation and their family members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journeyprograms.com/ Journey Programs]&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main paths that clients may choose to take: (1) they can affirm an LGB identity, (2) they can foster a lifestyle of celibacy, (3) they can work on developing heterosexual attractions, or (4) they can explore their options.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maptherapy.org/ MAP therapy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ex-gay organizations ====
{{Main|Ex-gay}}
[[File:One by One booth.jpg|thumb|150px|[[OneByOne]], an ex-gay organization, hosts a booth at a [[Love Won Out]] conference]]
For some ex-gay groups, choosing not to act on one's same-sex desires counts as a success&lt;ref name="regent"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sexualidentityinstitute.org/?page_id=13 |title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Regent University: Institute for the Study of Sexual Identity |accessdate = 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas conversion therapists tend to understand success in terms of reducing or eliminating those desires. For example, some ex-gays in [[mixed-orientation marriage]]s acknowledge that their sexual attractions remain primarily homosexual, but seek to make their marriages work regardless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Anonymous | title = No easy victory | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2002/003/2.50.html | publisher = Christianity Today | date = 2002-03-11 | accessdate = 2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-gay advocates sometimes compare adopting the label "ex-gay" to the [[coming out]] process.&lt;ref name="peebles"&gt;{{cite journal |last        = Peebles |first       = Amy E. |date        = April 2003 |title       = It's Not Coming Out, So Then What Is It?

Some ex-gay organizations follow the tenets of a specific religion, while others try to encompass a more general spirituality. Although most ex-gay organizations were started by American [[evangelical Christians]], there are now ex-gay organizations in other parts of the world and for [[Catholics]], [[Mormons]], [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. According to Douglas Haldeman, "This modality is thought to be one of the most common for individuals seeking to change their sexual orientation."&lt;ref name="haldeman"&gt;
{{cite journal |last= Haldeman |first= Douglas C. |date=June 2002 |title= Gay Rights, Patient Rights: The Implications of Sexual Orientation Conversion Therapy |journal= Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |pages= 260–4 |doi= 10.1037/0735-7028.33.3.260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ex-gay ministries typically are staffed by volunteer counselors, unlike reorientation counselling, which is conducted by licensed clinicians.&lt;ref name="Throckmorton2002"&gt;{{cite journal |publisher   = [[American Psychological Association]] |journal     = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |title       = Initial empirical and clinical findings concerning the change process for ex-gays |url         = http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=1 |date        = June 2002 |volume      = 33 |issue       = 3 |pages       = 242–8 |last        = Throckmorton |first       = Warren |doi         = 10.1037/0735-7028.33.3.242 |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20080504130831/http://www.drthrockmorton.com/article.asp?id=1 |archivedate = 2008-05-04 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex-gay groups use several different techniques. [[Love in Action]] hosts workshops on "child development, gender roles, and [[personal sexuality]]," one-on-one Biblical guidance, "a structured environment help[ing] establish new routines and healthy patterns of behaviour", "challenging written assignments and interactive projects," "family involvement to improve communication... and to facilitate marital reconciliation," and "hiking, camping, canoeing, and rafting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.loveinaction.org/default.aspx?pid=91|title = the source|accessdate = 2007-08-28|publisher = Love in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.loveinaction.org/default.aspx?pid=93|title = the journey|accessdate = 2007-08-28|publisher = Love in Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exodus International]] considers reparative therapy to be a useful tool, but not a necessary one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/  |title=Exodus International Policy Statements  |accessdate=2007-08-28  |publisher=Exodus International  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010931/http://exodus.to/content/view/34/117/  |archivedate=2007-09-28  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Evergreen International]] did not advocate or discourage particular therapies&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==== Criticism ====
[[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert L. Spitzer]] reported in 2003 that individuals who reported experiencing a change in sexual orientation had felt depressed or even suicidal prior to treatment "precisely because they had previously thought there was no hope for them, and they had been told by many mental health professionals that there was no hope for them, they had to just learn to live with their homosexual feelings."&lt;ref&gt;Adler, S. &amp; Levin, E.

=== Exploratory therapy===
The APA has specifically advised against sexual orientation change efforts and encourages practitioners to aid those who seek sexual orientation change by utilizing affirmative multiculturally competent therapy that recognizes the negative impact of social stigma on sexual minorities and balances ethical principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence, justice, and respect for people's rights and dignity.  If a client wants to change his sexual orientation, the therapist should help the client come to their own decisions by evaluating the reasons behind the patient's goals.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

== Relationship to religion ==
{{further|Religion and homosexuality}}

The terms ''egodystonic'' and ''egosyntonic'' are used within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in that, according to gay-rights advocate Bernard Lynch, priests who are gay but egodystonic, that is "hate their homosexuality", are acceptable, whereas egosyntonic candidates for the priesthood, those who accept their own sexuality, cannot be considered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InWjCcStFVE BBC HARDtalk - Father Bernard Lynch], 27 Feb 2013.  See at 4m20s&lt;/ref&gt;

Some churches publish specific instructions to clergy on how to minister to gay and lesbian people. These include ''[[Ministry to Persons with a Homosexual Inclination]]'', produced by the Catholic Church, and ''[[God Loveth His Children]]'', produced by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]. In 1994, a church in the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] held a conference entitled “The Path to Freedom: Exploring healing for the Homosexual.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url         = http://oneby1.org/aboutus.html |title       = OneByOne: About Us |accessdate  = 2007-10-29 |year        = 2006 |publisher   = Self-published |deadurl     = yes |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120845/http://oneby1.org/aboutus.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27 |df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The APA encourages religious leaders to recognize that it is outside their role to adjudicate empirical scientific issues in psychology.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

Mental health practitioners can incorporate religion into therapy by "integrating aspects of the psychology of religion into their work, including by obtaining a thorough assessment of clients’ spiritual and religious beliefs, religious identity and motivations, and spiritual functioning; improving positive religious coping; and exploring the intersection of religious and sexual orientation identities."&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt; Researchers have found that for some clients who have 'identity conflicts' these can be reduced by reading religious texts that increase self-authority and allow them to reduce their focus on negative messages about homosexuality. Researchers also found that such clients made further progress if they came to believe that regardless of their sexual orientation, their God still loves and accepts them.&lt;ref name=apa2009/&gt;

Some gay and lesbian people choose [[LGBT-affirming religious groups]], change churches to those that affirm LGBT people, or simply leave religion.&lt;ref name = apa2009/&gt;

Energy conversion efficiency depends on the usefulness of the output. All or part of the heat produced from burning a fuel may become rejected [[waste heat]] if, for example, work is the desired output from a [[thermodynamic cycle]]. Energy converter is an example of an energy transformation. For example a light bulb falls into the categories energy converter.  
&lt;math&gt;
\eta = \frac{P_\mathrm{out}}{P_\mathrm{in}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Even though the definition includes the notion of usefulness, [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] is considered a [[technology|technical]] or [[physics|physical]] term. Goal or mission oriented terms include [[effectiveness]] and [[efficacy]].

Generally, energy conversion efficiency is a [[dimensionless]] number between 0 and 1.0, or 0% to 100%.  Efficiencies may not exceed 100%, e.g., for a [[perpetual motion]] machine.  However, other [[thermal efficiency|effectiveness measures]] that can exceed 1.0 are used for [[heat pumps]] and other devices that move heat rather than convert it.

When talking about the efficiency of heat engines and power stations the convention should be stated, i.e., HHV ({{aka}} Gross Heating Value, etc.) or LCV (a.k.a. Net Heating value), and  whether gross output (at the generator terminals) or net output (at the power station fence) are being considered.  The two are separate but both must be stated. Failure to do so causes endless confusion.

Related, more specific terms include
*[[Electrical efficiency]], useful power output per electrical power consumed;
*[[Mechanical efficiency]], where one form of mechanical energy (e.g. potential energy of water) is converted to mechanical energy ([[Mechanical work|work]]);
*[[Thermal efficiency]] or [[Fuel efficiency]], useful [[heat]] and/or [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] [[Work output|output]] per input energy such as the [[fuel]] consumed;
*'Total efficiency', e.g., for [[cogeneration]], useful [[electric power]] and heat output per fuel energy consumed.  Same as the [[thermal efficiency]].
*[[Luminous efficiency]], that portion of the emitted electromagnetic radiation is usable for human vision.

==Fuel heating values and efficiency==
In Europe the usable energy content of fuel is typically calculated using the '''[[lower heating value]]''' (LHV) of that fuel, the definition of which assumes that the [[water vapor]] produced during fuel [[combustion]] (oxidation), remains gaseous, and is not [[condensation|condensed]] to liquid water so the latent heat of vaporization of that water is not  usable. Using the LHV, a [[condensing boiler]] can achieve a "heating efficiency" in excess of 100% (this does not violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as long as the LHV convention is understood, but does cause confusion). This is because the apparatus recovers part of the [[heat of vaporization]], which is not included in the definition of the lower heating value of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In the U.S. and elsewhere, the '''[[higher heating value]]''' (HHV) is used, which includes the latent heat for condensing the water vapor, and thus the thermodynamic maximum of 100% efficiency cannot be exceeded with HHV's use.

==Wall-plug efficiency, luminous efficiency, and efficacy==
[[File:Rare gas flashtube spectral outputs.JPG|thumb|The absolute irradiance of four different gases when used in a flashtube. Xenon is by far the most efficient of the gases, although krypton is more effective at a specific wavelength of light.]]
[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|The sensitivity of the human eye to various wavelengths. Assuming each wavelength equals 1 watt of radiant energy, only the center wavelength is perceived as 685 [[candela]]s (1 watt of luminous energy), equaling 685 lumens. The vertical colored-lines represent the 589 (yellow) sodium line, and popular 532 nm (green), 671 nm (red), 473 nm (blue), and 405 nm (violet) laser pointers.]]
[[File:Fluorescent Energy.svg|thumb|A [[Sankey diagram]] showing the multiple stages of energy loss between the wall plug and the light output of a fluorescent lamp. The greatest losses occur due to the Stokes shift.]]

In optical systems such as lighting and [[laser]]s, the energy conversion efficiency is often referred to as [[wall-plug efficiency]]. The wall-plug efficiency is the measure of output radiative-energy, in [[watt]]s ([[joule]]s per second), per the total of the input electrical-energy in watts. The output-energy is usually measured in terms of [[Absolute scale|absolute]] [[irradiance]] and the wall-plug efficiency is given as a percentage of the total input-energy, with the inverse percentage representing the losses.

The wall-plug efficiency differs from the ''luminous efficiency'' in that wall-plug efficiency describes the direct output/input conversion of energy (the amount of [[Work (physics)|work]] that can be performed) whereas luminous efficiency takes into account the human eye's varying sensitivity to different wavelengths (how well it can illuminate a space). Instead of using watts, the power of a light source to produce wavelengths proportional to human perception is measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s. The human eye is most sensitive to wavelengths of 555 [[nanometer]]s (greenish-yellow) but the sensitivity decreases dramatically to either side of this wavelength, following a [[Gaussian profile|Gaussian]] power-curve and dropping to zero sensitivity at the red and violet ends of the spectrum. Due to this the eye does not usually see all of the wavelengths emitted by a particular light-source, nor does it see all of the wavelengths within the visual spectrum equally. Yellow and green, for example, make up more than 50% of what the eye perceives as being white, even though in terms of radiant energy white-light is made from equal portions of all colors (i.e.: a 5 mw green laser appears brighter than a 5 mw red laser, yet the red laser stands-out better against a white background). Therefore, the [[radiant intensity]] of a light source may be much greater than its [[luminous intensity]], meaning that the source emits more energy than the eye can use. Likewise, the lamp's wall-plug efficiency is usually greater than its luminous efficiency. The effectiveness of a light source to convert electrical energy into wavelengths of visible light, in proportion to the sensitivity of the human eye, is referred to as [[luminous efficacy]], which is measured in units of lumens per watt (lm/w) of electrical input-energy. 

Unlike efficacy (effectiveness), which is a [[unit of measurement]], efficiency is [[unitless]] number expressed as a [[percentage]], requiring only that the input and output units be of the same type. Therefore, the luminous efficiency of a light source is the percentage of luminous efficacy per the theoretical-maximum efficacy at a specific wavelength. The amount of energy carried by a photon of light is determined by its wavelength. In lumens, this energy is offset by the eye's sensitivity to the selected wavelengths. For example, a green [[laser pointer]] can have greater than 30 times the apparent brightness of a red pointer of the same power output. At 555 nm in wavelength, 1 watt of radiant energy is equivalent to 685 lumens, thus a monochromatic light source at this wavelength, with a luminous efficacy of 685 lm/w, has a luminous efficiency of 100%. The theoretical-maximum efficacy lowers for wavelengths at either side of 555 nm. For example, [[low-pressure sodium lamp]]s produce [[monochromatic light]] at 589 nm with a luminous efficacy of 200 lm/w, which is the highest of any lamp. The theoretical-maximum efficacy at that wavelength is 525 lm/w, so the lamp has a luminous efficiency of 38.1%. Because the lamp is monochromatic, the luminous efficiency nearly matches the wall-plug efficiency of &lt; 40%.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Atomic Collision Physics, Volume 5'' by H. S. W. Massey, E. W. McDaniel, B. Bederson -- Academic Press 1982 Page 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.photonics.com/a28677/Efficacy_Limits_for_Solid-State_White_Light&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calculations for luminous efficiency become more complex for lamps that produce white light or a mixture of spectral lines. [[Fluorescent lamps]] have higher wall-plug efficiencies than low-pressure sodium lamps, but only have half the luminous efficacy of ~ 100 lm/w, thus the luminous efficiency of fluorescents is lower than sodium lamps. A xenon [[flashtube]] has a typical wall-plug efficiency of 50--70%, exceeding that of most other forms of lighting. Because the flashtube emits large amounts of infrared and ultraviolet radiation, only a portion of the output energy is used by the eye. The luminous efficacy is therefore typically around 50 lm/w. However, not all applications for lighting involve the human eye nor are restricted to visible wavelengths. For [[laser pumping]], the efficacy is not related to the human eye so it is not called "luminous" efficacy, but rather simply "efficacy" as it relates to the absorption lines of the [[laser medium]]. Krypton flashtubes are often chosen for pumping [[Nd:YAG laser]]s, even though their wall-plug efficiency is typically only ~ 40%. [[Krypton]]'s spectral lines better match the absorption lines of the [[neodymium]]-[[Dopant|doped]] crystal, thus the efficacy of krypton for this purpose is much higher than [[xenon]]; able to produce up to twice the laser output for the same electrical input.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Optical Instruments and Techniques'' by Daniel Malacara Hernández -- CRC Press 2018 Page 589&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Solid-state laser engineering'' by Walter Koechner – Springer-Verlag 1965 Page 335&lt;/ref&gt; All of these terms refer to the amount of energy and lumens as they exit the light source, disregarding any losses that might occur within the lighting fixture or subsequent output optics. ''Luminaire efficiency'' refers to the total lumen-output from the fixture per the lamp output.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding LED Illumination'' by M. Nisa Khan -- CRC Press 2014 Page 21--23&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a few light sources, such as [[incandescent light bulb]]s, most light sources have multiple stages of energy conversion between the "wall plug" (electrical input point, which may include batteries, direct wiring, or other sources) and the final light-output, with each stage producing a loss. Low-pressure sodium lamps initially convert the electrical energy using an [[electrical ballast]], to maintain the proper current and voltage, but some energy is lost in the ballast. Similarly, fluorescent lamps also convert the electricity using a ballast (electronic efficiency). The electricity is then converted into light energy by the [[electrical arc]] (electrode efficiency and discharge efficiency). The light is then transferred to a fluorescent coating that only absorbs suitable wavelengths, with some losses of those wavelengths due to reflection off and transmission through the coating (transfer efficiency). The number of photons absorbed by the coating will not match the number then reemitted as [[fluorescence]] ([[Quantum yield|quantum efficiency]]). Finally, due to the phenomenon of the [[Stokes shift]], the reemitted photons will have a shorter wavelength (thus lower energy) than the absorbed photons (fluorescence efficiency). In very similar fashion, lasers also experience many stages of conversion between the wall plug and the output [[aperture]]. The terms "wall-plug efficiency" or "energy conversion efficiency" are therefore used to denote the overall efficiency of the energy-conversion device, deducting the losses from each stage, although this may exclude external components needed to operate some devices, such as coolant pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rp-photonics.com/wall_plug_efficiency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Luminescent Semiconductor Materials'' by Leah Bergman, Jeanne L. McHale -- CRC Press 2012 Page 270&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extension transference''' is the symbolic sub-division of a particular goal or purpose so that the sub-divided concepts seem fragmented from the original purpose.

''"…when applied to language and experience, becomes a useful theoretical concept. Thus, spoken language is a symbolization of something that happened, is happening or will happen. Written language as an extension of the spoken form is therefore a symbolization of symbolization! This intellectual manoeuvre Hall terms extension transference. The extension can become confused with or take the place of the process described."'' (Lago, p68).

''"Extension transference is a phenomenon that occurs when we create systems to help us do things more efficiently and effectively and in ways that we can measure and control. Often these are processes that we once did quite naturally on our own."'' (Hanson, p.&amp;nbsp;43).

The term was coined by the American anthropologist [[Edward T. Hall]] in his book ''[[Beyond Culture]]'' (1976).

'''Friday Harbor Laboratories''' ('''FHL'''), is a [[marine biology]] field station of the [[University of Washington]], located in [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], [[San Juan Island]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States. Friday Harbor Labs is known for its intensive summer classes offered to competitive [[graduate students]] from around the world in fields of [[marine biology]] and other marine sciences.

[[File:Puget Sound Biological Station laboratories, Friday Harbor, San Juan Island, Washington, ca 1926 (COBB 335).jpeg|thumb|Friday Harbor Biological Station, ca 1926]]
Autumn and spring academic terms include courses designed for advanced undergraduates as well as graduate students; most spring and fall classes run 10 weeks and feature an original research component. In addition to serving students, Friday Harbor Laboratories has a small resident scientific staff and offers year-round laboratory, library, and housing accommodations for visiting researchers and their families. Research areas include [[Seaweed|marine algae]], marine conservation biology, marine invertebrate zoology, comparative invertebrate embryology, experimental and field approaches in biology and paleontology, functional morphology and ecology of marine fishes, invertebrate larval ecology, and other current topics in marine science and oceanography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/cemills/1904StationDiary.pdf|title=Station Diary|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NGC4676.jpg|thumb|300 px|The [[Mice Galaxies]] NGC 4676]]

A '''galactic tide''' is a [[tidal force]] experienced by objects subject to the [[gravitational field]] of a [[galaxy]] such as the [[Milky Way]]. Particular areas of interest concerning galactic tides include [[Interacting galaxy|galactic collisions]], the disruption of [[dwarf galaxy|dwarf]] or [[satellite galaxy|satellite galaxies]], and the Milky Way's tidal effect on the [[Oort cloud]] of the [[Solar System]].

==Effects on external galaxies==
{{main|Interacting galaxy}}

=== Galaxy collisions ===
[[File:NGC40384039 large.jpg|thumb|200 px|The lengthy tidal tails of the colliding [[antennae galaxies]]]] 
Tidal forces are dependent on the gradient of a gravitational field, rather than its strength, and so tidal effects are usually limited to the immediate surroundings of a galaxy. Two large galaxies undergoing collisions or passing nearby each other will be subjected to very large tidal forces, often producing the most visually striking demonstrations of galactic tides in action.

Two interacting galaxies will not always collide head-on (if at all), and the tidal forces will distort each galaxy along an axis pointing roughly towards  and away from its perturber. As the two galaxies briefly orbit each other, these distorted regions, which are pulled away from the main body of each galaxy, will be sheared by the galaxy's [[differential rotation]] and flung off into [[intergalactic space]], forming '''tidal tails'''. Such tails are typically strongly curved. If a tail appears to be straight, it is probably being viewed edge-on. The stars and gas that comprise the tails will have been pulled from the easily distorted galactic discs (or other extremities) of one or both bodies, rather than the gravitationally bound galactic centres.&lt;ref name="toomre72"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Galactic Bridges and Tails|author1=Toomre A. |author2=Toomre J. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=178|pages=623–666|date=1972|bibcode=1972ApJ...178..623T|doi=10.1086/151823 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two very prominent examples of collisions producing tidal tails are the [[Mice Galaxies]] and the [[Antennae Galaxies]].

Just as the Moon raises two water tides on opposite sides of the Earth, so a galactic tide produces two arms in its galactic companion. While a large tail is formed if the perturbed galaxy is equal to or less massive than its partner, if it is significantly more massive than the perturbing galaxy, then the trailing arm will be relatively minor, and the leading arm, sometimes called a '''bridge''', will be more prominent.&lt;ref name="toomre72"/&gt; Tidal bridges are typically harder to distinguish than tidal tails: in the first instance, the bridge may be absorbed by the passing galaxy or the resulting merged galaxy, making it visible for a shorter duration than a typical large tail. Secondly, if one of the two galaxies is in the foreground, then the second galaxy — and the bridge between them — may be partially obscured. Together, these effects can make it hard to see where one galaxy ends and the next begins. '''Tidal loops''', where a tail joins with its parent galaxy at both ends, are rarer still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=NGC 3310 and its tidal debris: remnants of galaxy evolution|author=Wehner E.H.|display-authors=etal|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|volume=371|issue=3|pages=1047–1056|date=2006|bibcode=2006MNRAS.371.1047W|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10757.x |arxiv = astro-ph/0607088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satellite interactions ===
[[Image:M31bobo.jpg|thumb|left|300 px|The [[Andromeda Galaxy]]. Note its satellite galaxy [[Messier 32|M32]] (top left), whose outer arms have been stripped away by Andromeda's tidal forces.]]
Because tidal effects are strongest in the immediate vicinity of a galaxy, satellite galaxies are particularly likely to be affected. Such an external force upon a satellite can produce ordered motions within it, leading to large-scale observable effects: the interior structure and motions of a dwarf satellite galaxy may be severely affected by a galactic tide, inducing rotation (as with the tides of the Earth's oceans) or an anomalous mass-to-[[Luminosity#In astronomy|luminosity]] ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Galactic Tides Inflate the Apparent M/L's of Dwarf Galaxies?|author1=Piatek S. |author2=Pryor C. |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=25|pages=1383|date=1993|bibcode=1993AAS...183.5701P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satellite galaxies can also be subjected to the same tidal stripping that occurs in galactic collisions, where stars and gas are torn from the extremities of a galaxy, possibly to be absorbed by its companion. The dwarf galaxy [[Messier 32|M32]], a satellite galaxy of [[Andromeda galaxy|Andromeda]], may have lost its [[spiral arm]]s to tidal stripping, while a high star formation rate in the remaining core may be the result of tidally-induced motions of the remaining [[molecular cloud]]s&lt;ref name="Bekkietal2001"&gt;{{cite journal

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Because tidal forces can knead and compress the interstellar gas clouds inside galaxies, they induce large amounts of [[star formation]] in small satellites.)

The stripping mechanism is the same as between two comparable galaxies, although its comparatively weak gravitational field ensures that only the satellite, not the host galaxy, is affected. If the satellite is very small compared to the host, the tidal debris tails produced are likely to be symmetric, and follow a very similar orbit, effectively tracing the satellite's path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Johnston, K.V. |author2=Hernquist, L. |author3=Bolte, M. |title=Fossil Signatures of Ancient Accretion Events in the Halo|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=1996|volume=465|pages=278|bibcode=1996ApJ...465..278J|doi=10.1086/177418 |arxiv = astro-ph/9602060 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the satellite is reasonably large—typically over one ten thousandth the mass of its host—then the satellite's own gravity may affect the tails, breaking the symmetry and accelerating the tails in different directions. The resulting structure is dependent on both the mass and orbit of the satellite, and the mass and structure of the conjectured [[Dark matter halo|galactic halo]] around the host, and may provide a means of probing the [[dark matter]] [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential|potential]] of a galaxy such as the Milky Way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Choi, J.-H. |author2=Weinberg, M.D. |author3=Katz, N. |title=The dynamics of tidal tails from massive satellites |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2007.12313.x |date=2007 |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=381 |issue=3 |pages=987–1000 |arxiv=astro-ph/0702353|bibcode = 2007MNRAS.381..987C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over many orbits of its parent galaxy, or if the orbit passes too close to it, a dwarf satellite may eventually be completely disrupted, to form a tidal stream of stars and gas wrapping around the larger body. It has been suggested that the extended discs of gas and stars around some galaxies, such as Andromeda, may be the result of the complete tidal disruption (and subsequent merger with the parent galaxy) of a dwarf satellite galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=On the Formation of Extended Galactic Disks by Tidally Disrupted Dwarf Galaxies|author1=Peñarrubia J. |author2=McConnachie A. |author3=Babul A. | journal=The Astrophysical Journal| volume=650|issue=1|pages=L33–L36|date=2006|bibcode=2006ApJ...650L..33P| doi=10.1086/508656|arxiv = astro-ph/0606101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on bodies within a galaxy==
{{See also|Oort cloud#Tidal effects}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
Tidal effects are also present within a galaxy, where their gradients are likely to be steepest. This can have consequences for the formation of [[star]]s and [[planetary system]]s. Typically a star's gravity will dominate within its own system, with only the passage of other stars substantially affecting dynamics. However, at the outer reaches of the system, the star's gravity is weak and galactic tides may be significant. In the Solar System, the hypothetical [[Oort cloud]], believed to be the source of long-period [[comet]]s, lies in this transitional region.

[[Image:Kuiper oort-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Diagram of the [[Oort cloud]].]]

The Oort cloud is believed to be a vast shell surrounding the Solar System, possibly over a [[light-year]] in radius. Across such a vast distance, the gradient of the Milky Way's gravitational field plays a far more noticeable role. Because of this gradient, galactic tides may then deform an otherwise spherical Oort cloud, stretching the cloud in the direction of the galactic centre and compressing it along the other two axes, just as the Earth distends in response to the gravity of the Moon.

The Sun's gravity is sufficiently weak at such a distance that these small galactic perturbations may be enough to dislodge some [[planetesimals]] from such distant orbits, sending them towards the Sun and planets by significantly reducing their [[perihelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Long-term effects of the Galactic tide on cometary dynamics| author=Fouchard M.| display-authors=etal| journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy| volume=95| issue=1–4|pages=299–326|date=2006|bibcode=2006CeMDA..95..299F| doi=10.1007/s10569-006-9027-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a body, being composed of a rock and ice mixture, would become a comet when subjected to the increased solar radiation present in the inner Solar System.

It has been suggested that the galactic tide may also contribute to the formation of an Oort cloud, by increasing the perihelia of planetesimals with large [[Apsis|aphelia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Orbital Evolution of Planetesimals by the Galactic Tide|author1=Higuchi A., Kokubo E.  |author2=Mukai, T.| journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society| volume=37|pages=521|date=2005|bibcode=2005DDA....36.0205H}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that the effects of the galactic tide are quite complex, and depend heavily on the behaviour of individual objects within a planetary system. However, cumulatively, the effect can be quite significant; up to 90% of all comets originating from an Oort cloud may be the result of the galactic tide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Periodic variation of Oort Cloud flux and cometary impacts on the Earth and Jupiter|author1=Nurmi P. |author2=Valtonen M.J. |author3=Zheng J.Q. |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=327 | issue=4|pages=1367–1376|date=2001|bibcode=2001MNRAS.327.1367N | doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04854.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on Earth==
The galactic tide's effect is negligible on Earth, though could in theory be measured:  If the sun's tidal effect is 1, then the Moon's is 2 and the Milky Way's is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Therefore, if tidal effects from the Moon were to raise the sea level 10 meters, the effect of the Milky Way would raise the sea about 10 [[picometre]]s, less than the size of an atom.

'''The general rating of city appeal''' — is a method for calculating and comparing the city appeal and urban environment, based on determining their number values and the threshold of appeal. The method is based on collection, description and assessment of qualitative and quantitative indices. 
Quantitative indices are represented by annual statistical data on the cities of the [[Russian Federation]], whereas qualitative characteristics are represented by own properties of a city. The purpose of the rating is to carry out an integrated collective and public analysis of the [[urban environment]], compare urban environments, analyze strengthens and weaknesses and to prepare information for managerial analysis and to make personnel decisions.

== Description ==

The general rating of city appeal for [[Russian cities]] was designed by the [[Russian Union of Engineers]] in 2012. The rating was designed due to the objective need to conduct a complex analysis and assess disproportions in distribution of population, labour resources and production capacity in the Russian Federation.

'''The purpose of the rating''' is to carry out an unbiased and complex appraisal of Russian cities in terms of the criteria which determine the quality level of all spheres of activity of the population, city economy and urban environment.

'''Tasks:'''
* To analyze the existing Russian and foreign methods and practices of comparing administrative and territorial units of macroregions and countries.
* To conduct a comprehensive research and determine the criteria and basic indicators of appraisal of cities by means of selected theoretical and methodological disciplines, related to the appraisal of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of objects under research.
* To develop a rating [[methodology]], based on the best Russian and foreign practices.
* To develop a complex rating methodology for comparing cities on the basis of a system of economic parameters.
* To develop a system social and economic parameters, fully charactering functioning of cities.
* To calculate integral parameters, indices and groups of indices in accordance with the developed methodology.
* To outline typical groups (typology) of items according to a range of features, specify similarities and differences in their development outline significant individual differences and analyze the results.
* To develop a monitoring system of social and economic status of the cities under research.

== Rating methodology ==

The methodology of appraisal of city appeal is based on quality assessment of elements of the city economy and comfort of living of citizens. The main method is a procedure borrowed from qualimetry, in which several approaches to quantitative appraisal of quality were developed.

To compare various properties measured in scales different in range and dimension &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;, a relative dimensionless ratio, is used to show the degree of approximation of  &lt;math&gt;Qi&lt;/math&gt;, (absolute property indicator) to the maximum  &lt;math&gt;Q^{max}&lt;/math&gt;, and minimum   &lt;math&gt;Q^{min}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative ratio is described as the following relationship  &lt;math&gt;Ki=f{(Q^{min},\ldots,Q_i,\ldots,Q^{max})}&lt;/math&gt;, which may be represented as a normalized function as follows  &lt;math&gt;K_i=\frac{Q_i-Q^{min}}{Q^{max}-Q^{min}}&lt;/math&gt;

To compare the relativities of all properties included in the tree of properties &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt;, dimensionless importance ratios are used. For the purposes of convenience the following is usually assumed  &lt;math&gt;0&lt;G_i&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N G_i=1&lt;/math&gt;

The values of importance ratios are determined with the help of expert and non-expert (analytical) methods. This study combines both techniques (as described below). The relative importance was determined using a method of expert survey involving 50 experts of various industries and areas of business, different social and professional status.

Thus, the qualitative appraisal of quality  &lt;math&gt;K_k&lt;/math&gt; is expressed using the following formula

&lt;math&gt;K_k=K_ef \sum_{i=1}^N K_iG_i&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;K_ef=1&lt;/math&gt; for all indices forming a part of the final general index of city appeal.
The general city appeal index is directly calculated as an average compound of all characteristics

&lt;math&gt;G(K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_n)=\sqrt[n]{K_1K_2\cdots K_n}=\left(\prod_{i=1}^n K_i\right)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

The key problem of selection of the minimum  combination of properties (indicators) forming a part of the item quality may be solved through the functional and typological analysis considering the quality as a system of objective properties, and based on the volume of the original information (statistical and open-access information). 
Therefore, to conduct the appraisal, 70 quasisimple properties were selected, forming 41 overall indices, which are, in their turn, interpreted as 13 indices.

== Ranking results ==

The top ten cities are characterized by high indicators in nearly all the aspects. The only exception is the [[housing affordability]] factor, in terms of which the leading cities have low indicators because of high prices for 1 square meter of residential space. The cities leading in terms of most indicators are million-plus cities ([[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], and others); cities having development advantages (Vladivostok, Krasnodar, Sochi, and Kaliningrad); cities that are attractive from the point of view of investments ([[Tomsk]], [[Omsk]], [[Surgut]], [[Tyumen]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Saratov]]); and Moscow Region cities with high construction rate ([[Podolsk]], [[Khimki]], [[Balashikha]] and [[Mytishchi]]).

The medium-ranked cities are the cities characterized by dynamic development ([[Kaluga]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Kislovodsk]]); industrial cities ([[Pervouralsk]], [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Ulyanovsk]], [[Kamensk-Uralsky]], [[Shakhty]]); the single-industry city of [[Naberezhnye Chelny]], as well as [[Bryansk]], [[Ryazan]], [[Vologda]], and [[Yoshkar-Ola]].

The following cities are noted for satisfactory development levels: [[Orsk]], [[Ulan-Ude]], [[Orenburg]], [[Sterlitamak]], [[Syzran]], [[Ussuriysk]], [[Oktyabrsky, Russia|Oktyabrsky]], [[Votkinsk]], single-industry cities [[Magnitogorsk]], [[Nizhni Tagil]], and the single-industry city having the highest investment inflow – [[Nakhodka]].

The bottom-ranked cities in most subratings are the [[North Caucasus]] cities ([[Kaspiysk]]  and [[Yessentuki]]), cities of the Altai Territory ([[Rubtsovsk]], [[Barnaul]], [[Biysk]]), single-industry cities [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky (city)|Leninsk-Kuznetsky]] and [[Severodvinsk]], as well as [[Artyom]], [[Miass]], [[Novocheboksarsk]] and Kopeisk. [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District]] cities [[Novy Urengoy]] and [[Noyabrsk]], in spite of high economic indicators, generally lose on 50% of the indicators.

Overall ranking indicates considerable disproportions in city potential, which becomes clear, if we delete [[population dynamics]] indices from the rating. Thus, if we exclude this parameter, the potential of the 1st city will be more than twice as high as of the 10th city and 10 times higher than the potential of the 100th city. Evidently, such a high difference is determined by objective difference of potentials of the cities; it is also important to notice that, in accordance with the Pareto principle, it is not obligatory to improve all the components of qualitative appraisal of cities. Here, the key aspect is economic potential.

It is also necessary to compare some social factors, first of all, the development of [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[social services]] because these are the key indicators.

The overall ranking of cities in the rating shows that even absolute leaders are not so far from the cities in the middle of the rating. This is caused by leveling of low indicators of parameters of some leaders. In particular, the value of the general index of Omsk, which ranks 10th, is just 1,2 times (by 20%) higher than that of the mid-city Mezhdurechensk. The only exception is Moscow (the value of the general indicator is 3 times higher than that of [[Mezhdurechensk]]; 2,5 times higher than that of the 10th city – Omsk – and twice as high as of the 3rd city – Novosibirsk).

Besides, if we analyze the total of indicators of all the cities as their total potential, then the weight of Moscow – the leader of the rating – is 2%, and the weight of Grozny – the last in the rating -  is 0,6%.

For most cities it can be said that the level of economic and industrial development would differ very much depending on [[living conditions]]. This is true for nearly all cities. For example, [[Syberia]] and [[Ural (region)|Ural]] are centers for hydrocarbon production and [[metal mining]]. With the highest [[Per capita income|income rates per capita]], these cities are characterized by the worst [[climate|natural climatic conditions]] and low-developed [[transport system]].

The group of mid-cities comprises rather different cities, ranging from the largest metallurgic mono-cities – Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, Kamensk-Uralsky to cities with quite versatile economy – [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], Volzhsky. On the whole, this group consists of either industrially developed centers with negative natural and climatic conditions, or mid-cities of old-cultivated regions, characterized by primarily average values of all indicators.

The lowest indices are found among underdeveloped cities of the North Caucasus and South Siberia. This is connected primarily with [[agriculture|agricultural specialization of the economy]] of these cities and adverse effect of conflicts which took place on the territory of the North Caucasus. The group of depressed cities also includes former large and middle-sized industrial centers which are primarily mono-cities – [[Zlatoust]] (metallurgy), [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky (city)|Leninsk-Kuznetsky]] (metallurgy), [[Norilsk]] (metallurgy), [[Severodvinsk]] (defense industry complex). In money terms, the income difference may be more than by 6,7 times, and, as a rule, not in favour of underdeveloped cities, where income growth rate may be observed primarily in budget sectors and general income growth rate is low. In addition, real income of population grows faster, which is determined by constant production growth in innovation industries.

== Theoretical implications ==

The study and appraisal of urban environment, namely, the parameter of appeal for internal and external factors and consumers, is of value:
* For [[economic science]], from the point of view of developing a system of complex research and appraisal of the quality of Russian cities, making development plans  directed at comprehensive satisfaction of needs of population;
* For [[sociology]], determining the key factors of perception of the city as a whole and of its individual elements.
* For the development of management potential of municipal authorities in terms of balanced management of the system of [[urban infrastructure]].

== Practical implications of the rating ==

On November 21, 2012, in the [[Polytechnical Museum| Polytechnical Museum of Moscow]], the Russian Union of Engineers presented the General rating of appeal of Russian cities for 2011, which attracted much interest among the general public, [[Mass Media]] and local, regional and federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuGhTtAYQso&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Presentations of the General Rating of Russian Cities 2011|publisher=RUE|location=Moscow|date=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2013, the Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation, the [[Gosstroy|Federal Agency of Construction and Housing of the Russian Federation]], Russian Union of Engineers and the experts of [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] developed a rating and methodology of  evaluation of urban environment and analyzed 50 largest [[Russian cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minregion.ru/press_office/news/2939.html |title=The project of Russian cities appeal rating |publisher=The Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation |location=Moscow |date=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012003742/http://www.minregion.ru/press_office/news/2939.html |archivedate=2013-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mail.ru/politics/13168733/|title=The Ministry of Regional Development made a rating of appeal of Russian Cities |publisher=|location=Moscow|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/05/21/goroda-site.html|title=The most attractive cities of Russia are announced|publisher=Russian Newspaper|location=Moscow|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, the Union designed the methods of urban environment quality assessment and a city appeal threshold. 
The rating has been developed:

* by the order [[the President of the Russian Federation]] defined in paragraph 1 of Assignments No. Pr-534 of the President of the Russian Federation as of February 29, 2012, to executive bodies as a result of the meeting “On measures of implementation of the housing policy” as of February 14, 2012 
* by the order of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation defined in paragraph 4 of the List of assignments № VP-P9-1581  “On development of a methodology of assessment of urban environment quality and assessment of the major cities of Russia”  of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation as March 20, 2012.

==About==
'''Global Hands-On Universe''' is a worldwide project, with extensions over all the continents, the root project being GHOU. The project is based on observations, possibly acquired by the pupils themselves in classrooms thanks to a worldwide network of automatic telescopes operated via Internet or didactic tools ([[webcam]] system, radio telescope) developed within this project. These observations can be manipulated in classrooms with a specific software designed to be pupil-friendly. They are integrated into pedagogical resources constructed in a close collaborative work between researchers and teachers. The resources developed in the course of this project are posted on the Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv |eprint=astro-ph/0109372 |title=Hands-On Universe: A Global Program for Education and Public Outreach in Astronomy |author1= Boer |author2= Pack |author3= Pennypacker |author4= Melchior |author5= Faye |author6= Ebisuzaki |date= 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) launched in 2009 the Galileo Teacher Training Program (GTTP), a Cornerstone project of the [[International Year of Astronomy]] 2009. GHOU is a major component of GTTP.

GHOU, among which EU-HOU is the leading consortium, is now officially included in the Astronomy for the Developing World Strategic Plan 2010-20 of IAU, under Section 3.4.2 Astronomy for Children and Schools. During the next decade the IAU will concentrate more resources on education activities for children and schools designed to advance sustainable global development.

In [[Europe]], the EU-HOU project is led by Dr. Ferlet &amp; Dr A.-L. Melchior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2006IAUSS...2E...3F |title=Hands-on Universe - Europe|journal=IAU Special Session|volume=2|pages=3|author1=Ferlet|first1=R.|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; EU-HOU has been funded through the [[European Community]] (EC) program MINERVA (SOCRATES) for a two-year period (2004–2006), and through  the European Community (EC) program COMENIUS (LifeLong Learning Program) for two two-year periods (2008–2010, 2010-2012). EU-HOU has extended up to 15 EC countries, with national websites. The [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in [[Paris]] is the educational centre for the EU-HOU project. The EU-HOU project has developed numerous  (free) pedagogical resources tested in classrooms and posted on the project's [http://www.euhou.net website]. The most ambitious ones are: (1) the multilingual [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/salsaj-software-mainmenu-9 SalsaJ] software: it enables secondary school pupils to handle astronomical data and analyse them. An exercise series based on this software has been developed. Associated data can be downloaded directly from the software. (2) The EUHOUMW Small Radiotelescope Network developed in the framework of the Comenius project "Connecting classrooms to the Milky Way" enables secondary school pupils to access the instruments installed in five different European countries (France, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain). Kids can observe the hydrogen from the Milky Way with these 3-metres radiotelescopes. Every operation can be performed from the [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/ Web interface], available in 17 different languages, which enables the learners to reconstruct the rotation curve of the Milky Way as well as its spiral arms. Pedagogical resources (teacher's manual, [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/simu.php simulator of observation], [http://euhou.obspm.fr/public/archive.php archives], [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/exercises-mainmenu-13/radio/352-pedagogical-material kinesthetic activities]) have been tested in teacher's training, secondary school level and also at undergraduate level.

In [[United States|America]], the US HOU project&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 1996AAS...189.3004A |title=Hands-On Universe: Meaningful Astronomical Research in the Classroom |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|volume=28|pages=1311 |date=1996|author1=Asbell-Clarke |first1=J. |last2=Barclay |first2=T. |last3=Deustua |first3=S. |last4=Gordon |first4=S. |last5=Marshall |first5=A. |last6=Pennypacker |first6=C. |last7=Refling |first7=J. |last8=Hoette |first8=V. |last9=Lohman |first9=R. |last10=Morin |first10=T. |last11=Pack |first11=H. |last12=Rodriguez |first12=B. |last13=Spuck |first13=T. |last14=Toler |first14=D. }}&lt;/ref&gt; is led by the United States with support from the [[National Science Foundation]], the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]. In the USA, HOU has developed and pilot tested an educational program that enables high school students to request their own observations from professional observatories. Students download telescope images to their classroom computers and use the powerful HOU image processing software to visualize and analyze their  data. [[High school]] [[curriculum]] developed by HOU integrates many of the science and math topics and skills outlined in national standards into open-ended astronomical investigations. HOU has also developed activities and tools for middle school students and products for informal science education centers. The Lawrence Hall of Science at [[University of California, Berkeley]], is the educational center for the HOU project.

In [[Asia]], the AS-HOU section have China and Japan strongly involved. They have their own web sites.

In Africa, AF-HOU is now extending to Kenya&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |bibcode= 2008cosp...37.2272O |title=Hands-on Universe |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly|volume=37 |page=E2|id=PE2-0011-08|author1=Oduori |first1=Susan |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a recently launched pilot, researchbased astronomy and astrophysics curriculum into Kenya High in Nairobi, Kenya as a vehicle to introducing the methodologies of scientific research into secondary education.

== Teacher training sessions ==

In the context of the European Commission [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]], EU-HOU proposes regular European training sessions in France, at [[Pierre-and-Marie-Curie University]] in Paris, since 2010. These sessions are published on the Comenius training database (reference numbers: FR-2010-314-003, FR-2011-359-006, [http://ec.europa.eu/education/trainingdatabase/index.cfm?fuseaction=DisplayCourse&amp;cid=34183 FR-2013-408-003]).

The main goal of these training sessions is to re-awake the interest for science in the young generation with inquiry-based methods. Active methods based e.g. on kinesthesia ([[Proprioception]]) have been recently introduced to introduce modelling concepts. Renewing of the teaching of science is fulfilled through astronomy as a well-established source of motivation, and through the use of new Information and Communication Technologies - ICT. Involving teachers in a variety of research-based astronomical projects, they will get excited, enthused and motivated to teach science/technology/maths. '''The training is intended to enhance basic competencies of teachers and develop higher level skills and expertise, primarily in [[Information and communication technologies in education]] (ICT), maths and physics area'''.

These sessions are financed through European Commission Comenius national Agencies ([[Comenius programme]]). Information related to scheduled training sessions are posted on the [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/training-sessions-mainmenu-184 EU-HOU] Website and its [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/news-mainmenu-49 news].

A dedicated [http://www.euhou.net/index.php/forum/index forum]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} in English has been opened to favour feed-back from trained teachers and interaction with a wider educator and researcher community.

HISTORICAL LINGUISTICS: Mathematical concepts. In W. Bright (Ed.), International Encyclopedia of Linguistics&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|131}}

The idea was developed by [[Morris Swadesh]] under two assumptions: that there does, indeed, exist a relatively stable "basic vocabulary" (referred to as "[[Swadesh list]]s") in all languages of the world; and that any replacements happen in a way analogous to [[radioactive decay]], in constant percentages per time elapsed. Meanwhile, there exist many different methods, partly extensions of the Swadesh method, now more and more under the biological assumptions of replacements in genes. However, Swadesh's technique is so well known that, for many people, 'glottochronology' refers to it alone.&lt;ref name=Embleton/&gt;{{rp|133}}&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Hans J. (2007). The new Arboretum of Indo-European 'Trees'; Can new algorithms reveal the Phylogeny and even Prehistory of IE?. Journal of Quantitative Linguistics 14-2:167–214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==

===Word list===
The original method presumed that the core vocabulary of a language is replaced at a constant (or constant average) rate across all languages and cultures, and can therefore be used to measure the passage of time. The process makes use of a list of lexical terms. Lists were compiled by Morris Swadesh and assumed to be resistant against borrowing (originally designed in 1952 as a list of 200 items; however, the refined 100 word list in Swadesh (1955)&lt;ref name=swadesh1955&gt;Swadesh, Morris. (1955). Towards greater accuracy in lexicostatistic dating. ''International Journal of American Linguistics'', ''21'', 121&amp;ndash;137&lt;/ref&gt; is much more common among modern day linguists). This core vocabulary was designed to encompass concepts common to every human language (such as personal pronouns, body parts, heavenly bodies, verbs of basic actions, numerals 'one' and 'two', etc.), eliminating concepts that are specific to a particular culture or time. It has been found that this ideal is not in fact possible and that the meaning set may need to be tailored to the languages being compared.  Many alternative word lists have been compiled by other linguists, often using fewer meaning slots.

The percentage of [[cognate]]s (words that have a common origin) in these word lists is then measured.  The larger the percentage of cognates, the more recently the two languages being compared are presumed to have separated.

===Glottochronologic constant===
[[Robert Lees (linguist)|Robert Lees]] obtained a value for the "glottochronological constant" ('''r''') of words by considering the known changes in 13 pairs of languages using the 200 word list.  He obtained a value of 0.805&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;0.0176 with 90% confidence.  For the 100 word list Swadesh obtained a value of 0.86, the higher value reflecting the elimination of semantically unstable words.  This constant may be related to the retention rate of words by:-

:&lt;math&gt;L = 2\ln(r) &lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is the rate of replacement, ln is the logarithm to base e, and ''r'' is the glottochronological constant

===Divergence time===
The basic formula of glottochronology in its shortest form is:-

: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln(c)}{-L}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' = a given period of time from one stage of the language to another, ''c'' = proportion of wordlist items retained at the end of that period, and ''L'' = rate of replacement for that word list.

One can also therefore formulate that:

: &lt;math&gt; t = -\frac{\ln(c)}{2\ln(r)}&lt;/math&gt;

By testing historically verifiable cases where we have knowledge of ''t'' through non-linguistic data (e. g. the approximate distance from Classical Latin to modern Romance languages), Swadesh arrived at the empirical value of approximately 0.14 for ''L'' (meaning that the rate of replacement constitutes around 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium).

===Results===
Glottochronology was found to work in the case of Indo-European, accounting for 87% of the variance. It is also postulated to work for Hamito-Semitic (Fleming 1973), Chinese (Munro 1978) and Amerind (Stark 1973; Baumhoff and Olmsted 1963). For the latter, correlations have been obtained with radiocarbon dating and blood groups as well as archaeology.
Note that the approach of Gray and Atkinson,&lt;ref&gt;''Language-tree divergence times support the Anatolian theory of Indo-European origin, Russell D. Gray &amp; Quentin D. Atkinson, Nature 426, 435&amp;ndash;439'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; as they say, has nothing to do with "glottochronology".

==Discussion==
The concept of language change is old, and its history is reviewed in Hymes (1973) and Wells (1973).  Glottochronology itself dates back to the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name=swadesh1955/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swadesh, Morris (1972). What is glottochronology? In M. Swadesh, ''The origin and diversification of languages'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;271–284). London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lees, Robert. (1953). The basis of glottochronology. ''Language'', ''29'' (2), 113&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt;  An introduction to the subject is given in Embleton (1986)&lt;ref&gt;Embleton, Sheila M. (1986). ''Statistics in Historical Linguistics'' [Quantitative linguistics, vol. 30]. Bochum: Brockmeyer. {{ISBN|3-88339-537-4}}. &amp;ndash; State of the art up to then.
&lt;/ref&gt; and in McMahon and McMahon (2005).&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, April and McMahon, Robert (2005) ''Language Classification by Numbers.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press (in particular p. 95)&lt;/ref&gt;

Glottochronology has been controversial ever since, partly owing to issues of accuracy, as well as the question of whether its basis is sound (see e.g. Bergsland 1958; Bergsland and Vogt 1962; Fodor 1961; Chretien 1962; Guy 1980).  These concerns have been addressed by Dobson et al. (1972), Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973&gt;Dyen, Isidore, ed. (1973). ''Lexicostatistics in genetic linguistics: Proceedings of the Yale conference, April 3&amp;ndash;4, 1971''. La Haye: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kruskal, Dyen and Black (1973).&lt;ref name=kruskal1973&gt;Some Results From the Vocabulary Method of Reconstructing Language Trees, Joseph B. Kruskal, Isidore Dyen and Paul Black, Lexicostatistics in Genetic Linguistics, Isidore Dyen (editor), Mouton, The Hague, 1973, pp. 30-55&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of a single-word replacement rate can distort the divergence-time estimate when borrowed words are included (Thomason and Kaufman 1988). Chrétien purported to disprove the mathematics of the Swadesh-model. At a conference at Yale in 1971 his criticisms were shown to be invalid. See the published proceedings under Dyen (1973)&lt;ref name=dyen1973/&gt; The same conference saw the application of the theory to [[Creole language]] (Wittmann 1973).
An overview of recent arguments can be obtained from the papers of a conference held at the McDonald Institute in 2000.&lt;ref name=renfrew2002&gt;Renfrew, C., McMahon, A., &amp; L. Trask, Eds. (2000). Time Depth in Historical LInguistics. Cambridge, England: The McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research.
&lt;/ref&gt; These presentations vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by [[Sergei Starostin|Starostin]] discussed above.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}
Since its original inception, glottochronology has been rejected by many linguists, mostly Indo-Europeanists of the school of the traditional [[comparative method]]. Criticisms have been answered in particular around three points of discussion.

* Criticism levelled against the higher stability of lexemes in Swadesh lists alone (Haarmann 1990) misses the point, because a certain amount of losses only enables the computations (Sankoff 1970).
* Traditional glottochronology did presume that language changes at a stable rate.
:Thus, in Bergsland &amp; Vogt (1962), the authors make an impressive demonstration, on the basis of actual language data verifiable by extra-linguistic sources, that the "rate of change" for [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] constituted around 4% per millennium, whereas for closely connected [[Riksmal]] (Literary Norwegian) it would amount to as much as 20%. (Swadesh's proposed "constant rate" was supposed to be around 14% per millennium).
:This and several other similar examples effectively proved that Swadesh's formula would not work on all available material&amp;mdash;a serious accusation considering that evidence that can be used to "calibrate" the meaning of ''L'' (i. e. language history recorded during prolonged periods of time) is not overwhelmingly large in the first place.
:It is highly likely that the chance of replacement is in fact different for every word or feature ("each word has its own history", among hundreds of other sources:&lt;ref&gt;Kirk JM, St Anderson, &amp; JDA Widdowson, 1985 Studies in Linguistic Geography: The Dialects of English in Britain and Ireland. London: Croom Helm&lt;/ref&gt;).
:This global assumption has been modified and downgraded to single words even in single languages in many newer attempts (see below).
*A serious argument is that language change arises from socio-historical events which are of course unforeseeable and, therefore, uncomputable.
:New methods developed by Gray &amp; Atkinson are claimed to avoid these issues, but are still seen as controversial, primarily since they often produce results that are incompatible with known data and because of additional methodological issues.

==Modified==

Somewhere in between the original concept of Swadesh and the rejection of glottochronology in its entirety lies the idea that glottochronology as a formal method of linguistic analysis becomes valid with the help of several important modifications.  Thus, inhomogeneities in the replacement rate were dealt with by Van der Merwe (1966)&lt;ref&gt;van der Merwe, N. J. 1966 "New mathematics for glottochronology", Current Anthropology 7: 485&amp;ndash;500&lt;/ref&gt; by splitting the word list into classes each with their own rate, while Dyen, James and Cole (1967)&lt;ref&gt;Dyen, I., James, A. T., &amp; J. W. L. Cole 1967 "Language divergence and estimated word retention rate", &lt;Language 43: 150--171&lt;/ref&gt; allowed each meaning to have its own rate. Simultaneous estimation of divergence time and replacement rate was studied by Kruskal, Dyen and Black.&lt;ref name=kruskal1973/&gt;

Brainard (1970) allowed for chance cognation and drift effects was introduced by Gleason (1959). Sankoff (1973) suggested introducing a borrowing parameter and allowed synonyms.

A combination of these various improvements is given in Sankoff's "Fully Parameterised Lexicostatistics".  In 1972 Sankoff in a biological context developed a model of genetic divergence of populations. Embleton (1981) derives a simplified version of this in a linguistic context. She carries out a number of simulations using this which are shown to give good results.

Improvements in statistical methodology related to a completely different branch of science &amp;ndash; [[Phylogenetics|changes in DNA over time]] &amp;ndash; have sparked a recent renewed interest. These methods are more robust than the earlier ones because they calibrate points on the tree with known historical events and smooth the rates of change across these. As such, they no longer require the assumption of a constant rate of change ([http://language.psy.auckland.ac.nz/publications/index.php?pub=Gray_and_Atkinson2003Nature Gray &amp; Atkinson 2003]).

===Starostin's method===

Another attempt to introduce such modifications was performed by the Russian linguist [[Sergei Starostin]], who had proposed that

* systematic [[loanword]]s, borrowed from one language into another, are a disruptive factor and have to be eliminated from the calculations; the one thing that really matters is the "native" replacement of items by items from the same language. The failure to notice this factor was a major reason in Swadesh's original estimation of the replacement rate at under 14 words from the 100-wordlist per millennium, when the real rate is, in fact, much slower (around 5 or 6). Introducing this correction effectively cancels out the "Bergsland &amp; Vogt" argument, since a thorough analysis of the Riksmal data shows that its basic wordlist includes about 15&amp;ndash;16 borrowings from other Germanic languages (mostly [[Danish language|Danish]]) &amp;ndash; exclusion of these elements from the calculations brings the rate down to the expected rate of 5&amp;ndash;6 "native" replacements per millennium;
* the rate of change is not really constant, but actually depends on the time period during which the word has existed in the language (i. e. chances of lexeme X being replaced by lexeme Y increase in direct proportion to the time elapsed – the so-called "aging of words", empirically understood as gradual "erosion" of the word's primary meaning under the weight of acquired secondary ones);
* individual items on the 100 wordlist have different stability rates (for instance, the word "I" generally has a much lower chance of being replaced than the word "yellow", etc.).

The resulting formula, taking into account both the time dependence and the individual stability quotients, looks as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;t = \sqrt \frac{\ln(c)}{-Lc}&lt;/math&gt;

In this formula, &amp;minus;''Lc'' reflects the gradual slowing down of the replacement process due to different individual rates (the less stable elements are the first and the quickest to be replaced), whereas the square root represents the reverse trend &amp;ndash; acceleration of replacement as items in the original wordlist "age" and become more prone to shifting their meaning. The formula is obviously more complicated than Swadesh's original one, but, as shown in Starostin's work, yields more credible results than the former (and more or less agrees with all the cases of language separation that can be confirmed by historical knowledge). On the other hand, it shows that glottochronology can really only be used as a serious scientific tool on language families the historical phonology of which has been meticulously elaborated (at least to the point of being able to clearly distinguish between cognates and loanwords).

===Time-depth estimation===
The McDonald Institute hosted a conference on the issue of time-depth estimation in 2000.  The published papers&lt;ref name=renfrew2002/&gt; give an idea of the views on glottochronology at that time.  These vary from "Why linguists don't do dates" to the one by Starostin discussed above. Note that in the referenced Gray and Atkinson paper, they hold that their methods can not be called "glottochronology", by confining this term to its original method.

'''Growth management''', in the United States, is a set of techniques used by the government to ensure that as the population grows that there are services available to meet their demands.  These are not necessarily only government services.  Other demands such as the protection of natural spaces, sufficient and affordable housing, delivery of utilities, preservation of buildings and places of historical value, and sufficient places for the conduct of business are also considered.

One technique is the imposition of [[impact fee]]s.  Impact fees are imposed to charge the owners of newly developed properties for the "impact" the new development will have on the community.  Fees can be used for such things as transportation improvements, new parks, and expansion of schools.  Impact fees are not used to maintain existing facilities, but instead, are used to create new facilities in proportion to the number of new developments in the area.

Another technique is the application of [[zoning]] to reduce the cost of service delivery.  Zoning can be used to reduce the area affected by urbanization, allowing the same number of people to live and work in a smaller area, allowing governmental services to be delivered more efficiently.  For example, fire protection and emergency medical response services are less expensive to provide in compact areas than in areas where the population is more spread out.  This results in lower expenditures for the same [[level of service]], which saves taxpayer dollars.  The efficiencies gained can also result in benefits to the private sector.  For example, grocery stores and [[pizza delivery]] businesses can serve only a limited area.  If more customers are located within their service delivery area, the cost of delivering their services is decreased.

Preventing suburban densities from affecting a large area also has the effect of providing open spaces so that people who wish to live in a rural setting can do so without [[urbanization]] threatening their lifestyle.

The application of growth management techniques is often governed by the development of a [[comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]].  The plan can be used to measure the impact that new growth will have on the community and define the method by which that impact is mitigated.

Pioneers in United States growth management were Oregon, which established [[Urban Growth Boundary|Urban Growth Boundaries]] in the 1970s and Florida which passed the Growth Management Act in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608160141/http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/florida-lawmakers-wipe-out-30-years-of-growth-management-law/1168328 |archive-date=2015-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2563">'''Haplography''' (from Greek: haplo- 'single' + -graphy 'writing'), also known as '''lipography''', is a [[scribal error|scribal]] or [[typographical error]] where a letter or group of letters that should be written twice is written once. It is not to be confused with [[haplology]], where a phoneme is omitted to prevent two similar sounds from occurring consecutively: the former is a textual error, while the latter is a phonological process. 

In English, a common haplographical mistake is the rendering of consecutive letters between morphemes as a single letter. Many [[commonly misspelled words]] have this form. For example, ''misspell'' is often misspelled as ''mispell''. The etymology of the word misspell is the affix "mis-" plus the root "spell", their bound morpheme has two consecutive s's, one of which is often erroneously omitted. The opposite of haplography is [[dittography]]. 

Other examples of words liable to be written haplographically in different languages are: German ''rollladen'' ("shutters", from ''roll'' + ''laden'') which requires an uncommon sequence of three ''l''-s and is often spelt ''rolladen'', or Arabic ''takyīf'' تكييف ("air conditioning"), which would require a sequence of two semivowels ''y'' (one as a true semivowel, and another as a device to mark long ''ī'') and is often spelt as ''takīf'' تكيف, with only one.

The term ''haplography'' is commonly used in the field of [[textual criticism]] to refer to the phenomenon of a scribe's, copyist's or translator's inadvertently skipping from one word or phrase to a similar word or phrase further on in the text, and omitting everything in between.&lt;ref&gt;This usage can be seen at {{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fnBj3_hJOXIC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first1=David Noel |last1=Freedman |first2=Shawna Dolansky |last2=Overton |chapter=Omitting the omissions: the case for haplography in the transmission of the biblical texts |title="Imagining" Biblical Worlds: studies in spatial, social and historical constructs in honor of James W.

In mass communication, the '''Hierarchy of Influences''', formally known as the '''Hierarchical Influences Model''', is an organized theoretical framework introduced by [[Pamela Shoemaker]] &amp; Stephen D. Reese. It comprises five levels of influence on media content from the macro to micro levels: social systems, social institutions, media organizations, routine practices, and individuals. This framework was introduced in their book ''Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content''.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (1996). Mediating the Message: Theories of Influences on Mass Media Content, 2nd edn, White Plains, NY: Longman.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five levels of Hierarchy of Influences ==

The framework was proposed for use in media effects research of media content. Based on media sociology and psychological studies perspective, the framework "takes into account the multiple forces that simultaneously impinge on media and suggests how influence at one level may interact with that at another."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas most media effects study treat media content as independent variable to understand how audience use media content and how they are influenced by media content, "Hierarchy of Influences" framework treats media content as dependent variable and five levels of influences as potential independent variables.

Overall, the framework provides a way to understand the "media and their links with culture, other organizations, and institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social systems ===

The macro social systems level is the outer-most ring of the model that represent the influences from social systems as a whole. This level focus on how ideological forces shape and influence media content. For this reason, it is often employed in cross-national comparative media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge..&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social institutions ===

Social institutional level describes influences coming from larger trans-organizational media field. How media organizations combine into larger institutions that become part of larger structured relationships that compete or depend on each other as powerful social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media organizations ===

Media organization level is distinguished from routines as this level describes larger organizational and occupational context such as organizational policy, occupational roles, and how the media enterprise  itself is structured.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Routine practices ===

The routines level has three sources of routines, which constrain and enable communicators in their work process: audiences, organizations, and suppliers of content. Journalists have developed routines from endless pattern of norms in response to common situations. This level is where Mr. Gates or [[gatekeeping (communication)]] theory is also applied in journalists' appearance

=== Individuals ===

The micro individual level is located at the center of the model. On this level, individual communicator's characteristics, on both personal and professional, influence media content. Individual's innate characteristics such as gender, race, religious and political background influence media content indirectly through shaping personal attitude and values (e.g. ethical values) as well as professional roles and education.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, Pamela and Reese, Stephen (2014). Mediating the Message in the 21st Century, 3rd edn, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==

Hierarchy of influences model has been employed as theoretical framework to explain different levels of influences on media content. Researchers have studied professionalism, journalistic roles,&lt;ref&gt;Reese, S. (2001). Understanding the global journalist: A hierarchy-of-influences approach. Journalism Studies, 2(2), 173-187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2007). Deconstructing journalism culture: Toward a universal theory. Communication Theory, 17, 367-385.&lt;/ref&gt; cross-national comparative journalistic roles,&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2006). Worlds of journalisms. Retrieved March 6, 2016, from http://www.worldsofjournalism.org&lt;/ref&gt; comparative media studies, and understanding news production to name a few of closely studies areas.

Thomas Hanitzsch took a similar approach to hierarchy of influences model in examining different levels of influences on journalists' reporting process in his ''Worlds of Journalism'' study.&lt;ref&gt;Hanitzsch, T. (2006). Worlds of journalisms. Retrieved March 6, 2016, from http://www.worldsofjournalism.org&lt;/ref&gt; This study conducted interviews in 21 countries focusing on differences in [[journalism culture]], influences and trust in public institutions.

'''ITER''' (''International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor'') is an international [[nuclear fusion]] research and engineering [[megaproject]], which will be the world's largest magnetic confinement [[plasma physics]] experiment. It is an experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] that is being built next to the [[Cadarache]] facility in [[Saint-Paul-lès-Durance]], in [[Provence]], southern France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060824071609/http://www.efda.org/the_iter_project/index.htm The ITER project]. EFDA, European Fusion Development Agreement (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

ITER was proposed in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/21/068/21068957.pdf |title=NCL Collection Store |date= |website=www.iaea.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designed as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, according to the "ITER Technical Basis," published by the International Atomic Energy Agency, in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www-pub.iaea.org/books/IAEABooks/6492/ITER-Technical-Basis|title=ITER Technical Basis|first=|last=IAEA|date=12 September 2018|publisher=|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, the ITER organization abandoned the original meaning of the acronym ''iter'', and instead adopted a new meaning, the Latin word for "the way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org:80/index.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050205034858/http://www.iter.org:80/index.htm|archivedate=2005-02-05|title=Wayback Machine|date=5 February 2005|others=Under "What is ITER?"|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ITER [[thermonuclear fusion]] reactor has been designed to produce a fusion plasma equivalent to 500 megawatts (MW) of thermal output power for around twenty minutes while 50 megawatts of thermal power are injected into the tokamak, resulting in a [[Fusion power#Q|ten-fold gain of plasma heating power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts &amp; Figures|url=https://www.iter.org/factsfigures|website=ITER|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more thermal power from the fusion process than is used to heat the plasma, something that has not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor. 
The total electricity consumed by the reactor and facilities will range from 110 MW up to 620 MW peak for 30-second periods during plasma operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power Supply|url=https://www.iter.org/mach/powersupply|website=ITER|accessdate=25 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thermal-to-electric conversion is not included in the design because ITER will not produce sufficient power for net electrical production. The emitted heat from the fusion reaction will be vented to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="jt60sa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jt60sa.org/b/FAQ/EE2.htm|title=Will ITER make more energy than it consumes?|website=www.jt60sa.org|accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iea.org/media/workshops/2016/fpccwebinar/Item_6_EUROPE.pdf |title=Workshop |date=2016 |website=www.iaea.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project is funded and run by seven member entities—the [[European Union]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]]. The EU, as host party for the ITER complex, is contributing about 45 percent of the cost, with the other six parties contributing approximately 9 percent each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |date=14 October 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11541383 |title=Key component contract for Iter fusion reactor |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/understandingfusion/ourcontribution.aspx ITER – Our Contribution].

==Background==
[[Image:Deuterium-tritium fusion.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|ITER will produce energy by fusing deuterium and tritium to helium.]]
Fusion power has the potential to provide sufficient energy to satisfy mounting demand, and to do so sustainably, with a relatively small impact on the environment.

Nuclear fusion has many potential attractions. Firstly, its [[hydrogen isotope]] fuels are relatively abundant – one of the necessary isotopes, [[deuterium]], can be extracted from [[seawater]], while the other fuel, [[tritium]], would be bred from a lithium blanket using neutrons produced in the fusion reaction itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iter.org/sci/fusionfuels "Fusion fuels"].

Retrieved 24 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a fusion reactor would produce virtually no [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] or atmospheric pollutants, and its [[nuclear waste|radioactive waste products]] would mostly be very short-lived compared to those produced by conventional nuclear reactors.

On 21 November 2006, the seven [[ITER#Participants|participants]] formally agreed to fund the creation of a nuclear fusion reactor.&lt;ref name=ns20061121&gt;{{cite web |title= Green light for nuclear fusion project |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10633-green-light-for-nuclear-fusion-project.html |date=21 November 2006 |website=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is anticipated to last for 30 years – 10 for construction, and 20 of operation. ITER was originally expected to cost approximately €5 billion, but the rising price of raw materials and changes to the initial design have seen that amount almost triple to €13 billion.&lt;ref name="ITER Organisation 2015"/&gt; The reactor is expected to take 10 years to build with completion scheduled for 2019.&lt;ref name=doub&gt;McGrath, Matt.

When supplied with 300 MW of electrical power, ITER is expected to produce the equivalent of 500 [[Megawatt|MW]] of thermal power sustained for up to 1,000 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100310021211/http://www.iter.org/mach/Pages/Tokamak.aspx ITER – The World's Largest Tokamak]. iter.org&lt;/ref&gt; This compares to [[Joint European Torus|JET]]'s consumption of 700 MW of electrical power and peak thermal output of 16 MW for less than a second) by the fusion of about 0.5 g of [[deuterium]]/[[tritium]] mixture in its approximately 840 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; reactor chamber. The heat produced in ITER will not be used to generate any electricity because after accounting for losses and the 300 MW minimum power input, the 
output will be equivalent to a zero (net) power reactor.&lt;ref name="jt60sa.org"/&gt;

Preparations for the first [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Gorbachev-Reagan Summit]] showed that there were no tangible agreements in the works for the summit.

One energy research project, however, was being considered quietly by two physicists, [[Alvin Trivelpiece]] and [[Evgeny Velikhov]]. The project involved collaboration on the next phase of magnetic fusion research — the construction of a demonstration model. At the time, magnetic fusion research was ongoing in Japan, Europe, the Soviet Union and the US. Velikhov and Trivelpiece believed that taking the next step in fusion research would be beyond the budget of any of the key nations and that collaboration would be useful internationally.

A major bureaucratic fight erupted in the US government over the project. One argument against collaboration was that the Soviets would use it to steal US technology and know-how. A second was symbolic — the Soviet physicist [[Andrei Sakharov]] was in internal exile and the US was pushing the Soviet Union on its human rights record. The [[United States National Security Council]] convened a meeting under the direction of [[William Flynn Martin]] that resulted in a consensus that the US should go forward with the project.

Martin and Velikhov concluded the agreement that was agreed at the summit and announced in the last paragraph of this historic summit meeting, "... The two leaders emphasized the potential importance of the work aimed at utilizing controlled thermonuclear fusion for peaceful purposes and, in this connection, advocated the widest practicable development of international cooperation in obtaining this source of energy, which is essentially inexhaustible, for the benefit for all mankind."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/112185a.htm Joint Soviet-United States Statement on the Summit Meeting in Geneva] Ronald Reagan. November 21, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Conceptual and engineering design phases carried out under the auspices of the [[IAEA]] led to an acceptable, detailed design in 2001, underpinned by US$650 million worth of research and development by the "ITER Parties" to establish its practical feasibility.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} These parties, namely [[European Union|EU]], Japan, [[Russian Federation]] (replacing the Soviet Union), and United States (which opted out of the project in 1999 and returned in 2003), were joined in negotiations by China, [[South Korea]], and Canada (who then terminated its participation at the end of 2003). India officially became part of ITER in December 2005.

On 28 June 2005, it was officially announced that ITER would be built in the [[European Union]] in Southern France. The negotiations that led to the decision ended in a compromise between the EU and Japan, in that Japan was promised 20% of the research staff on the French location of ITER, as well as the head of the administrative body of ITER. In addition, another research facility for the project will be built in Japan, and the European Union has agreed to contribute about 50% of the costs of this institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050823033756/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200506280351.html Japan cedes ITER project to France]. The Asahi Shimbun, 29 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2006, an international consortium signed a formal agreement to build the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6165932.stm |title=States sign nuclear energy pact |publisher=BBC News | date=21 November 2006 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 September 2007, the People's Republic of China became the seventh party to deposit the ITER Agreement to the [[IAEA]]. Finally, on 24 October 2007, the ITER Agreement entered into force and the ITER Organization legally came into existence.

==Objectives==

ITER's mission is to demonstrate the feasibility of fusion power, and prove that it can work without negative impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why ITER? |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/Pages/ITERMission.aspx |website=The ITER Organization|accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the project aims to:
* Momentarily produce a fusion plasma with thermal power ten times greater than the injected thermal power (a [[Fusion energy gain factor|''Q'' value]] of 10).
* Produce a steady-state plasma with a [[Fusion energy gain factor|''Q'' value]] greater than 5. (''Q'' = 1 is scientific breakeven.)
* Maintain a fusion pulse for up to 8 minutes.
* Develop technologies and processes needed for a fusion power station — including [[superconducting magnet]]s and [[remote handling]] (maintenance by robot).
* Verify [[tritium]] breeding concepts.
* Refine neutron shield/heat conversion technology (most of the energy in the D+T fusion reaction is released in the form of fast neutrons).

In 1978, the [[European Commission]], [[Japan]], [[United States]], and [[USSR]] joined in the International Tokamak Reactor (INTOR) Workshop, under the auspices of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), to assess the readiness of magnetic fusion to move forward to the experimental power reactor (EPR) stage, to identify the additional [[R&amp;D]] that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the then present status of the [[tokamak]] confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R&amp;D by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.

In 1985, at the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva summit meeting in 1985]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] suggested to [[Ronald Reagan]] that the two countries jointly undertake the construction of a tokamak EPR as proposed by the INTOR Workshop. The ITER project was initiated in 1988.&lt;ref name="Fusion Energy Reactor 2010"&gt;''"Quest for a Fusion Energy Reactor: An Insider's Account of the INTOR Workshop"'', Oxford University Press (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Milestones2012&gt;{{cite web |title= The Geneva Summit |url=http://www.iter.org/proj/itermilestones |website=Milestones in the History of the ITER Project |publisher=ITER |date=November 1985 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactor overview==
{{See also|Nuclear fusion}}

When [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuse, two [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] come together to form a [[helium]] nucleus (an [[alpha particle]]), and a high-energy [[neutron]].
:{{nuclide|Deuterium}} + {{nuclide|Tritium}} → {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{val|17.59|ul=MeV}}
While nearly all stable [[isotopes]] lighter on the [[periodic table]] than [[iron-56]] and [[nickel-62]], which have the highest [[nuclear binding energy|binding energy per nucleon]], will fuse with some other isotope and release energy, deuterium and tritium are by far the most attractive for energy generation as they require the lowest activation energy (thus lowest temperature) to do so, while producing among the most energy per unit weight.

All proto- and mid-life stars radiate enormous amounts of energy generated by fusion processes. Mass for mass, the deuterium–tritium fusion process releases roughly three times as much energy as uranium-235 fission, and millions of times more energy than a chemical reaction such as the burning of coal. It is the goal of a fusion power station to harness this energy to produce electricity.

Activation energies for fusion reactions are generally high because the [[proton]]s in each nucleus will tend to strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive [[Elementary charge|charge]]. A [[heuristic]] for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei must be able to get within 100 [[femtometers]] (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo [[quantum tunneling]] past the [[electrostatic]] barrier and the turning point where the [[Nuclear force|strong nuclear force]] and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.
High [[temperatures]] give the nuclei enough energy to overcome their [[electrostatic repulsion]] (see [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]]). For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures on the order of 100,000,000 [[kelvin|K]]. The plasma is heated to a high temperature by [[ohmic heating]] (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injection]] (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and [[radio frequency]] (RF) or [[microwave]] heating.

At such high temperatures, particles have a large [[kinetic energy]], and hence velocity. If unconfined, the particles will rapidly escape, taking the energy with them, cooling the plasma to the point where net energy is no longer produced. A successful reactor would need to contain the particles in a small enough volume for a long enough time for much of the plasma to fuse.
In ITER and many other [[magnetic confinement]] reactors, the plasma, a gas of charged particles, is confined using magnetic fields. A charged particle moving through a [[magnetic field]] experiences a force perpendicular to the direction of travel, resulting in [[centripetal acceleration]], thereby confining it to move in a circle or helix around the lines of magnetic flux.

A solid confinement vessel is also needed, both to shield the magnets and other equipment from high temperatures and energetic photons and particles, and to maintain a near-vacuum for the plasma to populate.
The containment vessel is subjected to a barrage of very energetic particles, where electrons, ions, photons, alpha particles, and neutrons constantly bombard it and degrade the structure. The material must be designed to endure this environment so that a power station would be economical. Tests of such materials will be carried out both at ITER and at [[IFMIF]] (International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility).

Once fusion has begun, high [[energy]] neutrons will radiate from the reactive regions of the plasma, crossing magnetic field lines easily due to charge neutrality (see [[neutron flux]]). Since it is the neutrons that receive the majority of the energy, they will be ITER's primary source of energy output. Ideally, alpha particles will expend their energy in the plasma, further heating it.

Beyond the inner wall of the containment vessel one of several test blanket modules will be placed. These are designed to slow and absorb neutrons in a reliable and efficient manner, limiting damage to the rest of the structure, and breeding tritium for fuel from lithium-bearing ceramic pebbles contained within the blanket module following the following reactions:

:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|6}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}}
:{{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}} + {{nuclide|Lithium|7}} → {{nuclide|Tritium}} + {{nuclide|Helium}} + {{SubatomicParticle|10neutron}}

where the reactant neutron is supplied by the D-T fusion reaction.

Energy absorbed from the fast neutrons is extracted and passed into the primary coolant. This heat energy would then be used to power an electricity-generating turbine in a real power station; in ITER this generating system is not of scientific interest, so instead the heat will be extracted and disposed of.

==Technical design==
{{wide image|ITER Tokamak and Plant Systems (2016) (41783636452).jpg|1200px|alt=Drawing of the ITER tokamak and integrated plant systems|Drawing of the ITER tokamak and integrated plant systems}}

===Vacuum vessel===
[[Image:NIST Light Source Illuminates Fusion Power Diagnostics (5940503177).jpg|thumb|Cross-section of part of the planned ITER fusion reaction vessel.]]
The vacuum vessel is the central part of the ITER machine: a double walled steel container in which the plasma is contained by means of magnetic fields.

The ITER vacuum vessel will be twice as large and 16 times as heavy as any previously manufactured fusion vessel: each of the nine [[torus|torus shaped]] sectors will weigh between 390 and 430 tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fusionforenergy.europa.eu/documents/iter_calls/26.pdf ITER Vacuum Vessel Assembly – Call for Expression of Interest]. ITER. 20 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When all the shielding and port structures are included, this adds up to a total of 5,116 tonnes. Its external diameter will measure {{convert|19.4|m}}, the internal {{convert|6.5|m}}. Once assembled, the whole structure will be {{convert|11.3|m}} high.

The primary function of the vacuum vessel is to provide a hermetically sealed plasma container. Its main components are the main vessel, the port structures and the supporting system. The main vessel is a double walled structure with poloidal and toroidal stiffening ribs between {{convert|60|mm|in|adj=mid|-thick}} shells to reinforce the vessel structure. These ribs also form the flow passages for the cooling water. The space between the double walls will be filled with shield structures made of stainless steel. The inner surfaces of the vessel will act as the interface with breeder modules containing the breeder blanket component. These modules will provide shielding from the high-energy neutrons produced by the fusion reactions and some will also be used for tritium breeding concepts.

The vacuum vessel has 18 upper, 17 equatorial and 9 lower ports that will be used for remote handling operations, diagnostic systems, neutral beam injections and vacuum pumping.

===Breeder blanket===
Owing to very limited terrestrial resources of [[tritium]], a key component of the ITER reactor design is the breeder blanket. This component, located adjacent to the vacuum vessel, serves to produce tritium through reaction with neutrons from the plasma. There are several reactions that produce tritium within the blanket. {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Lithium|6}} produces tritium via n,t reactions with moderated neutrons, {{SimpleNuclide2|link=yes|Lithium|7}} produces tritium via interactions with higher energy neutrons via n,nt reactions. Concepts for the breeder blanket include helium cooled lithium lead (HCLL) and helium cooled pebble bed (HCPB) methods. Six different Test Blanket Modules (TBM) will be tested in ITER and will share a common box geometry. Materials for use as breeder pebbles in the HCPB concept include [[Lithium titanate|lithium metatitanate]] and lithium orthosilicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hanaor| first1=D.A.H.| last2=Kolb| first2=M.H.H.| last3=Gan| first3=Y.| last4=Kamlah| first4=M.| last5=Knitter| first5=R.| title= Solution based synthesis of mixed-phase materials in the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;TiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-Li&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; system | journal= Journal of Nuclear Materials|year=2014| volume=456| pages=151–161| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022311514006187| doi=10.1016/j.jnucmat.2014.09.028|arxiv = 1410.7128 |bibcode = 2015JNuM..456..151H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements of breeder materials include good tritium production and extraction, mechanical stability and low activation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Gan| first1=Y| last2=Hernandez|first2=F|display-authors=etal |title=Thermal Discrete Element Analysis of EU Solid Breeder Blanket Subjected to Neutron Irradiation| journal= Fusion Science and Technology|year=2014| volume=66|issue=1| pages=83–90 | arxiv=1406.4199| doi=10.13182/FST13-727| citeseerx=10.1.1.748.6005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnet system===
The central [[solenoid]] coil will use [[superconducting]] [[niobium-tin]] to carry 46 [[Ampere|kA]] and produce a field of up to 13.5 [[Tesla (unit)|teslas]].
The 18 [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] field coils will also use niobium-tin. At their maximum field strength of 11.8 teslas, they will be able to store 41 [[gigajoule]]s. They have been tested at a record 80 kA. Other lower field ITER magnets (PF and CC) will use [[niobium-titanium]] for their superconducting elements. As of now the in-wall shielding blocks to protect the magnets from high energy neutrons are being manufactured and transported from the Avasarala technologies in Bangalore India to the ITER center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/whatsnew/print/2016/03/21 |title=What's news |date=2016 |website=www.iter.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional heating===
There will be three types of external heating in ITER: 
* Two Heating [[Neutral-beam injectors|Neutral Beam injectors]] (HNB), each providing about 17MW to the burning plasma, with the possibility to add a third one. The requirements in terms of deuterium beam energy (1MeV), total current (40A) and beam pulse duration (up to 1h).{{clarify|date=December 2018}} The prototype is being built at the [[ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility|Neutral Beam Test Facility]] (NBTF),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.igi.cnr.it/www/sites/default/files/home201511/SchedaNBTF_MIUR_EN.pdf]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being constructed in [[Padua]], Italy.
* Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH)
* Electron Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ECRH)

===Cryostat===
The cryostat is a large 3,800-tonne stainless steel structure surrounding the vacuum vessel and the superconducting magnets, in order to provide a super-cool vacuum environment. Its thickness ranging from {{convert|50|to|250|mm|in}} will allow it to withstand the atmospheric pressure on the area of a volume of 8,500 cubic meters. The total of 54 modules of the cryostat will be engineered, procured, manufactured, and installed by [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] Heavy Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title= Larsen &amp; Toubro Ltd will manufacture ITER Cryostat |url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/235/1287 |date=3 September 2012 |accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Cooling systems===
The ITER tokamak will use three interconnected cooling systems. Most of the heat will be removed by a primary water cooling loop, itself cooled by water through a heat exchanger within the tokamak building's secondary confinement. The secondary cooling loop will be cooled by a larger complex, comprising a cooling tower, a {{cvt|5|km}} pipeline supplying water from [[Canal de Provence]], and basins that allow cooling water to be cooled and tested for chemical contamination and [[tritium]] before being released into the [[Durance River]]. This system will need to dissipate an average power of {{val|450|u=MW}} during the tokamak's operation. A [[liquid nitrogen]] system will provide a further {{val|1300|u=kW}} of cooling to {{convert|80|K|lk=in}}, and a [[liquid helium]] system will provide {{val|75|u=kW}} of cooling to {{convert|4.5|K}}. The liquid helium system will be designed, manufactured, installed and commissioned by [[Air Liquide]].&lt;ref name=Cryogenics&gt;{{cite web |title= World's largest cryogenic plant to be installed in ITER fusion reactor |url=http://www.scienceworldreport.com/articles/4344/20121228/largest-cryogenic-helium-plant-iter-fusion-reactor-tokamak.htm |publisher=Science World Report |date=December 2012 |accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iter.org/newsline/251/1431|title=EUR 83 million contract signed for Liquid Helium Plant|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Cadarache (red dot) CIA World Factbook map.png|thumb|Location of [[Cadarache]] in France]]

The process of selecting a location for ITER was long and drawn out. The most likely sites were Cadarache in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]], France, and [[Rokkasho, Aomori|Rokkasho]], [[Aomori Prefecture|Aomori]], Japan. Additionally, Canada announced a bid for the site in [[Clarington]] in May 2001, but withdrew from the race in 2003. Spain also offered a site at [[Vandellòs i l'Hospitalet de l'Infant|Vandellòs]] on 17 April 2002, but the EU decided to concentrate its support solely behind the French site in late November 2003. From this point on, the choice was between France and Japan. On 3 May 2005, the EU and Japan agreed to a process which would settle their dispute by July.

At the final meeting in Moscow on 28 June 2005, the participating parties agreed to construct ITER at [[Cadarache]] in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]], France. Construction of the ITER complex began in 2007, while assembly of the tokamak itself was scheduled to begin in 2015.&lt;ref name=iter/&gt;

[[Fusion for Energy]], the [[European Union|EU]] agency in charge of the European contribution to the project, is located in [[Barcelona]], Spain. Fusion for Energy (F4E) is the European Union's Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy. According to the agency's website: &lt;blockquote&gt;F4E is responsible for providing Europe's contribution to ITER, the world's largest scientific partnership that aims to demonstrate fusion as a viable and sustainable source of energy. [...] F4E also supports fusion research and development initiatives [...]&lt;ref&gt;[http://fusionforenergy.europa.eu/aboutfusion/ The EU's Fusion for Energy website].

The [[ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility]] aimed at developing and optimizing the neutral beam injector prototype, is being constructed in [[Padova]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igi.cnr.it The Consorzio RFX website], where the ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility is host&lt;/ref&gt; It will be the only ITER facility out of the site in Cadarache.

==Participants==
[[File:ITER participants.svg|thumb|Thirty-five countries participate in the ITER project.]]

Currently there are seven parties participating in the ITER program: the [[European Union]] (through the legally distinct organisation [[Euratom]]), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=iter/&gt; Canada was previously a full member, but has since pulled out due to a lack of funding from the federal government. The lack of funding also resulted in Canada withdrawing from its bid for the ITER site in 2003. The host member of the ITER project, and hence the member contributing most of the costs, is the EU.

In 2007, it was announced that participants in the ITER will consider [[Kazakhstan]]'s offer to join the program&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.energy-daily.com/reports/Kazakhstan_Offers_To_Join_International_Fusion_Power_Project_999.html|title = Kazakhstan Offers To Join International Fusion Power Project| agency = RIA Novosti|accessdate=14 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2009, Switzerland, an associate member of Euratom since 1979, also ratified the country's accession to the European Domestic Agency [[Fusion for Energy]] as a third country member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iter.org/newsline/83/531

The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom announced on 20 March 2017 that the UK will be withdrawing from Euratom and future involvement in the project is unclear. The future of the [[Joint European Torus]] project, which is located in the UK, is also not certain. Some type of associate membership in Euratom is considered a likely scenario, possibly similar to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2114690-brexit-puts-europes-nuclear-fusion-future-in-doubt/ |title=Brexit puts Europe's nuclear fusion future in doubt |date=30 Nov 2016 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.euro-fusion.org/2016/06/eurofusion-and-uk-after-brexit/ |title=EuroFusion and UK after Brexit |date=24 Jun 2016 |publisher=EuroFusion |accessdate=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ITER announced a partnership with Australia for "technical cooperation in areas of mutual benefit and interest", but without Australia becoming a full member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iter.org/newsline/-/2546 |title=Welcome Australia! |date=16 Oct 2016 |publisher=iter.org |accessdate=17 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ITER's work is supervised by the ITER Council, which has the authority to appoint senior staff, amend regulations, decide on budgeting issues, and allow additional states or organizations to participate in ITER.&lt;ref name="ITER Council"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iter.org/org/Pages/Council.aspx |title=ITER Council, ITER's top authority |publisher=ITER.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Chairman of the ITER Council is Won Namkung,&lt;ref name="Press Release, 10th ITER Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iter.org/doc/www/content/com/Lists/list_items/Attachments/654/2016_01_Council_Chair.pdf|title=Won Namkung takes helm of the ITER Council|date=12 January 2016|publisher=ITER.org|access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ITER Director-General is [[Bernard Bigot]].

==Funding==

As of 2016, the total price of constructing the experiment is expected to be in excess of €20 billion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-15/world-s-biggest-science-experiment-seeks-more-time-and-money|title=World's Biggest Science Experiment Seeks More Time and Money|last=Tirone|first=Jonathan|website=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of €4.6 billion of its 2010 estimate,&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10614542 EU member states agree on Iter funding shortfall"], BBC, 13 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and of €9.6 billion from the 2009 estimate.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8103557.stm Fusion falters under soaring costs"], BBC, 17 June 2009 (accessed 18 June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, the proposed costs for ITER were €5 billion for the construction and €5 billion for maintenance and the research connected with it during its 35-year lifetime. At the June 2005 conference in Moscow the participating members of the ITER cooperation agreed on the following division of funding contributions: 45% by the hosting member, the European Union, and the rest split between the non-hosting members – China, India, Japan, South Korea, the Russian Federation and the USA. During the operation and deactivation phases, Euratom will contribute to 34% of the total costs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120713083340/http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/10/165&amp;format=H ITER &amp; Fusion Research press release]. Europa (web portal), 5 May 2011. Retrieved 19 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Japan's financial contribution as a non-hosting member is one-eleventh of the total, the EU agreed to grant it a special status so that Japan will provide for two-elevenths of the research staff at Cadarache and be awarded two-elevenths of the construction contracts, while the European Union's staff and construction components contributions will be cut from five-elevenths to four-elevenths.

It was reported in December 2010 that the European Parliament had refused to approve a plan by member states to reallocate €1.4 billion from the budget to cover a shortfall in ITER building costs in 2012–13. The closure of the 2010 budget required this financing plan to be revised, and the European Commission (EC) was forced to put forward an ITER budgetary resolution proposal in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12007965 Nuclear fusion finance plan rejected by EU Parliament], BBC, 16 December 2010 (accessed 19 December 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. withdrew from the ITER consortium in 2000. In 2006, Congress voted to rejoin, and again contribute financially.

==Criticism==
[[File:Stop-ITER Pertuis.jpg|thumb|Protest against ITER in France, 2009. Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and budget overruns.&lt;ref name="W Wayt Gibbs"/&gt; The [[World Nuclear Association]] says that fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author=World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |website= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624123428/http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |archivedate=24 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A technical concern is that the 14 [[electronvolt|MeV]] neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/FUSION.1999.849850|title=18th IEEE/NPSS Symposium on Fusion Engineering.

The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iter.org/mach/hotcell ITER homepage: Hot Cell]. Iter.org. Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, [[International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility|IFMIF]], is planned to investigate this problem.

Another source of concern comes from the 2013 tokamak parameters database interpolation which says that power load on tokamak [[divertor]]s will be five times the expected value for ITER and much more for actual electricity-generating reactors. Given that the projected power load on the ITER divertor is already very high, these new findings mean that new divertor designs should be urgently tested.&lt;ref name=Porkolab2013&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/FPA13_Porkolab_MIT.pdf Innovation is Key from ITER to DEMO.

A number of fusion researchers working on non-tokamak systems, such as [[Robert Bussard]] and [[Eric Lerner]], have been critical of ITER for diverting funding from what they believe could be a potentially more viable and/or cost-effective path to fusion power, such as the [[polywell]] reactor.&lt;ref name="google-bussard"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1996321846673788606| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070205120020/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1996321846673788606| archivedate = 2007-02-05| title = Should Google Go Nuclear?

YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;
Many critics accuse ITER researchers of being unwilling to face up to the technical and economic potential problems posed by tokamak fusion schemes.&lt;ref name="google-bussard"/&gt; The expected cost of ITER has risen from US$5 billion to US$20 billion, and the timeline for operation at full power was moved from the original estimate of 2016 to 2027.

A French association including about 700 anti-nuclear groups, [[Sortir du nucléaire (France)|Sortir du nucléaire]] (Get Out of Nuclear Energy), claimed that ITER was a hazard because scientists did not yet know how to manipulate the high-energy deuterium and tritium [[Isotopes of hydrogen|hydrogen isotopes]] used in the fusion process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1631650,00.html France Wins Nuclear Fusion Plant]. Deutsche Welle. Dw-world.de (28 June 2005). Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rebecca Harms]], Green/EFA member of the [[European Parliament]]'s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, said: "In the next 50 years, nuclear fusion will neither tackle climate change nor guarantee the security of our energy supply." Arguing that the EU's energy research should be focused elsewhere, she said: "The Green/EFA group demands that these funds be spent instead on energy research that is relevant to the future. A major focus should now be put on renewable sources of energy." French Green party lawmaker [[Noël Mamère]] claims that more concrete efforts to fight present-day global warming will be neglected as a result of ITER: "This is not good news for the fight against the greenhouse effect because we're going to put ten billion euros towards a project that has a term of 30–50 years when we're not even sure it will be effective."&lt;ref name=FH2005&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/en/science/mixed-reactions-iter/article-141693 Mixed reactions to ITER | EurActiv] July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

ITER is not designed to produce electricity, but made as a proof of concept reactor for the later [[DEMOnstration Power Station|DEMO]] project.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Grossman, "A Star is Born", ''[[Time Magazine]]'', November 2, 2015, p.29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to criticism===
Proponents believe that much of the ITER criticism is misleading and inaccurate, in particular the allegations of the experiment's "inherent danger." The stated goals for a commercial fusion power station design are that the amount of [[radioactive waste]] produced should be hundreds of times less than that of a fission reactor, and that it should produce no long-lived radioactive waste, and that it is impossible for any such reactor to undergo a [[nuclear meltdown|large-scale runaway chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.iter.org/sci/Fusion|title=Advantages of fusion|newspaper=ITER|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct contact of the plasma with ITER inner walls would contaminate it, causing it to cool immediately and stop the fusion process. In addition, the amount of fuel contained in a fusion reactor chamber (one half gram of deuterium/tritium fuel&lt;ref name=iter/&gt;) is only sufficient to sustain the fusion burn pulse from minutes up to an hour at most, whereas a fission reactor usually contains several years' worth of fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630030449/http://www.stpnoc.com/Fyi.htm Facts and Stats... 1/3 of fuel rods changed every 18 months]. STPNOC.com.&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, some detritiation systems will be implemented, so that at a fuel cycle inventory level of about {{cvt|2|kg}}, ITER will eventually need to recycle large amounts of tritium and at turnovers orders of magnitude higher than any preceding tritium facility worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Detritiation Systems at ITER |url=http://www.asn.fr/sites/tritium/fichiers/Tritium_CHAP_2-5.pdf |publisher=French Nuclear Safety Authority |year=2010 |accessdate=12 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913054421/http://www.asn.fr/sites/tritium/fichiers/Tritium_CHAP_2-5.pdf |archivedate=13 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of an accident (or sabotage), it is expected that a fusion reactor would release far less radioactive pollution than would an ordinary fission nuclear station. Furthermore, ITER's type of fusion power has little in common with nuclear weapons technology, and does not produce the fissile materials necessary for the construction of a weapon. Proponents note that large-scale fusion power would be able to produce reliable electricity on demand, and with virtually zero pollution (no gaseous CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; by-products are produced).

According to researchers at a demonstration reactor in Japan, a fusion generator should be feasible in the 2030s and no later than the 2050s. Japan is pursuing its own research program with several operational facilities that are exploring several fusion paths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1088/0029-5515/45/2/004|title= Demonstration tokamak fusion power station for early realization of net electric power generation|year= 2005|last1= Hiwatari|first1=R.|last2= Okano|first2=K.|last3=Asaoka|first3= Y.|last4=Shinya|first4= K.|last5=Ogawa|first5=Y.|journal= Nuclear Fusion|volume= 45|page= 96|bibcode = 2005NucFu..45...96H|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of ITER contend that an investment in research now should be viewed as an attempt to earn a far greater future return.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Also, worldwide investment of less than US$1 billion per year into ITER is not incompatible with concurrent research into other methods of power generation, which in 2007 totaled US$16.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Exec_summary.pdf|title=GLOBAL TRENDS IN SUSTAINABLE ENERGY INVESTMENT 2008|accessdate=10 October 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721182043/http://www.sefi.unep.org/fileadmin/media/sefi/docs/publications/Exec_summary.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of ITER emphasize that the only way to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF,&lt;ref name=iter/&gt; and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/proceedings/2004csewgusndp/tuesday/mbphysics/09_DSmith.pdf Nuclear Data for Helium Production in Fusion]. (PDF). Retrieved 21 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of ITER is to explore the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.

Furthermore, the main line of research via [[tokamak]]s has been developed to the point that it is now possible to undertake the penultimate step in magnetic confinement plasma physics research with a self-sustained reaction. In the tokamak research program, recent advances devoted to controlling the configuration of the plasma have led to the achievement of substantially improved energy and pressure confinement, which reduces the projected cost of electricity from such reactors by a factor of two to a value only about 50% more than the projected cost of electricity from advanced [[Light water reactor|light-water reactors]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} In addition, progress in the development of advanced, low activation structural materials supports the promise of environmentally benign fusion reactors and research into alternate confinement concepts is yielding the promise of future improvements in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/fusion_critic_response_stacey.pdf Commentaries on criticisms of magnetic fusion], Weston M.

'''Intercultural competence''' is a range of cognitive, affective, and behavioural skills that lead to effective and appropriate
[[communication]]  with people of other [[culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W., &amp; Schäfer, N. (2012) The ICCA Facilitator's Manual. Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal.

''Health &amp; Social Care In The Community'', ''24''(6), e117-e130. doi:10.1111/hsc.12293&lt;/ref&gt; Effective intercultural communication relates to behaviors that culminate with the accomplishment of the desired goals of the interaction and all parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lustig, M. W., &amp; Koester, J. (2003). ''Intercultural competence: Interpersonal communication across cultures'' (4th ed.). Boston : Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate intercultural communication includes behaviors that suit the expectations of a specific culture, the characteristics of the situation, and the level of the relationship between the parties involved in the situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Basics==
It's very important for someone to be culturally competent at work and at school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Individuals that are effective and appropriate in intercultural situations display high levels of cultural self-awareness and understand the influence of culture on behavior, values, and beliefs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intercultural competence is achieved through a set of skills that includes cognitive, affective, and behavioral processes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Liu, S. (2014) that allow a person understand another person from another culture. Becoming intercultural: exposure to foreign cultures and intercultural competence through [[travel]] and [[tourism]]. ''China Media Research'', ''10''(3), 7+. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://db19.linccweb.org/login?url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA381285571&amp;asid=99b4d2ef6464c5ca16122775ce082415&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

First, cognitive processes imply the understanding of situational and environmental aspects of intercultural interactions and the application of intercultural awareness, which is affected by the understanding of the self and own culture. Self-awareness in intercultural situations refers to the ability of self-monitoring in such interactions to censor anything not acceptable to another culture. On the other hand, cultural awareness leads the individual to an understanding of how his/her own culture determines feelings, thoughts, and personality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raţă, G. (2016). Intercultural Development through Intercultural Awareness and Cultural Briefing. ''Scientific Papers: Animal Science &amp; Biotechnologies / Lucrari Stiintifice: Zootehnie Si Biotehnologii'', ''49''(1), 284-288.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, affective processes define the emotions that span during intercultural interactions. These emotions are strongly related to self-concept, open-mindedness, non-judgementalism, and social relaxation. In general, positive emotions generate respect for other cultures and their differences.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Finally, behavioral processes refer to how effectively and appropriately the individual directs actions to achieve goals. Actions during intercultural interactions are influenced by the ability to clearly convey a message, proficiency with the foreign language, flexibility and management of behavior, and social skills.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Creating intercultural competence ==
Intercultural competence is determined by the presence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral abilities that directly shape communication across cultures. These essential abilities can be separated into five specific skills that are obtained through education and experience:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Mindfulness: the ability of being cognitively aware of how the communication and interaction with others is developed. It is important to focus more in the process of the interaction than its outcome while maintaining in perspective the desired communication goals. For example, it would be better to formulate questions such as "What can I say or do to help this process?" rather than "What do they mean?"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Cognitive flexibility: the ability of creating new categories of information rather than keeping old categories. This skill includes opening to new information, taking more than one perspective, and understanding personal ways of interpreting messages and situations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ciairano, S., Bonino, S., &amp; Miceli, R. (2006). COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE FROM CHILDHOOD TO EARLY ADOLESCENCE. ''Cognitie, Creier, Comportament/Cognition, Brain, Behavior'', ''10''(3), 343-366.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tolerance for ambiguity: the ability to maintain focus in situations that are not clear rather than becoming anxious and to methodically determine the best approach as the situation evolves. Generally, low-tolerance individuals look for information that supports their believes while high-tolerance individuals look for information that gives an understanding of the situation and others.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
# Behavioral flexibility: the ability to adapt and accommodate behaviors to a different culture. Although knowing a second language could be important for this skill, it does not necessarily translate into cultural adaptability. The individual must be willing to assimilate the new culture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrard, V., &amp; Schmid Mast, M. (2015). Physician behavioral adaptability: A model to outstrip a "one size fits all" approach. ''Patient Education &amp; Counseling'', ''98''(10), 1243-1247. doi:10.1016/j.pec.2015.07.028&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cross-cultural empathy: the ability to visualize with the imagination the situation of another person from an intellectual and emotional point of view. Demonstrating empathy includes the abilities of connecting emotionally with people, showing compassion, thinking in more than one perspective, and listening actively.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chi-Ying Chung, R., &amp; Bemak, F. (2002). The Relationship of Culture and Empathy in Cross-Cultural Counseling. ''Journal Of Counseling &amp; Development'', ''80''(2), 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, P. B., &amp; Pope, m.

==History in American ethnic studies==

The United States in its earliest history had a culture influenced heavily by its Northern European population, primarily from the [[British Isles]], who originally settled in the original [[British colonization of the Americas|British Colonies]].  While the indigenous peoples, known as Indians, were the largest population of [[North America]], they were slowly pushed away from the Eastern Seaboard into the interior of North America during the 17th century, 18th century, and 19th century (see [[Indian Removal Act]] describing specific actions during early 19th century).  During this period, people from the British Isles (England and Scotland primarily) brought the culture and religion of the British Isles with them to the United States and became the dominant political and cultural group along the Eastern Seaboard of North America.

Both voluntary immigration from other regions as well as the results of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], brought a mix of people to the Americas, including Europeans, Africans, and, to a lesser extent until the 20th century, Asians.  Thus began the process of diversifying the population of the Western Hemisphere.  While the majority of the U.S. population were white immigrants from northern and western Europe and their descendants, they maintained most of the power, social and economic, of the nation.

In the U.S. context, immigration from the 1840s onward diversified the ethnic composition of the nation.  During the early part of the 20th century, southern and eastern European immigrants and their descendants became a larger percentage of the population, but as recent immigrants concentrated in urban areas were also very often poor and lacking in basic healthy living and working conditions.    Descendants of African [[Slavery|slave]]s and immigrants faced a much more difficult challenge due to their skin color and discrimination enforced by legal systems, such as the [[Jim Crow law]]s in the United States.  Since the 1960s, African Americans as well as other minority groups such as [[Mexican American]]s have gained greater social and economic status and power.

Nonetheless, the dominant models of education and social services retained models developed by northern and western European intellectuals, even such well-meaning and important reformers as [[Jane Addams]] and [[Jacob Riis]].  After the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s, though, social workers, activists, and even healthcare providers began to examine their practices to see if they were as effective in African American, Latino, and even Asian American communities in the U.S.  The arrival of more than half a million [[Southeast Asia]]n [[refugee]]s, from 1975 to 1992, for example, tested the ability of medical and social workers to continue effective practice among speakers of other languages and among those coming from very different understandings of everything from mental health to charity.

== Education in the United States ==
With the larger population of minorities and [[racial integration]] during the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Education in the United States|public school system]] of the United States had to grapple with issues of cultural sensitivity as most [[teacher]]s in public school system came from white, [[middle class]] backgrounds.  Most of these teachers were educated, primarily English speaking, and primarily from the Western European cultures.  They often had trouble trying to communicate with speakers of limited English proficiency, let alone people of vastly different [[value system]]s and [[norm (sociology)|normative behaviors]] from that of Anglo-European culture.  The purpose of training educators and others in the area of cultural competence is to provide new teachers the background and skills to work effectively with children of all backgrounds and social classes.

With the growing diversity of the student body in U.S. public school, it is increasingly imperative that teachers have and continually develop a cultural competence that enables them to connect with, respond to, and interact effectively with their pupils.  The achievement gap between cultural minority and majority students suggests a communication disconnect often occurs in minority classrooms because cultural mismatch between teachers and students is common and should not prevent positive, productive for both parties, provided the educator is a culturally competent communicator.  Over the last few decades, scholars have increasingly shown interest in the relationship between learning, reading, schema, and culture.  People's schema depends on their social location, which, as Anderson (1984) explains, includes a reader's age, sex, race, religion, nationality, and occupation, amongst other factors.  Considering schemata determine how people understand, interpret, and analyze everything in their world, it is clear that background and experience really do affect the learning and teaching processes, and how each should be approached in context.  "In short," Anderson (1984) says, "the schema that will be brought to bear on a text depends upon the reader's culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;374-375).  More simply, Anderson (1984) describes a person's schema as their "organized knowledge about the world" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  In considering the role of schema, one of the educator's principal functions in teaching, particularly with literacy, is to "‘bridge the gap between what the learner already knows and what he needs to know before he can successfully learn the task at hand'" (Anderson, 1984, p.&amp;nbsp;382).  This is important because Staton (1989) explains that student learning—i.e. successful communication between instructor and pupil—occurs when teachers and students come to "shared understandings" (p.&amp;nbsp;364).  Thus, teachers must remember that they are "cultural workers, not neutral professionals using skills on a culturally-detached playing field" (Blanchett, Mumford &amp; Beachum, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;306).

Teachers and administrators in the public school systems of the United States come in contact with a wide variety of sub-cultures and are at the forefront of the challenge of bringing diverse groups together within a larger American society.  Issues confronting teachers and administrators on a daily basis include student [[learning disabilities]], student behavioral problems, [[child abuse]], [[drug addiction]], [[mental health]], and [[poverty]], most of which are handled differently within different cultures and communities.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/the-importance-of-cultural-competence-in-healthcare/| title=THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHCARE| accessdate=25 November 2015| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of cultural conflicts often seen by teachers in the public school system include:
* role of women in the family and the decisions they can make
* practices among cultural groups (e.g. [[fire cupping]])
* symbol systems among cultural groups (see [[semiotics]])

Examples of sub-groups within the United States: [[African American]], [[Asian American]], [[Indian American]], [[Irish American]], [[American Jews|Jewish American]], [[Mexican American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] or American Indians and [[refugee]]s.

==Healthcare==
{{Main|Cultural competence in healthcare}}
The provision of culturally tailored health care can improve [[patient outcomes]]. In 2005, California passed Assembly Bill 1195 that requires patient-related continuing medical education courses in [[California]] [[medical school]] to incorporate cultural and linguistic competence training in order to qualify for certification credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/state-legislation-requires-inclusion-cultural-and-linguistic-competence-continuing-medical |title=State Legislation Requires Inclusion of Cultural and Linguistic Competence in Continuing Medical Education, Increasing Acceptance of Their Importance by Educational Programs and Clinicians |date=2013-09-25 |accessdate=2013-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, HealthPartners Institute for Education and Research implemented the EBAN Experience™ program to reduce health disparities among minority populations, most notably East African immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/clinics-offer-culturally-tailored-diabetes-education-and-culturally-appropriate-care |title=Clinics Offer Culturally Tailored Diabetes Education and Culturally Appropriate Care to Ethiopian Patients, Leading to More Engagement, Better Outcomes, and Reduction of Health Disparities |date=2014-01-29 | accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josepha Campinha-Bacote|title=The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Healthcare Services: A Model of Care|journal=Journal of Transcultural Nursing|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hispanic versus Latin American ==
The term "Hispanic" is problematic{{According to whom|date=September 2016}}. It is impossible to refer to "a Hispanic-American perspective" or to "a single Latino culture".(1)(2)  The label "Hispanic" is controversial because it was coined by the Federal Government to describe a heterogeneous ethnic population whose ancestors come from a Spanish-speaking country. Although these American citizens have Latin American roots, the term "Latino" to characterize them is more correct since it is more inclusive of non-Spanish-speaking Latinos. However, the term "Latino" does not include individuals from Spanish-speaking countries outside of Latin America (e.g., Spain).

There is also a lack of adequate research into how race and ethnicity affects members of a group.(3)(4)(5) There are few life histories and phenomenological studies of illness as experienced by people outside the American white, urban, middle class, especially of immigrant and native populations.  Race has been used to explain the absence of research. Racial classifications are based on outmoded concepts and dubious assumptions regarding genetic differences.  In fact, outside of skin color, race is poorly correlated with biological or cultural phenomena, which sharply diminishes its validity in biomedical or social research.  Yet, unlike race or national origin, ethnicity is a sociological construct highly correlated with behavioral and cultural phenomena, particularly language, dress, adornment, food preference, religion, social interaction, marriage and family customs.

Further research is needed to determine whether race and ethnicity among Latinos are rather driven by mechanisms of discrimination and macrosocial factors or social status.  Fortunately, not too long ago, the National Institutes of Health took an important step by insisting that any NIH- supported clinical investigation include, where appropriate, minority populations, women and the aged.(6) However, we must guard against what has been called a new "tokenism", that is, having a large aggregate of "non-whites", and a few African Americans and Hispanics included. This aggregate will never produce a proper sample.  Rigorous attention to sample size, composition and sampling strategies is required to research basic psychosocial processes and clinical responses of minority populations. Accordingly, the heterogeneity of the Hispanic community has to be taken into account. The Hispanic's country of origin, cultural history, migration history, language, family, traditions, religion, educational level, socio-economic status, gender, sexual orientation, age and generation—all need to be explored.

==Cross-cultural competence==
{{Main|Cross-cultural competence}}

Cross-cultural competence (3C) has generated confusing and contradictory definitions because it has been studied by a wide variety of academic approaches and professional fields. One author identified eleven different terms that have some equivalence to 3C: cultural savvy, astuteness, appreciation, literacy or fluency, adaptability, terrain, expertise, competency, awareness, intelligence, and understanding.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"&gt;Selmeski, B.R. (2007). ''Military cross-cultural competence: Core concepts and individual development''. Kingston: Royal Military College of Canada Centre for Security, Armed Forces, &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Army Research Institute, which is currently engaged in a study of 3C has defined it as "A set of cognitive, behavioral, and affective/motivational components that enable individuals to adapt effectively in intercultural environments".&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."&gt;Abbe, A., Gulick, L.M.V., &amp; Herman, J.L. (2007). ''Cross-cultural competence in Army leaders: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Washington, DC: U.S. Army Research Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in academia, business, health care, government security, and developmental aid agencies have all sought to use 3C in one way or another. Poor results have often been obtained due to a lack of rigorous study of 3C and a reliance on "[[common sense]]" approaches.&lt;ref name="Selmeski"/&gt;

Cross-cultural competence does not operate in a vacuum, however. One theoretical construct posits that 3C, [[language proficiency]], and regional knowledge are distinct skills that are inextricably linked, but to varying degrees depending on the context in which they are employed. In educational settings, [[Benjamin Bloom|Bloom]]'s affective and cognitive taxonomies&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B.S. (Ed.). (1956). ''Taxonomy of educational objectives: Handbook I: Cognitive domain.'' New York: David McKay.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krathwohl, D.R., Bloom, B.S., &amp; Masia, B.B. (1973). ''Taxonomy of Educational Objectives, the Classification of Educational Goals. Handbook II: Affective Domain.'' New York: McKay Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; serve as an effective framework for describing the overlapping areas among these three disciplines: at the receiving and knowledge levels, 3C can operate with near-independence from language proficiency and regional knowledge. But, as one approaches the internalizing and evaluation levels, the overlapping areas approach totality.

The development of intercultural competence is mostly based on the individual's experiences while he or she is communicating with different cultures. When interacting with people from other cultures, the individual experiences certain obstacles that are caused by differences in cultural understanding between two people from different cultures. Such experiences may motivate the individual to acquire skills that can help him to communicate his point of view to an audience belonging to a different cultural ethnicity and background.

===Immigrants and international students===
A salient issue, especially for people living in countries other than their native country, is the issue of which culture they should follow: their native culture or the one in their new surroundings.

[[International student]]s also face this issue: they have a choice of modifying their cultural boundaries and adapting to the culture around them or holding on to their native culture and surrounding themselves with people from their own country. The students who decide to hold on to their native culture are those who experience the most problems in their university life and who encounter frequent [[culture shock]]s. But international students who adapt themselves to the culture surrounding them (and who interact more with domestic students) will increase their knowledge of the domestic culture, which may help them to "blend in" more. In the article it stated, "Segmented assimilation theorists argue that students from less affluent and racial and ethnic minority immigrant families face a number of educational hurdles and barriers that often stem from racial, ethnic, and gender biases and discrimination embedded within the U.S. public school system" (Bondy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bondy|first1=Jennifer|last2=Peguero|first2=Anthony|last3=Johnson|first3=Brent|title=The Children of Immigrants’ Academic Self-Efficacy: The Significance of Gender, Race, Ethnicity, and Segmented Assimilation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0013124516644049#articleCitationDownloadContainer|website=Sage Journals|publisher=Sage publications|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Such individuals may be said to have adopted [[Bicultural identity|bicultural identities]].

=== Ethnocentrism ===
{{See also|Ethnocentrism}}
Another issue that stands out in intercultural communication is the attitude stemming from [[Ethnocentrism]]. LeVine and Campbell (as cited in Lin and Rancer, 2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Y. &amp; Rancer, A.S.|year=2003|title=Ethnocentrism, intercultural communication apprehension, intercultural willingness‐to‐communicate, and intentions to participate in an intercultural dialogue program: testing a proposed model|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08824090309388800|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=62–72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines ethnocentrism as people's tendency to view their culture or in-group as superior to other groups, and to judge those groups to their standards. With ethnocentric attitudes, those incapable to expand their view of different cultures could create conflict between groups. Ignorance to diversity and cultural groups contributes to prevention of peaceful interaction in a fast-paced globalizing world. The counterpart of ethnocentrism is ethnorelativism: the ability to see multiple values, beliefs, norms etc. in the world as cultural rather than universal; being able to understand and accept different cultures.

==Cultural differences==
{{See also|Geert Hofstede}}
Cultural characteristics can be measured along several dimensions that were defined by Geert Hofstede in his studies of cultural differences. The ability to perceive them and to cope with them is fundamental for intercultural competence. These characteristics include:

=== Individualism versus Collectivism ===
* [[Collectivism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Luomala, H., Kumar, R., Singh, J., &amp; Jaakkola, M. (2015). When an Intercultural Business Negotiation Fails: Comparing the Emotions and Behavioural Tendencies of Individualistic and Collectivistic Negotiators. ''Group Decision &amp; Negotiation'', ''24''(3), 537-561. doi:10.1007/s10726-014-9420-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Maali, B. M., &amp; Al-Attar, A. (2017).

** Decisions are based on the benefits of the group rather than the individual;
** Strong loyalty to the group as the main social unit;
** The group is expected to take care of each individual;
** Collectivist cultures include Pakistan, India, Japan, and Guatemala.
* [[Individualism]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Autonomy of the individual has the highest importance;
** Promotes the exercise of one's goals and desires and so value independence and self-reliance;
** Decisions prioritize the benefits of the individual rather than the group;
** Individualistic cultures are Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the United States.

=== Masculinity versus Femininity ===
* Masculine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that indicate assertiveness and wealth;
** Judge people based on the degree of ambition and achievement;
** General behaviors are associated with male behavior;
** Sex roles are clearly defined and sexual inequality is acceptable;
** Masculine cultures include Austria, Italy, Japan, and Mexico.
* Feminine Cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
** Value behaviors that promote the quality of life such as caring for others and nurturing;
** Gender roles overlap and sexual equality is preferred as the norm;
** Nurturing behaviors are acceptable for both women and men;
** Feminine cultures are Chile, Portugal, Sweden, and Thailand.

=== Uncertainty avoidance&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ===
* Reflects the extent to which members of a society attempt to cope with anxiety by minimizing uncertainty;
* Uncertainty avoidance dimension expresses the degree to which a person in society feels comfortable with a sense of uncertainty and ambiguity.
** High uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Countries exhibiting high Uncertainty Avoidance Index or UAI maintain rigid codes of belief and behavior and are intolerant of unorthodox behavior and ideas;
*** Members of society expect consensus about national and societal goals;
*** Society ensures security by setting extensive rules and keeping more structure;
*** High uncertainty avoidance cultures are Greece, Guatemala, Portugal, and Uruguay.
** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
*** Low UAI societies maintain a more relaxed attitude in which practice counts more than principles;
*** Low uncertainty avoidance cultures accept and feel comfortable in unstructured situations or changeable environments and try to have as few rules as possible;
*** People in these cultures are more tolerant of change and accept risks;

==Assessment==
The assessment of cross-cultural competence is another field that is rife with controversy. One survey identified 86 assessment instruments for 3C.&lt;ref&gt;Fantini, A.E. (2006). ''87 Assessment tools of intercultural competence [Electronic version].'' Brattleboro, VT: School for International Training. Retrieved June 20, 2007, from http://www.sit.edu/publications/docs/feil_appendix_f.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A United States Army Research Institute study narrowed the list down to ten quantitative instruments that were suitable for further exploration of their reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

The following characteristics are tested and observed for the [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] of intercultural competence as an existing ability or as the potential to develop it: [[ambiguity tolerance]], openness to contacts, flexibility in behavior, emotional stability, motivation to perform, [[empathy]], [[metacommunicative competence]], and [[wikt:polycentric|polycentrism]].

===Quantitative assessment instruments===
Three examples of quantitative assessment instruments are:&lt;ref name="Abbe et al."/&gt;

===Qualitative assessment instruments===
Research in the area of 3C assessment, while thin, points to the value of qualitative assessment instruments in concert with quantitative ones.&lt;ref&gt;Kitsantas, A. (2004). Studying abroad: the role of college students' goals on the development of cross-cultural skills and global understanding. ''College Student Journal'', 38(3). Retrieved July 9, 2007, from ERIC database.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lessard-Clouston |first=M. |year=1997 |title=Towards an understanding of culture in L2/FL education |journal=Ronko: K.G. studies in English |volume=25 |pages=131–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lievens |first=F. |last2=Harris |first2=M. |last3=Van Keer |first3=E. |last4=Bisqueret |first4=C. |year=2003 |title=Predicting cross-cultural training performance: The validity of personality, cognitive ability, and dimensions measured by an assessment center and a behavior description interview |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=476–489 |pmid=12814296 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.3.476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qualitative instruments, such as scenario-based assessments, are useful for gaining insight into intercultural competence.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, B.

Intercultural coaching frameworks, such as the ICCA™ ([http://www.globusresearch.com/intercultural-coaching.aspx Intercultural Communication and Collaboration Appraisal]), do not attempt an assessment; they provide guidance for personal improvement based upon the identification of [[Trait theory|personal traits]], strengths, and weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;Messner, W. &amp; Schäfer, N.

==Criticisms==
It is important that cross-cultural competence training and skills does not break down into the application of stereotypes. Although its goal is to promote understanding between groups of individuals that, as a whole, think differently, it may fail to recognize specific differences between individuals of any given group. Such differences can be more significant than the differences between groups, especially in the case of heterogeneous populations and value systems.&lt;ref&gt;Rathje, S. (2007). Intercultural Competence: The Status and Future of a Controversial Concept. ''Journal for Language and Intercultural Communication'', 7(4), 254–266&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Madison |first=Greg |year=2006 |title=Existential Migration |journal=Existential Analysis |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=238–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; has criticized the tendency of 3C training for its tendency to simplify migration and cross-cultural processes into stages and phases. Madison's article offers an outline of the original research.

A '''juvenile''' is an individual [[organism]] that has not yet reached its [[adult]] form, [[sexual maturity]] or size. Juveniles sometimes look very different from the adult form, particularly in colour. In many organisms the juvenile has a different name from the adult (see also [[List of animal names]]).

Some organisms reach sexual maturity in a short [[metamorphosis]], such as [[eclosion]] in many [[insect]]s. For others, the transition from juvenile to fully mature is a more prolonged process—[[puberty]] for example. In such cases, juveniles during this transformation are sometimes called '''subadults'''.

Many [[invertebrate]]s, on reaching the adult stage, are fully mature and their development and growth stops. Their juveniles are [[larva]]e or [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].

In [[vertebrate]]s and some invertebrates (e.g. [[spider]]s), larval forms (e.g. [[tadpole]]s) are usually considered a development stage of their own, and "juvenile" refers to a post-larval stage that is not fully grown and not sexually mature. In [[amniote]]s and most [[plant]]s, the [[embryo]] represents the larval stage. Here, a "juvenile" is an individual in the time between hatching/birth/germination and reaching maturity.

The '''Kahn system''' is an industrial construction technique for reinforcement of buildings that was engineered and patented by [[Julius Kahn (inventor)|Julius Kahn]]. The Kahn system is an industrial construction design using the Kahn Trussed Bar as the bases. This steel bar was a new type of reinforcing bar used in concrete and had unique engineered features to distribute stress.{{sfn|Bucci|2002|pp=31&amp;ndash;33}}

Kahn saw problems with the concrete reinforcement systems used in building construction at the end of the 19th century. The existing technique of construction of the time was using concrete with a plain straight steel in the center of a concrete beam. The steel in the concrete would slip if there was even the tiniest bit of room between the hardened concrete and the steel and it would break adhesion. The main reinforcing bar had plain steel beam members rigidly attached to it. This diagonal tension fractured the reinforcing bar beams since the adhesion was broken. This caused weakness in the concrete/steel reinforced beam and a failure that could cause catastrophic results. The problem was that the plain steel beam separated from the concrete causing a failure since the two materials were no longer working together for strength.&lt;ref name="KahnEngineer"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=kt1q2nc2q9;NAAN=13030&amp;chunk.id=ss1.4 | title=The George H. Scripps Memorial Marine Biological Laboratory of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego | publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography | author=Shor, George G. | author2=Shor, Elizabeth Noble | author3=Spiess, Fred Noel | journal=SIO Reference | year=1979 | issue=79–26 | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A reinforced beam bar in the early 1900s consisted of a plain straight steel in the center of a molded concrete form. The beam would fail along the lines of principal stresses in the concrete through shearing. The plain straight steel was placed into an encased mold and concrete was poured in. This formulated mixture of steel and concrete then hardened and became the reinforced beam bar. But in some cases there was a tiny air gap between the steel and the hardened concrete which allowed the steel to move and slip. This weakened the reinforced beam from its original full strength capability. This meant then this weakened fractured beam could fail and break under the heavy load of the building it was supporting.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}}

Kahn discovered that concrete was much stronger in compression than tension, so devised the idea of distributing the stresses.&lt;ref name="SedlarReport"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/98436/Sedlar_Engineering_Industrial_Architecture.pdf | title=Engineering Industrial Architecture: Albert Kahn and the Trussed Concrete Steel Company | publisher=University of Michigan | date=June 24, 2013 | author=Sedlar, Frank | journal=2012–2013 MLibrary Undergraduate Research Award Maize Award for Single-Term  Projects | format=PDF | ref={{sfnRef|Sedlar|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did scientific engineering experiments and created the concept that if the steel beam edges were bent back at a 45-degree angle forming projecting tabs or "wings" before going into the molded form led to better stress distribution.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Skinner|2y=1997|2p=13}} The winged sheared members are cut and turned up to form an angle from the thin edge of the steel bar but are still permanently attached.{{sfn|Webb|Gibson|1916|p=48}} When the wet concrete mixture was poured and hardened there was no slippage of the steel beam because the tension stress is distributed throughout the beam.{{sfn|Ferry|1970|p=11}}

This new style constructed steel beam was called "the Kahn trussed bar", sometimes shortened to just "the Kahn bar".{{sfn|Bucci|2002|p=31}} The trussed steel bar had bent-up "wings" on each side. The "wings" on the steel bar provided 20–30% additional strength to a reinforced concrete beam over the old technology of plain straight smooth steel bars or rods.{{sfn|Matuz|2002|p=47}} The primary concept of the Kahn bar was that it gave reinforcement in both the vertical and horizontal plane while it simplified construction.{{sfnm|1a1=Bucci|1y=2002|1p=31|2a1=Buel|2y=1904|2p=337}} The principal lines of shear stresses in a beam average a 45-degree angle, so the angled "wings" transmitted the tension down to the main reinforcing steel beam.&lt;ref name=SedlarReport/&gt;

The Kahn bar is of high grade steel with an elastic limit of 42,000 pounds and tensile strength of 70,000 pounds per square inch.{{sfn|Trussed Concrete Steel Company|1910|p=8}} Kahn formed his own company in 1903 called [[Trussed Concrete Steel Company]] (aka "Truscon Steel Company") located in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], to manufacture these special steel bars used in reinforced concrete beams.{{sfnm|1a1=Matuz|1y=2002|1p=47|2a1=Ferry|2y=1970|2p=10}}

Another new engineered innovation of Kahn was steel forms built with "ribs" instead of "wings". It was a derivative from Kahn's 1903 patent. This advanced technology was marketed by the Trussed Concrete Steel Company with the brand name of [[Hy-Rib]] products.{{sfn|Hughes|Allen|Hecht|2001|p=142}} The Kahn System of reinforced concrete is the first time an automobile factory was constructed; it was for [[Packard Automotive Plant|Packard automobile factory plant building number 10]] designed in 1903–05.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1974|p=31|ps=. "Thus Plant Number Ten represented a clear advance in factory construction for Packard and for the automobile industry in general, as it was the first automobile plant to be built of reinforced concrete."}}{{sfn|Sedlar|2013|p=31|ps=. "The Packard #10 building was the first to utilize reinforced concrete with Julius Kahn's Kahn Bar but also as previously discussed, the full range of steel building products from the Trussed Concrete Steel Company."}}&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/b/bhlead/umich-bhl-0420?rgn=main;view=text | title=Albert Kahn papers | publisher=University of Michigan | work=Bentley Historical Library | date=January 14, 2004 | accessdate=July 30, 2014 | author=Kahn, Albert | editor=Bund, Sally Linvill | quote=Kahn's first factory built of reinforced concrete in Detroit was Building Number 10 for the Packard Motor Company (1905).}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Nelson|1939|p=10|ps=. "The first reinforced concrete factory in the country, designed by Albert Kahn, made its appearance in 1903."}} The Kahn system of reinforcement products had been used in over 1500 buildings in the United States by 1907.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=38}}

==Kahn trussed bar applications==
Kahn's patented invention is a steel bar of 45-degree diagonal "wings" as several minor members that are rigidly attached to the main member.{{sfn|Cody|2005|p=37}} The idea of the "wing" technique is that the stresses are distributed throughout the main reinforced beam.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt; The steel then doesn't slip within the hardened concrete.&lt;ref name=KahnEngineer/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''Kautsky effect''' (also named, ''fluorescence transient'', ''fluorescence induction'' or ''fluorescence decay'') is a phenomenon consisting on a typical variation on the behavior of a plant fluorescence when is exposed to light. It was discovered in 1931 by H. Kautsky and A. Hirsch.

When dark-adapted photosynthesising cells are illuminated with continuous light, [[chlorophyll fluorescence]] displays characteristic changes in intensity accompanying the induction of photosynthetic activity.

==Application of Kautsky effect==
The quantum yield of photosynthesis, which is also the photochemical quenching of fluorescence, is calculated through the following equation:

Φ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = (F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;/F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;

F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the low fluorescence intensity, which is measured by a short light flash that is not strong enough to cause photochemistry, and thus induces fluorescence. F&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum fluorescence that can be obtained from a sample by measuring the highest intensity of fluorescence after a saturating flash. The difference between the measured values is the variable fluorescence F&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Explanation==
[[image:kautsky effect.PNG|right|The Kautsky effect]]
When a sample (leaf or algal suspension) is illuminated, the fluorescence intensity increases with a time constant in the microsecond or millisecond range. After a few seconds the intensity decreases and reaches a steady-state level. The initial rise of the fluorescence intensity is attributed to the progressive saturation of the [[reaction center]]s of [[photosystem 2]] (PSII). Therefore, [[photochemical quenching]] increases with the time of illumination, with a corresponding increase of the fluorescence intensity. The slow decrease of the fluorescence intensity at later times is caused, in addition to other processes, by [[non-photochemical quenching]]. Non-photochemical quenching is a protection mechanism in photosynthetic organisms as they have to avoid the adverse effect of excess light. Which components contribute and in which quantities remains an active but controversial area of research. It is known that [[carotenoids]] and the [[special pigment pairs]] (e.g. [[P700]]) have functions in [[photoprotection]].

[[Image:Yakehashiri lava flow Aerial photograph A.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Green kīpukas surrounded by brown lava flows erupted from [[Mount Iwate|Iwate]] volcano, Japan]]

A '''kīpuka''' is an area of land surrounded by one or more younger [[lava]] flows. A kīpuka forms when lava flows on either side of a [[hill]], [[ridge]], or older [[lava dome]] as it moves downslope or spreads from its source. Older and more weathered than their surroundings, kīpukas often appear to be like islands within a sea of lava flows.  They are often covered with [[soil]] and late [[ecological succession]]al [[vegetation]] that provide visual contrast as well as habitat for animals in an otherwise inhospitable environment.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Etymology==

''Kīpuka'', along with ''[[aa (lava flow)|{{okina}}a{{okina}}ā]]'' and ''[[pahoehoe|pāhoehoe]]'', are [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] words related to [[volcanology]] that have entered the [[lexicon]] of [[geology]].  Some{{who|date=March 2017}} have used the word informally as applying to any place where biological life endures the encroachment of civilization, an "island of life."{{dubious|date=March 2017}}

==Significance to research==

''Kīpuka'' provides useful study sites for [[Ecology|ecological]] research because they facilitate [[Replication (statistics)|replication]]; multiple ''kīpuka'' in a system (isolated by the same lava flow) will tend to have uniform [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] age and successional characteristics, but are often isolated-enough from their neighbors to provide meaningful, comparable differences in size, [[invasive species|invasion]], etc.  They are also receptive to experimental [[Treatment and control groups|treatments]]. ''Kīpuka'' along [[Saddle Road]] on [[hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]] have served as the natural laboratory for a variety of studies, examining ecological principles like [[island biogeography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaspohler|first=David J. |author2=Giardina, Asner |author3=Hart, Price |author4=Lyons, Castaneda|title=Long-term effects of fragmentation and fragment properties on bird species richness in Hawaiian forests|journal=Biological Conservation|year=2010|volume=143|pages=280–288|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320709004509|accessdate=3 May 2017|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2009.10.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soil food web#Food web control|food web control]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruner|first=Daniel S.|title=Attenuation of top-down and bottom-up forces in a complex terrestrial community|journal=Ecology|year=2004|volume=85|pages=3010–3022|url=http://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/1903/7108/1/Gruner2004Ecology.pdf|accessdate=22 August 2013|doi=10.1890/04-0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[invader potential|biotic resistance]] to invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gruner|first=Daniel S.|title=Biotic resistance to an invasive spider conferred by generalist insectivorous birds on Hawaiʻi Island|journal=Biological Invasions|year=2004|volume=0|pages=1–6|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/146705q0#page-1|accessdate=22 August 2013|doi=10.1007/s10530-004-2509-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational linguistics]], '''lexical density''' constitutes the estimated measure of content per functional (grammatical) and lexical units ([[lexeme]]s) in total. It is used in [[discourse analysis]] as a descriptive parameter which varies with register and genre.  Spoken texts tend to have a lower lexical density than written ones, for example.

Lexical density may be determined thus:

&lt;math&gt; L_d = (N_{\mathrm{lex}}/N)  \times  100 &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;L_d&lt;/math&gt; = the analysed text's lexical density

&lt;math&gt;N_{\mathrm{lex}}&lt;/math&gt; = the number of lexical word tokens (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs) in the analysed text

&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = the number of all tokens (total number of words) in the analysed text

&lt;small&gt;(The variable symbols applied herein are by no means conventional; they were arbitrarily chosen for the nonce to illustrate the example in question.)&lt;/small&gt;

It also occurs in the closely related genera ''[[Corymbia]]'' and ''[[Angophora]]''. The word "mallee" may also be used as a [[noun]] in reference to species or individual plants with a mallee habit.

Mallees are the dominant vegetation throughout semiarid areas of [[Australia]] with reliable winter rainfall. Within this area, they form extensive woodlands and shrublands covering over {{convert|250000|km2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ANRA"&gt;{{cite web | title = Mallee woodlands and shrublands | work = Australian National Resources Atlas | url = http://audit.ea.gov.au/anra/vegetation/docs/Native_vegetation/vegfsheet-mvg14_low.pdf |accessdate=6 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031001070540/http://audit.ea.gov.au/anra/vegetation/docs/Native_vegetation/vegfsheet-mvg14_low.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[mallee woodlands and shrublands]] are considered one of Australia's [[major vegetation group]]s.&lt;ref name="ANRA"/&gt;

Widespread mallee species include:
* ''[[Eucalyptus dumosa|E.&amp;nbsp;dumosa]]'' (white mallee)
* ''[[Eucalyptus socialis|E.&amp;nbsp;socialis]]'' (red mallee)
* ''[[Eucalyptus gracilis|E.&amp;nbsp;gracilis]]'' (yorrell)
* ''[[Eucalyptus oleosa|E.&amp;nbsp;oleosa]]'' (red mallee)
* ''[[Eucalyptus incrassata|E.&amp;nbsp;incrassata]]'' (ridge-fruited mallee)
* ''[[Eucalyptus diversifolia|E.&amp;nbsp;diversifolia]]'' (soap mallee)

The [[malleefowl]] is a [[bird]] characteristic of this habitat.

An example of a mallee in a high-rainfall area is the rare yellow-top mallee ash, ''[[Eucalyptus luehmanniana]]''.

'''Mechanobiology''' is an emerging field of science at the interface of biology and engineering that focuses on how physical forces and changes in the mechanical properties of cells and tissues contribute to development, cell differentiation, [[physiology]], and disease.&lt;ref name="ICMM"/&gt;  A major challenge in the field is understanding [[mechanotransduction]]—the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense and respond to mechanical signals.
 
While medicine has typically looked for the genetic and biochemical basis of disease, advances in mechanobiology suggest that changes in cell mechanics, [[extracellular matrix]] structure, or mechanotransduction may contribute to the development of many diseases, including [[atherosclerosis]], [[fibrosis]], [[asthma]], [[osteoporosis]], [[heart failure]], and [[cancer]].  There is also a strong mechanical basis for many generalized medical disabilities, such as lower back pain, foot and postural injury, deformity, and [[irritable bowel syndrome]].

The effectiveness of many of the mechanical therapies already in clinical use shows how important physical forces can be in physiological control. For example, [[pulmonary surfactant]] promotes lung development in premature infants; modifying the tidal volumes of mechanical ventilators reduces morbidity and death in patients with acute lung injury; expandable [[stents]] physically prevent coronary artery constriction; tissue expanders increase the skin area available for reconstructive surgery;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buganza Tepole | first1 = A | last2 = Ploch | first2 = CJ | last3 = Wong | first3 = J | last4 = Gosain | first4 = AK | last5 = Kuhl | first5 = E | year = 2011 | title = Growing skin - A computational model for skin expansion in reconstructive surgery | url = | journal = J.

Insights into the mechanical basis of tissue regulation may also lead to development of improved medical devices, [[biomaterials]], and engineered tissues for tissue repair and reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 2003 | title = Mechanobiology and diseases of mechanotransduction | doi = 10.1080/07853890310016333 | journal = Annals of Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 564–77 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stretch-activated [[ion channels]], [[caveolae]], [[integrins]], [[cadherins]], growth factor receptors, myosin motors, [[cytoskeletal]] filaments, [[Nucleus (cell)|nuclei]], extracellular matrix, and numerous other molecular structures and signaling molecules have been shown to contribute to cellular mechanotransduction.  In addition, [[endogenous]] cell-generated traction forces contribute significantly to these responses by modulating tensional prestress within cells, tissues, and organs that govern their mechanical stability, as well as mechanical signal transmission from the macroscale to the nanoscale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ingber | first1 = DE | year = 1997 | title = Tensegrity: the architectural basis of cellular mechanotransduction | url = | journal = Annu.

In order to alleviate this tension, they produce growth factors, which in turn stimulates proliferation. The net result is increased arterial wall thickness but the stress levels in the artery are restored to the normal levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thorne|first1=BC|last2=Hayenga|first2=HN|last3=Humphrey|first3=JD|last4=Peirce|first4=SM|title=Toward a multi-scale computational model of arterial adaptation in hypertension: verification of a multi-cell agent based model.|journal=Frontiers in Physiology|date=2011|volume=2|pages=20|pmid=21720536|doi=10.3389/fphys.2011.00020|pmc=3118494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using mankind as a macroscopic example, in closed chain function, ground reactive forces, a dynamic architecture and a dynamic equilibrium of forces around joint axes impact the posture to produce tissue stress.  This tissue stress can be both beneficial or harmful. Since gravity, hard, unyielding ground surfaces and other factors such as activity level, body weight and health state impact each of us differently there is no one plan of care that will work for every individual.  This results in a lifetime of adaptation of tissues via Wolff's and Davis' Laws of Bone and Soft Tissue respectively that can unless compensated and/or corrected lead to breakdown, injury and reduced quality of life on a case to case basis.

As a further example, the foot has an inherited functional shape which when used will remodel and adapt in predictable manners. Theoretically programs can be establishing for prevention, performance enhancement and quality of life upgrading in addition to the treatment of pathology and pain. These interventions, some day, will cause positive remodeling of bone and soft tissue that will extend and possibly improve the mechanobiological timeline of mankind.

The '''microbial food web''' refers to the combined [[Trophic level|trophic]] interactions among [[microbe]]s in aquatic environments. These microbes include [[viruses]], [[bacteria]], [[algae]], heterotrophic [[protists]] (such as [[ciliates]] and [[flagellates]]).

In aquatic environments, microbes constitute the base of the [[food web]]. Single celled [[photosynthetic organism]]s such as [[diatoms]] and [[cyanobacteria]] are generally the most important primary producers in the open ocean. Many of these cells, especially cyanobacteria, are too small to be captured and consumed by small [[crustaceans]] and [[planktonic]] [[larva]]e. Instead, these cells are consumed by [[Phagocytosis|phagotrophic]] [[protists]] which are readily consumed by larger organisms. [[Viruses]] can infect and break open bacterial cells and (to a lesser extent), [[planktonic algae]] (a.k.a. [[phytoplankton]]). Therefore, viruses in the microbial food web act to reduce the population of bacteria and, by lysing bacterial cells, release particulate and [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC). DOC may also be released into the environment by algal cells. One of the reasons phytoplankton release DOC termed "unbalanced growth" is when essential [[nutrients]] (e.g. [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) are limiting. Therefore, carbon produced during photosynthesis is not used for the synthesis of proteins (and subsequent cell growth), but is limited due of a lack of the nutrients necessary for [[macromolecules]]. Excess photosynthate, or DOC is then released, or exuded.

The [[microbial loop]] describes a pathway in the microbial food web where DOC is returned to higher [[trophic level]]s via the incorporation into bacterial biomass.

'''Norwegian Social Research''' ({{lang-no|Norsk institutt for forskning om oppvekst, velferd og aldring}}, NOVA) is a state [[social science]] [[research institute]] based in [[Oslo]], Norway. It is part of [[Oslo Metropolitan University]], and was formerly an independent state agency from its establishment in 1996 until 2014. Together with the [[Work Research Institute]], the [[Norwegian Institute for Urban and Regional Research]] and the [[National Institute for Consumer Research]], it now forms the Centre for Welfare and Labour Research at Oslo Metropolitan University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/NOVA NOVA], ''[[Store Norske Leksikon]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is one of the largest social research institutes in Norway, and conducts research on different aspects of society and the [[welfare state]]. The institute has 92 employees. The director of the institute is [[Bjørn Hvinden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hioa.no/tilsatt/bhvind Bjørn Hvinden], Norwegian Social Research&lt;/ref&gt;

NOVA's research is centered on Norwegian society. The aim of the institute is to develop knowledge and understanding of social conditions and processes of change. They focus on issues of life-course events, level of living conditions and aspects of life-quality as well as on programmes and services provided by the welfare system. Within its fields NOVA performs research assignments commissioned by public and private sector clients.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2937">The '''Oracle Unified Method''' ('''OUM'''), first released by [[Oracle Corporation]] in 2006, is a [[standards-based method]] with roots in the [[Unified Process]] (UP). OUM is business-process and [[use case | use-case]] driven and includes support for the [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML), though the use of UML is not required. OUM combines these standards with aspects of Oracle's legacy methods and Oracle implementation best-practices.

OUM is applicable to any size or type of information technology project. While OUM is a plan-based method – that includes extensive overview material, task and artifact descriptions, and associated templates – the method is intended to be tailored to support the appropriate level of ceremony required for each project. Guidance is provided for identifying the minimum subset of tasks, tailoring the project approach, executing iterative and incremental project planning, and applying [[Agile technique]]s. Supplemental guidance provides specific support for [[Oracle product]]s, tools, and technologies.

OUM v6.4.0 provides support for:
* Application Implementation
* Cloud Application Services Implementation
* Software Upgrade projects

as well as the complete range of technology projects including:
* [[Business intelligence]] (BI)
* Enterprise Security
* WebCenter
* [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA)
* Application Integration Architecture (AIA)
* Business Process Management (BPM)
* [[Enterprise integration]]
* Custom Software

Detailed techniques and tool guidance are provided, including a supplemental guide related to [[Oracle Tutor]] and UPK.

OUM is available for use by Oracle employees; for Oracle PartnerNetwork Diamond, Platinum, and Gold Partners; and for customers who participate in the OUM Customer Program.

Legacy method retirement dates:
* Oracle Custom Development Method (CDM), February 2010
* Oracle CDM Fast Track, February 2010
* Oracle Application Implementation Methodology (AIM), January 2011
* Oracle AIM for Business Flows, January 2011

== History ==

=== Foundation of the University ===

[[File:Botanical Garden of PetrSU.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Botanical Garden of Petrozavodsk State University]]

On April 24, 1940 the congress of the [[Communist party|Communist Party]] [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|KFSSR]] was held, where the leader of Karelo-Finnish SSR G.N. Kupriyanov showed his report. It claimed that it’s needed to pay special attention to the development of higher education in the region in order to improve the economic and cultural life and science of the country. On June 2, 1940 a decree of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee of the Communist Party]] and the Council of People's Commissars of the Karelo-Finnish SSR "About opening of the Karelian-Finnish State University" was published. The leadership of the USSR supported this decision, and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR adopted a resolution № 1209 about the opening of the Karelian-Finnish State University (based on the Karelian State Pedagogical Institute) on June 10, 1940. The university was called KFGU in abbreviated form, consisted of 4 [[faculty (division)|faculties]]: historical and philological, physical and mathematical, biological, geographical and hydrogeological. The goal of university was preparing a large number of specialists for the national economy and the development of scientific research.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=11}}

Formation of the University turned out to very tricky process. A lot of difficult problems had to be solved connected with the simultaneous building of classrooms, accommodation for teachers and students, purchase of the necessary equipment and appliances, integration of scientific university libraries, the development of work plans and teaching aids. However, all these problems have been solved, and in autumn 1940 17 [[Academic department|departments]], which counted 62 teachers, including 5 [[Doctor of Philosophy|PHD]] ([[professor]]s) and 32 [[Docent|associate professors]] began work in the university.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=12}} On September 2, 1940, more than 700 students of all courses began their studying at a young university, 417 people of them were freshmen. On September 7, 1940 a grand opening of the university took place.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=13}}

[[Tuure Lehén|Tuuri Ivanovich Lehen]] was appointed as the [[Rector (academia)|first head]] of the university. Konstantin Dmitrievich Mitropolsky was appointed as the [[Prorector|vice-president]] on Academic Affairs and Research. Faculty deans were appointed:{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=11}}
* M.G. Nikulin - History and Philology Department, 
* A.A. Raykerus - Physics and Mathematics Department, 
* E.D. Manevitch - Department of Biology, 
* M.A. Toikka - geological and hydrological Department.

On May 21, 1941 the Scientific Council was approved, that consisted of 25 members. The Council solved the various issues associated with university life, and could award academic degrees and titles in the following specialties: [[theoretical physics]], [[Human body|human and animal physiology]], [[plant physiology]], [[genetics]], [[History of the Soviet Union|history of the USSR]], [[folklore]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=13}}

=== University in the Great Patriotic War ===

[[File:Finnish advance in Karelia during the Continuation War.png|thumb|right|Finnish advance in Karelia during the [[Continuation War]]. Old border marked in grey.]]

The first [[school year]] was coming to an end, students were passing the [[Test (assessment)|session]] making plans for the summer. But these plans were not realized. On June 22, 1941 at 4.00 am the [[Great Patriotic War]] began. In connection with this event on June 28 the general university [[meeting]] was held in [[Petrozavodsk]] at which the participants expressed their desire to fight against the enemy and to give their strength for the victory over him. During the first months of the [[war]] the students, the members of staff, teachers went to the [[Front (military)|front]], also the rector of the university [[Tuure Lehén|T. I. Lekhen]] was among them.{{sfn|Zolina|1965|p=11}} In total 328 man left to the war.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=15}} The students and teachers made contribution to the struggle against the enemy not only at the battlefield but also in the [[Rear (military)|rear]] they worked at the [[factories]], built [[fortification]]s.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=15}}

At the end of the summer 1941 the front was approaching the city of [[Petrozavodsk]] (on October 1, 1941 Petrozavodsk was completely occupied by the Finnish army). The [[government]] decided to [[Emergency evacuation|evacuate]] the university. They were able to take a significant part of the university property to the town of [[Syktyvkar]] [[Komi Republic]]. The university continued its work there cooperating closely with the Komi pedagogical institute. In this difficult period the leadership of the PetrSU was carried by K. D. Mirtopolsky. Vice-rector of two universities was the rector of the pedagogical institute G. P. Balin.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=16}}

It should be noted that in spite of the hardships of the war the research activities did not cease, although some research topics have changed: now they were focusing on the needs of [[Arms industry|defense industry]], the tasks of the national economic development of the Northern region and an identifying the reserves for military needs. For example, scientists-geologists carried out the exploration of mineral resources in the Republic of Komi and the Urals, and the Department of [[Plant Physiology]] studied the [[Freeze thaw resistance|frost-resisting ability]] of [[potato]], the [[acclimatization]] of [[Nicotiana|tobacco]] and [[sugar beet]]s in the [[North]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=17}}

In June 1944 during the Svir-Petrozavodsk military operation there was the defeat of the [[Military occupation|invaders]] in the south of Karelia. On June 28 of that year soviet troops entered Petrozavodsk. In autumn the whole territory of Karelia was liberated. In June 1944 the government of the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]] decided to return the university to Petrozavodsk. On July 30, 1944 the teachers with their families and students returned to Petrozavodsk from Syktyvkar. During the war the university building was destroyed, all remaining equipment and the library were destroyed. The students and the staff of the university had to make exert every effort on its reconstruction. In the reconstruction the leaders of the Karelian republic took an active part too. The number of teaching staff of the university increased thanks to the teachers who were returning from the front. The new school year 1944 started on October 2, and 242 students began to learn. In summer 1945 the university celebrated its fifth anniversary. In August 1945 in Petrozavodsk State University the new rector V. S. Chepurnov began his activity.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|pp=19-21}}

Hard time of the Great Patriotic War the university survived with dignity, it didn't stop its activity and on the contrary - it directed all the energies for the victory. Its students, teachers and collaborators were working hard and were fighting on the front and in the rear. Unfortunately, not all of them were able to live up to a happy [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]]. During the Great Patriotic War 90 students, teachers and collaborators were killed and were missing. The fate of 42 people is unknown.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=18}} But in spite of everything in the period from 1942 to 1945 years 65 students graduated from the university, among them there were one geographer, three geologists, six mathematicians, 21 biologists, 34 historians and philologists.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=17}}

=== Founding and development of PetrSU during 1950s-1960s ===

During the post-war restoration of the Karelian Republic there was a significant shortage of qualified personnel. To address that problem, the local government in cooperation with [[USSR Ministry of Higher Education]] decreed to expand the university's program in various fields, such us [[heavy industry]], [[civil construction]] and [[agriculture]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}

In 1951, the technical engineering faculty was created, with V. S. Artamonov as dean. That faculty was training [[Forestry|forest engineer]]s, [[agriculturist]]s and [[Zootechnics|zootechnician]]s. In May 1954 that faculty was divided into two separate ones: the forest engineering faculty with the dean [[Alexey Lukashin|A. L. Lukashin]] and the geological prospecting faculty with the dean V. S. Artamonov. In 1956, the forest engineering faculty opened a night school branch for the workers and employees of the [[Onega Tractor Plant]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}
The same year, the [[USSR Ministry of Geology]] saw inexpedient to continue training of geological prospecting specialists within the Karelo-Finnish University, so the last group of geologists graduated from there in 1960.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In 1951, the physics and mathematics faculty and the biological faculty were suspended, and in their place the natural mathematics faculty was created, on which students learned math, biology and agriculture. In February 1954 that faculty was divided into two: the physics and mathematics faculty with the dean A. A. Raikerus and the natural faculty (renamed to agricultural in 1958) with the dean [[Maria Petrovna Mironova|M. P. Mironova]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78}}

On October 8, 1956, the first issue of the large circulation newspaper "Petrozavodsk University" was published.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=87}} The content for the newspaper was being proposed by lecturers and students. The newspaper has a page on the university's website since 1996.{{sfn|Newspaper PetrSU}}

In 1957 the new rules for enrollment were issued, according to these rules the enrollees with at least two years [[work experience]] and [[ex-servicemen]] of the [[Soviet Army]] had an advantage. Shortly before that, the tuition fees were cancelled.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In 1958, the university's faculties were assigned internship bases, according to the new law of linking the school to daily life.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=81}}

From 1957 to 1963, the enrollment to the [[Finnish language]] and literature majors of the History and Philology faculty was temporarily suspended, as the faculty underwent reformations.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=78-79}}

In 1960, the medical faculty was created. Initial yearly enrollment was up to 150 students for the day courses and 50 for the night courses (since 1961). [[Natalya Likhachova|N. B. Likhacheva]], the representative of Leningrad medical school, became the dean.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

[[File:Student on exam.jpg|thumb|left|Part-time student on the exam]]

In 1962, the general technology faculty was created (abbr. GTF, {{lang-ru|ОТФ}}). It consisted of four subjects: mechanics, construction, energetics and technical. The faculty also conducted [[night courses]] and [[correspondence courses]] in more than 50 disciplines in three years, after which the students were transferred into other engineering subjects within the university, or to other technical universities of the country.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

On June 16, 1964 by a decree of Central Committee of the USSR Communist Party and the USSR Council of Ministries the university was named after [[Otto Wille Kuusinen|O. V. Kuusinen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.karelia.ru/gov/Different/Dates/index.html?month=6 Calendar of important dates]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, from the construction discipline a new faculty of industrial and civil construction was created (abbr. ICC, {{lang-ru|ПГС}}) with professor [[Vladimir Kazin|V. V. Kazin]] as dean.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

Because of all these reformations, the university managed to become a source of wide-purpose qualified workforce, the income of new students increased considerably as well as the numbers of professors and lecturers. For example, in 1970 the university had 483 lecturers working in 47 departments, 30 of them being Ph.D. or professors, and 190 assistant professors. The final number of employees came to 529.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=79}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, extensive [[scientific research]] was being conducted within the university, for example, the students and professors of the History and Philology faculty actively participated in archeological, folklorist and linguistic expeditions, gathering valuable information on the history and culture of the [[native peoples]] of the republic. Thanks to the works of some historians, a large number of new documentary sources were unveiled to a wide range of readers.
The university's [[linguist]]s took part in assembling Russian-Finnish and Finnish-Russian [[dictionary|dictionaries]] (published in 1947, 1955, 1963). The [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM field]] scientists of the university also conducted valuable research and acquired particular results, such as developing methods of separation and analysis of optically active isomers of important biological compounds - [[amino acids]], [[Lipid|phosphatides]]; or studies into the [[Fatigue (material)|process of destruction of metals and alloys]] due to material fatigue.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=81-83}}

Within the same time period, the non-curricular student life was developing swiftly. In 1952, the university's theatrical studio was created by an [[Meritorious Artist|Honored Artist]] of Karelia, [[Yuri Alexandrovich Sungurov|Y. A. Sungurov]]. It staged [[Performance|various play]]s based on the works of [[Alexander Ostrovsky|A. Ostrovsky]], [[Lev Ivanovich Oshanin|L. Oshanin]], [[Aleksei Arbuzov|A. Arbuzov]], [[Bertolt Brecht|B. Brecht]], that were warmly welcomed by the viewers. At the same time, a Finnish dramatical club was created under the supervision of an Honored Artist of USSR and Karelia [[Toivo Lankinen|T. I. Lankinen]]. 1962 is the birth year of the [[university's academic choir]], led by [[G. E. Terazuyanets]]. In 1964, the [[tourist club]] "Sampo" was founded under the supervision of [[Yury Lanev|Y. S. Lanev]], to guide hundreds of students into the wild unknown during the years. In 1966, the [[International Friendship club]] "The Globe" was created, which conducted numerous events for establishing international academic connections. Special attention was also paid to the [[physical education]], various sports sections were created, of which the [[Ski-orienteering|skiing section]] was prevalent.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=87-88}}

During the period of 1951-1970, about 7 thousand specialists graduated from the university and were highly praised not only in Karelia, but overall.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=90}}

{{Spoken Wikipedia|En-PetrSU (part History 1970-1985).ogg|2016-04-24}}

Thanks to the coordinated efforts of university employees, the Karelian-Finnish State University's influence grew rapidly in Karelia and the European North.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=216}}

In 1973, [[Mikhail Shumilov]] became the new rector of the university. He had a PhD in History and was well known for his monographs about the history of Karelia and Northern Europe.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=216}}

In 1975, the Department of Accounting was opened in the university as a part of the School of Mathematics and Physics. The main impetus behind the opening of this department was the lack of qualified accountants and economists in Karelia. The first class of accounting students graduated in 1979 and consisted of 52 young specialists. In 1980, the School of Economics was opened. It consisted of three departments: political economy, accounting and economic activity, and sectorial economy. The first dean of the school was [[Sergey Polyakov (economist)|S. N. Polyakov]]. In 1982, he was replaced by [[Anatoly Rusakov|A. G. Rusakov]].{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

[[File:Entrants in the entrance exams.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Entrants in the entrance exams (in gym).]]

To increase the popularity of the University among prospective [[Abitur|students]], departments and schools of the University put a lot of effort in distributing information about the university in Karelia and neighboring areas.  Additionally, a number of special training courses (recruiting about 1,800 people) were organized. University teachers organized meetings with high school students where they talked about opportunities the students would get at the university. The so-called "Open Door Days"&lt;ref&gt;The special days when people can visit Departments of the University and to get information about University.&lt;/ref&gt; were organized regularly. As a result, competition for admission grew to about 2.3 students per available slot.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

Special attention was paid to improvement of the level of teacher qualification. Teachers now could take additional vacation to earn master and doctoral (PhD) degrees. The university had 40-50 graduate students each year.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=217}}

In 1970s special attention was also paid to the technical equipment of the university. Eight classrooms were equipped to display [[film|movies]] and two classrooms became language [[language lab|laboratories]]. Computer classrooms were also upgraded and the third generation computers [[ES EVM|ES-1022 and ES-1035]] were installed.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=218}}

PetrSU was one of the first universities that implemented an integrated program of the [[Ministry of Higher and Secondary Special Education of the USSR|USSR Ministry of Higher Education]] called "[[Industrial control system|ICS]]-university". To improve the work of the university, the university researchers developed a number of software systems including "Entrant", "Number of students", "Session", "Current control", "Social and political practice," "Graduate student," "Control of decision implementation", and "Human Resources Staff".{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=219}}

From the early 1970s to 1985, approximately 14,300 students graduated from the university.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=228}}

=== PetrSU in 1985-1990 ===
In the second half of the 1980s, system of higher education of [[Soviet Union]] was reorganized. 
In 1987,  the [[Central Committee of the CPSU]] and the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR]] published decrees, which said that university education was the most perfect form for organization and education of youth.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=332-333}}

In 1986, technical faculty was abolished within the framework of general changes in the university. Faculty of history and philology was divided into two independent faculties – philological and historical. The faculty of physics and mathematics was divided into the faculty of physics and the faculty of mathematics also.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=333}}

University management has always held the view that the education system had to be constantly improved, so in the second half of 1980 educational and work plans were revised, modified or supplemented in all faculties. In the training sessions the priority was given to active and creative mastery of the material. From this moment students have more time for independent work.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=334}}

In 1987, in the framework of the program aimed at continuous development of education, courses for improve of professional skills were created for leading workers of the national economy.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=335}}

In the second half of the 1980s, cooperation with foreign universities was expanded. Relations were established with the universities of the cities of [[Oulu]] and Kupio ([[Finland]]), [[Umeå]] ([[Sweden]]), [[Duluth]] ([[United States]]). There was an exchange of teachers and students between universities and PetrSU and also joint scientifics researches were conducted.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=339}}

In 1988, the construction of a new university building was started, called Drevlyanka, district of Petrozavodsk.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=340}}

During this period, public student deaneries, which dealt with issues related to the [[scholarship]] and extracurricular pastime of students, were created at the mathematical, physical, medical and biological faculties.{{sfn|Shumilov|2005|p=340}}

{{Anthropology}}
'''Political Economy''' in anthropology is the application of the theories and methods of [[Historical Materialism]] to the traditional concerns of anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies. Political Economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture. Most anthropologists moved away from modes of production analysis typical of structural Marxism, and focused instead on the complex historical relations of class, culture and hegemony in regions undergoing complex colonial and capitalist transitions in the emerging world system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|pages=161–85|doi=10.1146/annurev.an.17.100188.001113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political Economy was introduced in American anthropology primarily through the support of [[Julian Steward]], a student of [[Alfred L. Kroeber|Kroeber]]. Steward’s research interests centered on “subsistence” — the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work. This emphasis on subsistence and production - as opposed to exchange - is what distinguishes the Political Economy approach. Steward's most theoretically productive years were from 1946-1953, while teaching at [[Columbia University]].  At this time, Columbia saw an influx of [[World War II]] [[veteran]]s who were attending school thanks to the [[GI Bill]]. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would go on to develop Political Economy as a distinct approach in anthropology, including [[Sidney Mintz]], [[Eric Wolf]], [[Eleanor Leacock]], [[Roy Rappaport]], [[Stanley Diamond]], Robert Manners, [[Morton Fried]], [[Robert F. Murphy (anthropologist)|Robert F. Murphy]], and influenced other scholars such as [[Elman Service]], [[Marvin Harris]] and June Nash. Many of these students participated in the Puerto Rico Project, a large-scale group research study that focused on modernization in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Anthropologies and Histories: essays in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutcgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=146–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlins' work on hunter-gatherers as the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist world-system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt;

More recently, these political economists have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial) capitalism around the world.

==Theory==

===Cultural materialism===
{{main|Cultural materialism (anthropology)}}
Cultural materialism is a research orientation introduced by [[Marvin Harris]] in 1968 (''The Rise of Anthropological Theory''),&lt;ref name=Harris2001a&gt;{{citation |date=2001a |origyear=1968 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0132-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUUYN3X18dwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rise+Anthropological+Theory&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KySLTMqBFI2IvgOjtY0Y&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a theoretical paradigm and research strategy. Indeed, it is said to be the most enduring achievement of that work.&lt;ref name=Margolis&gt;{{citation |year=2001 |last=Margolis |first=Maxine L |authorlink=Maxine Margolis |contribution=Introduction |editor=Marvin Harris |title=The Rise of Anthropological Theory: A History of Theories of Culture |series=2001a |origyear=1968 |page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris subsequently developed a defense of the paradigm in his 1979 book ''Cultural Materialism''.&lt;ref name=Harris2001b&gt;{{citation |date=2001b |origyear=1979 |author=Harris, Marvin |authorlink=Marvin Harris |title=Cultural Materialism: the Struggle for a Science of Culture |edition=Updated |place=Walnut Creek, California |publisher=AltaMira Press |isbn=0-7591-0134-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xc9DMbB5KQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22materialism%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=meSKTIetFMu8cZOwyMkE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2010}} Paperback {{ISBN|0-7591-0135-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Harris, cultural materialism "is based on the simple premise that human social life is a response to the practical problems of earthly existence".&lt;ref name=Harris2001bpxv&gt;Harris, Marvin (2001b), p.xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris' approach was influenced by but distinct from Marx. Harris' method was to demonstrate how particular cultural practices (like the Hindu prohibition on harming cattle) served a materialistic function (such as preserving an essential source of fertilizer from being consumed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Marvin|title=Cows, pigs, wars &amp; witches; the riddles of culture|year=1974|publisher=Random House|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic behavior has a cultural side which indicates that the works of anthropologists is relevant to economics. The Motivation behind cultural materialism is mainly to show that cultures adapt to the environment they're produced in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Materialism and Institutional Economics|last=Jackson|first=William|publisher=Review of Social Economy|year=1996|isbn=|location=University of York|pages=225–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural Marxism===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
Structural Marxism was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and anthropologists outside France during the 1970s. French structuralist Marxism melded Marxist political economy with [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Levi-Strauss]]'s [[Structuralism|structural]] methodology, eliminating the human subject, dialectical reason and history in the process. Structural Marxists introduced two major concepts, mode of production and social formation, that allowed for a more prolonged and uneven transition to capitalism than either dependency or World systems theory allowed for.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 161–85"/&gt; A [[mode of production]] consisting of producers, non-producers and [[means of production]], combined in a variety of ways, formed the deep structure of a "social formation." A social formation combined (or "articulated") several modes of production, only one of which was dominant or determinant. Primary anthropological theorists of this school included [[Maurice Godelier]], [[Claude Meillassoux]], Emmanuel Terray and Pierre-Philippe Rey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Chris Hann]]|first=[[Keith Hart (anthropologist)|Keith Hart]]|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|pages=73–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s. In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures.&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural materialism===
Critical influences on Structural Marxism, primarily from the British Marxist historical tradition, included [[E. P. Thompson|E.P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]] and [[Raymond Williams]]. They criticized the functionalist emphasis in Structural Marxism, that neglected individuals in favour of the structural elements of their model. The British school was more interested in class, culture and politics, and placed human subjects at the centre of analysis. Where mode of production analysis was abstract, they focused on people. Where world-systems theory had little to say about the local, the Cultural Materialists began and ended there. Others connected with this school of thought concentrated on issues such as ethnic formation, labor migration, remittances, household formation, food production and the processes of colonialism.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=172|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The anthropology of pre-capitalist societies ==
[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumbnail|Dobe !Kung men lighting a fire.]]
{{main|Original affluent society}}
As anthropologists embraced "mode of production" analysis in the 1950s, they struggled to adapt its evolutionary model to the groups that they had traditionally worked with. While Marxist analysis was developed to account for capitalist society and its class dynamics, it had little to say about "pre-capitalist" societies, other than to define them by what they were not.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 172"/&gt; One of the first attempts to theorize [[Hunter-gatherer]] society was [[Marshall Sahlins]] ''Stone Age Economics'' (1972) which overturned nineteenth century ideas that characterized life in such societies as "nasty, brutish and short". Sahlins demonstrated that actual existing hunter-gatherers lived in "the original affluent society"; their needs were met with relatively little work leaving them with far more leisure time than western industrial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard B. Lee|Richard B. Lee's]] work amongst the [[ǃKung people|Dobe !Kung]] of Botswana provided a detailed case study of the argument, even in one of the most hostile desert environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Richard B.|title=The Dobe Ju/'hoansi 3rd edition|year=2002|publisher=Wadsworth Thomson|location=Belmont CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of Sahlins' book applies Chayanov's theories to develop a theory of a "Domestic mode of production." Given the argument of the "original affluent society" that many of these societies had abundant resources, Sahlins argued that the limit on production was the amount of labour available. Young families with many dependent children had to work harder, whereas older families with mature children and many workers worked much less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Durrenberger|first=Paul|title=A Shower of Rain: Marshall Sahlins's Stone Age Economics Twenty-five years later|journal=Culture &amp; Agriculture|year=1998|volume=20|issue=2/3|pages=103–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final sections developed a theory of reciprocity discussed above.

An alternate model of the Domestic Mode of Production was developed by Eric Wolf, who rejected the evolutionary implications of Sahlins' model and argued that this mode of production should be viewed as the product of developing colonial trade relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several collections addressing the question of mode of production analysis in classless societies came out in this period, including "''The Anthropology of Pre-Capitalist Societies''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Joel Kahn|first=Joseph Llobera|title=The Anthropology of Pre-capitalist Societies|year=1981|publisher=Macmillan|location=Basingstoke}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "''Marxist Analysis and Social Anthropology''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maurice Bloch ed.|title=Marxist analysis and Social Anthropology|year=1975|publisher=Tavistock|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the state==
{{main|State formation}}
Political economists such as [[Morton Fried]], [[Elman Service]], and [[Eleanor Leacock]] took a Marxist approach and sought to understand the origins and development of inequality in human society. Marx and Engels had drawn on the ethnographic work of [[Lewis H. Morgan]], and these authors now extended that tradition. In particular, they were interested in the evolution of social systems over time.

==Colonialism and imperialism==
[[File:Rhodes and Africa from Cairo to Cape Town.jpg|thumbnail|right|Cecil Rhodes, driving force of British imperialism in Africa]]

===Articulated modes of production===
The articulation of modes of production within a single formation was meant to account for the influence of colonialism on lineage modes of production, primarily in the African context. According to Hann and Hart, the short lived success of the theory was that

&lt;blockquote&gt;it produced a version of structural-functionalism at once sufficiently different from the original to persuade English-speakers that they were learning Marxism and similar enough to allow them to retain their customary way of thinking, which had been temporarily discredited by its role in the administration of empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chris Hann|first=Keith Hart|title=Economic Anthropology: History, Ethnography, Critique|year=2011|publisher=Polity Press|location=Cambridge|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===World-systems theory and dependency theory===
{{main|World-systems theory|Dependency theory}}
Dependency Theory arose as a theory in Latin America in reaction to [[modernization theory]]. It argues that resources flow from a "periphery" of poor and underdeveloped states to a "core" of wealthy states, enriching the latter at the expense of the former. It is a central contention of dependency theory that poor states are impoverished and rich ones enriched by the way poor states are integrated into the "[[World-system]]" and hence poor countries will not follow Rostow's predicted path of modernization. Dependency Theory rejected Rostow's view, arguing that underdeveloped countries are not merely primitive versions of developed countries, but have unique features and [[structuralism|structures]] of their own; and, importantly, are in the situation of being the weaker members in a world market economy and hence unable to change the system.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=166|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immanuel Wallerstein's "world-systems theory" was the version of Dependency Theory that most North American anthropologists engaged with. His theories are similar to Dependency Theory, although he placed more emphasis on the system as system, and focused on the developments of the core rather than periphery. Wallerstein also provided an historical account of the development of capitalism which had been missing from Dependency Theory.&lt;ref name="Roseberry 1988 166"/&gt;

Both versions of Dependency Theory were critiqued throughout the 1970s for the static historical accounts they provided. Their influence was slowly replaced by more dynamic and historically sensitive versions, such as Eric Wolf's "Europe and the People Without History."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roseberry|first=William|title=Political Economy|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|year=1988|volume=17|page=167|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.17.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eric Wolf and ''Europe and the people without history''===
{{main|Europe and the people without history}}
[[File:16th century Portuguese Spanish trade routes.png|thumbnail|left|16th-century Portuguese (blue) and Spanish (white) trade routes]]
"Europe and the people without history" is history written on a global scale, tracing the connections between communities, regions, peoples and nations that are usually treated as discrete subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins in 1400 with a description of the trade routes a world traveller might have encountered, the people and societies they connected, and the civilizational processes trying to incorporate them. From this, Wolf traces the emergence of Europe as a global power, and the reorganization of particular world regions for the production of goods now meant for global consumption. Wolf differs from World Systems theory in that he sees the growth of Europe until the late eighteenth century operating in a tributary framework, and not capitalism. He examines the way that colonial state structures were created to protect tributary populations involved in the silver, fur and slave trades.  Whole new "tribes" were created as they were incorporated into circuits of mercantile accumulation. The final section of the book deals with the transformation in these global networks as a result of the growth of capitalism with the industrial revolution. Factory production of textiles in England, for example transformed cotton production in the American South and Egypt, and eliminated textile production in India. All these transformations are connected in a single structural change. Each of the world's regions are examined in terms of the goods they produced in the global division of labour, as well as the mobilization and migration of whole populations (such as African slaves) to produce these goods. Wolf uses [[labor market segmentation]] to provide a historical account of the creation of ethnic segmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=127–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where World Systems theory had little to say about the periphery, Wolf's emphasis is on the people "without history" (i.e. not given a voice in western histories) and on how they were active participants in the creation of new cultural and social forms emerging in the context of commercial empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Maritime Fur Trade-WorldContext.png|thumbnail|Maritime Fur Trade, 1790-1840.]]
Wolf distinguishes between three modes of production: capitalist, kin-ordered, and tributary. Wolf does not view them as an evolutionary sequence. He begins with capitalism because he argues our understanding of kin-ordered and tributary modes is coloured by our understanding of capitalism. He argues they are not evolutionary precursors of capitalism, but the product of the encounter between the West and the Rest. In the tributary mode, direct producers possess their own means of production, but their surplus production is taken from them through extra economic means. This appropriation is usually by some form of strong or weak state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=131–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the kin-ordered mode of production, social labour is mobilized through kin relations (such as lineages), although his description makes its exact relations with tributary and capitalist modes unclear. The kin mode was further theorized by French structuralist Marxists in terms of 'articulated modes of production.' The kin-ordered mode is distinct again from Sahlins' formulation of the domestic mode of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roseberry|first=William|title="European History and the Construction of Anthropological Subjects" in Anthropologies and Histories: essay in culture, history and political economy|year=1989|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unfree labour and slavery==
Liberal and neo-liberal market-based societies are predicated upon the concept of "free labour" - workers enter a labour market freely, and enter into contractual relations with employers voluntarily. "Unfree labour" - otherwise known as bond labour, debt bondage, debt peonage, and slavery, are thought to be archaic forms that will be eliminated with capitalist development. Anthropologists working in a wide variety of current situations have documented that the incidence of bonded labour is much greater than capitalist ideology would lead us to expect.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brass|first=Tom|title=Towards a Comparative Political Economy of Unfree Labour: Case Studies and Debates|year=1999|publisher=Frank Cass|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Debt: The first 5,000 years|year=2011|publisher=Melville House|location=Brooklyn, NY|pages=349–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Brass argues that unfree labour is not an archaic holdover in today's world, but an active process of deproletarianization of agricultural workers to provide rural agrarian capitalists with cheaper labour. In the constant drive to cheapen the cost of agricultural labour, debt bondage is used to tie workers to specific employers, lower their wages, and extract further unpaid labour from them. He illustrates this process at work in Peru and India.&lt;ref name="Brass 1999"/&gt;

An early study of debt bondage was [[Ann Laura Stoler]]'s ''Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979'' (1985). Stoler examined the tobacco plantations of the Deli Maatschappij, one of the most profitable Dutch colonial corporations of the 19th century. The Deli company imported large numbers of Chinese indentured labourers to [[Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]], where they were treated not as employees, but as contractors. As contractors they had to buy all their supplies at inflated prices from the company, take all the risks of cultivation and processing, and finally sell their tobacco to the company at prices it set. They were kept in perpetual debt, unable to change employers, in working conditions that resulted in extraordinarily high death rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoler|first=Ann|title=Capitalism and Confrontation in Sumatra's Plantation Belt, 1870-1979|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jan Breman extended this analysis of the "Coolie regulation" (which allowed for indentured labour) to the Dutch mining industry in the [[Netherlands East Indies]] (Indonesia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Breman|first=Jan|title=Taming the Coolie Beast : Plantation Society and the Colonial Order in Southeast Asia|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery is but one form of unfree (or bound) labour. Structural Marxists sought to theorize it as a mode of production. Claude Meillassoux has refined this approach in his study of pre-colonial African slavery. He analyzed the military and aristocratic systems that organized the capture of slaves and situated it within the politics of the merchants who organized the trade in slaves. His work focuses on the forces at play within a kinship organized polity that define slaves culturally as "anti-kin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meillassoux|first=Claude|title=The Anthropology of Slavery: The Womb of Iron and Gold|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Simple commodity production and the peasantry===
{{main|Simple commodity production}}
Simple commodity production (also known as "petty commodity production") is a term coined by [[Frederick Engels]] to describe productive activities under the conditions of what Marx had called the "simple exchange" of [[commodities]], where independent producers such as peasants trade their own products. The use of the word "simple" does not refer to the nature of the producers or of their production, but to the relatively simple and straightforward exchange processes involved. Simple commodity production is compatible with many ''different'' relations of production, ranging from [[self-employment]] where the producer owns his means of production, and family labour, to forms of [[slavery]], [[peonage]], [[indentured labour]], and [[serfdom]].

===Capitalist transitions and agrarian change===
{{main|Anthropology of development}}
Michael Taussig, for example, examined the reactions of peasant farmers in Columbia as they struggled to understand how money could make interest. Taussig highlights that we have [[Commodity fetishism|fetishized]] money. We view money as an active agent, capable of doing things, of growth. In viewing money as an active agent, we obscure the social relationships that actually give money its power. The Columbian peasants, seeking to explain how money could bear interest, turned to folk beliefs like the "baptism of money" to explain how money could grow. Dishonest individuals would have money baptized, which would then become an active agent; whenever used to buy goods, it would escape the till and return to its owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taussig|first=Michael|title=The Genesis of Capitalism Amongst a South American Peasantry: Devil's Labor and the Baptism of Money|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|year=1977|volume=19|issue=2|pages=130–155|doi=10.1017/S0010417500008586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in 1969 by [[Eric Wolf]], ''Peasant Wars of the Twentieth Century'', is a comparative view of the [[peasant]] [[revolution]]s of [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Algeria]], and [[Cuba]].

===The moral economy of the peasant===
The concept of a [[moral economy]] was first elaborated by English historian [[E.P. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was developed further in anthropological studies of other peasant economies. Thompson wrote of the moral economy of the poor in the context of widespread food riots in the English countryside in the late eighteenth century. According to Thompson these riots were generally peaceable acts that demonstrated a common political culture rooted in feudal rights to “set the price” of essential goods in the market. These peasants held that a traditional “fair price” was more important to the community than a “free” market price and they punished large farmers who sold their surpluses at higher prices outside the village while there were still those in need within the village. The notion of a non-capitalist cultural mentalité using the market for its own ends has been linked by others (with Thompson's approval) to subsistence agriculture and the need for subsistence insurance in hard times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Edward P.|title=Customs in Common|year=1991|publisher=New Press|location=New York|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cambodiaricefarming1.jpg|thumbnail|Cambodian rice farming]]
The concept was widely popularized in anthropology through the book, "The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia" by [[James C. Scott]] (1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=James C.|title=The Moral Economy of the Peasant: Rebellion and Subsistence in Southeast Asia|year=1976|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book begins with a telling metaphor of peasants being like a man standing up to his nose in water; the smallest wave will drown him. Similarly, peasants generally live so close to the subsistence line that it takes little to destroy their livelihoods. From this, he infers a set of economic principles that it would be rational for them to live by. It is important to emphasize that this book was not based on fieldwork, and itself proposed a cross-cultural universalistic model of peasant economic behaviour based upon a set of fixed theoretical principles, not a reading of peasant culture. Firstly, he argued that peasants were "risk averse", or, put differently, followed a "safety first" principle. They would not adopt risky new seeds or technologies, no matter how promising, because tried and true traditional methods had demonstrated, not promised, effectiveness. This gives peasants an unfair reputation as "traditionalist" when in fact they are just risk averse. Secondly, Scott argues that peasant society provides "subsistence insurance" for its members to tide them over those occasions when natural or man-made disaster strikes. Although fieldwork has not supported many of Scott's conclusions, the book encouraged a generation of researchers.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Protein combining''' (or '''protein complementing''') is a dietary theory for [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition that purports to optimize the [[biological value]] of protein intake. According to the theory, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] diets may provide an insufficient amount of some [[essential amino acids]], making protein combining with multiple foods necessary to obtain a [[complete protein]]. The terms ''complete'' and ''incomplete'' are outdated in relation to plant protein. The position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of protein combining has been discredited by major health organizations. Studies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins has shown that vegetarians and vegans do not actually need to complement plant proteins in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied and caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=V.

==Concept==
Protein nutrition is complex because any [[proteinogenic amino acid]] may be the [[limiting factor]] in [[metabolism]]. Mixing [[livestock feed]]s can optimize for growth, or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth. Similarly, [[human nutrition]] is subject to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]]: The lowest level of one of the essential amino acids will be the limiting factor in metabolism.
:If the content of a single indispensable amino acid in the diet is less than the individual’s requirement, then it will limit the utilization of other amino acids and thus prevent the normal rates of synthesis even when the total nitrogen intake level is adequate. Thus the "limiting amino acid" will determine the nutritional value of the total nitrogen or protein in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board of [[Institute of Medicine]] (2005) ''Dietary Reference Intakes for'' [http://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Protein and Amino Acids], page 685, from [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants are thus rated as protein sources by their limiting amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long | format = PDF |  id= | pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of "limiting" amino acids in plant protein ===
According to WHO, human need for proteins is 0.66 g per kg of bodyweight per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joint WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation|first=|date=2007|title=Protein and amino acid requirements in human nutrition|journal=World Health Organization Technical Report Series|volume=|issue=935|pages=pag 88 – table 4|issn=0512-3054|pmid=18330140|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43411/1/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a 70&amp;nbsp;kg person has an estimated protein requirement of 46.2g (70&amp;nbsp;kg x 0,66 g/kg).

In addition, there is a specific need of essential amino acids quantities, thereby written in the table.

In the above example, the combination of both whole rice and canned chickpeas has no limiting amino acids, that means that only consuming rice and chickpeas, in these specific quantities of 306g/day and 261g/day respectively, for long periods of time, would not result in any of the essential amino acid deficiency.

As the data of the example show, all essential amino acids are found in a specific plant, however one of them may or may not be 'limiting', that is, present in quantities below the WHO daily recommendation.
For this reasons vegan and vegetarian diets need to be varied in terms of plants consumed.

==Plant protein research==
The first biochemist to enter the field was [[Karl Heinrich Ritthausen]], a student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Burr Osborne]] continued what Ritthausen started and published ''The Vegetable Proteins'' in 1909. Thus [[Yale University]] was the early center of protein nutrition, where [[William Cumming Rose]] was a student. Osborne also worked to determine the essentials, and later led the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Chicago]].

When Ritthausen died in 1912, Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry:
:As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins; and he was the first to direct attention to this fact, and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Osborne, Thomas Burr]] (1913) "In Memoriam: Heinrich Ritthausen", ''Biochemical Bulletin'' 2:338, published by the [[Columbia University]] Biochemical Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne then joined forces with [[Lafayette Mendel]] at the [[Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] took this knowledge to India and Guatemala. He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of [[kwashiorkor]]. In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize, while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/nevin-s-scrimshaw-obituary-0211.html Scrimshaw obituary] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularization==
In 1954, [[Adelle Davis]] published ''Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit'', which described the importance of combining "incomplete" proteins to make "complete" proteins, and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Adelle|title=Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit|date=1954|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=4-87187-961-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Frances Moore Lappé]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in [[vegetarian nutrition]]. The book became a [[bestseller]] :
:An extension of a one-page handout that Lappé had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley, ''Diet for a Small Planet'' (1971) soon became ''the'' vegetarian text of the [[ecology movement]], selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Belasco (1989) ''Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 — 1988'', page 56, [[Pantheon Books]] {{ISBN|0394543998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lappé wrote:
:Complementary protein combinations make for delicious [[recipe]]s – they are combinations that formed the basis of the world’s traditional [[cuisine]]s. We use them naturally in our cooking without even being aware of it. The three most common complementary protein combinations are:
:#Grains (rice, corn, wheat, barley, etc.) + legumes (peas, beans, lentils)
:#Grains and milk products
:#Seeds (Sesame or sunflower) +legumes&lt;ref name=FML&gt;[[Frances Moore Lappé|Lappé, Frances Moore]] (1981) ''Diet for a Small Planet'', {{ISBN|0-345-32120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}

In 1975, both [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and [[American Journal of Nursing]] carried articles describing the principles and practice of protein combining.&lt;ref&gt;Judith S. Stern (1975) "How to stay well on a vegetarian diet and save money too!", [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] 165(2):150,1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor R. Williams (1975) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3423700 Making Vegetarian Diets Nutritious], [[American Journal of Nursing]] 75(12):2168–73 from [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For a time, 
The [[United States National Research Council|American National Research Council]] and the [[American Dietetic Association]] (ADA) cautioned vegetarians to be sure to combine their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Donna. (2002). Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. {{ISBN|1-56639-936-X}}. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the principle of protein combining was explained by J. Rigó:
:The [[biological value]] of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in [[cereal]]s and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the biological value ... [is] given by the technique of complementing.&lt;ref&gt;Rigó, J. (1985) "Nutritional Functions of Cereals", in ''Amino Acid Composition and Biological Value of Cereal'', Radomir Lásztity &amp; Máté Hidvégi editors, [[International Association for Cereal Chemistry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[PLOS ONE]]published an article investigating the specifics of protein combining for 1251 plant-based foods. The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition, and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal. They explain, "complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone."&lt;ref name=FW&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woolf | first1 = P.

==Criticism==

Protein combining has drawn criticism as an unnecessary complicating factor in [[nutrition]].

In 1981,    [[Frances Moore Lappé]] changed her position on protein combining from a decade prior in a revised edition of  ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' in which she wrote:

:"In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.

:"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] [[fruit]] or on [2] some tubers, such as [[sweet potato]]es or [[cassava]], or on [3] [[junk food]] (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein."&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|162}}

Necessity of protein combining was not asserted. Rather, the increased [[biological value]] of meals where proteins are combined was noted. In a concession, Lappé removed from the second edition "charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins".&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|239}}

The American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism. Suzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:
:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went ahead and made that change in the paper.  [Note: The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.]

In 1994, Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans. It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary. Thus, people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets.&lt;ref name="VRYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long| pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins, especially [[lysine]], and to a lesser extent [[methionine]] and [[threonine]], eating a variety of plants can serve as a well-balanced and complete source of amino acids.&lt;ref name="VRYoung" /&gt;

Pediatrician [[Charles R. Attwood]] wrote, "The old ideas about the necessity of carefully combining vegetables at every meal to ensure the supply of essential amino acids has been totally refuted."&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, Charles R. [http://www.vegsource.com/attwood/complete_protein.htm "Complete" Proteins?], VegSource.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[John A. McDougall|Dr. John McDougall]] wrote a correction to the American Heart Association for a 2001 publication that questioned the completeness of plant proteins, and further asserted that "it is impossible to design an amino acid–deficient diet based on the amounts of unprocessed starches and vegetables sufficient to meet the calorie needs of humans."&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDougall|first1=J|title=Plant foods have a complete amino acid composition|journal=Circulation|date=25 Jun 2002|volume=105|issue=25|page=:e197|pmid=12082008|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000018905.97677.1F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Dr. [[Andrew Weil]] wrote that "you don’t have to worry that you won’t get enough usable protein if you don’t put together some magical combination of foods at each meal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA142995 Vegetarians: Pondering Protein?], DrWeil.com, Dec. 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Healthy Times'' Jeff Novick wrote that the necessity of protein combining is a "myth that won’t go away".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-complementary-protein-myth-wont-go-away.html Complementary Protein Myth Won't Go Away!],
Jeff Novick, M.S., R.D., ''Healthy Times'' (May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]] wrote:
:...plant foods have plenty of protein and you do not have to be a nutritional scientist or dietitian to figure out what to eat and you don’t need to mix and match foods to achieve protein completeness.  Any combination of natural foods will supply you with adequate protein, including all eight essential amino acids as well as unessential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuhrman|first1=Joel|title=Eat to Live|date=2005|publisher=Little Brown|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[T. Colin Campbell]] wrote in 2006:
:We now know that through enormously complex metabolic systems, the human body can derive all the essential amino acids from the natural variety of plant proteins that we encounter every day. It doesn’t require eating higher quantities of plant protein or meticulously planning every meal.&lt;ref name="ChinaStudy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=T. Colin|last2=Campbell|first2=Thomas M.|title=The China Study|date=2006|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=1935251007|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|American Dietetic Association]] wrote: 
:Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met. Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults, thus, complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=July 2009|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1267–1268|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027|pmid=19562864 | last1 = Craig | first1 = WJ | last2 = Mangels | first2 = AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heart Association now states:
:You don’t need to eat foods from animals to have enough protein in your diet. Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and non-essential amino acids, as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs. Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts all contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. You don’t need to consciously combine these foods (“complementary proteins”) within a given meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegetarian, Vegan Diet &amp; Heart Health|url=https://www.goredforwomen.org/live-healthy/first-steps-to-prevent-heart-disease-and-be-heart-healthy/vegetarian-vegan-diet-heart-health/|website=Go Red For Women|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=13 January 2017|ref=GoRed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions use the [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] to assess diets without consideration of protein combining and hence find the use of combinations to be a challenge to their methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The '''Railway Technical Centre''' (RTC) in London Road, [[Derby]], England, was built by the [[British Railways Board]] in the early 1960s to be its technical headquarters. [[British Rail]] was able to announce that "The Railway Technical Centre at Derby is the largest railway research complex in the world."

The RTC centralised most of the technical services provided by the regional Chief Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineers (CM&amp;EE) to form the Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering (DM&amp;EE). In addition, it housed the newly formed [[British Rail Research Division]] which reported directly to the Board. The latter is well known for its work on the experimental [[Advanced Passenger Train]] (APT-E). At that early stage this was a concept vehicle, and in time the DM&amp;EE applied the new knowledge to existing practice in the design of the [[InterCity 125|High Speed Train]] (HST), the later prototype APT-P and other high-speed vehicles.

==History==
===Opening===
The Research Division was the first to move into the purpose-built accommodation on London Road. This was formed initially with personnel from other departments around the country, including the Electrical Research Division from [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the Mechanical Engineers Research Section,  the Civil Engineering Research Unit (Track Lab), and the Chemical Research Unit, while the Scientific Services Division occupied the former [[LMS Scientific Research Laboratory]] building across the road known as Hartley House. The embryo RTC site (mainly Kelvin House and the Research Test Hall) was officially opened by the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] in May 1964.&lt;ref&gt;"British Railways Research Department Expanded" ''[[Railway Gazette International|Railway Gazette]]'' 5 June 1964 page 425&lt;/ref&gt; Later additional buildings were added: Trent House and Derwent House, the Advanced Projects lab, then Stephenson House, Lathkill House and finally Brunel House. 

===Department of Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering===
In addition to the research employees, the RTC became the headquarters of the DM&amp;EE. This brought together engineers from the regional departments, together with its Drawing Offices, the Testing &amp; Performance Section and the Engineering Development Unit workshop (EDU) from [[Darlington]], the Workshops Division (which later became [[British Rail Engineering Limited]]) and it was also home to the Board's Central Purchasing Department. Strange to relate but the layout of equipment within the new workshop was as near as possible the same as the original. Following this came the Plastics Development Unit from [[Eastleigh]], which, among other innovations, was responsible for the design of the High Speed Train's streamlined cabs as well as the prototype [[British Rail Mark 3|Mark 3]] coach doors.

===Test tracks===
When research and testing required stretches of real railway line, the Research Division used the [[Old Dalby Test Track]], and at [[Mickleover]] in Derby and The High Marnham Test Track, the former LD&amp;ECR from Shirebrook to Tuxford where one of Network Rail's RIDC is located.

== RTC today ==
At [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]], most of the facilities were taken over by commercial railway engineering companies, and it was marketed as the "rtc Business Park" renting space to a range of small consultancy firms. 

===Research===
The only facility which is still used for railway research is the moving-model aerodynamic test facility. 

===Repairs===
The former RTC site is also used by [[LORAM Maintenance of Way, Inc.#United Kingdom|LORAM]] to carry out repairs and maintenance on railway vehicles. It was also used by Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services (RC&amp;WS) which went into liquidation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/L-60495-1816069 |title=Rampart Carriage &amp; Wagon Services Ltd |publisher=Thegazette.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storage===
A large part of the site is used as storage and an operating base by LORAM and [[Network Rail]], whose rolling stock on site forms part of Network Rail testing trains. Usual traction on these trains is either [[Colas Rail]] [[British Rail Class 37|class 37s]] or [[British Rail class 67|class 67s]]. The [[New Measurement Train]] and LORAM C21 Grinding/Rail Profile Trains are also maintained at this facility.

A '''Reflective crack''' is a type of failure in [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]] pavement, one of the most popular [[road surface]] types. Asphalt pavement is impacted by traffic and thermal loading. Due to loading, cracks can appear on pavement surface that can reduce the [[Pavement Condition Index]](PCI) dramatically. 

The pavement can be maintained by overlay. Cracks under the overlay can cause stress concentration at the bottom of the overlay. Due to the repeated stress concentration, a crack starts in the overlay that has a similar shape to the crack in the old pavement. This crack is called a "reflective crack".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nejad|first1=Fereidoon Moghadas|last2=Noory|first2=Alireza|last3=Toolabi|first3=Saeed|last4=Fallah|first4=Shahab|title=Effect of using geosynthetics on reflective crack prevention|journal=International Journal of Pavement Engineering|date=3 July 2015|volume=16|issue=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|issn=1029-8436}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Reflective cracking can be categorized as one of the distresses in asphalt pavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASTM D6433 - 11 Standard Practice for Roads and Parking Lots Pavement Condition Index Surveys|url=https://www.astm.org/Standards/D6433.htm|website=www.astm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can affect the general performance and durability of the pavement. A reflective crack can also open a way for water to enter the pavement's body and increase the deterioration rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nejad|first1=Fereidoon Moghadas|last2=Noory|first2=Alireza|last3=Toolabi|first3=Saeed|last4=Fallah|first4=Shahab|title=Effect of using geosynthetics on reflective crack prevention|journal=International Journal of Pavement Engineering|date=3 July 2015|volume=16|issue=6|pages=477–487|doi=10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10298436.2014.943128|issn=1029-8436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflective cracks can also happen in overlays placed on joints or cracks in concrete pavements ([[Road_surface#Composite_pavement|composite pavements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yang H.|title=Pavement design and analysis|date=2004|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0131424734|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When creating [[computer-generated imagery]], final scenes appearing in movies and television productions are usually produced by [[rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] more than one "layer" or "pass," which are multiple images designed to be put together through digital [[compositing]] to form a completed frame.

Rendering in passes is based on a traditions in [[motion control photography]] which predate CGI. As an example, for a visual effects shot, a camera could be programmed to move past a physical model of a spaceship in one pass to film the fully lit beauty pass of the ship, and then to repeat exactly the same camera move passing the ship again to photograph additional elements such as the illuminated windows in the ship or its thrusters. Once all of the passes were filmed, they could then be optically printed together to form a completed shot.

The terms ''render layers'' and ''render passes'' are sometimes used interchangeably. However, rendering in layers refers specifically to separating different ''objects'' into separate images, such as a layer each for foreground characters, sets, distant landscape, and sky. On the other hand, rendering in passes  refers to separating out different ''aspects'' of the scene, such as shadows, highlights, or reflections, into separate images.

'''''Science and Religion: Some Historical Perspectives''''' is a book on the [[relationship between religion and science]] by [[John Hedley Brooke]].

The book identifies three traditional views of the relationship between science and religion found in historical analyses: conflict, complementarity, and commonality.  The book portrays all three as oversimplifications. It offers up the alternative notion of complexity, which bases the relationship between science and religion on changing circumstances where it is defined upon each particular historical situation and the actual beliefs and ideas of the scientific and religious figures involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Temperley|first=HNV|title=Science and salvation|journal=Nature|volume=359|pages=685–686|doi=10.1038/359685a0|year=1992|issue=6397}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Sociology of philosophy''' is a subdivision of [[sociology]] that seeks to understand the influence of [[philosophy]] in the society, the social conditions in the intellectual activity and effects of philosophy, and the social configurations and processes of philosophical research. Sociology of philosophy, as an empirical sociological branch based on theory, was developed in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heidegren|first1=Carl-Göran|last2=Lundberg|first2=Henrik|title=Towards a Sociology of Philosophy|journal=Acta Sociologica|date=2010|volume=53|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1177/0001699309357831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought''''' is a book on [[Modernism]] by historian [[William Everdell]], published in 1997 by the [[University of Chicago Press]]. A ''[[New York Times]]'' Notable Book of 1997, ''The First Moderns'' suggests that "the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/07/books/notable-books-of-the-year-1997.html, "Notable Books of the Year 1997"], ''The New York Times,'' December 7, 1997.

Everdell, Dean of Humanities at [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in Brooklyn Heights,&lt;ref&gt;William R. Everdell, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/17/books/it-s-about-time-it-s-about-space.html "It's About Time. It's About Space."], ''The New York Times,'' August 17, 2003. Accessed July 28 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; posits that Modernism first emerged in the field of mathematics rather than the arts, specifically in the work of German mathematician [[Richard Dedekind]], who, in 1872, demonstrated that mathematicians operate without a continuum; this represents the formalization of Everdell's axiom of "ontological discontinuity," which he goes on to examine in a multiplicity of contexts. He examines this emerging framework of discreteness in science ([[Ludwig Boltzmann]]'s mechanics, [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal|Cajal]]'s neuroscience, [[Hugo de Vries]]'s conception of the gene and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s quantum work, [[Einstein]]'s physics); mathematics, logic, and philosophy ([[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and the linguistic turn, [[Husserl]] and the beginnings of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]); in addition to the arts ([[James Joyce]]'s novels, [[Picasso]]'s [[Demoiselles d'Avignon|''Demoiselles D'Avignon'']], [[Schoenberg]]'s twelve-tone music).

==Reviews==

Critics largely reviewed ''The First Moderns'' favorably, appreciating Everdell's interdisciplinary approach, in publications including the [[New york review of books|''New York Review of Books'']], the ''New York Times,'' the [[Los Angeles Times|''Los Angeles Times,'']] and the [[Washington Post Book World|''Washington Post''.]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Holt (philosopher)|Jim Holt]], [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1999/05/20/infinitesimally-yours/ "Infinitesimally Yours"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''New York Review of Books,'' May 20, 1999. "Drawing together such disparate manifestations as Seurat's pointillism, Muybridge's stop-motion photography, the poetry of Whitman, Rimbaud, and Laforgue, the tone rows of Schoenberg, and the novels of Joyce, the author [Everdell] makes an engrossing and persuasive case for his claim that 'the heart of Modernism is the postulate of ontological discontinuity'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hugh Kenner]], [https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/29/reviews/970629.29kennert.html "A Change of Mind], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought'', ''The New York Times'', June 29, 1997. "The change started to happen in the 1870's [sic], and not, as William R. Everdell arrestingly demonstrates in ''The First Moderns,'' in painting or in literature but in number theory. He's aware that word-focused people will be startled: ''Everyone who has heard of modernism has heard of Picasso. Most have heard of Joyce. But who has heard of Dedekind?'' Yet it was an 1872 pamphlet of Richard Dedekind's that first, to use the terminology of 19th-century positivism, ''rigorized'' modernism's generic concept -- which, as Everdell reveals, is discontinuity."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederic Morton]], [http://articles.latimes.com/1997/jul/20/books/bk-14342 "Deconstructing Modernism"], review of William R. Everdell, ''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth Century Thought,'' ''Los Angeles Times'', July 20, 1997. "''The First Moderns'' brilliantly maps the beginning of a path at whose end loom as many diasporas as there are men."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shiva Musée Guimet 22971.jpg|thumb|A Cambodian [[Shiva]] head showing a third eye.]]
The '''third eye''' (also called the '''mind's eye''', or '''inner eye''') is a mystical and [[esoteric]] concept of a speculative invisible eye which provides perception beyond ordinary sight.&lt;ref name=MMM&gt;{{cite book|title=Man, Myth and Magic&amp;nbsp;– Volume 19|year=1994|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|location=New York, NY|isbn=0839360355|page=2606|editor=Richard Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious overview==
In certain dharmic spiritual traditions the third eye refers to the [[ajna]] (or brow) [[chakra]].&lt;ref name=Saraswati&gt;{{cite book|last=Saraswati|first=Swami Satyananda Saraswati|title=Kundalini iuuuggTantra|year=2001|publisher=Yoga I Publications Trust|location=Bihar, India|isbn=978-8185787152}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third eye refers to the gate that leads to inner realms and spaces of [[higher consciousness]]. In [[New Age]] spirituality, the third eye often [[symbol]]izes a state of [[enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] or the evocation of [[mental image]]s having deeply personal [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[psychological]] significance. The third eye is often associated with [[vision (religion)|religious visions]], [[clairvoyance]], the ability to observe [[chakra]]s and [[aura (paranormal)|auras]],&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Chakras'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1927 Theosophical Publishing House Page 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[precognition]], and [[out-of-body experience]]s. People who are claimed to have the capacity to utilize their third eyes are sometimes known as ''seers''.  In [[Hinduism]], the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. 

In [[Taoism]] and many traditional Chinese religious sects such as Chan (called [[Zen]] in Japanese), "third eye training" involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various [[qigong]] postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct "vibration" of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach more advanced meditation levels. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the [[mind's eye]], is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism claims that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth [[Chakra]], forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.&lt;ref&gt;The doctrine of the elixir by R.B. Jefferson Coombe Springs Press 1982 chapter 4. The Archaic Anatomy of Individual Organs.&lt;/ref&gt; In Taoist alchemical traditions, the third eye is the frontal part of the "Upper Dan Tien" (upper cinnabar field) and is given the evocative name "muddy pellet".

According to the Christian teaching of Father [[Richard Rohr]], the concept of the third eye is a metaphor for non-dualistic thinking; the way the mystics see. In Rohr's concept, mystics employ the first eye (sensory input such as sight) and the second eye (the eye of reason, meditation, and reflection), "but they know not to confuse knowledge with depth, or mere correct information with the transformation of consciousness itself. The mystical gaze builds upon the first two eyes—and yet goes further." Rohr refers to this level of awareness as "having the mind of Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, Richard "The Naked Now: Learning to See as the Mystics See", The Crossroad Publishing Company, 2009, {{ISBN|0-8245-2543-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8245-2543-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adherents of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[H.P. Blavatsky]]&lt;ref&gt;H.P. Blavatsky, ''[http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/sd/sd-hp.htm The Secret Doctrine]'', Vol. 2, 1888, {{ISBN|1-55700-124-3}}, pp. 289-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant [[pineal gland]], which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. [[Reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s sense light via a third [[parietal eye]]—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their [[circadian rhythm]]s, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. [[C.W. Leadbeater]] claimed that by extending an "etheric tube" from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision.&lt;ref name="Leadbeater, C.W. Page 79"/&gt;  It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye's microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as [[quark]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Stephen ''Extrasensory Perception of Quarks'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA 1980 Theosophical Publishing House {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0227-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland.&lt;ref name="Helena Petrovna Blavatsky 1993"&gt;Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'' vol. II, (Wheaton, IL: Theosophical Publishing House, 1993), 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Rick Strassman]] has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] (dimethyltryptamine), an [[entheogen]] which he believes possibly could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.&lt;ref name="strassman"&gt;{{cite book |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule. A Doctor's Revolutionary Research into the Biology of Near-Death and Mystical Experiences |last=Strassman |first=Rick J. |authorlink=Rick Strassman |year=2001 |publisher=Park Street |location=Rochester, Vt |isbn=978-0-89281-927-0}} ({{cite web | url=http://rickstrassman.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=60 | title=Chapter summaries | accessdate=27 February 2012}})&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The use of the phrase ''mind's eye'' does not imply that there is a single or unitary place in the mind or brain where visual consciousness occurs.  Philosophers such as [[Daniel Dennett]] have critiqued this view.&lt;ref&gt;''Consciousness Explained'', Daniel C. Dennett, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1991.  {{ISBN|0-316-18065-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others, such as [[Johnjoe McFadden]] of the [[University of Surrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] and the New Zealand-based neurobiologist [[Susan Pockett]],  propose that the brain's [[electromagnetic field]] is consciousness itself, thus causing the perception of a unitary location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20022/0516026.htm Our Conscious Mind Could Be An Electromagnetic Field], UniSci.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surrey.ac.uk/qe/pdfs/cemi_theory_paper.pdf Synchronous Firing and Its Influence on the Brain's Electromagnetic Field: Evidence for an Electromagnetic Field Theory of Consciousness], J.

{{Literature}}
'''Tragicomedy''' is a [[literary genre]] that blends aspects of both [[tragedy|tragic]] and [[comedy|comic]] forms. Most often seen in [[drama|dramatic literature]], the term can variously describe by either a tragic play which contains enough comic elements to lighten the overall mood or a serious play with a happy ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewar-Watson|first1=Sarah|author2=Eds. Subha Mukherji and Raphael Lyne|title=''"Aristotle and Tragicomedy."'' Early Modern Tragicomedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gbzzzpd6oCUC|accessdate=26 January 2012|year=2007|publisher=Brewer|isbn=978-1-84384-130-2|pages=15–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical precedent===
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Tragic Comic masks of [[Ancient Greek theatre]] represented in the [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic.]]

There is no complete formal definition of tragicomedy from the [[classical antiquity|classical]] age.  It appears that the Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] had something like the Renaissance meaning of the term (that is, a serious action with a happy ending) in mind when, in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', he discusses tragedy with a dual ending.&lt;ref&gt;Poetics: XIII, End of 2nd paragraph, Trans: Bywater, Ingram, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;  In this respect, a number of [[Ancient Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman plays]], for instance ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', may be called tragicomedies, though without any definite attributes outside of plot.  The word itself originates with the Roman comic playwright [[Plautus]], who coined the term somewhat facetiously in the prologue to his play ''[[Amphitryon (Plautus play)|Amphitryon]]''.  The character Mercury, sensing the indecorum of the inclusion of both kings and gods alongside servants in a comedy, declares that the play had better be a "tragicomoedia":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foster|first=Verna A.|title=The Name and Nature of Tragicomedy|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate|location=Aldershot, UK|isbn=0-7546-3567-8|pages=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|I will make it a mixture: let it be a tragicomedy. I don't think it would be appropriate to make it consistently a comedy, when there are kings and gods in it. What do you think?

===Renaissance revivals===
====Italy====
Plautus's comment had an arguably excessive impact on [[Renaissance]] aesthetic theory, which had largely transformed Aristotle's comments on drama into a rigid theory.  For "rule mongers" (the term is [[Giordano Bruno]]'s), "mixed" works such as those mentioned above, more recent "romances" such as ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', and even ''[[The Odyssey]]'' were at best puzzles; at worst, mistakes.  Two figures helped to elevate tragicomedy to the status of a regular genre, by which is meant one with its own set of rigid rules. [[Giovanni Battista Giraldi]] Cinthio, in the mid-sixteenth century, both argued that the tragedy-with-comic-ending (''tragedia de lieto fin'') was most appropriate to modern times and produced his own examples of such plays.  Even more important was [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]].  Guarini's ''[[Il Pastor Fido]]'', published in 1590, provoked a fierce critical debate in which Guarini's spirited defense of generic innovation eventually carried the day.  Guarini's tragicomedy offered modulated action that never drifted too far either to comedy or tragedy, mannered characters, and a pastoral setting.  All three became staples of continental tragicomedy for a century and more.

====England====
In England, where practice ran ahead of theory, the situation was quite different.  In the sixteenth century, "tragicomedy" meant the native sort of romantic play that violated the unities of time, place, and action, that glibly mixed high- and low-born characters, and that presented fantastic actions.  These were the features [[Philip Sidney]] deplored in his complaint against the "mungrell Tragy-comedie" of the 1580s, and of which Shakespeare's Polonius offers famous testimony: "The best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individuable, or poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the liberty, these are the only men." Some aspects of this romantic impulse remain even in the work of more sophisticated playwrights: [[Shakespeare]]'s last plays, which may well be called tragicomedies, have often been called romances.

By the early Stuart period, some English playwrights had absorbed the lessons of the Guarini controversy. [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s ''The Faithful Shepherdess'', an adaptation of Guarini's play, was produced in 1608.  In the printed edition, Fletcher offered an interesting definition of the term, worth quoting at length: "A tragi-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing, but in respect it wants deaths, which is enough to make it no tragedy, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie."  Fletcher's definition focuses primarily on events: a play's genre is determined by whether or not people die in it, and in a secondary way on how close the action comes to a death.  But, as Eugene Waith showed, the tragicomedy Fletcher developed in the next decade also had unifying stylistic features: sudden and unexpected revelations, outré plots, distant locales, and a persistent focus on elaborate, artificial rhetoric.

Some of Fletcher's contemporaries, notably [[Philip Massinger]] and [[James Shirley]], wrote successful and popular tragicomedies. [[Richard Brome]] also essayed the form, but with less success. And many of their contemporary writers, ranging from [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]] to [[Lodowick Carlell]] to Sir [[Aston Cockayne]], made attempts in the genre.

Tragicomedy remained fairly popular up to the closing of the theaters in 1642, and Fletcher's works were popular in the Restoration as well.  The old styles were cast aside as tastes changed in the eighteenth century; the "tragedy with a happy ending" eventually developed into [[melodrama]], in which form it still flourishes.

====Later developments====
The more subtle criticism that developed after the Renaissance stressed the thematic and formal aspects of tragicomedy, rather than plot. [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] defined it as a mixture of emotions in which "seriousness stimulates laughter, and pain pleasure."  Even more commonly, tragicomedy's affinity with satire and "dark" comedy have suggested a tragicomic impulse in modern theatre with Luigi Pirandello who influenced Beckett.  Also it can be seen in [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] drama. [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], the Swiss dramatist, suggested that tragicomedy was the inevitable genre for the twentieth century; he describes his play ''[[The Visit (play)|The Visit]]'' (1956) as a tragicomedy.  Tragicomedy is a common genre in post-[[World War II]] [[United Kingdom|British]] theatre, with authors as varied as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Tom Stoppard]], [[John Arden]], [[Alan Ayckbourn]] and [[Harold Pinter]] writing in this genre. Many writers of the [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] and [[postmodernist]] movements have made use of tragicomedy and/or [[gallows humor]]. A notable example of a [[Metamodernism|metamodernist]] tragicomedy is [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Infinite Jest]]''.

In [[computer science]], a '''typed assembly language''' ('''TAL''') is an [[assembly language]] that is extended to include a method of annotating the [[datatype]] of each value that is manipulated by the code. These annotations can then be used by a program (type checker) that processes the assembly language code in order to analyse how it will behave when it is executed.  Specifically, such a type checker can be used to prove the [[type safety]] of code that meets the criteria of some appropriate [[type system]].  

Typed assembly languages usually include a high-level memory management system based on [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].

A typed assembly language with a suitably expressive type system can be used to enable the safe execution of untrusted code without using an intermediate representation like [[bytecode]], allowing features similar to those currently provided by virtual machine environments like [[Java platform|Java]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]].
