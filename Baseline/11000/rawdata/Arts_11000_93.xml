      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

== Popular music ==

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

'''Art Nouveau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑː|r|t|_|n|uː|ˈ|v|oʊ|,_|ˌ|ɑː|r}}; {{IPA-fr|aʁ nuvo|lang}})  is an international [[style (visual arts)|style]] of art, architecture and [[applied art]], especially the [[decorative arts]], that was most popular between 1890 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reaction to the [[academic art]] of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

English uses the French name Art Nouveau (new art).  The style is related to, but not identical with,  styles that emerged in many countries in Europe at about the same time:  in Austria it is known as ''[[Vienna Secession|Secessionsstil]]'' after ''[[Wiener Secession]]''; in Spanish ''Modernismo''; in Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]''; in Czech ''Secese''; in Danish ''Skønvirke'' or ''Jugendstil''; in German ''Jugendstil'', Art Nouveau or ''Reformstil''; in Hungarian ''Szecesszió''; in Italian Art Nouveau, ''Stile Liberty'' or  ''Stile floreale''; in Lithuanian ''Modernas''; in Norwegian ''Jugendstil''; in Polish ''Secesja''; in Slovak ''Secesia''; in Ukrainian and Russian ''Модерн'' (Modern)&lt;!--''Ар-нуво'' [Ar-nuvo] or ''Югендстиль'' [JUgendstil']--&gt;; in Swedish and Finnish ''Jugend''.

Art Nouveau is a [[gesamtkunstwerk|total art style]]: It embraces a wide range of fine and decorative arts, including architecture, painting, graphic art, interior design, jewelry, [[Art Nouveau furniture|furniture]], textiles, ceramics, glass art, and metal work. 

By 1910, Art Nouveau was already out of style. It was replaced as the dominant European architectural and decorative style first by [[Art Deco]] and then by [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry R. Hope, review of H. Lenning, ''The Art Nouveau'', ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 34 (June 1952), 168–171 (esp. 168–169): Discussing the state of Art Nouveau during 1952, the author notes that Art Nouveau, which had become disfavored, was not yet an acceptable study for serious art history or a subject suitable for major museum exhibitions and their respective catalogs. He predicts an impending change, however.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;Michèle Lavallée, "Art Nouveau", ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', [[Oxford University Press]] [accessed 11 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
Art Nouveau took its name from the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' (''House of the New Art''), an art gallery opened in 1895 by the Franco-German [[art dealer]] [[Siegfried Bing]] that featured the new style. In France, Art Nouveau was also sometimes called by the British term "Modern Style" due to its roots in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], ''Style moderne'', or ''Style 1900.''&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; It was also sometimes called ''Style Jules Verne'', ''Le Style Métro'' (after Hector Guimard's iron and glass subway entrances), ''Art Belle Époque'', and ''Art fin de siècle''.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, where the architectural movement began, it was sometimes termed ''Style nouille'' (noodle style) or ''Style coup de fouet'' (whiplash style).&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Britain, it was known as the ''Modern Style'', or, because of the Arts and Crafts movement led by [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow,  as the [[Glasgow School|"Glasgow" style]].

In Italy, because of the popularity of designs from London's [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty &amp; Co]] department store (mostly designed by [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]), it was sometimes called the ''Stile Liberty'' ("Liberty style"),  ''Stile floral'', or ''Arte nova'' (New Art).

In the United States, due to its association with [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], it was often called the "Tiffany style".&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23"&gt;Duncan (1994): 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany and Scandinavia, a related style emerged at about the same time; it was called ''Jugendstil'', after the popular German art magazine of that name.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;  In Austria and the neighboring countries then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a similar style emerged, called ''Secessionsstil'' in German, ({{lang-hu|szecesszió}}, {{lang-cs|secese}}) or ''Wiener Jugendstil'', after the artists of the [[Vienna Secession]].

The style was called ''Modern'' (Модерн) in Russia and ''Nieuwe Kunst'' (new art) in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt; In Spain the related style was known as ''Modernismo'', ''Modernisme'' (in Catalan), ''Arte joven'' ("young art"); and in Portugal ''Arte nova'' (new art). 

Some names refer specifically to the organic forms that were popular with the Art Nouveau artists: ''Stile Floreal'' ("floral style") in France; ''Paling Stijl'' ("eel style") in the Netherlands;  and ''Wellenstil'' ("wave style") and ''Lilienstil'' ("lily style") in Germany.&lt;ref name="duncan23" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of [[William Morris]], and in the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House of Morris (1859), and the lavish [[Peacock Room]] by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, including [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including [[Selwyn Image]], [[Heywood Sumner]], [[Walter Crane]], [[Alfred Gilbert]], and especially [[Aubrey Beardsley]].&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau'' (1985), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the style combined several different tendencies. In architecture, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], a declared enemy of the historical [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts architectural style]]. In his 1872 book ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', he wrote, "use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament."&lt;ref&gt;Viollet le-Duc, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''&lt;/ref&gt;  This book influenced a generation of architects, including [[Louis Sullivan]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Hector Guimard]], and [[Antoni Gaudí]].{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=24}}

The French painters [[Maurice Denis]], [[Pierre Bonnard]] and [[Édouard Vuillard]] played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. "I believe that before everything a painting must decorate", Denis wrote in 1891. "The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the colored surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions."&lt;ref&gt;Interview in ''L'Écho de Paris'', 28 December 1891, cited in Bouillon (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985|page=26}}

Another important influence on the new style was [[Japonism]]: the wave of enthusiasm for Japanese [[woodblock printing]], particularly the works of [[Hiroshige]], [[Hokusai]], and [[Utagawa Kunisada]] which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising [[Siegfried Bing]] founded a monthly journal, ''Le Japon artistique'' in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including [[Gustav Klimt]]. The stylized features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain,  jewelry, and furniture.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and color [[lithographs]], played an essential role in popularizing the new style. ''[[The Studio (magazine)|The Studio]]'' in England, ''Arts et idèes'' and ''Art et décoration'' in France, and ''[[Jugend]]'' in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. [[Aubrey Beardsley]] in England, and [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Félix Vallotton]] achieved international recognition as illustrators.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=30}}

With the posters by [[Jules Cheret]] for dancer [[Loie Fuller]] in 1893, and by [[Alphonse Mucha]] for actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and other artists achieved international celebrity status.

===Maison de l'Art Nouveau (1895)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher [[Siegfried Bing]] played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize [[Japonism]] in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Eugène Grasset]], which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts|Société nationale des beaux-arts]] in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at [[Rue de Provence|22 rue de Provence]] in Paris, the ''[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]'', devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect [[Henry Van de Velde]], one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' showed paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]] and [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], glass from [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and [[Emile Gallé]], jewelry by [[René Lalique]], and posters by [[Aubrey Beardsley]]. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, "Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies."{{Sfn|Bouillon|1985}}

===Beginning of Art Nouveau architecture (1893–1898)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] by Victor Horta and the [[Bloemenwerf]] house by [[Henry Van de Velde]], were built in Brussels in 1893–1895. Both Horta and Van de Velde designed not only the houses, but also all of the interior decoration, furniture, carpets, and architectural details.

Horta, an architect with classical training, designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element became the stairway, beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of Art Nouveau.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=127}}

Van de Velde was by training a designer, not an architect, and collaborated with an architect on the plan of the [[Bloemenwerf]], the house that he built for himself. He was inspired by the British Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly William Morris's Red House, and like them he designed all aspects of the building, including the furniture, wallpaper and carpets.

After visiting Horta's Hôtel Tassel, [[Hector Guimard]] built the [[Castel Béranger]], the first Paris building in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under [[Napoleon III]] by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]]. They welcomed Guimard's colorful and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard's career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new [[Paris Métro]] system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city's 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition Universelle'']].&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/artn/hd_artn.htm Gontar, Cybele.

===Paris ''Exposition universelle'' (1900)===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Paris 1900 [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''Exposition universelle'']] marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]: the main exhibit hall, the [[Grand Palais]] had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

The Exposition particularly highlighted French designers, who all made special works for the Exhibition: [[Lalique]] crystal and jewelry; jewelry by [[Henri Vever]] and [[Georges Fouquet]]; [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] glass; the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] in [[porcelain]]; ceramics by [[Alexandre Bigot]]; sculpted glass lamps and vases by [[Emile Gallé]] and [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], and Company from the United States; furniture by [[Édouard Colonna]] and [[Louis Majorelle]]; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms from around Europe and the world. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, [[Siegfried Bing]] presented a pavilion called '' Art Nouveau Bing'', which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.&lt;ref name="eidelberg"&gt;Martin Eidelberg and Suzanne Henrion-Giele, "Horta and Bing: An Unwritten Episode of L'Art Nouveau", ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 119, Special Issue Devoted to European Art Since 1890 (Nov. 1977), pp. 747–752.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncanbing"&gt;Duncan (1994), pp. 15–16, 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The [[1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition]] marked the beginning of the [[Modernisme]] style in Spain, with some buildings of [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]]. The [[Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Decorativa Moderna (1902)|''Esposizione internazionale d'arte decorativa moderna'']] of 1902 in [[Turin]], Italy, showcased designers from across Europe.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by [[Jules Lavirotte]], who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the [[Lavirotte Building]], at 29 avenue Rapp (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including ''[[Maxim's]]'' at [[Rue Royale, Paris|3 rue Royale]], and [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|''Le Train bleu'']] at the [[Gare de Lyon]] (1900).{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=86–87}}

The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in [[Lorraine]] became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the ''Alliance provinciale des industries d'art'', also known as the ''[[École de Nancy]]'', was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts.  The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators [[Emile Gallé]], the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] brothers in glass design, and the designer [[Louis Majorelle]], who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect [[Henri Sauvage]] brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his [[Villa Majorelle]] in 1898.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including ''The Studio'', ''Arts et Idées'' and ''Art et Décoration'', whose photographs and color lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion,  virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these continue to be manufactured in the style today.

Belgium was an early center of the Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of [[Victor Horta]], who designed the first Art Nouveau houses, the [[Hôtel Tassel]] in 1893, and the [[Hôtel Solvay]] in 1894. Horta met and had a strong influence on the work of the young [[Hector Guimard]]. Other important designers included architect [[Paul Hankar]], who built an Art Nouveau house in 1893; the architect and furniture designer [[Henry van de Velde]], the decorator [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]], and the graphic artist [[Fernand Khnopff]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unescohorta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1005|title=Major Town Houses of the Architect Victor Horta (Brussels)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), pp. 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of [[ivory]] imported from the [[Belgian Congo]]; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as [[Philippe Wolfers]], was popular.{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

In the Netherlands, the style was known as the ''Nieuwe Kunst'', the New Art. Architects included [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]], who designed a more functional, rational variant, while [[Carel Adolph Lion Cachet]], [[Theo Nieuwenhuis]] and [[Gerrit Willem Dijsselhof]] designed a more picturesque and decorative style. Furniture design was influenced by the importation of exotic woods from the Dutch East Indies (modern [[Indonesia]]), while textiles were influenced by the designs and techniques of [[batik]].{{Sfn|Riley|2004|page=323}}

Prominent Swiss artists of the period included painter and graphic artist [[Théophile Steinlen]], creator of the famous poster for the Paris [[cabaret]] [[Le Chat Noir|''Le Chat noir'']], and the artist, sculptor and decorator [[Eugène Grasset]], who moved from Switzerland to Paris where he designed graphics, furniture, tapestries, ceramics and posters. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (''École normale d'enseignement du dessin''), where his students included [[Augusto Giacometti]] and [[Paul Berthon]].&lt;ref&gt;Lahor, ''L'Art Nouveau'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="duncan37"&gt;Duncan (1994), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the [[arts and crafts movement]] of the 1880s, which called for a closer union between the fine arts and decorative arts, and a break away from historical styles to designs inspired by function and nature. One notable early example [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of [[Sir Christopher Wren]], published in 1883.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers [[Aubrey Beardsley]] whose drawings featured the curved lines which became the most recognizable feature of the style. free-flowing [[wrought iron]] from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included [[Walter Crane]] and [[Charles Robert Ashbee|Charles Ashbee]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|title=Art Nouveau - Art Nouveau Art|date=22 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm|archivedate=22 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]] department store in London played an important role, through its colorful stylized floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewelry designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]]. His jewelry designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewelry design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important center in Britain was [[Glasgow, Scotland|Glasgow]], with the creations of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] and the [[Glasgow School]], whose work was inspired by the French Art Nouveau, Japanese art, symbolism and Gothic revival. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the [[Glasgow School of Art]] (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]], a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs which combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the ''Glasgow Rose".{{Sfn|Lahor|page=160}}

[[Léon-Victor Solon]], made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in [[Tubelining|tube-lined]] vases marketed as "secessionist ware" (usually described as named after the [[Viennese Secession|Viennese art movement]]).&lt;ref name="Muter"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=41809144 | title=Leon Solon and John Wadsworth | work=Journal of the Decorative Arts Society | year=1985 | author=Muter, Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Leek silk industry]]&lt;ref&gt;He was commissioned by the Wardle family of dyers and printers, trading as "Thomas Wardle &amp; Co" and "Bernard Wardle and Co".[http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ The Wardel Pattern Books Revealed]{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044031/http://www.whitworth.manchester.ac.uk/collection/recentprojects/wardle/ |date=3 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[doublure (bookbinding)|doublure]]s for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle under Lyme), who patented the ''Sutherland'' binding in 1895.

The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the [[Former Everard's Printing Works|printing works of Edward Everard]], features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of [[Johannes Gutenberg]] and [[William Morris]], both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the "Spirit of Light", while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, ''Jugendstil''. The name is taken from the artistic journal, ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Die Jugend]]'', which was published in Munich and which espoused the new artistic movement. It was founded in 1896 by [[Georg Hirth]] (Hirth remained editor until his death in 1916, and the magazine continued to be published until 1940). The magazine was instrumental in promoting the style in Germany. As a result, its name was adopted as the most common German-language term for the style: ''Jugendstil'' ("youth style"). Although, during the early 20th century, the word was applied to only two-dimensional examples of the graphic arts,&lt;ref&gt;A. Philip McMahon, "review of F. Schmalenbach, ''Jugendstil''", ''Parnassus'', vol. 7 (Oct., 1935), 27.&lt;/ref&gt; especially the forms of organic [[typography]] and [[graphic design]] found in and influenced by German magazines like ''[[Jugend (magazine)|Jugend]]'', ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', and ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', it is now applied to more general manifestations of Art Nouveau visual arts in Germany, the [[Netherlands]], the [[Baltic states]], and [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref name="grove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heller"&gt;Reinhold Heller, "Recent Scholarship on Vienna's "Golden Age", Gustav Klimt, and Egon Schiele", ''The Art Bulletin'', vol. 59 (Mar., 1977), pp. 111–118.&lt;/ref&gt; The two main centres for Jugendstil art in Germany were [[Munich]] and [[Darmstadt]] ([[Darmstadt Artists' Colony|Mathildenhöhe]]).

Two other journals, ''[[Simplicissimus]]'', published in Munich, and ''[[Pan (magazine)|Pan]]'', published in Berlin, proved to be important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of ''Jugendstil'', especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes a variety of different methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and [[Art exhibition|exhibition]] [[poster]]s. Designers often used unique display [[typeface]]s that worked harmoniously with the image.

One of the most famous German artists associated with both ''Die Jugend'' and ''Pan'' was [[Otto Eckmann]]. His favourite animal was the swan, and such was his influence in the German movement that the swan came to serve as the [[leitmotif]] for the Jugendstil.

One of the most prominent German designers in the style was [[Richard Riemerschmid]], who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=52}}

{{Main article|Vienna Secession}}
Vienna became the center of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the [[Vienna Secession]], an art movement that was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists which included [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Koloman Moser]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]], [[Max Kurzweil]], and [[Otto Wagner]]. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward [[historicism]] expressed by [[Vienna Künstlerhaus]], the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, ''[[Ver Sacrum]]'', to promote their works in all media. The Secession style was notably more feminine, less heavy and less nationalist than the ''Jugendstil'' in neighboring Germany.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=63}} The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists. The architectural style of the Vienna Secession had an influence well beyond the city. Buildings in the style appeared in the other major cities of the Empire and beyond; one of the most famous examples is the [[Stoclet Palace]] built by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels in 1905–11. The interior is entirely decorated in Secession style, including notable paintings by Gustav Klimt.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. [[Koloman Moser]] was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, furniture, and more. He often worked in collaboration with Hoffmann and Klimt; the three together created the interiors, furnishing and even clothing to be worn in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels. In 1903, he and Hoffmann founded the [[Wiener Werkstätte]], a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=120}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the capitals of Central Europe, then ruled by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] in Vienna, national forms of Art Nouveau are quick to appear, and often took on historical or folkloric elements. The furniture designs of [[Ödön Faragó]] in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]) combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. [[Pál Horti]], another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

[[Prague]], in the [[Czech Republic]], has a notable collection of Art Nouveau architecture, including the ''Hotel Central'' and the [[Jubilee Synagogue]], built in 1908.

The style of combining Art Nouveau and national architectural elements was typical also for a [[Slovakia|Slovak]] architect [[Dušan Jurkovič]] who was under the influence of Hungarian Art Nouveau. His most original works are the Cultural House in [[Skalica]] in [[Slovakia]] (1905), buildings of spa in [[Luhačovice]] in the [[Czech Republic]] (1901–1903) and 35 war cemeteries near [[Nowy Żmigród]] in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko ([[Rusyns|Rusyn]]) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917). Another example of Secession architecture in Slovakia is the [[Church of St. Elisabeth (Bratislava)|Church of St. Elisabeth]] (The Little Blue Church) in [[Bratislava]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Italy's ''Stile Liberty'' took its name from the British department store [[Liberty (store)|Liberty]], the colorful textiles of which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers included [[Galileo Chini]], whose ceramics were inspired both by [[majolica]] patterns and by Art Nouveau. He was later known as a painter and a scenic designer; he designed the sets for two Puccini operas  ''[[Gianni Schicchi]]'' and ''[[Turandot]]''.

The [[Teatro Massimo]] in [[Palermo]], by the architect [[Ernesto Basile]], is an example of the Italian variant of the style, architectural style, which combined Art Nouveau and classical elements.

The most important figure in Italian Art Nouveau furniture design was [[Carlo Bugatti]], the son of an architect and sculptor, and brother of the famous automobile designer. He studied at the [[Brera Academy|Milanese Academy of Brera]], and later the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=310}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In Spain, a highly original variant of the style, Catalan ''[[Modernisme]]'', appeared in [[Barcelona]]. Its most famous creator was [[Antoni Gaudi|Antoni Gaudí]], who used Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms in a very novel way in ''[[Palau Güell]]'' (1886).{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=142}}&lt;ref&gt;James Grady, ''Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau'', in "The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians", vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18–27.&lt;/ref&gt; His designs from about 1903, the ''[[Casa Batlló]]'' (1904–1906) and ''[[Casa Milà]]'' (1906–1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan52"&gt;Duncan (1994): 52.&lt;/ref&gt; However, famous structures such as the ''[[Sagrada Família]]'' characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist [[Neo-Gothic]].&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the [[Castell dels Tres Dragons]] (1888), [[Palau de la Música Catalana]] and [[Casa Lleó Morera]] (1905).&lt;ref name="duncan52" /&gt; Another major modernista was [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], who designed the [[Casa Martí]] and its Quatre Gats café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the [[Caixa Forum|CaixaFòrum]] art museum), Casa Macaya, [[Casa Amatller]], the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the Casa de les Punxes ("House of Spikes"). Also well-known is [[Josep Maria Jujol]], with houses in [[Sant Joan Despí]] (1913–1926), several churches near [[Tarragona]] (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in [[Barcelona]]. A few other major architects working outside of Barcelona were Lluís Muncunill i Parellada, with a magnificent textile factory in [[Terrassa]] (Vapor Aymerich, Amat i Jover, now the Science and Technology Museum of Catalonia – Museu de la Ciència i de la Tècnica de Catalunya) and a "farmhouse"/small manor house called Masia Freixa in the same city; and [[Cèsar Martinell i Brunet]], with his spectacular "wine cathedrals", housing town cooperative wineries throughout southern and central [[Catalonia]]. A [[Valencian Country|Valencian]] architect who worked in Catalonia before emigrating to the [[United States|States]] was [[Rafael Guastavino]]. Attributed to him is the Asland Cement Factory in [[Castellar de n'Hug]], among other buildings.

The Catalan furniture designer Gaspar Homar (1870–1953), influenced by Antoni Gaudí, often combining marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=311}} Examples of Art Nouveau (''Arte nova''), based largely on the French model, appeared in Portugal in [[Porto]] and [[Aveiro, Portugal|Aveiro]].  A notable example is the '[[Livraria Lello]]' bookstore in [[Porto]], designed by Xavier Esteves (1906).

Art Nouveau was popular in the [[Nordic countries]], where it was usually known as [[Jugendstil]], and was often combined with the [[National Romantic Style]] of each country. In [[Norway]] the Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by [[Viking]] folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and [[Celts|Celtic]] patterns, and [[Gerhard Munthe]], who designed a chair with a stylized dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}} Other examples include the [[Skien Church]] (1887–1894) and [[Fagerborg Church]] in [[Kristiania]] (Oslo) (1900–1903).

In [[Finland]], good examples are the [[Helsinki Central railway station]], designed by [[Eliel Saarinen]], father of the famous American modernist architect [[Eero Saarinen]]. Examples of the style include the [[Finnish National Theatre]], [[Kallio Church]], the [[Finnish National Museum]], and [[Tampere Cathedral]]. In contrast to the very elaborate furniture of the Norwegian Art Nouveau, Finnish Art Deco was extremely simple and functional, as in the chairs designed by Eliel Saarinen (1907-1908).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitfinland.com/article/the-charm-of-old-helsinki/|title=The Charm of Old Helsinki — VisitFinland.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnouveau.eu/en/city.php?id=136|title=Art Nouveau European Route : Cities|website=www.artnouveau.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very colorful Russian variation of Art Nouveau appeared in Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, "Мир искусства" (transliteration: ''[[Mir Iskusstva]]'') ("The World of Art"), by Russian artists [[Alexandre Benois]] and [[Léon Bakst]], and chief editor [[Sergei Diaghilev]]. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including [[Mikhail Vrubel]], [[Konstantin Somov]], [[Isaac Levitan]], and the book illustrator [[Ivan Bilibin]]. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colors and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the "World of Art" was the creation by Diaghilev of a new ballet company, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'', headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colorful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, ''[[L'Illustration]]'', [[La Vie Parisienne (magazine)|''La Vie parisienne'']] and [[Gazette du Bon Ton|''Gazette du bon ton'']], and the Russian style became known in Paris as ''à la Bakst''. The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Alistair, ''Art déco'', Thames and Hudson (1988), pp. 147–48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg]] have several prominent Art Nouveau buildings constructed in the last years before the Revolution; notably the [[Hotel Metropol (Moscow)|Hotel Metropol]] in Moscow, which features a ceramic mural on the façade, ''The Princess of Dreams'', by scenic designer [[Mikhail Vrubel]];  and the [[Vitebsk Railway Station]] in Saint Petersburg (1904)

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In the United States, the firm of [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the [[National Academy Museum and School|National Academy of Design]] in New York, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its coloring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and coloring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of color In 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of [[Thomas Edison]], he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicolored glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewelry. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany's craftsmen (and craftswomen) designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany's glass also had great success at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|''1900 Exposition Universelle'']] in Paris; his stained glass window called the ''Flight of Souls'' won a gold medal.{{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=167}}

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect [[Louis Sullivan]], best known as the architect of some of the first American iron-framed skyscrapers. At the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned ''White City'', he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance to the Transportation Building. The Columbian Exposition was also an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany's home in New York, are now on display at the [[Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art]] in [[Winter Park, Florida]].

==Form and character==
[[File:Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen - Tournée du Chat Noir de Rodolphe Salis (Tour of Rodolphe Salis' Chat Noir) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''La tournée du Chat noir de Rodolphe Salis'' (1896) by [[Théophile Steinlen]]]]

Although Art Nouveau acquired distinctly localised tendencies as its geographic spread increased, some general characteristics are indicative of the form. A description published in ''Pan'' magazine of [[Hermann Obrist]]'s wall hanging ''Cyclamen'' (1894) described it as "sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip", which became well known during the early spread of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan27"&gt;Duncan (1994): 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, not only did the work itself become better known as ''The Whiplash'' but the term "whiplash" is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists.&lt;ref name="duncan27" /&gt; Such decorative "whiplash" motifs, formed by dynamic, undulating, and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are found throughout the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

The origins of Art Nouveau are sometimes attributed in the resistance of the artist [[William Morris]] to the cluttered compositions and the [[Gothic revival|revival]] tendencies of the 19th century and his theories that helped initiate the [[Arts and crafts movement]].&lt;ref name="duncan10"&gt;Duncan (1994): 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Mackmurdo]]'s book-cover for ''[[Christopher Wren|Wren]]'s City Churches'' (1883), with its rhythmic floral patterns, is also sometimes described as the first realisation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan10" /&gt; About the same time, the flat perspective and strong colors of [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block prints]], especially those of [[Katsushika Hokusai]], had a strong effect on the formulation of Art Nouveau.&lt;ref name="duncan14"&gt;Duncan (1994): 14–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Japonisme]]'' that was popular in Europe during the 1880s and 1890s was particularly influential on many artists with its organic forms and references to the natural world.&lt;ref name ="duncan14" /&gt; Besides being adopted by artists like [[Emile Gallé]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], Japanese-inspired art and design was championed by the businessmen [[Siegfried Bing]] and [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]] at their stores&lt;ref&gt;Before opening the ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'', Bing managed a shop specialising in items from Japan; after 1888, he promoted Japanism with his magazine [[Artistic Japan|''Le Japon artistique'']]: Duncan (1994): 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris and London, respectively.&lt;ref name="duncan14" /&gt; &lt;!--If confirmed: "One of the first Art Nouveau paintings can be found at [[Roquetaillade castle]] (France). [[Viollet-le-Duc]] restored the castle during the 1850s, and, even though his ideal was to create a [[Gothic revival]], his [[fresco]] in the keep of the castle is a pure example of "pre" Art Nouveau style—organic movement and color. "--&gt;
[[File:Immeuble rue de l'église détail Porte.jpg|thumb|upright|Doorway at 24 place Etienne Pernet, ([[15th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 15e]]), 1905 Alfred Wagon, architect.]]

In architecture, [[hyperbola]]s and [[parabola]]s in windows, arches, and doors are common, and decorative [[:molding (decorative)|mouldings]] 'grow' into plant-derived forms. Like most design styles, Art Nouveau sought to harmonise its forms. The text above the Paris Metro entrance uses the qualities of the rest of the iron work in the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sterner (1982), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau in architecture and interior design eschewed the eclectic revival styles of the 19th century. Though Art Nouveau, designers selected and 'modernised' some of the more abstract elements of [[Rococo]] style, such as [[flame]] and [[Animal shell|shell]] textures, they also advocated the use of very stylised organic forms as a source of inspiration, expanding the 'natural' repertoire to use [[seaweed]], [[grass]]es, and insects. The softly-melding forms of 17th-century [[auricular style]], best exemplified in Dutch silverware, was another influence.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
[[File:Gustav Klimt, 1907, Adele Bloch-Bauer I, Neue Galerie New York.jpg|thumb|left|upright0.1||''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'' by [[Gustav Klimt]] (1907)]]
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]] and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] styles, and artists like [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Jan Toorop]] could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the [[artisan]]-oriented [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and [[abstraction]] in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts Movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726155845/http://www.musee-rodin.fr/communication/images/CPrevejaponais_anglais.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |df=dmy }} Edmond Lachenal produced editions of Rodin's sculptures&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many [[technology|technological]] innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.
 
Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In [[Denmark]], for example, it was one aspect of ''Skønvirke'' ("aesthetic work"), which itself more closely relates to the [[Arts and Crafts style]].&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Opie, ''A Dish by Thorvald Bindesbøll'', in ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 132 (May, 1990), pp. 356.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claire Selkurt, "New Classicism: Design of the 1920s in Denmark", in ''The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 4 (Spring, 1987), pp. 16–29 (esp. 18 n. 4).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the ''[[Młoda Polska]]'' ("Young Poland") style in [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Danuta A. Boczar, ''The Polish Poster'', in ''Art Journal'', vol. 44 (Spring, 1984), pp. 16–27 (esp. 16).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Młoda Polska'', however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Danuta Batorska, "Zofia Stryjeńska: Princess of Polish Painting", in ''Woman's Art Journal'', vol. 19 (Autumn, 1998–Winter, 1999), pp. 24–29 (esp. 24–25).&lt;/ref&gt;

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly color [[lithography]] which allowed the mass production of color posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]] (1872-1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', then black and white illustrations for [[Salome]] by [[Oscar Wilde]] (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine ''The Studio'', which helped publicize European artists such as [[Fernand Khnopff]] in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=99}}

The Swiss-French artist [[Eugène Grasset]] (1845-1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret [[Le Chat Noir|Le Chat noir]] in 1885 and made his first posters for the ''Fêtes de Paris''. He made a celebrated posters of [[Sarah Bernhardt]] in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers [[Jules Chéret]], [[Georges de Feure]] and the painter [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]] all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The [[Czechs|Czech]] artist [[Alphonse Mucha]] (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play ''[[Gismonda]]'' by [[Victorien Sardou]]. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewelry for the actress.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;''[http://www.mala.bc.ca/~Johnstoi/praguepage/muchalecture.htm An Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau]'', lecture by [[Ian Johnston (academic)|Ian Johnston]] of [[Malaspina University-College]], [[Nanaimo]], British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Julie. H. [http://www.style2000.com/p05b.html "Recycling art"] style2000.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure.  He went on to design products, from jewelry to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style. {{Sfn|Lahor|2007|page=112}}

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was [[Koloman Moser]] (1868-1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Josef Hoffmann]], and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, ''Ver Sacrum'', as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.{{Sfn|Lahor|pages=120-121}}

Painting was another important domain of Art Nouveau, though most Art Nouveau painters were also associated with other art movements, particularly the [[Nabis]] in France and the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] in France and Austria. In 1892, [[Siegfried Bing]] organized an exhibition in Paris featuring seven painters, including [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]], [[Félix Vallotton]], and [[Maurice Denis]]; and his ''Maison de l'Art Nouveau'' exhibited paintings by [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. [[Eugène Grasset]], [[Koloman Moser]] and [[Gustav Klimt]] moved comfortably in the avant-garde and Art Nouveau. In Belgium, [[Fernand Khnopff]] worked in both painting and graphic design. Paintings by Gustav Klimt were an integral part of he decorative scheme of [[Josef Hoffmann]] for the [[Palais Stoclet]]. One common theme of both symbolist and Art Nouveau painters of the period was the stylized depiction of women. One popular subject was the American dancer [[Loie Fuller]], portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.&lt;ref&gt;Bouillon, Jean-Paul, ''Journal de l'Art Nouveau (1870-1914)'', Skira, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glass art]] was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique which permitted production in series. The city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] became an important center for the French glass industry, and the workshops of [[Emile Gallé]] and the [[Daum (studio)|Daum]] studio, led by [[Auguste Daum|Auguste]] and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including [[Ernest Bussière]], [[Henri Bergé]], and [[Amalric Walter]]. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different color glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]], whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Gruber, who made windows for the [[Villa Majorelle]] and other houses.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=318}}

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of [[Val Saint Lambert]], which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by [[Philippe Wolfers]]. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of [[symbolist]] glass, often with metal decoration attached. In [[Bohemia]], then a region of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] noted for crystal manufacture, the companies [[Lobmeyr]] and [[Loetz-Witwe]] also experimented with new coloring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colors. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; [[Otto Prutscher]] was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]] for the architectural display called "The House of an Art Lover."

In the United States, [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]] and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of coloring glass, patenting in 1894 the process [[Favrile glass]], which used metallic oxides to color the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the [[Tiffany lamp]] in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by [[Siegfried Bing]], and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, [[Steuben Glass]], was founded in 1903 in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, NY]], by [[Frederick Carder]], who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colors. Another notable American glass artist was [[John La Farge]], who created intricate and colorful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=320}}

The 19th-century architectural theorist [[Viollet-le-Duc]] had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects [[Victor Horta]] and [[Hector Guimard]] went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=322}}

In the United States, the designer [[George Grant Elmslie]] made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]].

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, [[Joseph Maria Olbrich]] and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=324}}

Art Nouveau is characterized done by soft, curved shapes and lines, and usually features natural designs such as flowers, birds and other animals. The female body is a popular theme and is featured on a variety of jewelry pieces, especially cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of [[amethyst]], [[peridot]], or [[citrine quartz|citrine]].&lt;ref name="Art Nouveau Jewelry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectorsweekly.com/fine-jewelry/art-nouveau|title=Art Nouveau Jewelry|accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewelry industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewelry had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewelers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including [[agate]], [[garnet]] [[opal]], [[moonstone (gemstone)|moonstone]], [[Beryl#Aquamarine and maxixe|aquamarine]] and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others [[vitreous enamel|enameling]], and new materials, including [[horn (anatomy)|horn]], molded glass, and [[ivory]].

Early notable Paris jewelers in the Art Nouveau style included [[Louis Aucoc]], whose family jewelry firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, [[René Lalique]], served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewelry and glass, using nature, from [[dragonfly|dragonflies]] to grasses, as his model. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as [[Paul Follot]], best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included [[Jules Brateau]] and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was [[Louis Comfort Tiffany]], whose work was shown at the shop of [[Siegfried Bing]] and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. designer [[Archibald Knox (designer)|Archibald Knox]], who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. [[C. R. Ashbee]] designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile [[Glasgow]] designer [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the center for ''Jugendstil'' jewelry was the city of [[Pforzheim]], where most of the German firms, including [[Theodor Fahrner]], were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles which dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration. The buildings were covered with ornament in curving forms, based on flowers, plants or animals: butterflies, peacocks, swans, irises, cyclamens, orchids and water lilies. Façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'' (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

The style first appeared in Brussels' [[Hôtel Tassel]] (1894) and [[Hôtel Solvay]] (1900) of [[Victor Horta]]. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by [[Hector Guimard]], who used the same style in his first major work, the [[Castel Béranger]] (1897–98). In all of these houses, the architects also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new [[Paris Métro]], which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, These became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building facades by [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], the prefect of Paris under [[Napoleon III]]. [[Bow window]]s were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of [[Jules Lavirotte]], which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighborhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], around the [[Villa Majorelle]] (1901–02), the residence of furniture designer [[Louis Majorelle]]. It was designed by [[Henri Sauvage]] as a showcase for Majorelle's furniture designs.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006), pp. 107-111&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings;  the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the center for furniture design and manufacture was in [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], where two major designers, [[Émile Gallé]] and [[Louis Majorelle]] had their studios and workshops, and where the ''Alliance des industries d'art'' (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of [[marquetry]] in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included [[Eugène Vallin]] and [[Émile André]]; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. Other notable French designers included [[Henri Bellery-Desfontaines]], who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc|Viollet-le-Duc]]; and [[Georges de Feure]], [[Eugène Gaillard]], and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer [[Siegfried Bing]] to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for "abstract naturalism", its unity of straight and curved lines, and its [[rococo]] influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was [[François-Rupert Carabin]], a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. Other influential Paris furniture designers were [[Charles Plumet]], and [[Alexandre Charpentier]].{{sfn|Riley|2007|page=302}}  In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century [[Rococo]] furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.&lt;ref name="Gontar, Cybele 2006" /&gt;

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the ''Art Nouveau movement'', [[Victor Horta]] and [[Henry van de Velde]], designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration.  The Belgian designer [[Gustave Serrurier-Bovy]] added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called ''Nieuwe Kunst'' or New Art, H.P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English [[Arts and Crafts]] movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration.&lt;ref name="Lucie-Smith, 160"&gt;Lucie-Smith, 160&lt;/ref&gt; Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of [[Peter Behrens]] and the [[Jugendstil]] was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the [[Wiener Werkstätte]] in Vienna, led by [[Otto Wagner]], [[Josef Hoffmann]], Josef Maria Olbrich and [[Koloman Moser]]. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the [[Biedemeier]] style.{{Sfn|RIley|2007|page=308}}
 
Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. [[Carlo Bugatti]] in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of [[Antoni Gaudi]] and the ''Modernismo'' movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was [[Charles Rohlfs]] in Buffalo, New York, whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of [[Celtic Art]] and [[Gothic art]], with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=312}}

The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovation in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (''grand feu'') porcelain with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as oxblood glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional [[Stoneware|''grés'']] methods and reinvented them with new motifs. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, [[Jules Lavirotte]] and [[Hector Guimard]] among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with ceramic tiles, many of them made by the firm of [[Alexandre Bigot]], giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look. In the Art Nouveau ceramics quickly moved into the domain of sculpture and architecture.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|pages=314-15}}

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was [[Ernest Chaplet]], whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter [[Paul Gauguin]] on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors [[Félix Bracquemond]], [[Jules Dalou]] and [[Auguste Rodin]]. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]] outside Paris; [[Nymphenburg]], [[Meissen]], [[Villeroy &amp; Boch]] in Germany, and [[Doulton Industrial Products|Doulton]] in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included [[Taxile Doat]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat|fr}}, [[Edmond Lachenal]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Albert Dammouse|fr}} and [[Auguste Delaherche]].&lt;ref&gt;''Edmond Lachenal and His Legacy'', by Martin Eidelberg, Claire Cass, Hudson Hills Press; illustrated edition (25 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine ''Dancer with a Scarf'' by [[Agathon Léonard]], made for the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The [[Zsolnay|Zsolnay factory]] in [[Pécs]], [[Hungary]], was led by [[Miklós Zsolnay]] (1800–1880) and his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900,) with [[Tádé Sikorski]] (1852–1940) chief designer, to produce stoneware and other ceramics in 1853. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of [[eosin]]. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 World Fair in Vienna]], then at the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 World Fair in Paris]], where Zsolnay received a ''Grand Prix''. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magyarkeramia.hu/keramia/zsolnay/page_en.html Timeline], accessed 1/23/08&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs o[[William Morris]] had helped launch the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty department store]] in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the [[Silver Studio]], which provided colorful stylized floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from [[Glasgow School]], and [[Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh]]. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylized eggs, geometric forms and the "Rose of Glasgow".

In France, a major contribution was made by designer [[Eugène Grasset]] who in 1896 published ''La Plante et ses applications ornamentales'', suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer [[Hermann Obrist]]  specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the "whiplash" style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian [[Henry van de Velde]] presented a textile work, ''La Veillée d'Anges'', at the Salon ''La Libre Esthéthique'' in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of [[Paul Gauguin]] and of the [[Nabis]]. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by [[batik]] patterns from the Dutch colonies in the [[East Indies]]. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of [[Gerhard Munthe]] and [[Frida Hansen]] in Norway. The ''Five Swans'' design of [[Otto Eckmann]] appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer [[János Vaszary]] combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.{{Sfn|Riley|2007|page=328}}

'''''Avotakka''''' is a monthly [[Finnish language|Finnish]] interior design [[magazine]] published in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. 

==History and profile==
''Avotakka'' was first published in December 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Avotakka Magazine|url=https://whatsgoingonatconran.wordpress.com/tag/avotakka-magazine/|work=Conran|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 it merged with an older Finnish design magazine ''Kaunis koti'' [meaning ''Beautiful Home'' in English], which had first been published in 1948. At the time, the merger represented the combination of a more middle- and professional class magazine (''Kaunis koti'') with a more populist magazine (''Avotakka''). The owner and publisher is A-lehdet Oy&lt;ref name=usm&gt;{{cite web|title=Member Info|url=http://www.aikakauslehdet.fi/Frontpage/Members-of-FPPA/Member-info/?lista=luokat&amp;luokka=a.2.1&amp;vuosi=2014&amp;lang=eng&amp;type=&amp;sub=Consumer%20magazines|work=Aikakaus Media|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the headquarters of the magazine is in [[Helsinki]].&lt;ref name=aik/&gt; The magazine is published on a monthly basis.&lt;ref name=usm/&gt;

As of 2011 the [[editor-in-chief]] of the magazine was Soili Ukkola.

[[File:Jaco pastorius 87.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Jaco Pastorius]] (1951–1987) was an influential American [[jazz]] bassist, composer and big band leader. He is best known for his work with [[Weather Report]] from 1976 to 1981, as well as work with artists including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Pat Metheny]], and his own solo projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/jaco-pastorius-is-the-most-important-musician-youve-never-heard-of|title=Jaco Pastorius Is the Most Important Musician You Might Have Never Heard Of|author=|date=6 March 2015|website=vice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
A '''bassist''' or '''bass player''', is a musician who plays a [[Bass (instrument)|bass instrument]] such as a [[double bass]], [[bass guitar]], [[keyboard bass]] or a low brass instrument such as a [[tuba]] or [[sousaphone]]. Different [[musical genre]]s tend to be associated with one or more of these instruments. Since the 1960s, the electric bass has been the standard bass instrument for [[funk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premierguitar.com/articles/20342-on-bass-what-the-funk|title=On Bass: What the Funk?|author=|date=|website=premierguitar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[R&amp;B]], soul music, [[rock and roll]], [[reggae]], [[jazz fusion]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[Country music|country]] and pop music. The double bass is the standard bass instrument for [[European classical music|classical music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[rockabilly]], and most genres of [[jazz]]. Low brass instruments such as the tuba or sousaphone are the standard bass instrument in [[Dixieland]] and New Orleans-style jazz bands.

Despite the associations of different bass instruments with certain genres, there are exceptions. Some 1990s and 2000s rock and pop bands use a double bass, such as both [[Andrew Jackson Jihad]], [[Barenaked Ladies]]; [[Indie rock|Indie]] band [[The Decemberists]] and [[punk rock]], [[psychobilly]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artofslapbass.com/artofslapbass/index.php?...3{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; groups such as [[The Living End]], [[Nekromantix]], [[The Horrorpops]] and [[Tiger Army]]. Some fusion jazz groups use a lightweight, stripped-down [[electric upright bass]] rather than a double bass. Some composers of modern art music use the electric bass in a [[chamber music]] setting. Some jazz big bands use electric bass. Some funk, R&amp;B and jazz, fusion groups use [[synth bass]] or keyboard bass rather than electric bass. Bootsy Collins and Stevie Wonder used synth bass. Some Dixieland bands use double bass or electric bass instead of a tuba. In some jazz groups and [[jam band]]s, the basslines are played by a [[Hammond organ]] player, who uses the bass [[pedal keyboard]] or the lower manual for the low notes.

Electric bassists play the [[bass guitar]]. In most rock, pop, metal and country genres, the [[bass line]] outlines the [[Chord progression|harmony]] of the music being performed, while simultaneously indicating the rhythmic pulse. In addition, there are many different standard bass line types for different genres and types of song (e.g. blues ballad, fast swing, etc.). Bass lines often emphasize the root note, with a secondary role for the third, and fifth of each [[chord (music)|chord]] being used in a given song. In addition, [[pedal point|pedal tones]] (repeated or sustained single notes), [[ostinato]]s, and bass [[riff]]s are also used as bass lines. While most electric bass players rarely play [[Chord (music)|chord]]s (three or more notes all sounded at the same time), chords are used in some styles, especially [[funk]], [[R&amp;B]], soul music, [[jazz]], [[Latin]] and [[heavy metal music]].

The '''Bethlem Gallery''' is an [[art gallery]] in [[Beckenham]], [[London Borough of Bromley|Bromley]], [[England]]. It was established in 1997 to support and exhibit artists who are current or former patients of the [[South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slam.nhs.uk/about-us/art-and-history/bethlem-gallery | title=Bethlem Gallery | work=About Us | publisher=South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust | location=UK | accessdate=28 June 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707060639/http://slam.nhs.uk/about-us/art-and-history/bethlem-gallery | archivedate=7 July 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery is housed in an Art Deco building shared with the [[Bethlem Museum of the Mind]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slam.nhs.uk/about-us/art-and-history/bethlem-gallery-and-museum |title=Bethlem Gallery and Museum - South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust |publisher=Slam.nhs.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; with exhibits about the history of Bethlem Royal Hospital.

The '''Cave of Nicanor''' ({{IPAc-en|n|aɪ|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ər}}; {{IPA-grc|niː.ˈka.nɔːr|lang}}) is an ancient burial cave located on [[Mount Scopus]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]]. Excavations in the cave discovered an [[ossuary]] referring to "Nicanor the door maker".&lt;ref&gt;Clermont-Ganneau, "Archeological and epigraphic notes on Palestine," Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, 1903, pp.125-131; Gladys Dikson, "The tomb of Nicanor of Alexandria," Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement, 1903, pp.326-332.&lt;/ref&gt; The cave is located in the [[National Botanic Garden of Israel]] on the grounds of the Mount Scopus campus of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

Nicanor belonged to a wealthy [[Jews of Egypt|Alexandrian Jewish]] family. He is mentioned in the works of the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and the [[Talmud]] as the donor of the bronze doors of the Court of the Women in the [[Second Temple]] in Jerusalem. This fact is also inscribed in Greek on his ossuary, which is a rare case of archaeology supporting facts stated by written sources.

==Exploration history==
In 1903, John Gray Hill discovered the family tomb of Nicanor of Alexandria ({{lang-grc-gre|Νικάνωρ Ἀλεξανδρεύς}})&lt;ref name='Greek-spelling'/&gt; in a field just north of his house. Gladys Dickson brought it to the attention of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]], a French diplomat and orientalist, examined it, publishing his conclusions in the ''Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement''. Later that year Dickson published a detailed report on the tomb complex illustrated with plans by R.A. Stewart Macalister.  Gray Hill gave the ossuary to the Palestine Exploration Fund, which transferred it to the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=369621&amp;partid=1&amp;searchText=nicanor&amp;fromADBC=ad&amp;toADBC=ad&amp;numpages=10&amp;orig=%2fresearch%2fsearch_the_collection_database.aspx&amp;currentPage=1 Nicanor sarcophagus in the [[British Museum]]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
===Courtyard===
Outside the burial caves is a hewn rectangular courtyard.

===Burial caves===
Two burial caves can be accessed from the courtyard.

The burial cave containing Nicanor's ossuary is typical of the Second Temple period. Four burial halls, each with a number of burial niches. In the passages between the halls rock depressions indicate that the entrances were decorated with stone slabs, a phenomenon unique to this cave.

A fifth burial cave not linked to the rest of the hall, opens to the right of the front yard, on the eastern side of the courtyard.

===Ossuary===
Nicanor's ossuary bears an inscription mentioning, among other things, his best-known deed: 'Bones of the family of Nicanor the Alexandrian who made the gates'. The ossuary is engraved with geometric patterns, with rough red-painted decoration on the lid. The inscriptions appear at one end.

==Date==
The architectural plan of the cave, the artistic style, and finds within it, allow the cave to be dated to the middle of first century CE.

===Byzantine-period findings===
[[Byzantine]] pottery found at the bottom of the shafts in the yard and two crosses engraved on the wall of the main room, show that use of the cave continued until the Byzantine period.

== National Pantheon of Israel ==
[[File:Pinsker-Oshiskin.jpg|250px|thumb|Tombs of Leon Pinsker and Menachem Ussishkin]]
In 1934, the remains of [[Leon Pinsker]] from [[Odessa]] were reburied in the Nicanor cave at the initiative of [[Menachem Ussishkin]], who envisaged a national pantheon on Mt. Scopus.  However, the only other person buried there was Ussishkin himself, who died in 1941. A national leaders plot was established on [[Mount Herzl]] after the founding of the state in 1948, in part because Mount Scopus became an enclave in [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordanian-ruled territory]].

'''''Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads''''' is an artwork by Chinese contemporary artist and political commentator, [[Ai Weiwei]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2959">[[File:Baths of Diocletian-Antmoose1.jpg|thumb|320px|right|&lt;center&gt;The Baths of Diocletian in Rome with three-light “Diocletian windows” visible.]]

'''Diocletian windows''', also called '''thermal windows''', are large semicircular windows characteristic of the enormous [[public bath]]s (''[[thermae]]'') of [[Ancient Rome]]. They have been revived on a limited basis by some [[neo-classical architecture|classical revivalist architects]] in more modern times.

==Description==
Diocletian windows are large segmental arched [[window]]s (or other openings) which are usually divided into three lights (window compartments) by two vertical [[mullion]]s. The central compartment is often wider than the two side lights on either side of it.&lt;ref name=pevsner1&gt;{{cite book|title=Pevsner's Architectural Glossary|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16721-4|editor=Bradley, Simon|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names ==
Diocletian windows are named after the windows found in the [[Baths of Diocletian|Thermae (Baths) of Diocletian]] (AD 302) in [[Rome]]. (The Thermae is now the church of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri]].) The variant name, thermal window, also comes from their association with the Thermae of Diocletian.

== Influence ==
[[File:Penn Station3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;A five-light variant of the thermal window is seen on the old [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] in New York City (''circa'' 1911).]]

This type of window was revived and used in Italy in the 16th century, especially by [[Andrea Palladio]]. Palladio and others incorporated an elongated Diocletian window in the form of an arched central light flanked by narrower, square-headed apertures. This combination became known as a [[Palladian architecture#The Palladian window|Palladian, or Venetian, window]].

The Diocletian window was much used in the early 18th century by the English architect [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Richard Boyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/164082/Diocletian-window www.britannica.com- Diocletian Window]&lt;/ref&gt; 3rd [[Earl of Burlington]], one of the originators of the [[Palladian architecture#English Palladian revival (neo-Palladian)|English Palladian style]], and by his followers.

Diocletian windows continued to be used occasionally in large public buildings in the various devolutions of [[neoclassical architecture]] including the [[Beaux Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]] (1880–1920).

'''Dissernet''' ({{lang-ru|Диссернет}}) is a volunteer community network working to clean Russian science of [[plagiarism]]. The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] and [[habilitation]] (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.

Launched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=2016-05-22|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|archivedate=2016-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of [[academic fraud]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the [[State Duma]] had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding  [[academic degree]]s. Dissernet  deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.

The key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:

* Large-scale, bad faith and non-attributed  plagiarism   of other people's scientific works and other texts used by the authors of examined works in breach of the proper citation rules fixed in regulations of the  [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK) of the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of Russia]];
* Falsification of scientific research articles which, according to VAK regulations, are a mandatory prerequisite for awarding the respective academic degree to the applicant;
* Gross violations of the rules for thesis preparation (documenting performed research, interaction with the scientific research supervisor, advisor, opponents, co-authors, getting formal responses, etc.) as well as the procedure for defense of the thesis prescribed by VAK regulations.

Within the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise The latest expertises] on the Dissernet site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the [[State Duma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexandrova|first=Lyudmila|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/opinions/1451|title= Russia’s bloggers help authorities expose forged dissertations|publisher=[[Russian News Agency TASS]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]], [[governor (Russia)|governors]] of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities,&lt;ref name="investigators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/crime/20131125/184982011/Russias-Top-Investigator-Accused-of-Plagiarism.html|title=Russia’s Top Investigator Accused of Plagiarism|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate= February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; heads of security and military services, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupaper.com/post/12076|title=The Moscow minister will ask to cancel his thesis|publisher=Rupaper.com |date= December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mass media coverage ==
The work of the Dissernet community has gained much publicity and has been broadly covered in Russian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girin|first=Nikita|url=http://www.novayagazeta.ru/politics/60155.html|title=Это не про науку.

The result of the research performed by the Monitoring Center Public.Ru (more than 7500 federal and regional social and political and business [[printed matter]]s, Internet [[mass media]], news feeds of [[News agency|Press agencies]], programs of central TV- and radio-channels have been analysed) showed that at 2013 year-end the word "Dissernet" was accepted as third by popularity [[neologism]] of the year, after the words "[[Euromaidan]]" and "[[titushky]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.public.ru/press_slovo_2013/|title=Пресс-слово 2013|publisher=Public.Ru|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the magazine ''Russian Reporter'' mentioned Dissernet’s work among the most notable milestones of the year 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2013/50/vehi-goda/|title=Вехи года|work=Russian Reporter|number=50|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Internet edition ''The Village'' published an article about Dissernet in the dictionary "Summaries of 2013: main words and phrases of the outgoing year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasilnikova|first=Nastya|url= http://www.the-village.ru/village/city/city/136119-slovar-2|title=Итоги 2013: главные слова и фразы уходящего года|work=The Village|date= December 23, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anatolian animal carpets''' represent a special type of pile-woven [[Turkish carpet|carpet]], woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, corresponding to the 14th–16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, and most of them are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th–16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and support our knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H.

== Surviving carpets ==

=== Dragon and Phoenix carpet ===
A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between the [[fenghuang]], or Chinese [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and the dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. [[Radiocarbon dating]] confirmed that the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet was woven in the mid 15th century, during the early [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rageth|first1=Jürg|title=Dating the dragon &amp; phoenix fragments.|journal=Hali|date=2004|volume=134|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is knotted with symmetric knots.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beselin|first1=Anna|title=Geknüpfte Kunst : Teppiche des Museums für Islamische Kunst = Woven Art: Carpets of the Berlin Museum of Islamic art|date=2011|publisher=Edition Minerva|location=Wolfratshausen|isbn=9783938832806|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese motif was probably introduced into [[Islamic art]] by the Mongols, or artists working for them, during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his original borders, and seems to be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-groud octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles and rows of white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;

The Phoenix and Dragon carpet was first described in 1881 by [[Julius Lessing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Orientalische Teppiche = Oriental Carpets|date=1891|publisher=Ernst Wasmuth|location=Berlin|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Teppich-Erzeugung im Orient. Monographien von Sir George Birdwood in London, Geheimrath Dr. Wilhelm Bode in Berlin, C. Purdon Clarke in London, M. Gerspach in Paris, Sidney J. A. Churchill, M. R. A. S. in Teheran, Vincent J. Robinson in London, u.a.|date=1895|publisher=Verlag des K. K. Österreichischen Handels-Museums|location=Wien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Dragon and Phoenix carpet has been referred to in many books on Oriental carpets.

A similar fragment was discovered in [[Fustat]], with dragon and phoenix depicted in combat on a yellow field. The animals in this fragment are depicted in red, and outlined in blue. The minor border shows a variant of the "kufic" borders known from other Seljuq period carpets.

=== Marby rug ===
Another carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby in [[Jämtland]] province. The rug was radiocarbon dated to 1300–1420.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt; More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have additional rows of knots on their backsides. At a distance of every 6&amp;nbsp;cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from [[Fustat]] has similar additional knots. It has been suggested that these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of the carpet and the amount of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;46–49&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;)

=== Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum ===
The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Anatolian animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the [[Siena|Sienese]]  artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

=== Animal carpets from the Vakıflar Museum ===
The field of an animal carpet in the Vakıflar Museum, [[Istanbul]] (Inv. No. E-1)&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=HIrsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into two rectangular compartments by a band similar to its borders. An octagon containing [[confronted animals]] is inscribed into each compartment. The winged animals face a stylized tree. They show a down-turned, snout-like head, to which antler-like extensions are attached, and their body is spotted. Overall, the animals more resemble [[fallow deer]] than birds, which are usually depicted on animal carpets. Deer and fallow deer are already depicted on the borders of the [[Pazyryk carpet]], and are frequently seen on early textiles and other objects in Anatolia and Iran. Below each deer, and above the main animal, is a bird-like quadruped.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

Another animal carpet with a coarser design compared to the Vakıflar rug is at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in [[Konya]] (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;).

=== Animal carpet from the Pergamon Museum ===
Another carpet in the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a rectangular field surrounded by an eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each at the top and bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional [[Warp and woof|wefts]] can be seen meandering over two [[Warp and woof|warps]] after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;50–1&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;) See: [[knot density]].

=== Batári-Crivelli fragment, Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest ===
The animal carpet fragment is approximately half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second segment of the medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a [[mosque lamp]] ornament. In the center of the long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the "Dragon and Phoenix" and "Marby" rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. [[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, [[indigo]] blue, [[Rubia tinctorum|madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed ([[Reseda luteola]]), and Dyer's sage ([[Salvia fruticosa]]), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batári|first1=Ferenc|title=Ottoman Turkish carpets|date=1994|publisher=Budapest Museum of Applied Arts|location=Budapest|isbn=978-9630492126|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Batári, the late curator of the carpet and textile department of the museum.

Other animal carpets are at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]] and in private collections.

== Animal carpets in Renaissance painting ==
{{see also|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
Animal-style carpets begin to appear in Italian paintings in the 14th, and continue to be depicted in Western European paintings throughout the 15th century. They represent the earliest Oriental carpets which were identified in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance painting]]. The comparison of animal-style carpets on Renaissance paintings, for which the painter and the date of origin are often known, allows for the determination of a [[Terminus post quem|"''terminus ante quem''"]] date for existing carpets of similar design. Wilhelm von Bode identified a carpet on [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s 1440 painting ''The Marriage of the Foundlings'' with marked similarities to the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet. This marks the beginning of the "ante quem" method, which was subsequently further elaborated by the "Berlin School" of History of Islamic Art. By this method, a variety of existing carpets could be dated by comparison to their painted counterparts.

The illustrated rugs are generally drawn by the early Renaissance painters in a simplified manner, compared to the original carpet designs. The artists may sometimes have painted the animals out of their imagination, but the general appearance of the painted rugs still resembles the originals.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;

A general compositional analysis of the animal-style rugs from Renaissance paintings was first developed by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Orientalische Tierteppiche auf Bildern des XIV. und XV Jahrhunderts = Oriental animal carpets on paintings of the 14th and 15th century.|journal=Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen|date=1929|issue=5|pages=261–298|jstor=23350357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of animal carpets is usually divided into rectangular compartments, large or small. Each compartment contains an octagon, which in turn contains animal figures of four types:
# "Heraldic" animals, including single- or double-headed eagles;
# A pair of birds and a tree;
# Single birds or quadrupeds in a geometric frame;
# Paired animals within a frame, sometimes depicted in combat.

=== 14th century ===
At the beginning of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Siena and Florence school]]. During the second half of the 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in [[Lippo Memmi]]'s ''Virgin Mary and Child'', 1340–50, and in [[Sano di Pietro]]'s ''Marriage of the Virgin'', 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar rug in the Vakıflar Halı Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=John|title=Early animal carpets in Western paintings|journal=Hali|date=1978|volume=1|issue=3|pages=234–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A carpet fragment with a single bird with its head turned is now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragment of an animal carpet|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/448133?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=carpet+fragment&amp;pos=18|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painted counterpart can be seen in [[Niccolò di Buonaccorso]]'s "Marriage of the Virgin", 1380.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 15th – 16th century ===
By the beginning of the 15th century, the variations of the animal design increase:

Two animal-style carpet fragments from Fustat were dated to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt; They contain parts of a different version of the tree-and-birds pattern seen in the Marby rug. The field is no longer divided into fields, and the tree-and-paired birds pattern appear in offset rows, covering the field in endless repeat (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;29, plates 18,19&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

A fresco in the [[Palais des Papes]] at Avignon, by [[Matteo di Giovanni]] depicts a carpet with rather indistinct bird figures in front of the Pope's throne. Written sources of the 14th century indicate that [[Pope Benedict XII]] very much liked a carpet with "white swans", which he had set before his throne. A painting by [[Giovanni di Paolo]], 1440, shows an Anatolian animal style rug with birds spread before the pope's throne (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;33, ill. 5 and 6&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

Various examples are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A rug in the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]], dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;31, plate 20&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). A painting by [[Jaume Huguet]] in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs can be seen in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome, and in "Madonna enthroned" by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;34, ill. 7 and 8&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in [[Carlo Crivelli]]'s "Annunciation", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on [[Fra Angelico]]'s [[San Marco Altarpiece]].

The Pergamon Museum's "Phoenix and Dragon" finds its painted counterparts in Domenico di Bartolo's "The Marriage of the Foundlings" (1440) shows a very similar rug, as well as [[Alesso Baldovinetti]]'s "Tale of Saint Vincenzo Ferrerio", and [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s "Annunciation".

The Vakıflar Museum's animal carpet has a painted counterpart in [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]]'s "Portrait of Dorothy Cary, later Viscountess Rochford". The animals shown in the painted rug are very similar to the small bird-like animals in the Vakıflar carpet. As known so far, the carpet depicted in Larkin's portrait is the last of its kind, and the last animal carpet seen in a Western European painting (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62,&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt; Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

The Batári-Crivelli fragment finds its parallel in two paintings by [[Carlo Crivelli]], the ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt and the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery]] (1486). Both paintings depict a carpet with a sixteen-pointed star motif, with some compartments containing highly stylised animal motifs.

'''Exumer''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[thrash metal]] band formed in [[Wiesbaden]] in 1985 by singer/bassist [[Mem V. Stein]] and guitarist [[Ray Mensh]]. The band broke up in 1991 after two demos and two albums. Exumer appeared for a one-off show at ''[[Wacken Open Air]]'' in 2001 and were re-activated by V. Stein and Mensh in 2008.

== History ==
{{ods|date=August 2016}}
The first album, ''[[Possessed by Fire]]'', moves on the same line of ''[[Into the Dark Past]]'' of the then label mates of [[Angel Dust (band)|Angel Dust]], the second album ''[[Rising from the Sea]]'' is rather more obvious the influence of [[Slayer]] thanks to the voice of Paul Arakaki, similar to that of [[Tom Araya]]. Soon after this album the band broke up only to reform in the 2001 during the exhibition at [[Wacken Open Air]]. In 2009 Exumer released a one track demo called "Waking the Fire". Exumer released their third album ''[[Fire &amp; Damnation]]'' in April 2012, followed four years later by their fourth album ''The Raging Tides''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exumer-to-enter-studio-this-month/|title=Exumer To Enter Studio This Month|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|date=October 16, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Glasgow School''' was a circle of influential artists and designers that began to coalesce in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]] in the 1870s, and flourished from the 1890s to around 1910. Representative groups included '''The Four''' (also known as the '''Spook School'''), the '''Glasgow Girls'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Glasgow Girls: women in art and design, 1880-1920|publisher=Canongate|year=2001|isbn=9781841951515|editor-last=Burkhauser|editor-first=Jude|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the '''Glasgow Boys'''.&lt;ref&gt;Rezelman, Cogger. The Glasgow Boys.&lt;/ref&gt; They were responsible for creating the distinctive '''Glasgow Style'''.

Glasgow experienced an [[Boom and bust|economic boom]] at the end of the 19th century, resulting in an increase in distinctive contributions to the [[Art Nouveau]] movement, particularly in the fields of [[architecture]], [[interior design]] and [[painting]].

==The Four (Spook School)==
[[File:Wfm glasgow school of art.jpg|thumb|right|Glasgow School of Art]]
Among the most prominent definers of the Glasgow School  collective were The Four. They were the [[Painting|painter]] and [[Studio glass|glass artist]] [[Margaret MacDonald (artist)|Margaret MacDonald]], acclaimed [[architect]] [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] (MacDonald's husband), MacDonald's sister [[Frances MacDonald|Frances]] and [[Herbert MacNair]]. Together, The Four defined the Glasgow Style's fusion of influences including the [[Celtic Revival]], the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], and [[Japonisme]], which found favour throughout the [[modern art]] world of continental [[Europe]]. The Four, otherwise known as the Spook School, ultimately made a significant impact on the definition of [[Art Nouveau]]. The name, Spook School, or Spooky or Ghoul School,  was originally a "derisive epithet" given to their work which "distorted and conventionalized human... form."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920|last = Burkhauser|first = Jude|publisher = Canongate Press|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 55-104|chapter = The Glasgow Style}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Glasgow Girls==
The Glasgow Girls is the name now used for a group of female designers and [[women artists|artists]] including Margaret and Frances MacDonald, both of whom were members of The Four, [[Jessie M. King]], [[Annie French]], [[Helen Paxton Brown]], [[Jessie Wylie Newbery]], [[Ann Macbeth]], [[Bessie MacNicol]], [[Norah Neilson Gray]],&lt;ref name=show&gt;[http://www.helensburgh-heritage.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=777:glasgow-girls-work-on-show&amp;catid=101:headlines&amp;Itemid=539 Glasgow Girls On Display], Mary Selwood, accessed July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stansmore Dean Stevenson|Stansmore Dean]], [[Eleanor Allen Moore]], [[De Courcy Lewthwaite Dewar]], the silversmith Agnes Banks Harvey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01nbr0x|title=Series 35, Antiques Roadshow - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Christian Jane Fergusson]]. May Wilson and Eliza Bell, among others, continued the tradition of ceramic artistry into the 1940s and 1950s by hand painting various items with floral patterns.

Women were able to flourish in Glasgow during a "period of enlightenment" that took place between 1885 and 1920, where women were actively pursuing art careers and the [[Glasgow School of Art]] had a significant period of "international visibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920|last = Burkhauser|first = Jude|publisher = Canongate Press, Plc|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 19–26|chapter = Restored to a Place of Honour}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is sometimes attributed to the "influential" and "progressive"&lt;ref name=times/&gt; head of the art school, [[Fra Newbery]], who established an environment in which women could flourish, both as students and as teachers.&lt;ref name=tanner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/73660|title=Glasgow Girls (act. 1880–1920) - Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|website=Oxforddnb.com|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Women benefited from the new [[Glasgow Society of Lady Artists]] (founded 1882) which offered a place for women artists to meet and also had exhibition space.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt; In addition, many art school students and staff were  involved in [[women's suffrage]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920 |publisher = Canongate Press, Plc|year = 1993|isbn = 0963698508|location = Edinburgh|pages = 43-54|editor-last = Burkhauser|editor-first = Jude|chapter = The 'New Woman' in the Arts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Students took turns between classes stitching up banners" for the movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The name "Glasgow Girls" emerged much later. In the 1960s there was an attempt to give due attention to the work of the city’s women artists to balance the plentiful discussion of the Glasgow Boys.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt; It is thought that the then head of the [[Scottish Arts Council]] William Buchanan was the first to use the name in the catalogue for a 1968 Glasgow Boys exhibition.&lt;ref name=tanner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exploreart.co.uk/results.asp?SF1=art_style&amp;ST1=The+Glasgow+Girls|title=ExploreArt -  Search Results - The Glasgow Girls|website=Exploreart.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Glasgow Boys: An Exhibition of Work by the Group of Artists who Flourished in Glasgow 1880-1900'', Volume 2, Scottish Arts Council, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  This "invention"&lt;ref name=times&gt;Andrew Gibbbon Williams, 'Engendering respect', The Times (features), 18 Sep 1990&lt;/ref&gt; has been called an "ironic reference" to the equivalent men’s grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org./stable/1358454|title= 'Review of "Glasgow Girls": Women in Art and Design 1880-1920' |author=Lynne Walker|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=14.2|date=1993|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term Glasgow Girls was emphasised by a major exhibition ''Glasgow Girls: Women in Art and Design 1880-1920'' organised by [[Jude Burkhauser]] in 1990.

==The Glasgow Boys==
Through the 1880s and 1890s, around the same time that the Spook School was gaining prominence, a collective which came to be known as the Glasgow Boys was interpreting and expanding the [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] and [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] painting. Their subject matter featured [[rural]], prosaic scenes from in and around Glasgow. Their colorful depictions attempted to capture the many facets of the character of [[Scotland]].

The Glasgow Boys consisted of several men, most of whom were trained in, or had strong ties to the city of Glasgow. These men were brought together by a passion for realism and naturalism and this showed through in the pieces they produced. Along with this passion for naturalism, they shared a marked distaste for the Edinburgh oriented Scottish art establishment, which they viewed as oppressive. Driven and motivated by these ideals they embraced change, created masterpieces, and became Scottish icons in the process.

Among the painters associated with the group were [[Joseph Crawhall]] (1861–1913), [[Thomas Millie Dow]] (1848-1919), [[James Guthrie (artist)|James Guthrie]] (1859–1930), [[George Henry (painter)|George Henry]] (1858–1943), [[Edward Atkinson Hornel|E. A. Hornel]] (1864–1933), [[James Whitelaw Hamilton]] (1860-1932) and [[E. A. Walton]] (1860–1922). [[David Gauld]] (1865–1936), [[William Kennedy (painter)|William Kennedy]] (1859–1918), [[John Lavery]] (1856–1941), [[Harrington Mann]] (1864-1937), [[Stuart Park]] (1862–1933), [[William Wells (painter)|William Wells]] (1872–1923), [[David Young Cameron]] (1865–1945), [[Alexander Ignatius Roche]] (1861–1923), [[Arthur Melville]] (1855–1904), [[Thomas Corsan Morton]] (1859-1928), [[James Nairn]] (1859–1904), [[George Pirie (artist)|George Pirie]] (1863-1946)  and [[John Quinton Pringle]] (1864–1925). [[James Paterson (painter)|James Paterson]] (1854–1932) and [[William York Macgregor]] (1855-1923) were leading figures in the group, which used to meet at Macgregor's studio.

Their main influences were that of Japanese print, French Realism including [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]], and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], but all of their experiences around the world greatly impacted on and inspired their work, in particular in Spain, North Africa, and Japan. The group was constantly influenced by what they saw in the world around them and strove to display these images by utilizing the techniques of realism and naturalism; they had a passion to depict things as they actually are. This is one of the reasons that the group often chose to work outdoors. Working outdoors allowed them to produce paintings that were as true to nature as possible and it allowed them to paint realistic objects in their natural environment. They painted real people in real places. The production of naturalistic paintings was new to this time period, and thus their techniques were considered to be innovative. Similarly, the pieces often created a sense of movement, an accurate (or naturalistic) depiction of light and shade, and extremely realistic texture. This made them stand out in the art community.

===Collections and exhibitions===
A large collection of work from the Glasgow Boys is held in the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], where one room is dedicated to the group. The museum houses more than 60 of the Boys' pieces that were created between 1880 and 1900, arguably the time period in which their best, and most innovative, pieces were produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-15385117|title=New Glasgow Boys gallery to open|date=20 October 2011|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More of their works can be found on display at the [[Burrell Collection]], [[Broughton House]], [[Paisley Museum and Art Galleries]] and the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4131">In [[mathematics]], a '''harmonious set''' is a subset of a [[locally compact abelian group]] on which every weak character may be uniformly approximated by strong characters. Equivalently, a suitably defined dual set is relatively dense in the [[Pontryagin dual]] of the group. This notion was introduced by [[Yves Meyer]] in 1970 and later turned out to play an important role in the mathematical theory of [[quasicrystal]]s. Some related concepts are '''model sets''', '''[[Meyer set]]s''', and '''cut-and-project sets'''.

== Definition ==

Let ''&amp;Lambda;'' be a subset of a locally compact abelian group ''G'' and ''&amp;Lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; be the subgroup of ''G'' generated by ''&amp;Lambda;'', with [[discrete topology]]. A '''weak character''' is a restriction to ''&amp;Lambda;'' of an algebraic homomorphism from ''&amp;Lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; into the [[circle group]]:

: &lt;math&gt; \chi: \Lambda_d\to\mathbf{T}, \quad 
\chi\in\operatorname{Hom}(\Lambda_d,\mathbf{T}). &lt;/math&gt;

A '''strong character''' is a restriction to ''&amp;Lambda;'' of a continuous homomorphism from ''G'' to '''T''', that is an element of the [[Pontryagin dual]] of ''G''.

A set ''&amp;Lambda;'' is '''harmonious''' if every weak character may be approximated by 
strong characters uniformly on ''&amp;Lambda;''. Thus for any ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 and any weak character ''&amp;chi;'', there exists a strong character ''&amp;xi;'' such that

: &lt;math&gt; \sup_\Lambda |\chi(\lambda)-\xi(\lambda)| \leq \epsilon, \quad
\chi\in\operatorname{Hom}(\Lambda_d,\mathbf{T}), \xi\in\hat{G}. &lt;/math&gt;

If the locally compact abelian group ''G'' is [[separable topological space|separable]] and [[metrizable]] (its topology may be defined by a translation-invariant metric) then harmonious sets admit another, related, description. Given a subset ''&amp;Lambda;'' of ''G'' and a positive ''&amp;epsilon;'', let ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; be the subset of the Pontryagin dual of ''G'' consisting of all characters that are almost trivial on ''&amp;Lambda;'':

: &lt;math&gt; \sup_\Lambda|\chi(\lambda)-1| \leq \epsilon, \quad
\chi\in\hat{G}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''&amp;Lambda;'' is '''harmonious''' if the sets ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; are '''relatively dense''' in the sense of [[Besicovitch]]: for every ''&amp;epsilon;'' &gt; 0 there exists a compact subset ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;epsilon;''&lt;/sub&gt; of the Pontryagin dual such that

: &lt;math&gt; M_\epsilon + K_\epsilon = \hat{G}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Properties ==

* A subset of a harmonious set is harmonious.
* If ''&amp;Lambda;'' is a harmonious set and ''F'' is a finite set then the set ''&amp;Lambda;'' + ''F'' is also harmonious.

The next two properties show that the notion of a harmonious set is nontrivial only when the ambient group is neither compact nor discrete.

* A finite set ''&amp;Lambda;'' is always harmonious. If the group ''G'' is compact then, conversely, every harmonious set is finite.
* If ''G'' is a [[discrete group]] then every set is harmonious.

== Examples ==

Interesting examples of multiplicatively closed harmonious sets of real numbers arise in the theory of [[diophantine approximation]].

* Let ''G'' be the additive group of [[real number]]s, ''&amp;theta;'' &gt;1, and the set ''&amp;Lambda;'' consist of all finite sums of different powers of ''&amp;theta;''. Then ''&amp;Lambda;'' is harmonious if and only if ''&amp;theta;'' is a [[Pisot number]]. In particular, the sequence of powers of a Pisot number is harmonious.
* Let '''K''' be a real [[algebraic number field]] of degree ''n'' over '''Q''' and the set ''&amp;Lambda;'' consist of all Pisot or [[Salem number|Salem]] numbers of degree ''n'' in '''K'''. Then ''&amp;Lambda;'' is contained in the open interval (1,&amp;infin;), closed under multiplication, and harmonious. Conversely, any set of real numbers with these 3 properties consists of all Pisot or Salem numbers of degree ''n'' in some real algebraic number field '''K''' of degree ''n''.

[[Image:ComynscarrVF.jpg|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;"An Art Critic"&lt;br&gt;February 1893 caricature by Spy ([[Leslie Ward]]) in [[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Joseph William Comyns Carr''' (1 March 1849 – 12 December 1916) was an English drama and art critic, gallery director, author, poet, playwright and theatre manager.

Beginning his career as an art critic, Carr was a vigorous advocate for Pre-Raphaelite art and a vocal critic of the "short-sighted" art establishment.  In 1877 he became a director of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] and promoting Pre-Raphaelite painters and other important exhibitors, such as [[James McNeill Whistler]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]].  Ten years later he founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]].

Carr also wrote essays, books, plays, librettos, English-language adaptations of foreign works and stage adaptations of Dickens novels and classic tales like ''King Arthur'' and ''Faust''.

==Life and career==
J. Comyns Carr was born in [[Marylebone]], [[Middlesex]], England, the seventh of ten children.  His parents were Jonathan Carr, a woollen draper, and his Irish wife, Catherine Grace Comyns. Kate Comyns Carr, his sister, became a portrait artist; his brother Jonathan Carr developed the world's first garden suburb [[Bedford Park, London|Bedford Park]].&lt;ref&gt;Casteras, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbJBSpYc0_4C&amp;pg=PA184 p. 184, n. 12]&lt;/ref&gt; Comyns Carr was educated at [[Bruce Castle School]], [[Tottenham]], [[Middlesex]], from 1862 to 1865.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Esposito, Anthony.  [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/46761 "Carr, Joseph William Comyns (1849–1916)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 October 2008, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/46761}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied law at the [[University of London]] and graduated in 1869, beginning to practise at the bar at the [[Inner Temple]], London.  He soon gave up law for a career in journalism and became drama critic for the ''Echo''.&lt;ref name=Whistler&gt;[http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm Biography of Carr at the Whistler website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040615225011/http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/biog/Carr_JC.htm |date=15 June 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873 in [[Dresden]], Carr married author [[Alice Comyns Carr|Alice Laura Vansittart]] née Strettell (1850–1927), a novelist and designer. Alice designed the bold costume that [[Ellen Terry]] wore as Lady Macbeth, and in which [[John Singer Sargent]] painted her in 1889.  Sargent also painted Mrs. Comyns Carr in 1889&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssgallery.org/Paintings/Mrs_JW_Comyns_Carr.html Painting of Alice Vansittart Comyns Carr]&lt;/ref&gt; and several portraits of her sister, [[Alma Strettell|Alma]], and illustrated Alma's ''Spanish and Italian Folk-Songs'' in 1897.  Carr and his wife had three children: Philip, Dorothy and [[Arthur Strettell Comyns Carr|Arthur]] (a [[barrister]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Member of Parliament).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Carr was a member of the [[Arts Club]] and the [[Garrick Club]].  He published two memoirs: ''Some Eminent Victorians'' (1908), and ''Coasting Bohemia'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;Vansittart (1920) P.1&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr died of cancer at the age of 67 at his home in [[South Kensington]], London.  He was buried in [[Highgate Cemetery]].

===Art career===
[[File:J-comyns-carr.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carr in the 1910s]]
In 1873, Carr became an art critic for the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]''.  The same year, in ''The Globe'', he wrote a series of widely read articles about contemporary artists.  [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] took notice of these and befriended him.  Carr was a strong critic of the art establishment, decrying what he saw as its short-sightedness.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1875 He was engaged in 1875 by the influential French journal ''L'Art'' as its English editor.  In 1881–83, he founded and edited ''Art and Letters''.  As the first editor from 1883–86 of ''[[The English Illustrated Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote for a number of other journals including the ''Art Journal'', ''Saturday Review'', the ''Examiner'', the ''World'' and the ''[[Manchester Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr wrote books and articles about art championing the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] school of art, as well as monographic works on artists such as [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]] and [[Sir Hubert von Herkomer]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr and [[Charles Edward Hallé|Charles Hallé]] were appointed co-directors of the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1877 by Sir Coutts Lindsay.  The gallery promoted Pre-Raphaelite painters and exhibited provocative work.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; [[James McNeill Whistler]], Rossetti and Burne-Jones exhibited frequently at the Grosvenor Gallery.  In 1887, Carr and Hallé resigned from that gallery (which closed in 1890), after a dispute with Lindsay, and quickly founded the rival [[New Gallery (London)|New Gallery]], capturing Burne-Jones and most of the Grosvenor Gallery's other important artists.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; Carr continued as co-director until 1908.  He also wrote the introduction to the British section of the 1911 International Exhibition of Fine Arts at Rome and later was chosen as the English representative to the Art Congress.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Theatre career===
Carr was also the author of dramatic works, beginning with several light comedies in the early 1880s for the [[German Reed Entertainments]] at [[St. George's Hall, London|St George's Hall]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He also wrote numerous plays and adapted a number of French plays, such as ''Frou-Frou'', produced at the [[Princess's Theatre, London]] (1881); a stage adaptation of ''[[Far From the Madding Crowd]]'' co-authored with Thomas Hardy (1881); [[Hugh Conway]]'s ''Called Back'' (1884), which was very successful for the actor–manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]; ''Dark Days''; ''Boys Together''; ''In the Days of the Duke''; ''A Fireside Hamlet''; ''The United Pair''; ''The Naturalist'' (1887, an operetta with music by [[Charles King Hall]]); ''The Friar''; and ''Forgiveness''.&lt;ref name=Whistler/&gt; At the [[Haymarket Theatre]] from 1887 to 1893, Carr acted as Tree's literary adviser and partner.

[[Image:Carrcraven7.jpg|right|frame|Scene from ''King Arthur'']]
Carr leased the [[Comedy Theatre]] from 1893 to 1896.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; At the same time, his ''King Arthur'' (1895), a [[blank verse]] play inspired by the writings of [[Thomas Malory]] and [[Alfred Tennyson]], as well as by the visual images of the Pre-Raphaelites, was produced by [[Henry Irving]] in the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].  It starred Irving and [[Ellen Terry]], with music composed by [[Arthur Sullivan]] and sets, costumes and artwork designed by Carr's friend Edward Burne-Jones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/king_arthur/index.html "King Arthur"]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', 10 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This spectacular production was a success for Irving and ran for over 100 performances, also touring North America.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; Another play that year was ''Delia Harding'', an adaptation of a [[Victorien Sardou]] play, at the [[Comedy Theatre]].  Also for Irving's company, in 1897 he produced an English version of ''[[Madame Sans-Gêne (play)|Madame Sans-Gêne]]'' by Sardou and [[Émile Moreau (playwright)|Émile Moreau]] in 1897, which played on both sides of the Atlantic.  Carr also dramatised ''The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde'' in 1910, starring [[H. B. Irving]] at [[Queen's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dinamico.unibg.it/rls/stage.htm Information about Carr's version of ''Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr collaborated with [[Arthur Wing Pinero]] and Arthur Sullivan on ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'', an opera billed as a "romantic musical drama", at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1898. The Faustian theme was not what the Savoy audiences were used to, and the piece never found an audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html Information about ''The Beauty Stone''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720110243/http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/other_sullivan/beauty_stone/beauty_intro.html |date=20 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carr's adaptation of ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' was produced by [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], London (1905).&lt;ref&gt;[http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html Photo from ''Oliver Twist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204173319/http://gabrielleray.150m.com/ArchiveTextC/ConstanceCollier001.html |date=4 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also produced on Broadway in 1905 and 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=7447 IBDB profile of Oliver Twist]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1899 to 1904, after Irving transferred control of the Lyceum, Carr managed the theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Carr's ''Tristram and Iseult'' (1906), a pseudo-medieval drama, was produced at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] starring [[Matheson Lang]], [[Lily Brayton]] and [[Oscar Asche]].  An adaptation of Dickens' ''[[The Mystery of Edwin Drood]]'' (1907) was produced by Tree in Cardiff.  Carr's theory of the play was that Jasper, under the influence of opium, attempted to act upon his murderous impulses, but Drood, overhearing his uncle's ravings, was able to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/adaptations/39.html Information about Carr's ''Mystery of Edwin Drood'']&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by an adaptation of Goethe's ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', for Tree in 1908, in collaboration with [[Stephen Phillips]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

At the [[Royal Opera House]] in 1913–14, Carr was artistic adviser.  A fan of [[Richard Wagner]], Carr was responsible for the first English performance of Wagner's ''[[Parsifal]]'' in 1914 at Covent Garden.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Jules Semon Bache''' (November 9, 1861 – March 24, 1944) was an [[United States|American]] [[banker]], [[art collector]] and [[philanthropist]].

== Early life ==
Julius Bache was born to a [[Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorksocialdiary.com/social-history/2008/best-friends-jewish-society-in-old-palm-beach New York Social Diary: "Best Friends: Jewish Society in Old Palm Beach"] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=w1xAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=jules+bache#v=onepage&amp;q=jules%20bache&amp;f=false The American Hebrew: "Jule S.

==Career==
In 1881, he started work as a cashier at Leopold Cahn &amp; Co., a [[stockbroker]]age firm founded by his uncle. In 1886, he was made a minority partner and in 1892 took full control of the business, renaming it [[Bache &amp; Co.|J. S. Bache &amp; Co.]] Jules Bache built the company into one of the top brokerage houses in the United States, outranked only by [[Merrill Lynch]]. In the process, he became an immensely wealthy individual, a patron of the arts, and a philanthropist.

During [[World War I]], Jules Bache donated money to the [[American Field Service]] in [[France]] and his wife was the honorary treasurer of the "War Babies' Cradle," a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that provided aid for mothers and children in distress in war-torn Northern France and [[Belgium]] to provide them with food, clothing, heating fuel and medical care.

Jules Bache was a shareholder of a number of prominent corporations and sat on the board of directors of many of them. Among his personal holdings, Bache had sizeable interests in Canadian mining companies. His equity in these companies were held by his [[Bahamas]] based corporation that allowed him to legally avoid some of the high personal U.S. surtaxes, a fact which he would be publicly criticized for as a result of the Federal investigations during the 1930s into the causes of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]]. Bache however believed that high taxation was a hindrance to economic growth and published a booklet titled "''Release business from the slavery of taxation''." A major shareholder in [[Placer Dome|Dome Mines Limited]], Bache served as company president from 1919 until 1942 and was Chairman of the Board at the time of his passing. After the brokerage firm of [[Dillon, Read &amp; Co.]] acquired the [[Dodge]] Brothers Automobile Company in 1923, Jules Bache acquired a substantial position in [[Chrysler Corporation]].

[[File:Jules Bache Mausoleum 1024.jpg|thumb|300px|The mausoleum of Jules Bache]]In addition to his high profile in the business world, Jules Bache would also become well known for his art collecting that received much press attention in 1929 when he purchased the portrait of "''[[Giuliano di Lorenzo de' Medici|Giuliano de Medici]]''," then attributed to [[Raphael]]. He would acquire numerous other important works including those by or attributed to [[Rembrandt]], [[Titian]] (including ''[[The Bache Madonna]]''), [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Gerard David]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Sandro Botticelli]], amongst others. In 1937 he opened his magnificent art collection to the public, and in 1943 donated some of his works to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]].

=== Gift to the Metropolitan Museum of Art ===
Bache was a major donor to the Department of Decorative Arts at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Preston_Remington_records_b18157099.pdf Finding aid for the Preston Remington records, 1925–1970], Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death in 1944, most of his picture collection – up to that time gifted to the Jules Bache Foundation, was given to the Museum; the remaining works of art from his estate from his house at 814 Fifth Avenue were sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Herald Tribune, Sunday, April 1, 1945, p. 20 'Jules S. Bache Art Collection is Going on Sale: Works Not Donated to the Metropolitan Museum To Be Sold April 19, 20, 21.' The auction was held at the Kende Galleries of Gimbel Brothers. The New York Times, Sunday, April 1, 1945 adds that 'oil paintings and terracotta statuary' were to be sold on April 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably his portrait by Austrian artist [[Wilhelm Viktor Krausz]] (1878–1959) was retained by one of Bache's daughters.

[[File:Kolty Nizovka.jpg|thumb|Kolts found in Nizovka, [[Chernihiv Oblast]]. 12th century.]]

'''Kolt''' or '''kolty''' was a part of a female [[headgear]], hanging on a [[ryasna]] at both [[Temple (anatomy)|temples]] as a sign of family's wealth, common in 11th-13th centuries in Old [[Rus' (region)|Rus']]. It comprised a pair of metal pieces, joined to form a hollow [[medallion]] or star that, presumably, contained a piece of [[cloth]], impregnated with [[fragrance oil|fragrances]].

== Origin ==
The origin of the word “kolt” is obscure. As a term, it was introduced in the late 19th century in the course of [[Ethnography|ethnographic surveys]]. According to a version it derived from the {{lang-uk|ковтки }} meaning ([[earrings]]),&lt;ref&gt;Б. Д. Гринченко.

М., 2004, с. 268 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; In a Novgorod dialect the word “колтки” means pendants of earrings, it was also mentioned in [[birch bark document]] No. 644, found in [[Novgorod]], dating back to [[Novgorod Republic]].

'''Literary movements''' are a way to divide literature into categories of similar philosophical, topical, or aesthetic features, as opposed to divisions by [[literary genre|genre]] or period. Like other categorizations, literary movements provide language for comparing and discussing literary works. These terms are helpful for [[curriculum|curricula]] or [[anthology|anthologies]].&lt;ref name="Milne"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Milne |first1=Ira Mark |title=Literary Movements for Students: Presenting Analysis, Context, and Criticism on Literary Movements |date=2009 |publisher=Gale |location=Detroit |isbn=978-1-4144-3719-4 |pages=xi-xii |edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these movements (such as Dada and Beat) were defined by the members themselves, while other terms (for example, the metaphysical poets) emerged decades or centuries after the periods in question. Further, some movements are well defined and distinct, while others, like expressionism, are nebulous and overlap with other definitions. Because of these differences, literary movements are often a point of contention between scholars.&lt;ref name="Milne"/&gt;
==The list==
This is a list of modern literary movements: that is, movements after the [[Renaissance]]. Ordering is approximate, as there is considerable overlap.

'''''Lone Survivor: The Eyewitness Account of Operation Redwing and the Lost Heroes of SEAL Team 10''''' (2007) is a [[non-fiction]] book written by [[Marcus Luttrell]] with assistance from novelist and ghostwriter [[Patrick Robinson (author)|Patrick Robinson]] and published by [[Little, Brown and Company]]. The narrative takes place in [[Afghanistan]], where the reader follows Marcus Luttrell and a group of [[U.S. Navy SEALs]].&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com. Web. 15 Nov. 2009.&lt;https://www.amazon.com/Lone-Survivor-Eyewitness-Account-Operation/dp/0316067598&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has since seen a 2013 [[Lone Survivor|film adaptation of the same name]], with [[Mark Wahlberg]] starring as Luttrell.

==Synopsis==
At the beginning of the book, Marcus Luttrell describes his childhood and his training to prepare for the [[Navy SEAL]]s with Billy Shelton. After joining the U.S. Navy and completing SEAL training, Luttrell describes his posting in Afghanistan, in the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of the [[Kunar province]]. With him are the rest of [[SDVT-1]] (SEAL Delivery Vehicle Team 1), except [[Shane E. Patton]], for whom Danny Dietz was substituted. Their mission, [[Operation Red Wings]], was to observe a village and capture or kill a leading [[Taliban]] member thought to be allied with [[Osama bin Laden]].

One night in June 2005, while hiding out, the team encountered three shepherds, including a boy. The team debated killing the shepherds, but after a vote, team leader [[Michael P. Murphy|Michael Murphy]] decided to uphold the [[rules of engagement]] and let the shepherds go. About an hour later, the four SEALs were surrounded by a number of Taliban warriors. ''[[The New York Times]]'' sums up the story: {{quote|Mr. Luttrell was the only one of four men on the mission to survive after a violent clash with dozens of Taliban fighters.

Eight members of the SEALs and eight Army special operations soldiers who came by helicopter to rescue the original four were shot down, and all aboard were killed.

Luttrell was then rescued by a group of Afghan [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] villagers who harbored him in their homes for several days, protecting him from the Taliban and ultimately helping him to safety."|The New York Times, August 9, 2007&lt;ref name="Rich"&gt;{{cite news

==Reception==
Reviews of the book have been mostly positive. Conservative commentators [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Michelle Malkin]] have spoken their support. The book was also showcased on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (U.S. TV series)|The Today Show]]'' and [[CNN]]. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote: "If you're looking for a true story that showcases both American heroism and Afghani [sic] humanity, Marcus Luttrell's ''Lone Survivor'' ... may be the book for you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2010-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' review was laudatory, but also noted, "Along with the tragic story about how Mr. Luttrell lost his comrades, the book is spiked with unabashed [[wikt:braggadocio|braggadocio]] and patriotism, as well as several polemical passages lashing out at the 'liberal media' for its role in sustaining military rules of engagement that prevent soldiers from killing unarmed civilians who may also be scouts or informers for terrorists."&lt;ref name="Rich"/&gt;

==Accuracy==
There is some debate about the exact numbers of Taliban forces involved in the engagement, among other mistakes by some sources. In Luttrell's own official after-action report filed with his superiors after his rescue, he estimated the size of the Taliban force to be around 20–35. Initial [[Intelligence assessment|intel]] estimates were approximately 10-20.&lt;ref name="Ed_Darack_Marine_Corps_Gazette"/&gt; Official media reports from the military estimated the size of the Taliban force to be around 20, while in the Medal of Honor (MOH) citation for LT Michael P. Murphy, the Navy cited 30–40 enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/oc.html |title=Official Citation |publisher=Navy.mil |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113085927/http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/oc.html |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Summary of Action related to the same MOH, the Navy cites an "enemy force of more than 50 anti-coalition militia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |title=Summary of Action |publisher=Navy.mil |date=June 28, 2005 |accessdate=2011-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114090628/http://www.navy.mil/moh/mpmurphy/soa.html |archivedate=January 14, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, ''Victory Point: Operations Red Wings and Whalers – the Marine Corps' Battle for Freedom in Afghanistan'', military journalist [[Ed Darack]] cites a military intelligence report stating the strength of the Taliban force to be 8–10, compared to the more than 200 claimed by Patrick Robinson in ''Lone Survivor''.

Major studios including [[Warner Bros.]], [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], [[DreamWorks]], and [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] all put in bids for the film rights, with Universal eventually securing the rights in August 2007 for more than $2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finke|first=Nikki|title=‘Lone Survivor’ Book To Be Universal Film|url=http://www.deadline.com/2007/08/lone-survivor-book-to-be-a-universal-movie/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[PMC (company)|PMC]]|date=August 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a June 2012 interview about his new book, ''Service: A Navy SEAL at War'', Luttrell was asked, "is a movie going to be made about ''Lone Survivor''"? He replied, "We will start shooting this September [2012]. It will star [[Mark Wahlberg]] who I spoke to a couple of times by phone. I want to make sure that the movie is true to the book. Most people get their information from movies and TV and don't read, so I want to make sure this movie is as realistic as possible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackfive.net/main/2012/06/review-interview-marcus-luttrells-service-a-navy-seal-at-war.html] June 2012 Blackfive.net interview&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, ''[[Lone Survivor]]'', stars [[Mark Wahlberg]], [[Taylor Kitsch]], [[Ben Foster]], [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Eric Bana]], and [[Alexander Ludwig]] and was released on January 10, 2014. It was directed by [[Peter Berg]].&lt;ref&gt;Tatiana Siegel, "Peter Berg's 'Lone Survivor' Boarded by Broadway and Film Financier Norton Herrick," ''The Hollywood Reporter'', November 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mughal Architecture" is the type of [[Indo-Islamic architecture]] developed by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries throughout the ever-changing extent of their empire in the [[Indian subcontinent]].  It developed the styles of earlier Muslim dynasties in India as an amalgam of [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]], [[Iranian architecture|Persian]], Turkish and [[Architecture of India|Indian architecture]]. Mughal buildings have a uniform pattern of structure and character, including large bulbous domes, slender minarets at the corners, massive halls, large vaulted gateways and delicate ornamentation. Examples of the style can be found in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The Mughal dynasty was established after the victory of [[Babur]] at Panipat in 1526. During his five-year reign, Babur took considerable interest in erecting buildings, though few have survived. His grandson [[Akbar]] built widely, and the style developed vigorously during his reign. Among his accomplishments were [[Agra Fort]], the fort-city of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Buland Darwaza]]. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] commissioned the [[Shalimar Bagh, Srinagar|Shalimar Gardens in Kashmir]].

Mughal architecture reached its zenith during the reign of [[Shah Jahan]], who constructed the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Jama Masjid (Delhi)|Jama Masjid]], the [[Red Fort]], and the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens in Lahore]]. The end of his reign corresponded with the decline of Mughal architecture and the Empire itself.

==Monuments==
===Agra Fort===
{{main article|Agra fort}}
Agra fort is a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site in [[Agra]], Uttar Pradesh. The major part of Agra fort was built by [[Akbar The Great]] during 1565 to 1574. The [[architecture]] of the fort clearly indicates the free adoption of the [[Rajput]] planning and construction. Some of the important buildings in the fort are Jahangiri Mahal built for Jahangir and his family, the Moti Masjid, and Mena Bazaars. The Jahangir Mahal is an impressive structure and has a courtyard surrounded by double-storeyed halls and rooms.

=== Humayun's Tomb===
{{main article|Humayun's Tomb}}
'''Humayun's tomb''' is the [[tomb]] of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]] in Delhi, India. The tomb was commissioned by Humayun's first wife and chief consort, Empress [[Bega Begum]] (also known as Haji Begum), in 1569-70, and designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad, Persian architects chosen by her. It was the first garden-tomb on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It is often regarded as the first mature example of Mughal architecture.

===Fatehpur Sikri===
{{main article|Fatehpur Sikri}}
Akbar’s greatest architectural achievement was the construction of [[Fatehpur Sikri]], his capital city near Agra at a trade and Jain pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=Zee News|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/excavation-at-akbars-fort-at-fatehpur-sikri-reveals-flourishing-jain-and-hindu-habitation/1/243578.html|title=Excavation at Akbars fort at Fatehpur Sikri reveals flourishing Jain and Hindu habitation|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/fatehpur-sikri-was-once-a-jain-pilgrimage-centre-book/story-4DfRoVJ6tVxmWzz1RztA5I.html|title=Fatehpur Sikri was once a Jain pilgrimage centre: Book|date=2013-02-27|work=hindustantimes.com/|access-date=2017-12-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction of the walled city was started in 1569 and completed in 1574.

It contained some of the most beautiful buildings – both religious and secular which testify to the Emperor’s aim of achieving social, political and religious integration.  The main religious buildings were the huge Jama Masjid and small tomb of Salim Chisti.  The tomb, built in 1571 in the corner of the mosque compound, is a square marble chamber with a verandah. The cenotaph has an exquisitely designed lattice screen around it. Buland Darwaza, also known as the Gate of Magnificence, was built by Akbar in 1576 to commemorate his victory over Gujarat and the Deccan. It is 40 metres high and 50 metres from the ground. The total height of the structure is about 54 metres from ground level...

The Haramsara, the royal seraglio  in [[Fatehpur Sikri]] was an area where the royal women lived. The opening to the Haramsara is from the Khwabgah side separated by a row of cloiters. According to Abul Fazl, in [[Ain-i-Akbari]], the inside of Harem was guarded by senior and active women, outside the enclosure the [[eunuch]]s were placed, and at a proper distance there were faithful [[Rajput]] guards.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page 146, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jodha Bai's Palace====
This is the largest palace in the Fatehpur Sikri seraglio, connected to the minor ''haramsara'' (where the less important harem ladies and maids would have resided) quarters. The main entrance is double storied, projecting out of the [[facade]] to create a kind of [[porch]] leading into a recessed entrance with a balcony. Inside there is a quadrangle surrounded by rooms. The columns of rooms are ornamented with a variety of [[Hindu]] sculptural motifs. 
The glazed tiles on the roofs from [[Multan]] have an eye catching shade of [[turquoise]].&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta(2013), page151, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hil", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque was built in honour of [[Mariam-uz-Zamani#The misnomer of Jodhabai|Jodha Bai]], mother of Jahangir and wife of Akbar.  Her Mughal name was Mariyam Zamani Begum and this being the reason that the mosque was built in her honor in Lahore’s walled city. Jahangir built his mother Mariyam Zamani Begum’s mosque and is just 1&amp;nbsp;km away from the tomb of Akbar near Agra at a place called Sikandra.

Buland Darwaza dominates the landscape. Historian [[`Abd al-Qadir Bada'uni]] writes that it was the highest gateway in Hindustan at that time until today.

====Inscription====

A [[chronogram]] is inscribed on the central archway composed by Ashraf Khan, one of Akbar's principal secretaries that reads,

{{Quote|In the reign of King of the world Akbar,
To whom is due the order in the country.
The Sheikh-ul-Islam adorned the mosque.
Which for its elegance deserves as much reverence as the Ka'ba.
The year of the completion of this magnificent edifice.
Is found in the words: duplicate of the Masjidi'l-Haram.&lt;ref&gt;Subhadra Sen Gupta (2013), page 172-176, " Fatehpur Sikri: Akbars magnificent city on a hill", Niyogi books. {{ISBN|9789381523728}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
The Tomb of [[Sheikh Salim Chishti]] is famed as one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture in India, built during the years 1580 and 1581, along with the imperial complex at Situated near Zenana Rauza and facing south towards Buland Darwaza, within the quadrangle of the Jama Masjid which measures 350&amp;nbsp;ft. by 440&amp;nbsp;ft. It enshrines the burial place of the Sufi saint, Salim Chisti (1478 – 1572), a descendant of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti of Ajmer, and lived in a cavern on the ridge at Sikri. The mausoleum, constructed by Akbar as a mark of his respect for the Sufi saint, who foretold the birth of his son, who was named Prince Salim after him and later succeeded Akbar to the throne of the Mughal Empire.

==Shah Jahan==
The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in [[Lahore]] was commissioned during the reign of Shah Jahan, and is famous for its rich embellishment which covers almost every interior surface.
Rather than building a huge monuments like his predecessors to demonstrate their power, Shah Jahan built elegant monuments. The force and originality of this previous building style gave way under Shah Jahan to a delicate elegance and refinement of detail, illustrated in the palaces erected during his reign at [[Agra Fort|Agra]], [[Delhi Fort|Delhi]] and [[Lahore Fort|Lahore]]. Some examples include the [[Taj Mahal]] at Agra, the tomb of his wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]]. The [[Moti Masjid (Lahore Fort)|Moti Masjid]] (Pearl Mosque) in the [[Lahore Fort]] and the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] at Delhi are imposing buildings of his era, and their position and architecture have been carefully considered so as to produce a pleasing effect and feeling of spacious elegance and well-balanced proportion of parts. Shah Jahan also built sections of the  [[Sheesh Mahal (Lahore)|Sheesh Mahal]], and [[Naulakha pavilion]], which are all enclosed in the fort. He also built a mosque named after himself in [[Thatta]] called [[Shahjahan Mosque]]. Shah Jahan also built the Red Fort in his new capital at Shah Jahanabad, now [[Delhi]]. The red sandstone Red Fort is noted for its special buildings-[[Diwan-i-Aam]] and [[Diwan-i-Khas (Red Fort)|Diwan-i-Khas]]. Another mosque was built during his tenure in Lahore called Wazir Khan Mosque, by Shaikh Ilm-ud-din Ansari who was the court physician to the emperor.

===Taj Mahal===
{{main article|Taj Mahal}}

The Taj Mahal, a [[World Heritage Site]] described as the "[[teardrop on the cheek of time]]" by [[Rabindranath Tagore]], was built between 1630–49 by the emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal.(Mumtaz died after her 14th delivery). Its construction took 22 years and required 22,000 laborers and 1,000 elephants. Built entirely of white marble at a cost of $1018200000, it is one of the [[New7Wonders of the World]]. The building's longest [[plane (geometry)|plane]] of [[symmetry]] runs through the entire complex except for the [[sarcophagus]] of Shah Jahan, which is placed off centre in the crypt room below the main floor. This symmetry is extended to the building of an entire mirror [[mosque]] in red sandstone, to complement the [[Mecca]]-facing mosque placed to the west of the main structure. Shah Jahan used "[[pietra dura]]", a method of decoration on a large scale-inlaid work of jewels.

===Wazir Khan Masjid===
{{main|Wazir Khan Mosque}}
[[File:Wazir_Khan_Mosque_by_Moiz.jpg|thumb|[[Wazir Khan Mosque]], A [[Mughal era]] mosque in [[Lahore]]]]

===Shalimar Gardens===
{{main|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore}}
The Shalimar Gardens (1641–1642) built on the orders of Bahadur Shah Zafar in Lahore, Pakistan, is also on the UNESCO world heritage list.

===Shah Jahan Mosque===

The [[Shah Jahan Mosque, Thatta|Shah Jahan Mosque]] is the [[Jama Masjid|central mosque]] for the city of [[Thatta]], in the [[Pakistan]]i province of [[Sindh]].

==Aurangzeb and later Mughal architecture==
{{further information|Bibi Ka Maqbara}}
In [[Aurangzeb]]'s reign (1658–1707) squared stone and marble was replaced by brick or rubble with [[stucco]] ornament. [[Srirangapatna]] and [[Lucknow]] have examples of later Indo-Mughal architecture. He made additions to the Lahore Fort and also built one of the thirteen gates which was later named after him (Alamgir).

===Badshahi Masjid===
{{main|Badshahi Mosque}}
The [[Badshahi Mosque|Badshahi Masjid]] in Lahore, Pakistan was commissioned by the sixth [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]]. Constructed between 1671 and 1673, it was the largest mosque in the world upon construction. It is the third largest mosque in Pakistan and the seventh largest mosque in the world. The mosque is adjacent to the Lahore Fort and is the last in the series of congregational mosques in red sandstone. The red sandstone of the walls contrasts with the white marble of the domes and the subtle intarsia decoration. Aurangzeb's mosque's architectural plan is similar to that of his father, Shah Jahan, the Jama Masjid in Delhi; though it is much larger. It also functions as an [[Idgah (place)|''idgah'']]. The courtyard which spreads over 276,000 square feet, can accommodate one hundred thousand worshippers; ten thousand can be accommodated inside the mosque. The [[minarets]] are {{convert|196|ft|m}} tall. The Mosque is one of the most famous Mughal structures, but suffered greatly under the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan included the Badshahi Mosque in the tentative list for [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name=whc.unesco.org&gt;{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1277/ |title=Badshahi Mosque, Lahore &amp;ndash; UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional monuments===
Additional monuments from this period are associated with women from Aurangzeb's imperial family. The construction of the elegant [[Zinat al-Masjid]] in [[Daryaganj]] was overseen by Aurangzeb's second daughter [[Zinat-al-Nissa]]. Aurangzeb's sister [[Roshan-Ara]] who died in 1671. The tomb of [[Roshanara Begum]] and the garden surrounding it were neglected for a long time and are now in an advanced state of decay. [[Bibi Ka Maqbara]]  was a mausoleum built by Prince [[Azam Shah]], son of Emperor Aurangzeb, in the late 17th century as a loving tribute to his mother, Dilras Bano Begam in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[Maharashtra]]. The [[Alamgiri Gate]], built in 1673, is the main entrance to the Lahore Fort in present-day Lahore. It was constructed to face west towards the Badshahi Mosque in the days of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.

Another construction of the Mughal era is [[Lalbagh Fort]] (also known as "Fort Aurangabad"), a Mughal palace fortress at the Buriganga River in the southwestern part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, whose construction started in 1678 during the reign of Aurangzeb.

==Mughal gardens==
{{main article|Mughal garden}}
[[File:Faiz Baksh (Bestower of Goodness) terrace view from Farah Baksh (Bestower of Pleasure) terrace.jpg|thumb|The [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]] are among the most famous Mughal gardens.]]
Mughal gardens are gardens built by the Mughals in the Islamic style of architecture. This style was influenced by Persian gardens and Timurid gardens. Significant use of rectilinear layouts are made within the walled enclosures. Some of the typical features include pools, fountains and canals inside the gardens. The famous gardens are the [[Char Bagh]] gardens at Taj Mahal, gardens at Humayun's Tomb Shalimar Gardens of Lahore, Delhi and Kashmir as well as [[Pinjore]] Garden in [[Haryana]].

==Mughal bridges==
[[Shahi Bridge, Jaunpur]] was constructed during the reign of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]].

Besides exhibiting a high level of skill in traditional religious art, Newar artists have been at the forefront in introducing Western art styles in Nepal. [[Raj Man Singh Chitrakar]] (1797-1865) is credited with starting [[watercolor painting]] in the country. Bhaju Man Chitrakar (1817–1874), Tej Bahadur Chitrakar (1898-1971) and [[Chandra Man Singh Maskey]] were other pioneer artists who introduced modern style paintings incorporating concepts of lighting and perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsofnepal.com/nepali-art-news/12/traditional-art-in-upheaval-the-development-of-modern-contemporary-art-in-nepal.html |title=Traditional Art In Upheaval: The Development Of Modern Contemporary Art In Nepal |last=van der Heide |first=Susanne |website=Arts of Nepal |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nine Houses''', of which only six remain, are in Park Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  The row of houses is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376376|desc= The Nine Houses (of which six remain), Chester|accessdate= 1 November 2011|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They face the eastern portion of [[Chester city walls]].&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust|  page = 103|  isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The houses are the only surviving pre-19th-century [[almshouse]]s in Chester.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;  They were built in about 1650.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  By the 1960s the houses were in a dilapidated state and were in danger of collapse.  There were campaigns to preserve them led by the Chester Civic Trust and the Chester Archaeological Society.  A report was prepared by the [[Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings]], following which they were renovated and rebuilt by [[Chester City Council]] in 1968–69.  The end wall had to be repaired in old brick, and the rear wall was completely rebuilt.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

==Architecture==

The row consists of six adjoined cottages in two storeys.  Each cottage consists of a single [[bay (architecture)|bay]].&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  The lower storey is constructed in brick on a low [[sandstone]] [[plinth]], with stone dressings around the entrance doorways that contain oak-boarded doors.  The upper storey is [[timber framing|timber-framed]] and [[jettying|jettied]], and has a [[gable]] that is jettied further.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;  In the lower storey of each cottage is a 12-pane horizontally-sliding [[sash window]].  Each upper storey contains a 16-pane vertically-sliding sash window.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;

'''Opus signinum''' ('cocciopesto' in modern Italian) is a building material used in [[ancient Rome]]. It is  made of tiles broken up into very small pieces, mixed with mortar, and then beaten down with a rammer.&lt;ref&gt;Signīnum Opus. Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137:book=35:chapter=46&amp;highlight=signinum%2Copus]&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny in his [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] describes its manufacture: "Even broken pottery has been utilized; it being found that, beaten to powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and durable than other substances of a similar nature; forming the cement known as the "Signine" composition, so extensively employed for even making the pavements of houses."&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137&amp;layout=&amp;loc=35.46 Pliny, Natural History, book 35, chapter 46]&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's use of the term "Signine" references "Signia (modern Segni), the name of a town in Latium which was famous for its tiles."&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/opus_signinum https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/opus_signinum]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins, spread, disuse==
The technique began in North Africa, some time before 256 B.C., and spread north from there to Sicily and finally to the Italian peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;The Decorated Pavements of Morgantina II: The Opus Signinum. Author(s): Barbara Tsakirgis. [[American Journal of Archaeology]], Vol. 94, No. 3 (Jul., 1990), pp. 425-443. Archaeological Institute of America. {{jstor|505795}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The houses at Kerkouane on Cap Bon in Tunisia have opus signinum floors. The floors must date before 256 B.C., since the town was destroyed in that year by Regulus. Kerkouane I 79. H. Joyce, "Form, Function and Technique in the Pavements of Delos and Pompeii," AJA 83 (1979) 259.&lt;/ref&gt; Floors of signinum are found extensively in the Punic towns of North Africa and commonly in the Hellenistic houses on Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;For the signinum in the North African houses, see D. Harden, The Phoenicians (London 1962) 133-34; T. Carter, "Western Phoenicians at Lepcis Magna," AJA 69 (1965) 128, pl. 33; M. Fantar, "Pavimenta Punica et signe dit de Tanit dans les habitations de Kerkouane," Studi Magrebini 1 (1966) 57-65; M. Fantar, "Les Pavements puniques," Les Dossiers de l'Archeologie (1978) 6-11; Kerkouane I 502-503; Kerkouane II; S. Lancel, "Les Pavimenta Punica du quartier punique tardif de la colline de Byrsa," Cahiers des etudes anciennes 17 (1985) 157-77. For the signinum floors in Sicilian houses, see for Agrigento: R.P.

Mosaici antichi in Italia: Pavimenti di signino repubblicani di Roma e dintorni (Rome 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vitruvius]] describes the process of laying a floor, whether signinum or mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/7*.html Marcus Vitruvius Pollio: de Architectura, Book VII]&lt;/ref&gt; The trend began in the 1st century BC, proliferating in private homes as well as public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;F. Sear. Roman Wall and Vault Mosaics. Heidelberg 1977&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century, opus signinum would give way to more patterned styles of pavement.

The '''peer jury process''' is often used in the arts to assess applications for grants, proposals for exhibitions made in response to an open call for submissions and art competitions. Like the practice of [[peer review]] used in the academic sphere, a peer jury brings to an evaluation process expertise that an organization or agency awarding grants or sponsoring a competition might not itself have. 

A peer jury in the arts context is generally composed of artists selected to be representative of those working in a relevant discipline or area. While jurors are expected to have [[independence]], [[anonymity]] is less of a concern than in academic [[peer review]], in part because the jury's task is not to catch errors or offer criticism but to only to select. For example, in Canada, agencies that award grants typically publish lists of jurors or make lists available on request. 

In principle the peer jury process is an effective way for arts councils and other agencies to be responsive to and engaged with the constituencies they serve, and in touch with the latest developments in contemporary art.

'''Peter Goffin''' [[FRSA|F.R.S.A.]] (28 February 1906 - 22 March 1974), was an English set and costume designer and stage manager, known for his work with the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

==Biography==
Goffin was born in [[Plymouth]], England, the son of Willam Earl Goffin and Elizabeth Goffin, née Underwood. From 1922 to 1930 he worked as an interior decorator and mural painter locally.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;''Who's Who in the Theatre'', fourteenth edition (1967), p. 655, Pitman Publishing, London&lt;/ref&gt;  As a young man, he was taken on by the local repertory theatre in Plymouth as a designer, going on to [[Dartington Hall]] from 1931-34 where he took over responsibility for staging, costumes and lighting of the Dance-Drama Group.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;  In 1935 and 1936 he was resident director at the Barn Theatre, [[Chesham Bois]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

In 1936, Goffin went to the Westminster Theatre in London, working with [[Harley Granville Barker]] and Michael MacOwan on a range of productions, from classics such as ''[[Volpone]]'', ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', to modern works including ''[[Mourning Becomes Electra]], [[Heartbreak House]],'' and [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''The Family Reunion.''  In 1938 Goffin was invited by the government to supervise a course on stagecraft and to lecture on the subject.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

During his Dartington days, Goffin met [[Bridget D'Oyly Carte]].  She introduced him to her father, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte|Rupert]], who commissioned Goffin to redesign the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s production of ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' in 1938.  Goffin's new set caused dissent among traditionalists because it did not depict the familiar backdrop of the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]].  [[Martyn Green]], the reigning principal comedian, was far from happy with his new costume, and he implied in his memoirs that it was one of the reasons why he later left the company.&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Green, ''Here’s a How-De-Do'', London, Max Reinhardt, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

For Rupert and later Bridget D'Oyly Carte, he designed new sets and costumes for ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1948), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1957), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1958 – sets only, most of the celebrated [[Charles Ricketts]] costumes being retained), ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1958), ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' (1959), ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1961), and ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1961).  He also created a unit set – a framework on which the sets for each opera could easily be interchanged, which, according to [[Frederic Lloyd]], the General Manager of the D'Oyly Carte Company, "saved the management an enormous amount of expense and facilitated taking more operas to more theatres."&lt;ref&gt;Goffin's obituary in ''The Savoyard''&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Goffin designed a number of posters and other graphic art for the D'Oyly Carte organisation.

Goffin wrote books including ''Stage Lighting'' (1938), ''The Realm of Art'' (1946), ''Stage Lighting For Amateurs'' (1947) and ''The art and science of stage management'' (1953).  His ''The Realm of Art'', and his meeting [[Leon MacLaren]], led the [[School of Economic Science]] to begin teaching philosophy; Goffin later presented their early public philosophy lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Stewart |title=Standing for Justice |publisher=BookSurge Publishing |page=67|year=2009 |isbn=0-85683-194-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dorine Tolley |title=The Power Within: Leon MacLaren, A Memoir of His Life and Work |publisher=BookSurge Publishing| pages=76–77 |year=2009 |isbn=1-4392-1030-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1948.&lt;ref name=WW/&gt;

[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747–1822)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|ᵻ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|φοῖνιξ}}, ''phoînix'') is a long-lived [[bird]] that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 

Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]}} There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for  500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 67&amp;ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif.

In the historical record, the phoenix "could symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], [[metempsychosis]], [[consecration]], [[resurrection]], life in the heavenly [[Paradise]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[virginity]], the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}

==Etymology==
The modern English noun ''phoenix'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''phenix'' (before 1150), itself from [[Old English]] ''fēnix'' (around 750). Old English ''fēnix'' was borrowed from Medieval Latin ''phenix'', which is derived from Classical Latin ''phoenīx''. The Classical Latin ''phoenīx'' represents Greek φοῖνιξ ''phoinīx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}}

In ancient Greece and Rome, the bird, phoenix, was sometimes associated with the similar-sounding [[Phoenicia]], a civilization famous for its production of purple dye from conch shells. A late antique etymology offered by the 6th- and 7th-century CE archbishop [[Isidore of Seville]] accordingly derives the name of the phoenix from its allegedly purple-red hue. Because the costly purple dye from Phoenicia was associated with the upper classes in antiquity and, later, with royalty, in the medieval period the phoenix was considered "the royal bird".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 51}}

In spite of these [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], with the deciphering of the [[Linear B]] script in the 20th century, the original Greek φοῖνιξ was decisively shown to be derived from [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', itself open to a variety of interpretations.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62–66}}

==Relation to the Egyptian Bennu==
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In the 19th century scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird observed in some respects to be similar to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14–25}}

[[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix:

{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Appearance==
[[File:Phoenix_detail_from_Aberdeen_Bestiary.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from the 12th-century ''[[Aberdeen Bestiary]]'', featuring a phoenix]]
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|nimbus]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the sun Titan of Greek mythology).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246–247}} Pliny the Elder&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo CarlÁ,Irene Berti, page172&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}

Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257–258}}

Herodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}

==In later European culture==
[[Dante]] refers to the phoenix in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' Canto XXIV:
{{Verse translation|lang=it|
&lt;poem&gt;Così per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

erba né biado in sua vita non pasce,
ma sol d’incenso lagrime e d’amomo,
e nardo e mirra son l’ultime fasce.&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr1=In the [[:s:it:Divina Commedia/Inferno/Canto XXIV|original Italian]]|
&lt;poem&gt;Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed
The phoenix dies, and then is born again,
When it approaches its five-hundredth year;

On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,
But only on tears of [[incense]] and [[amomum]],
And [[Spikenard|nard]] and [[myrrh]] are its last [[shroud|winding-sheet]].&lt;/poem&gt;
|attr2=In [[s:The Divine Comedy/Inferno/Canto XXIV|English translation]]
}}

In the play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], the King says in [[s:The Life of King Henry the Eighth|Act V Scene v]], in flattering reference to his young daughter Elizabeth (who was to become [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Analogues==
Scholars have observed analogues to the phoenix in a variety of cultures. These analogues include the [[Hindu mythology|Hindu]] [[garuda]] and [[gandaberunda]], the [[Slavic folklore|Russian]] [[Firebird (Slavic folklore)|firebird]], the [[Persian mythology|Persian]] [[Simorgh]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] paskunji, the Arabian Anka عنقاء, and from that, the [[Turkish mythology|Turkish]] Zümrüdü Anka, the [[Tibet]]an Me byi karmo, the [[Chinese mythology|Chinese]] [[fenghuang]] and [[Vermilion Bird|zhu que]], and the Japanese [[fenghuang|hō-ō]].{{Sfn | Garry | El-Shamy | 2005 | pp = 84–87}}

The '''police procedural''', or '''police crime drama''', is a subgenre of [[detective fiction]] that emphasizes the investigative procedure of a [[police officer]] or department as the [[protagonist]](s), as contrasted with other genres that focus on a private investigator or amateur detective. Unlike traditional mysteries, which conceal the criminal's identity until the police solve the crime in the [[Climax (narrative)|narrative climax]] (the so-called [[whodunnit]]), police procedurals often reveal the perpetrator's identity to the audience early in the narrative, making it an [[inverted detective story]] or "howcatchem" {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Police procedurals attempt to accurately depict such police-related topics as [[forensic science]], [[autopsy|autopsies]], gathering [[Evidence (law)|evidence]], [[search warrant]]s, [[interrogation]] and adherence to legal restrictions and procedure.

==Early history==
The roots of the police procedural have been traced to at least the mid-1880's. [[Wilkie Collins]]'s novel ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a tale of a [[Scotland Yard]] detective investigating the theft of a valuable diamond, has been described as perhaps the earliest clear example of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Wheat, Carolyn (2003) How to Write Killer Fiction: The Funhouse Of Mystery &amp; The Roller Coaster Of Suspense. Santa Barbara, PA: Perseverance Press, {{ISBN|1880284626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As detective fiction rose to worldwide popularity in the late 1800's and early 1900's, many of the pioneering and most popular characters, at least in the English-speaking world, were private investigators or amateurs. See [[C. Auguste Dupin]], [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Sam Spade]], [[Miss Marple]] and others. [[Hercule Poirot]] was described as a veteran of the Belgian police but as a protagonist he worked independently. Only after WW2 would police procedural fiction rival the popularity of PIs or amateur sleuths.

[[Lawrence Treat]]'s 1945 novel ''V as in Victim'' is often cited as the first police procedural, by [[Anthony Boucher]] (mystery critic for the ''[[New York Times]] Book Review'') among others. Another early example is [[Hillary Waugh]]'s ''[[Last Seen Wearing ... (Hillary Waugh novel)|Last Seen Wearing ...]]'', 1952.  Even earlier examples from the 20th Century, predating Treat, include the novels ''Vultures in the Dark'', 1925, and ''The Borrowed Shield'', 1925, by [[Richard Enright]], retired [[New York City Police Commissioner]], ''Harness Bull'', 1937, and ''Homicide'', 1937, by former Southern California police officer [[Leslie T. White]], ''P.C. Richardson's First Case'', 1933, by Sir [[Basil Thomson]], former [[Assistant Commissioner]] of [[Scotland Yard]], and the short story collection ''Policeman's Lot'', 1933, by former Buckinghamshire High Sheriff and Justice of the Peace [[Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, 6th Baronet|Henry Wade]].

The procedural became more prominent after [[World War II]], and, while the contributions of [[novelist]]s like Treat were significant, a large part of the impetus for the post-war development of the procedural as a distinct subgenre of the mystery was due, not to prose fiction, but to the popularity of a number of American films which dramatized and fictionalized actual crimes.  Dubbed "[[semidocumentary]] films" by movie critics, these motion pictures, often filmed on location, with the cooperation of the law enforcement agencies involved in the actual case, made a point of authentically depicting police work. Examples include ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), ''[[The Street with No Name]]'' (1948), ''[[T-Men]]'' (1947), ''[[He Walked by Night]]'' (1948), and ''[[Border Incident]]'' (1949).

Films from other countries soon began following the semi-documentary trend.  In [[France]], there was ''[[Quai des orfevres]]'' (1947), released in the [[United States]] as ''Jenny Lamour''.  In [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese cinema]], there was [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1949 film ''[[Stray Dog (film)|Stray Dog]]'', a serious police procedural [[film noir]] that was also a precursor to the [[buddy cop film]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FilmInt|journal=Film International|year=2006|volume=4|issue=1–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y50qAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=28 April 2012|page=163|publisher=[[Arts Council Norway|Kulturrådet]]|location=Sweden|quote=In addition to being a masterful precursor to the buddy cop movies and police procedurals popular today, Stray Dog is also a complex genre film that examines the plight of soldiers returning home to post-war Japan.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[UK]], there were films such as ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Long Arm (film)|The Long Arm]]'' (1956) set in London and depicting the Metropolitan Police.

One semidocumentary,  ''[[He Walked By Night]]'' (1948), released by [[Eagle-Lion Films]], featured a young radio actor named [[Jack Webb]] in a supporting role.  The success of the film, along with a suggestion from [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Sergeant]] Marty Wynn, the film's [[technical advisor]], gave Webb an idea for a [[radio drama]] that depicted police work in a similarly semi-documentary manner. The resulting series, ''[[Dragnet (drama)|Dragnet]]'', which debuted on radio in 1949 and made the transition to television in 1951, has been called "the most famous procedural of all time" by mystery novelists [[William L. DeAndrea]], [[Katherine V. Forrest]] and [[Max Allan Collins]].

The same year that ''Dragnet'' debuted on radio, [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning playwright [[Sidney Kingsley]]'s stage play ''[[Detective Story (play)|Detective Story]]'' opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].  This frank, carefully researched dramatization of a typical day in an [[NYPD]] [[police station|precinct]] detective squad became another benchmark in the development of the police procedural.

Over the next few years, the number of novelists who picked up on the procedural trend grew to include writers like Ben Benson, who wrote carefully researched novels about the [[Massachusetts State Police]], retired police officer [[Maurice Procter]], who wrote a series about North England cop Harry Martineau, and Jonathan Craig, who wrote short stories and novels about [[New York City]] police officers.  Police novels by writers who would come to virtually define the form, like [[Hillary Waugh]], [[Evan Hunter|Ed McBain]], and [[John Creasey]] started to appear regularly.

In 1956, in his regular ''[[New York Times Book Review]]'' column, mystery critic [[Anthony Boucher]], noting the growing popularity of crime fiction in which the main emphasis was the realistic depiction of police work, suggested that such stories constituted a distinct subgenre of the mystery, and, crediting the success of ''Dragnet'' for the rise of this new form, coined the phrase "police procedural" to describe it.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Ed McBain, the [[pseudonym]] of [[Evan Hunter]], wrote dozens of novels in the ''[[87th Precinct]]'' series beginning with ''[[Cop Hater]],'' published in 1956. Hunter continued to write 87th Precinct novels almost until his death in 2005. Although these novels focus primarily on Detective Steve Carella, they encompass the work of many officers working alone and in teams, and Carella is not always present in any individual book.

As if to illustrate the universality of the police procedural, many of McBain's 87th Precinct novels, despite their being set in a slightly fictionalized New York City, have been filmed in settings outside New York, even outside the US. [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s 1963 film, ''[[High and Low (1963 film)|High and Low]]'', based on McBain's ''King's Ransom'' (1959), is set in [[Tokyo]].  ''Without Apparent Motive'' (1972), set on the [[French Riviera]], is based on McBain's ''Ten Plus One'' (1963). [[Claude Chabrol]]'s ''[[Blood Relatives|Les Liens de Sang]]'' (1978), based on ''Blood Relatives'' (1974), is set in [[Montreal]].  Even ''[[Fuzz (film)|Fuzz]]'' (1972), based on the 1968 novel, though set in the US, moves the action to [[Boston]].

===John Creasey/J. J. Marric===
Perhaps ranking just behind McBain in importance to the development of the procedural as a distinct mystery subgenre is [[John Creasey]], a prolific writer of many different kinds of crime fiction, from espionage to criminal protagonist. He was inspired to write a more realistic crime novel when his neighbor, a retired [[Scotland Yard]] detective, challenged Creasey to "write about us as we are." The result was ''Inspector West Takes Charge'', 1940, the first of more than forty novels to feature Roger West of the [[London Metropolitan Police]]. The West novels were, for the era, an unusually realistic look at Scotland Yard operations, but the plots were often wildly melodramatic, and, to get around thorny legal problems, Creasey gave West an "amateur detective" friend who was able to perform the extra-procedural acts that West, as a policeman, could not.

In the mid-1950s, inspired by the success of television's ''Dragnet'' and a similar British TV series, ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', Creasey decided to try a more down-to-earth series of cop stories. Adopting the pseudonym "J.J. Marric", he wrote ''[[Gideon's Day]]'', 1955, in which [[George Gideon]], a high-ranking detective at Scotland Yard, spends a busy day supervising his subordinates' investigations into several unrelated crimes. This novel was the first in a series of more than twenty books which brought Creasey his best critical notices. One entry, ''Gideon's Fire'', 1961, won an [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] for Best Mystery Novel. The Gideon series, more than any other source, helped establish the common procedural plot structure of threading several autonomous story lines through a single novel.

===Sjöwall and Wahlöö===
[[Maj Sjöwall]] and [[Per Wahlöö]] planned and wrote the [[Martin Beck]] police procedural series of ten books between the 1960s and 1970s, set in [[Sweden]]. The series is particularly renowned for its extensive character development throughout the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Scene of the Crime: The Importance of Place in Crime and Mystery Fiction|last = Geherin|first = David|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck himself is gradually promoted from [[detective]] in a newly nationalised Swedish police force to [[Chief of staff|Chief]] [[Inspector]] of the National Murder Squad, and the realistic depiction, as well as criticism of the Swedish [[welfare state]] at the time whilst the tedium of the police procedural continues in the background, is something still widely used today, with authors such as [[Jo Nesbø]] and [[Stieg Larsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gumshoes: A Dictionary of Fictional Detectives|last = Brunsdale|first = Mitzi|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books gave rise to the [[Scandinavian noir|Swedish noir]] scene, and ''[[The Laughing Policeman (novel)|The Laughing Policeman]]'' earned a "Best Novel" Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1971. The books were translated from Swedish into 35 different languages, and have sold roughly ten million copies. Sjöwall and Wahlöö used [[Black comedy|black humour]] extensively in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.crimefictionlover.com/2014/09/cis-a-guide-to-the-martin-beck-series/|title = CIS: A GUIDE TO THE MARTIN BECK SERIES|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Megraw|first = Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is widely recognised as one of the finest police procedural series.

===Elizabeth Linington/Dell Shannon/Lesley Egan===
A prolific author of police procedurals, whose work has fallen out of fashion in the years since her death, is [[Elizabeth Linington]] writing under her own name, as well as "Dell Shannon" and "Lesley Egan." Linington reserved her Dell Shannon pseudonym primarily for procedurals featuring LAPD Central [[Homicide]] [[Lieutenant]] Luis Mendoza (1960–86). Under her own name she wrote about Sergeant Ivor Maddox of LAPD's North Hollywood Station, and as Lesley Egan she wrote about suburban cop Vic Varallo. These novels are often considered severely flawed, partly due to the author's far-right political viewpoint (she was a proud member of the [[John Birch Society]]), but primarily because Miss Linington's books, notwithstanding the frequent comments she made about the depth of her research, were all seriously deficient in the single element most identified with the police procedural, technical accuracy. However, they have a certain charm in their depiction of a kinder, gentler California, where the police were always "good guys" who solved all the crimes and respected the citizenry.

===Georges Simenon===
It has been suggested{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that the ''[[Inspector Maigret]]'' novels of [[Georges Simenon]] aren't really procedurals because of their strong focus on the lead character, but the novels have always included subordinate members of his staff as supporting characters. More importantly, Simenon, who had been a journalist covering police investigations before creating Maigret, was giving an accurate depiction, or at least the appearance of an accurate depiction, of law enforcement in Paris. Further, Simenon's influence on later European procedural writers, like [[Sweden]]'s [[Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö]], or [[A. C. Baantjer|Baantjer]], is obvious.

===Joseph Wambaugh===
Though not the first police officer to write procedurals, [[Joseph Wambaugh]]'s success has caused him to become the exemplar of cops who turn their professional experiences into fiction.  The son of a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]], policeman, Wambaugh joined the Los Angeles Police Department after a stint of military duty.  In 1970, his first novel, ''[[The New Centurions]]'', was published.  This followed three police officers through their training in the Academy, their first few years on the street, culminating in the Watts riots of 1965.  It was followed by such novels as ''The Blue Knight'', 1971, ''[[The Choirboys (book)|The Choirboys]]'', 1975, ''Hollywood Station'', 2006, and acclaimed non-fiction books like ''[[The Onion Field]]'', 1973, ''Lines and Shadows'', 1984, and ''Fire Lover'', 2002.  Wambaugh has said that his main purpose is less to show how cops work on the job, than how the job works on cops.

===Tony Hillerman===
[[Tony Hillerman]], the author of 17 novels involving Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn, wrote procedurals in which the procedures were those of the [[Navajo Tribal Police]].

===Detective novel writers===
It is difficult to disentangle the early roots of the procedural from its forebear, the traditional detective novel, which often featured a police officer as protagonist. By and large, the better known novelists such as [[Ngaio Marsh]] produced work that falls more squarely into the province of the traditional or "cozy" detective novel. Nevertheless, some of the work of authors less well known today, like [[Freeman Wills Crofts]]'s novels about Inspector French or some of the work of the prolific team of [[G. D. H. Cole|G.D.H.]] and [[Margaret Cole]], might be considered as the antecedents of today's police procedural.  British mystery novelist and critic [[Julian Symons]], in his 1972 history of crime fiction, ''Bloody Murder'', labeled these proto-procedurals "humdrums," because of their emphasis on the plodding nature of the investigators.

===TV series===
{{Main|List of police television dramas}}

====United States====
* ''[[Dragnet (series)#Television|Dragnet]]'' (1951–59, 1967–70, 1989–91 and 2003–04) was a pioneering police procedural that began on radio in 1949 and then on television in 1951. ''Dragnet'' established the tone of many police dramas in subsequent decades, and the rigorously authentic depictions of such elements as organizational structure, professional jargon, legal issues, etc., set the standard for technical accuracy that became the most identifiable element of the police procedural in all media.  The show was occasionally accused of presenting an overly idealized portrait of law enforcement in which the police (represented by Sgt. [[Joe Friday]]) were invariably presented as "good guys" and the criminals as "bad guys", with little moral flexibility or complexity between the two. However, many episodes depicted sympathetic perpetrators while others depicted unsympathetic or corrupt cops.  Further, though Jack Webb may have seemed to go to extremes to depict the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] in a favorable light, most depictions of cops at the time of ''Dragnet'''s debut were both unsympathetic and unrealistic.  Webb's depiction was meant to offer balance.  Also, the show benefited from the unprecedented technical advice, involvement, and support of the LAPD, a first in TV, which may also have been an incentive to depict the Department favorably.  After the success of ''Dragnet'', Webb produced other procedural shows like ''[[The DA's Man]]'', about an undercover investigator for the [[New York County District Attorney|Manhattan District Attorney]]'s Office, ''[[Adam-12]]'', about a pair of uniformed [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers patrolling their beat in a radio car, and ''[[O'Hara, U.S. Treasury]]'', with [[David Janssen]] as a trouble-shooting federal officer.
* ''[[The Untouchables (1959 TV series)|The Untouchables]]'' (1959–63)  fictionalized real-life Federal Agent [[Eliot Ness]]'s ongoing fight with prohibition-era gangs in [[Chicago]] and elsewhere.  Originally a two-part presentation on the anthology series ''[[Desilu Playhouse]]'', it made such a splash that a series was launched the following fall.  That two-part pilot, later released to theaters under the title ''The Scarface Mob'', stuck comparatively close to the actual events, with Ness, as played by [[Robert Stack]], recruiting a team of incorruptible investigators to help bring down [[Al Capone]]. Later episodes showed Ness and his squad, after Capone, going after just about every big name gangster of the era, and when the writers ran out of real-life figures to pit against Ness, they created new ones. [[Quinn Martin]], who would become closely associated with police and crime shows like this, produced the series during its first season, leaving to found his own company, QM Productions, which would go one to produce police procedural shows like ''[[The New Breed (TV series)|The New Breed]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Dan August]]'', and ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'' over the next twenty years.  The success of the series led to an [[Academy Award]]-winning [[The Untouchables (1987 film)|motion picture]] in 1987, and a new TV [[The Untouchables (1993 TV series)|series]] that was syndicated to local stations in 1993.
* ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'' (1973–78) was an anthology series set in Los Angeles created by [[LAPD]] Detective Sergeant Joseph Wambaugh.  Hard-hitting and unflinchingly realistic, its anthology format made it possible to look at LAPD police work from many different perspectives, what it was like to be a woman in a male-dominated profession, an honest cop suspected of corruption, a rookie cop, an undercover narc, a veteran facing retirement, or a cop who had to adjust to crippling injuries incurred in the line of duty.  Despite its anthology format, there were a number of characters who appeared in more than one episode, including Robbery/Homicide partners Tony Calabrese ([[Tony Lo Bianco]]) and Bert Jameson ([[Don Meredith]]), vice cop turned homicide detective Charlie Czonka ([[James Farentino]]), and stakeout-surveillance specialist Joe LaFrieda ([[Vic Morrow]]).  Several series were spun off from the show, including ''[[Police Woman (TV series)|Police Woman]]'', ''Joe Forrester'', and ''[[David Cassidy: Man Under Cover|Man Undercover]]''.  During its last two seasons, the show appeared as an irregular series of two-hour [[TV movies]] rather than a weekly one-hour program.  The show was revived for a season in 1988, using old scripts reshot with new casts when a writers' strike made new material inaccessible.
* ''[[Kojak]]'' (1973–78, 1989–90) created by [[Abby Mann]], focused on a veteran [[New York City]] detective-lieutenant played by [[Telly Savalas]].  Its exteriors were filmed at New York's Ninth Precinct, the same place where ''[[NYPD Blue]]'''s exteriors would be filmed.  In 1989 Savalas returned to the role briefly for five two-hour episodes, in which Kojak had been promoted to [[inspector]] and placed in charge of the Major Crimes Squad. It rotated with three other detective shows on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].  A 2005 remake for the [[USA Network]] starred [[Ving Rhames]]. Kojak's most memorable character trait was his signature lollipop.
* ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' (1981–87) featured a number of intertwined storylines in each episode, and pioneered depiction of the conflicts between the work and private lives of officers and detectives on which the police procedural was centered.  The show had a deliberate "documentary" style, depicting officers who were flawed and human, and dealt openly with the gray areas of morality between right and wrong.  It was set in an unidentified east coast or Midwestern US city.  The show was written by [[Steven Bochco]] and Michael Kozoll.
* ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' (1982–88) revolved around two female NYPD detectives who led very different lives. Christine Cagney, played by [[Sharon Gless]], was a single-minded, witty, brash career woman. Mary Beth Lacey was a resourceful, sensitive working mom. [[Loretta Swit]] was the original choice for Cagney [she played the role in a TV movie] however she couldn't get out of her contract on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''. During the first season, [[Meg Foster]] played the part of Cagney, while [[Tyne Daly]] played Lacey, the role she had originated in the pilot. [[CBS]] canceled the series claiming low ratings. It was brought back due both to a letter-writing campaign which drew millions of letters nationwide and because the ratings went ''up'' during summer reruns. A ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine read "Welcome Back". Daly continued as Lacey, but Foster was replaced with Gless, who would become the actress most identified with the part. It had 36 nominations and 14 wins during its run.  Four TV movies were broadcast after the series ended.
* ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984–90) and ''[[21 Jump Street]]'' (1987–91) showed the MTV style of Police procedurals.
* The [[Law &amp; Order (franchise)|''Law &amp; Order'' franchise]], which started with the long-running series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' (1990–2010), focuses on the two 'halves' of a criminal proceeding in the [[New York City]] criminal justice system: the investigation of the crime by the [[New York City Police Department]] homicide detectives and the subsequent prosecution of the criminals by the [[New York County District Attorney]]'s office. The success of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' inspired nine other [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series in four different countries:
** Five in the U.S.: ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' (1999–present), which focuses on sex crimes such as rape and child molestation, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'' (2001–11), focusing on major crimes from the point of view of the criminal and capturing them from a psychological side, ''[[Law &amp; Order: Trial by Jury]]'' (2005–06), which focuses more on the trial from both the prosecution and the defense teams' points of view, ''[[Conviction (2006 TV series)|Conviction]]'' (2006) and ''[[Law &amp; Order: LA]]'' (2010–11). ''Special Victims Unit'', ''Criminal Intent'', and ''LA'' series focused more on the police procedurals than ''Trial by Jury'' and ''Conviction''.  As of August 2011, ''Special Victims Unit'' is the only currently running American series in the ''Law &amp; Order'' franchise.
** Two in [[Russia]]: Adaptations of ''Special Victims Unit'' (2007) and ''Criminal Intent'' (2007), both set in [[Moscow]].
** ''[[Paris enquêtes criminelles]]'' (2007), a [[France|French]] adaptation of ''Criminal Intent'' set in [[Paris]].
** ''[[Law &amp; Order: UK]]'' (2009–2014), a [[United Kingdom|British]] adaptation of the original ''Law &amp; Order'' set in [[London]].
:Aside from being its depiction of police investigation, this program also relates to the [[legal drama]] and "forensic pathology" subgenres, and has inspired such other programs as the ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' [[CSI (franchise)|series]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' (1993–99; TV movie in 2000), a police procedural focusing on the homicide unit of the [[Baltimore]] city police department. Critically praised{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} (although frequently struggling in the ratings), the show was more of an ensemble piece, focusing on the activities of the unit as a whole (although significant characters such as Detective [[Frank Pembleton]] and Detective [[John Munch]], who has also appeared on the various ''Law &amp; Order'' shows, among others, became popular with viewers). The show (particularly in its first three seasons) used long-form arcs to depict ongoing criminal investigations, such as the investigation of a murdered child in the first season, which ran through 13 episodes but ended without an arrest or conviction, or even conclusive proof of who committed the crime. The show also heavily featured the complex internal politics of the police department, suggesting that rising through the ranks has more to do with personal connections, favors and opportunism than genuine ability.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* ''[[NYPD Blue]]'' (1993–2005) explored the internal and external struggles of the assorted investigators of the fictional 15th Precinct of Manhattan.  The show gained notoriety for profanity and nudity never previously broadcast on American network television. ''NYPD Blue'' was created by genre veteran [[Steven Bochco]] and [[David Milch]]. The cast of ''NYPD Blue'' included actor Dennis Franz, who previously played Detective Buntz on ''Hill Street Blues'', as well as on a spin-off series, ''Beverly Hills Buntz''. Another cast member, David Caruso, would later play Lt. Horatio Caine on ''CSI: Miami''.
* The [[CSI (franchise)|CSI franchise]] which started with ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' (2000–2015) and eventually spawned two  spin-offs focused on solving ordinary crimes using forensics, ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' (2002-2012) and ''[[CSI: NY]]'' (2004-2013).  Produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]], these three shows focus on three groups of forensic scientists in [[Las Vegas]], [[Miami]] and [[New York City]] who investigate how and why a person has died and if it is a murder or not by investigating not only [[whodunit]] but also howdunit. A third spin-off, ''[[CSI: Cyber]]'' (2015-2016), focused on cybercrime and its impact on modern society.
** The CSI franchise inspired other forensic shows such as ''[[Body of Proof]]'' (2011–2013), ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' (2005-2017) and ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' (2001–2007).
** The CSI franchise also inspired other crime dramas involving teams solving crimes but not relying on forensics; these include victim and witness memory for cold cases and missing people in ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' (2003–2010) and ''[[Without a Trace]]'' (2002-2009) respectively, psychological profiling in ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' (2005-), using [[mathematics]] in ''[[Numbers (TV series)|Numbers]]'' (2005-2010) and using deception in ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008–2015).
* ''[[The Shield]]'' (2002–08) is about an experimental division of the Los Angeles Police Department set up in the fictional Farmington district ("the Farm") of Los Angeles, using a converted church ("the Barn") as their police station, and featuring a group of detectives called "The Strike Team", who will do anything to bring justice to the streets. Michael Chiklis (Chiklis previously played the title character in the TV series ''The Commish'') has top billing with his portrayal of Strike Team leader Detective Victor "Vic" Mackey. The show has an ensemble cast that will normally run a number of separate story lines through each episode. It was on the [[FX network]] and was known for its portrayal of police brutality and its realism. The show inspired other shows similar to ''The Shield'' such as ''[[Dark Blue (TV series)|Dark Blue]]'' and ''[[Southland (TV series)|Southland]]''. ''The Shield'' was created by writer/producer [[Shawn Ryan]].
* The ''[[NCIS (franchise)|NCIS]]'' franchise was spun off from the CBS series ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' in 2003. The original series, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' (2003-present) follows the Major Case Response Team of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]], as they investigate crimes related to the [[US Navy]] and [[Marine Corps]]. ''NCIS'' has been among the top scripted series on U.S. television, and has received two spin-offs; ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' (2009-) deals with an LA-based branch dealing in special undercover assignments, and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' (2014-) focuses on a small group of agents who handle cases from the Mississippi River to the Texas Panhandle.
* ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'' (2009-2016), ''[[The Mentalist]]'' (2008-2015), ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' (2002–2009) and ''[[Psych]]'' (2006-2014) feature quirky investigators with their own distinct methods of solving crimes and are equally comedic shows as they are police procedurals.
* [[Chicago (franchise)|''Chicago'']] is a multi-genre franchise that focuses on the [[Chicago]] [[Chicago P.D. (TV series)|Police Department]], the [[Chicago Fire (TV series)|Fire Department]] and the [[Chicago Med|Medical branch]] respectively.

====India====
* ''[[C.I.D. (India TV series)|C.I.D.]]'' (1995–present) C.I.D. is an Indian crime detective series that airs on Sony TV. It is about a team of detectives belonging to the Criminal Investigation Department in Mumbai. The protagonists of the show are played by [[Shivaji Satam]], [[Aditya Srivastava]], [[Dayanand Shetty]], [[Dinesh Phadnis]], [[Hrishikesh Pandey]], [[Vivek Mashru]], [[Jasveer Kaur]], [[Ansha Saeed]].The forensic experts are played by [[Narendra Gupta]] and [[Shraddha Musale]] respectively.

====Austria====
* ''[[Inspector Rex]]'' (1994–2003) was an Austrian homicide detective series, whiched aired all over the world and was (and still is) incredibly popular in Australia when broadcast on [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]]. It is about a German Shepherd police dog named Rex and his owner, Detective-Inspector Richard Moser of the Vienna Kriminalpolizei. Rex was a bomb squad dog whose handler was killed at a crime scene that Moser was investigating. Moser's team consisted of Ernst Stockinger (seasons 1 and 2), and Peter Hollerer (seasons 1 to 4), and Christian Bock (seasons 3 to 6). Dr Leo Graf served as forensic pathalogist/coroner throughout the whole series, who often described autopsy scenes &amp; procedures much to the disgust of the police staff. Moser was murdered by a psychotic serial killer halfway through season 4. New detective inspector Alexander Brandtner took over Moser's role after Moser's untimely death. 
Rex frequently saved the team's necks during pursuits and catching criminals, sniffing out clues, rescuing child victims, as well as occasionally being a nuisance around the office or while interviewing suspects.
The show mixes series themes with occasional comedy, such as Rex's penchant for [[ham rolls]] (wurstsemmeln), demanding to buy many dog toys, and interfering with Moser's &amp; Brandtner's erratic love lives.

====United Kingdom====
* ''[[Fabian of the Yard]]'', (1954–55) – possibly the first police drama to be made for British TV, this series, based on the memoirs of real-life Scotland Yard detective Robert Fabian, had a lot in common with ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''.  Just as ''Dragnet'' had been the first network drama series with continuing characters to be shot on film, so ''Fabian of the Yard'' was one of the first British series to be filmed.  Both shows featured voice-over narration by the main character; both fictionalized stories derived from real-life cases; and both ended with an epilogue that revealed the ultimate fate of the criminals.  On ''Fabian'', this took the form of a medium-shot of Bruce Seton, who played Fabian in the series, seated at a desk.  The shot slowly dissolved into one of the real-life Fabian in the same pose at the same desk.  At that point, the actual Fabian stood up and told the audience what happened to the criminal he'd caught in the real-life case that had just been dramatized.
* ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]'', (1955–76) – [[Jack Warner (actor)|Jack Warner]] reprised the role of [[Constable]] George Dixon, the uniformed beat cop he had played in ''[[The Blue Lamp]]'', despite the fact that the Dixon character had been tragically murdered in that film.  During the course of this somewhat gentle series, Warner's character became, for many, the living embodiment of what every British "bobby" was supposed to be.  As the series progressed, Dixon went through several promotions, eventually winding up as the [[Station Sergeant]] at his local division.  By the final season, with Warner now over 80, Dixon retired and the focus shifted to the younger officers he'd trained up over the years.
* ''[[No Hiding Place]]'', (1957–67) – Produced with the cooperation of Scotland Yard, this long-running series featured Raymond Francis as high-ranking Met detective Tom Lockhart.  During its run, the series went through several title changes.  When it began in 1957, it was known as ''Murder Bag'', referring to the [[murder bag|bag of investigative tools]] that [[Superintendent (police)|Superintendent]] Lockhart carried with him whenever he was called to a case.  In 1959, with Lockhart promoted to [[Chief Superintendent]], it became ''Crime Sheet''.  Later in 1959, the series was given its final and best-remembered title, ''No Hiding Place'', which lasted until the series ended in 1967.
* ''[[Z-Cars]]'', (1962–78) – a police drama about two teams of uniformed constables ([[Brian Blessed]], [[Joseph Brady (actor)|Joseph Brady]], [[James Ellis (actor)|James Ellis]], and [[Jeremy Kemp]]) assigned to "Crime Patrol" duties in a pair of powerful [[Ford Zephyr]]s, under the supervision of Detective Sergeant John Watt ([[Frank Windsor]]) and Detective [[Chief Inspector]] Charlie Barlow ([[Stratford Johns]]).  A franker, and often less flattering portrait of police work than audience were used to seeing on ''Dixon of Dock Green'', the show was an immediate hit, its popularity generating spin-offs like ''[[Softly, Softly (TV series)|Softly, Softly]]'' (1966–76), ''[[Barlow at Large]]'' (1971–75), and ''[[Second Verdict]]'' (1976).
* ''[[Gideon's Way]]'', (1965–66) – a crime series produced during 1964/65 and based on the novels by [[John Creasey]] (as J. J. Marric). The series was made at Elstree in twin production with [[The Saint (TV series)|The Saint]] TV series.

==Comic strips and books==
The [[comic strip]] ''[[Dick Tracy]]'' is often pointed to as an early procedural. Indeed, in his introduction to a 1970 collection of ''Tracy'' strips entitled ''The Celebrated Cases of Dick Tracy'', no less an authority than [[Ellery Queen]] suggested that Tracy, predating Webb, Treat, Creasey, and McBain, was the first "truly" procedural policeman in any fictional medium.

Certainly ''Tracy'' creator [[Chester Gould]] seemed to be trying to reflect the real world. Tracy himself, conceived by Gould as a "modern-day [[Sherlock Holmes]]", was partly modeled on real-life law enforcer Eliot Ness, and his first, and most frequently recurring, antagonist, the [[Alphonse "Big Boy" Caprice|Big Boy]], was based on Ness's real-life nemesis Al Capone. Other members of Tracy's [[Recurring characters in Dick Tracy|Rogues Gallery]], like Boris Arson, [[Flattop Jones]], and Maw Famon, were inspired, respectively, by [[John Dillinger]], [[Charles "Pretty Boy" Floyd]], and [[Ma Barker|Kate "Ma" Barker]].

More to the point, Gould was making a genuine attempt to portray police work realistically.  Once ''Tracy'' was sold to the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' syndicate, Gould enrolled in a criminology class at [[Northwestern University]], met with members of the [[Chicago Police Department]], and did research at the Department's crime lab, to make his depiction of law enforcement more authentic.  Ultimately, he hired retired [[Chicago]] policeman Al Valanis, a pioneering forensic sketch artist, as both an artistic assistant and police technical advisor.

Later stories, in which Gould veered into [[space opera]] and extraterrestrial contacts, mitigated somewhat against the strip's being recognized for its early use of realistic police procedure, but any examination of the ''Tracy'' strip from its beginnings in 1931 through the 1950s makes Gould's status as a pioneer in the police procedural subgenre clear.

The success of ''Tracy'' led to many more police strips.  While some, like Norman Marsh's ''[[Dan Dunn]]'' were unabashedly slavish imitations of ''Tracy'', others, like [[Dashiell Hammett]]'s and [[Alex Raymond]]'s ''[[Secret Agent X-9]]'', took a more original approach.  Still others, like Eddie Sullivan's and Charlie Schmidt's ''[[Radio Patrol]]'' and Will Gould's ''Red Barry'', steered a middle course. One of the best post-''Tracy'' procedural comics was ''[[Kerry Drake]]'', written and created by Allen Saunders and illustrated by [[Alfred Andriola]]. It diverged from the metropolitan settings used in ''Tracy'' to tell the story of the titular Chief Investigator for the District Attorney of a small-town jurisdiction. Later, following a personal tragedy, he leaves the DA's Office and joins his small city's police force in order to fight crime closer to the grass roots level.  As both a DA's man and a city cop, he fights a string of flamboyant, Gould-ian criminals like "Stitches", "Bottleneck", and "Bulldozer."

Other syndicated police strips include [[Zane Grey]]'s ''[[King of the Royal Mounted]]'', depicting police work in the contemporary Canadian Northwest, Lank Leonard's ''[[Mickey Finn (comics)|Mickey Finn]]'', which emphasized the home life of a hard-working cop, and ''Dragnet'', which adapted stories from the pioneering radio-TV series into comics. Early [[comic books]] with police themes tended to be reprints of syndicated newspaper strips like ''Tracy'' and ''Drake''.  Others adapted police stories from other mediums, like the radio-inspired anthology comic ''[[Gang Busters]]'', Dell's ''87th Precinct'' issues, which adapted McBain's novels, or ''The Untouchables'', which adapted the fictionalized TV adventures of real-life policeman Eliot Ness.

More recently, there have been attempts to depict police work with the kind of hard-edged realism seen in the novels of writers like Wambaugh, such as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel's]] four-issue mini-series ''Cops:  The Job'', in which a rookie police officer learns to cope with the physical, emotional, and mental stresses of law enforcement during her first patrol assignment. With [[superhero]]es having long dominated the comic book market, there have been some recent attempts to integrate elements of the police procedural into the universe of costumed crime-fighters.  ''[[Gotham Central]]'', for example, depicts a group of police detectives operating in [[Batman]]'s [[Gotham City]], and suggested that the caped crime-fighter is disliked by many Gotham detectives for treading on their toes. Meanwhile, ''[[Metropolis SCU]]'' tells the story of the Special Crimes Unit, an elite squad of cops in the police force serving [[Superman]]'s [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].

The use of police procedural elements in superhero comics can partly be attributed to the success of [[Kurt Busiek]]'s groundbreaking 1994 series ''[[Marvels]]'', and his subsequent ''[[Astro City]]'' work, both of which examine the typical superhero universe from the viewpoint of the common man who witnesses the great dramas from afar, participating in them tangentially at best.

In the wake of Busiek's success, many other writers mimicked his approach, with mixed results&amp;nbsp;– the narrative possibilities of someone who does not get involved in drama are limited. In 2000, however, [[Image Comics]] published the first issue of [[Brian Michael Bendis]]'s comic ''[[Powers (comics)|Powers]]'', which followed the lives of homicide detectives as they investigated superhero-related cases. Bendis's success has led both Marvel Comics and [[DC Comics]] to begin their own superhero-themed police procedurals (''[[District X]]'' and the aforementioned ''Gotham Central''), which focus on how the job of a police officer is affected by such tropes as secret identities, superhuman abilities, costumes, and the near-constant presence of [[vigilante]]s.

While the detectives in ''Powers'' were "normal" (unpowered) humans dealing with super-powered crime, [[Alan Moore]] and [[Gene Ha]]'s ''[[Top 10 (comics)|Top 10]]'' mini-series, published by [[America's Best Comics]] in 2000–01, centered around the super-powered police force in a setting where powers are omnipresent. The comic detailed the lives and work of the police force of Neopolis, a city in which everyone, from the police and criminals to civilians, children and even pets, has super-powers, colourful costumes and secret identities.

[[File:Sa-potpourri.jpg|thumb|A potpourri.]]
[[File: Draper-Pot Pourri.jpg|thumb|Painting of a woman making potpourri by [[Herbert James Draper]], 1897.]]

'''Potpourri''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|oʊ|p|ʊ|ˈ|r|iː}} is a mixture of dried, naturally fragrant [[plant]] material, used to provide a gentle natural scent, commonly in residential settings. It is often placed in a decorative bowl or tied in small [[Sachet (scented bag)|sachet]] made from sheer fabric.

The word "potpourri" comes into English from the [[French language|French]]  word ''pot-pourri''. The French term has two connotations. It is the French name for a [[Spain|Spanish]] stew with a wide variety of ingredients called "''[[olla podrida]]''", a specialty of the town of [[Burgos]]. The word was taken and copied by the French military during the Napoleonic occupation of Burgos (1808-1813). The word ''pot'' in French has the same meaning as it does in Spanish and English, while the word ''pourri''  means rotten. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-putrid-origin-of-potpourri&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File: Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory - Potpourri Vase (Vase potpourri à vaisseau) - Walters 48559.jpg|thumb|[[Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship]], 1763, porcelain.]] 
[[File:Potpourri.jpg|thumb|A potpourri vase.]]
Dried scented plant material has been used in rooms since ancient times, in a variety of ways, including just scattering them on floors. In early 17th Century [[France]], fresh [[herbs]] and flowers were gathered—beginning in spring and continuing throughout the summer. The herbs were left for a day or two to become limp, then layered with coarse [[sea salt]]. The aging mixture was stirred occasionally as layers were added to it. Often the mixture would [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|ferment]] or even mold as the summer went by. In fall, spices would be added to the unsightly grey mix until a pleasant fragrance was achieved. Then, scent preserving fixatives (see below) were added. The finished potpourri was set out in special pots with perforated lids to perfume rooms. 

Much modern potpourri consists of any decoratively shaped dried plant material (not necessarily from scented plants) with strong natural and synthetic [[perfume]]s (and often colored [[dye]]s) added, with the scent often bearing no relation to the plant material used. Sometimes, items that do not originate from plants are mixed in with the potpourri, to give it bulk and to make it more aesthetically pleasing. It is possible to spray scents onto potpourri, however, a fixative is needed so that the scent is absorbed for slow release. Generally, [[orris root]] is used for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/herbs/hgen/creating-potpourri-herb-garden.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifespan==
Dried flowers can last anywhere from two months to 20 years, depending on the chosen blend. Properly made potpourri will last longer when stored in closed container.

==Containers==
In ceramics manufacturing, a potpourri vase is a specifically designed for holding potpourri. In the traditional designs, a potpourri container is provided with a pierced fitted lid, through which the scent may slowly diffuse.  The porcelain [[Sèvres pot-pourri vase in the shape of a ship]] is one of the most spectacular examples from the 1750s and 1760s; [[Madame de Pompadour]] owned three of the twelve examples made, ten of which survived.

==Plants used==

[[File:Dried rose.jpg|thumb|A dried rose. Dried flowers are a common component of potpourris.]]
There are many plant species that are used for potpourri. Researchers have identified 300 species from 95 families, including [[fungi]] and [[lichen]]s. A few toxic ingredients have been found in fruits such as ''[[Strychnos nux-vomica]]'', the strychnine tree. Naturally scented plants used in traditional potpourri include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rose.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Arthur-Tucker-Best-Plants-for-Homemade-Potpourri.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Associated with the proletarian arts movement in Japan, it primarily used small gauge films such as [[16mm film]] and [[9.5mm film]] to record demonstrations and workers' lives and show them in organized events or, using mobile projection teams, at factories and mines. It also published its own journals. Most of its films were [[documentaries]] or [[newsreels]], but Prokino also made [[fiction films]] and [[animated films]]. Prominent members included [[Akira Iwasaki]] and [[Genjū Sasa]], although in its list of supporters one finds such figures as [[Daisuke Itō (film director)|Daisuke Itō]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Shigeharu Nakano]], [[Tomoyoshi Murayama]], [[Kiyohiko Ushihara]], [[Kogo Noda]], [[Takiji Kobayashi]], [[Sōichi Ōya]], [[Fuyuhiko Kitagawa]], [[Tokihiko Okada]], [[Matsuo Kishi]], [[Kiyoshi Miki]], [[Denmei Suzuki]], [[Teppei Kataoka]], and [[Shigeyoshi Suzuki (film director)|Shigeyoshi Suzuki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Description and history==
The [[Smithsonian Institution]] describes ''Rachel'' as a "life-size, realistic figure" of a sow piggy bank.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt; The Pike Place Market Foundation calls it the "mascot" of [[Pike Place Market]].&lt;ref name=PPMF/&gt; The bronze sculpture depicts a pig with a money slot on the top of its head and measures approximately {{convert|36 x 66 x 16|in|cm}} and weighs {{convert|550|lbs|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Times-2011"&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Hagan |first=Maureen |date=February 6, 2011 |title=Rachel, Pike Place brass pig, survives crash—Rear-ended taxi careens into statue Rachel knocked off cement base |page=B2 |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/pig-vs-prius-and-the-winner-is/ |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze foot prints are on the sidewalk leading to the pig figure. One nearby plaque reads: "Market Foundation Piggy Bank.

The sculpture was surveyed by the Smithsonian's [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program in April 1995 and was deemed "well maintained".&lt;ref name=Smithsonian/&gt;

'''''Rossetti and His Circle''''' is a book of twenty-three [[caricatures]] by English [[Caricature|caricaturist]], essayist and [[Parody|parodist]] [[Max Beerbohm]]. Published in 1922 by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|William Heinemann]], the drawings were Beerbohm's humorous imaginings concerning the life of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his fellow [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelites]], the period, as he put it, "just before oneself."&lt;ref name="max"&gt;Max Beerbohm, ''Rossetti and His Circle'', London: William Heinemann, 1922&lt;/ref&gt; The book is now considered one of Beerbohm's masterpieces.&lt;ref name="nysl"&gt;[http://www.nysoclib.org/collections/green/beerbohm_max.html Link] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219084148/http://www.nysoclib.org/collections/green/beerbohm_max.html |date=19 February 2012 }} Beerbohm on the [[New York Society Library]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beerbohm and Rossetti==

Beerbohm returned to England from his home in [[Rapallo]] in Italy so that he could study photographs of the subjects he depicted in his caricatures. During the winter of 1917 he rented a cottage in the English countryside near the home of his friend [[William Rothenstein]] so that he could work on his Rossetti drawings. Every day, carrying his portfolio of drawings with him, Beerbohm walked across the snow to visit Rothenstein. "No wonder Max was nervous of leaving his Rossetti caricatures in an empty cottage... What a remarkable reconstruction of a period!" Rothenstein later wrote.&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt;
Rossetti and the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] had captured Beerbohm's imagination. "In London, in the great days of a deep, smug, thick, rich, drab, industrial complacency," he wrote, "Rossetti shone, for the men and women who knew him, with the ambiguous light of a red torch somewhere in a dense fog. And so he still shines for me."&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt;

Beerbohm's caricatures include [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] with his sister [[Christina Rossetti|Christina]], [[John Ruskin]], [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Millais]] and [[George Meredith]]. In plate 22, [[Oscar Wilde]], on his 1882 lecture tour in America, describes the delights of the [[Aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]] to a fascinated audience.&lt;ref name="nysl"/&gt; This tour had been organised by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] to publicise the new [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] opera ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]''.

Sir [[Hugh Walpole]] bequeathed Beerbohm's original watercolour artwork for ''Rossetti and His Circle'' to the [[Tate|Tate Collection]] in London in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=722&amp;page=1 Link] The Beerbohm Collection at the [[Tate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A special limited edition of 380 numbered copies bound in white cloth was also published in 1922. These were signed by Beerbohm.

But alas, in all of us there is a duality of nature. You, O felix nimium, are poet as well as painter. I, separated from my easel, am but a citizen. And the civistic passion yes, passion, dear Mr. Rossetti- restrains the instinct of the artist in me towards solitude, and curbs the panting of the hart in me for the water-brooks. I feel that I have, in conjunction with my colleagues, a duty to the nation. To improve the taste of the Sovereign, the taste of her ever-genial first-born and of his sweet and gracious consort, of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the faithful Commons, of the Judicial Bench, of those who direct the Army and Navy and Reserve Forces, of our merchant princes in Threadneedle Street and of our squires in the Shires, and through all these to bring light and improvement to those toiling millions on whom ultimately the glory of Great Britain rests all this is in me an ambition not to be stifled and an aspiration not to be foregone. You smile, Mr. Rossetti, yet I am not disemboldened to say to you now, as I have often wished to say to you, in the words of the Apostle Paul, 'Come over and help us!' Our President I grant you in confidence is not of all men the most enlightened. But I, in virtue of what is left to me of youth and ardour, conjoined with the paltry gift of tact, have some little influence at Burlington House. Come now! let me put your name down in our Candidates' Book."

The '''''Saint Vincent Panels''''', or the ''Adoration of Saint Vincent'' panels, are a [[polyptych]] consisting of six panels that were perhaps painted in the 1450s. They are attributed to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Nuno Gonçalves]], who was active from 1450 to 1471. Traditionally, the polyptych is dated to the 1450s due to the putative prominence of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] among the persons represented in the panels (Henry died in 1460). Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry's presence in the panels - if any - along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the ''[[floruit]]'' of the painter Gonçalves.

The original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained "over twelve" panels, as a source from 1767 states.&lt;ref&gt;Adriano de Gusmão, Nuno Gonçalves; The Burlington Magazine Vol. 98, No. 638 (May, 1956), pp. 166+169&lt;/ref&gt; They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra, where they escaped the devastating [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake of Lisbon in 1755]].

The panels are now housed in the [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] (National Museum of Antique Art), in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

== Discovery ==

Found during the late 1880s in the [[monastery]] of [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora|Saint Vicente de Fora]] in Lisbon, the panels depict scenes associated with the veneration of [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent of Saragossa]]. This polyptych consists of six separate panels of [[oak]] painted with oil or [[tempera]].

The only reference that art historians can use to support the attribution of the creation of the panels to the painter Gonçalves was written in the 16th century by [[Francisco de Holanda]].&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Holanda, Da pintura antiga (Lisbon, 1548)&lt;/ref&gt; The reference mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be these panels. There has also been speculation that the father of [[Hugo van der Goes]] collaborated in the painting of the panels, but no firm evidence to support this hypothesis exists.  In any case, the ''Saint Vincent Panels'' are regarded as the greatest achievement of pre-modern Portuguese art.

==Interpretations ==

Since their discovery in the late 19th century, there has been a continuing dispute over the identity of the painter and the subjects portrayed on the panels. Some basic questions, still unanswered, are these:

* What scene, or scenes, are depicted in the panels?
* Who are the sixty persons portrayed?
* What symbolism is expressed in the panels?
* Who commissioned these panels to be painted?

The majority of experts who have studied this polyptych agree that the panels display several social groups of 15th-century Portugal. They also agree that the children of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] are represented on these panels, but there is disagreement about their placement and identity.

=== Panel of the Prince: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Painéis de São Vicente3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The third panel - Panel of the Prince]]

One of the more controversial issues concerning the panels is the depiction of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. At first glance, the appearance of the man in black in the third panel is quite compatible with traditional conceptions of Prince Henry's likeness: a man with a light moustache and distinctive black [[Chaperon (headgear)|round chaperon]] such as can be found in numerous representations today. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.&lt;ref name="Marques"&gt;António Salvador Marques, 1998, [http://paineis.org/INDICE.htm Painéis de S. Vicente de Fora] (accessed 15-8-2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry the Navigator (Cronicas).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Frontispiece in Zurara's ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'' (Paris codex)]]
The most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) of [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]]'s ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'', written in 1453.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; Zurara's book is an account of the early [[Portuguese discoveries]] in Africa along with a [[hagiography]] of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry's own.
 
One alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara's book might actually be King [[Edward of Portugal]] (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry's brother.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.

This alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures  surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Eleanor of Aragon]]. Below them would be their son, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen [[Isabella of Coimbra]], who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward's heir, the future King [[John II of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt;

This alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother [[Philippa of Lancaster|Philippa]] and sister, [[Isabella of Portugal (1397–1471)|Isabella]], Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.

Another interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry's presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward's appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.

The alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs.  Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the ''floruit'' of Nuno Gonçalves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.

=== Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Nuño Gonçalves 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The fifth panel - Panel of the Knights]]

Hypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the "Panel of the Knights". This alternative interpretation posits that the four knights featured in the panel are the four younger brothers of King [[Edward of Portugal]],&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; as follows:
* On the right is [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was prince regent during the minority of Afonso V; he is wearing a belt of the [[Order of the Garter]]. 
* On the left is [[John, Constable of Portugal|John of Reguengos]], Constable of Portugal, in the red color and blade-holding pose typical of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]], of which he was the master.
* On top, helmeted and bearded in black, is [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince]], who died after spending many years as a hostage in a Moroccan prison.  His beard, long hair and emaciated face may reflect his long captivity.  It is possible that the reflection on his helmet is intended to represent the end of a Moorish prison window or (in conjunction with his beard), a [[Cross fleury]], the badge of the [[Order of Aviz]], of which he was the master.
* Below, kneeling in purple, is Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], with what seems like that order's cross pendant on his neck and a loose belt of the Order of the Garter.  The face of this grey-haired Henry is very different from traditional portrayals.

There has also been much discussion around the possible political significances of this panel.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It seems, in particular, that by the poses, this panel aims to humiliate Henry the Navigator, possibly for allying himself with [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso of Braganza]] against his full brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]] in 1449.  These features of the portrait have been noted: 
* Henry is on his knees, seemingly begging for forgiveness, while Peter and John seem to "stand guard" over him.  
* The pendant Order of Christ cross around Henry's neck is broken.
* Henry's garter belt is untied and disheveled, whereas Peter's is worn properly. 
* The pommel of Henry's sword is twisted, dull and draped in black thread, whereas Peter and John's swords are shiny, laced with gold and silver threads.
* Henry's head is penitently uncovered, whereas Peter and John wear the caps of nobles.
* Peter and John are wearing white gloves, perhaps to denote guilt-free "clean hands", whereas Henry is ungloved.
* Henry seems to gaze straight across to another panel, as if her were asking forgiveness from the royal dynasty he had "wronged", whereas Peter and John look at the spectators.

It is worth remarking that the colors chosen for the princes seem to match the [[liturgical colors]] of the [[Roman rite]]—black (Ferdinand) for mourning of the dead, green (Peter) for ordinary, red (John) for passion and sacrifice and purple (Henry) for penance and mortification.&lt;ref&gt;"Liturgical Colors" at Catholic Encyclopedia [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04134a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

If this interpretation is valid, then the polyptych of St. Vincent may very well have been conceived by Nuno Gonçalves as a piece of anti-Braganza political propaganda, one possible reason it might have remained hidden for years.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It would also set up a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the creation of the panels; they would have to have been painted after 1449 (the date of the Battle of Alfarrobeira). That would tend to support the traditional belief that they date from the 1450s (when passions left over from that conflict would still have been fresh), however if the boy depicted in the Panel of the Prince can be identified as the future King John II (b. 1455), his height and appearance would certainly indicate a child older than five years' old, thus a date in the 1460s would be more likely.

'''Speedtest.net''' is a web service that provides free analysis of [[Internet access]] performance metrics, such as connection data rate and latency. It was founded by Ookla in 2006, and is based in [[Seattle, Washington]].

The service measures the [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] (''speed'') and [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] of a visitor's Internet connection against one of 4,759 geographically dispersed [[Server (computing)|servers]] (as of August 2016) located around the world. Each test measures the data rate for the [[download]] direction, i.e. from the server to the user computer, and the [[upload]] data rate, i.e. from the user's computer to the server. The tests are performed within the user's web browser or within [[Mobile app|apps]].  {{As of|September 2018}}, over 21 billion speed tests have been completed.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[https://speedtest.net See tests completed on page.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests were previously performed using the [[HTTP|HTTP]] protocol at Layer 7 of the [[OSI model]]. To further improve accuracy, Speedtest.net now performs tests via direct [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] sockets and uses a custom protocol for communication between servers and clients.

The site also offers detailed statistics based on test results. This data has been used by numerous publications in the analysis of Internet access data rates around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7098992.stm |title=Broadband speeds around the world |date=December 2, 2007 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10454199"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/technology/news/article.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10454199 |title=The truth about Kiwi broadband |author=Greenop, Matt |date=July 27, 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/hey-telstra-forget-about-broadband/2007/06/23/1182019431084.html |title=Hey Telstra, forget about broadband |author=Lane, Terry |authorlink=Terry Lane |date=June 24, 2007 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The owner and operator of Speedtest.net, Ookla, was established in 2006 by a small team of internet and technology veterans. Ookla was acquired by [[Ziff Davis]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://investor.j2global.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=885561|title=Ziff Davis Acquires Ookla...

==Technology==
The technology of Speedtest.net is similar to that of Ookla NetGauge, which is provided to a wide variety of companies and organizations on a licensed basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ookla.com/netmetrics/|title=NetMetrics from Ookla - Internet performance database|work=ookla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speedtest.net Mini was a free, stripped-down Flash version of the speed test technology used on Speedtest.net that users could run on their own web server, however it was replaced in 2016 with Speedtest Custom, an HTML5-based tool. Together, over 20 million speed tests are generated each month using Ookla's software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ookla.com/about.php|title=Ookla - About|work=ookla.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026002139/http://www.ookla.com/about.php|archivedate=2017-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''St Ursula's''' is a building at 37 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It incorporates a section of [[Chester Rows]] and is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]] because of the quality of the [[undercroft]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376436|desc= Number 37 Street Number 45 Row St Ursulas, Chester|accessdate= 11 April 2015|mode=cs2|ps=none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building originated somewhere between about 1180 and about 1280.  Alterations were made in the 16th&amp;nbsp;or 17th&amp;nbsp;century and it was largely rebuilt above the Row level in the late 19th&amp;nbsp;century and altered again in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century.  The building is in four storeys.  It is built in [[sandstone]] at the street (undercroft) and Row levels and above this is [[timber framing|timber-framed]].  The undercroft has 5½ bays and it is considered that the walls date from the late 12th&amp;nbsp;century, and are therefore the earliest features yet to have been dated in the structure of the Rows.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

The undercroft is currently in use as a storeroom for the neighbouring toy shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Toycraft|url=http://toycraft.co.uk/index.php/about_toycraft/|publisher=Toycraft|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced|date=May 2007}}

A '''subway party''' is a [[party|celebration]] that occurs on a [[mass transit]] system. Generally, people meet at a predetermined station in their city's mass transit system, wait until their numbers have achieved [[critical mass (sociodynamics)|critical mass]], and board the train. From there, revelers may engage in many different activities, from playing [[music]] and dancing to exchanging gifts.

There are several kinds of subway parties, the two most distinct being the [[rush hour]] subway party and the [[night|late night]] subway party.

==Rush hour subway parties==
{{SectOR|date=October 2007}}
The stated goal of the rush hour subway party is to spread joy to commuters, whose daily treks into the center of their metropolis can be long, boring or stressful. Several subway party groups have boarded subway cars dressed in [[goat skins]] to give presents to commuters, and have been known to play parcheesi, wear wings and sprinkle moon dust on the willing.

Critics of subway parties of this kind say that, by introducing chaos, these activities may place the already-crowded subway riders in danger or cause delays. Also, some people may simply become annoyed by them.

==Late night subway parties==
Late night subway parties are for the enjoyment of the attendees. Party-goers don [[costumes]], decorate the subway car, bring musical instruments and sometimes the parties have a [[Theme (visual arts)|theme]].

With the advent of email and cellphones, invitations to subway parties can now be distributed electronically. The party usually starts at one [[Rapid transit|subway]] station and acquires more participants as it proceeds through the system. The instructions often ask people to meet by the last car of the train.

==Other subway parties==
On nights that are especially festive such as [[New Year's Eve|New Year's]] or [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] victories, a spontaneous subway party may occur. People may already be drinking above ground and decide to board the subway. When this happens, the general feeling of revelry continues below ground.

In 2005, the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] declared October "culture month", perhaps inspired by recent subway parties in the city.{{Fact|date=September 2008}} This campaign included "culture cars", which were randomly selected cars that contained spontaneous, professional singing, dancing and music.

==History of the subway party==
In 1904, the [[New York City Subway]] system's [[Early history of the IRT subway |first line]] opened. Photographs from the event show people dressed in tuxedos and top hats and drinking champagne to celebrate.

In the 1980s, [[Michael Alig]] and the [[Club Kids]] threw parties on [[New York City]] subway trains where they purportedly took the drug [[Methylenedioxymethamphetamine|ecstasy]]. The events were promoted through [[word of mouth]] and telephones. These parties are detailed in the book ''[[Disco Bloodbath]]''.

Today, subway parties are only loosely related to the [[flash mob]] phenomenon. The details for subway parties are published on blogs, websites and mailing lists. People assemble seemingly spontaneously in dozens of [[cities]] throughout the world.

[[File:Elizabeth of Romania pic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A royal portrait employing strong mythic overtones: [[Elisabeth of Wied|Queen Elisabeth of Romania]], born a German princess, adopts the national costume of Romania, with distaff and spindle.]]
The theme of '''textiles in mythology and folklore''' is ancient, and its lost mythic lore probably accompanied the early spread of this art.  In traditional societies today, westward of Central Asia and the Iranian plateau, [[weaving]] is a mystery within woman's sphere.  Where men have become the primary weavers in this part of the world, it is possible that they have usurped the archaic role:&lt;ref&gt;Kathy M'Closky, "Trading is a whiter man's game: the appropriation of women's weaving," in Sally Cole and Lynne Phillips, eds., ''Ethnographic Feminisms: Essays in Anthropology'' (Ottawa: Carleton University Press) 1996:97–118&lt;/ref&gt; among the gods, only goddesses are weavers. [[Herodotus]] noted, however, the cultural difference between gender identities and weaving among Hellenes and Egyptians: among Egyptians it was the men who wove.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, 2.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaving begins with [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]].  Until the [[spinning wheel]] was invented in the 14th century, all spinning was done with [[distaff]] and [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]. In English the "distaff side"  indicates relatives through one's mother, and thereby denotes a woman's role in the household economy.  In Scandinavia, the stars of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion's belt]] are known as ''Friggjar rockr'', "Frigg’s distaff".

Textiles have also been associated in several cultures with [[Cultural depictions of spiders|spiders in mythology]].

The spindle, essential to the weaving art, is recognizable as an emblem of security and settled times in a ruler's eighth-century BCE inscription at [[Karatepe]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In those places which were formerly feared, where a man fears... to go on the road, in my days even women walked with spindles"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the adjacent region of North [[Syria]], historian [[Robin Lane Fox]] remarks [[funerary]] [[stelae]] showing men holding cups as if feasting and women seated facing them and holding spindles.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted and noted in Fox, Robin Lane (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NZFM-TUwFxgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer]''. Vintage Books. p. 77. {{ISBN|978-0-679-76386-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt==
In pre-Dynastic Egypt, ''nt'' ([[Neith]]) was already the goddess of weaving (and a mighty aid in war as well). She protected the Red Crown of Lower Egypt before the two kingdoms were merged, and in Dynastic times she was known as the most ancient one, to whom the other gods went for wisdom. Nit is identifiable by her emblems: most often it is the loom's shuttle, with its two recognizable hooks at each end, upon her head.  According to E. A. Wallis Budge (''The Gods of the Egyptians'') the root of the word for ''weaving'' and also for ''being'' are the same: ''nnt''.

==Greece==
In Greece the [[Moirai]] (the "Fates") are the three [[crone]]s who control [[destiny]], and the matter of it is the art of spinning the thread of life on the distaff.  [[Ariadne]], the wife of the god [[Dionysus]] in Minoan Crete,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} possessed the spun thread that led [[Theseus]] to the center of the [[labyrinth]] and safely out again.

Among the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian]]s, the weaver goddess is [[Athena]], who, despite her role, was bested by her acolyte [[Arachne]], who was turned later into a weaving spider.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Athena-Greek-mythology|title=Athena {{!}} Greek mythology|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The daughters of Minyas, [[Alcithoe]], [[Leuconoe]] and their sister, defied [[Dionysus]] and honored Athena in their weaving instead of joining his festival. A woven [[peplos|peplum]], laid upon the knees of the goddess's iconic image, was central to festivals honoring both Athena at Athens, and [[Hera]].

In Homer's legend of the [[Odyssey]], [[Penelope]] the faithful wife of [[Odysseus]] was a weaver, weaving her design for a shroud by day, but unravelling it again at night, to keep her suitors from claiming her during the long years while Odysseus was away; Penelope's weaving is sometimes compared to that of the two weaving enchantresses in the ''Odyssey'', [[Circe]] and [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] is at her loom in the ''[[Iliad]]'' to illustrate her discipline, work ethic, and attention to detail.

[[Homer]] dwells upon the supernatural quality of the weaving in the robes of goddesses.

In Roman literature, [[Ovid]] in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' (VI, 575–587) recounts the terrible tale of [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Philomela]], who was raped and her tongue cut out so that she could not tell about her violation, her loom becomes her voice, and the story is told in the design, so that her sister [[Philomela (princess of Athens)|Procne]] may understand and the women may take their revenge.  The understanding in the Philomela myth that pattern and design convey myth and ritual has been of great use to modern mythographers: [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] led the way, interpreting the more permanent patterns of vase-painting, since the patterned textiles had not survived.

==Germanic==
For the [[Norse paganism|Norse]] peoples, [[Frigg]] is a goddess associated with weaving. The Scandinavian "[[Darraðarljoð|Song of the Spear]]", quoted in "[[Njals Saga]]", gives a detailed description of [[Valkyrie]]s as women weaving on a loom, with severed heads for weights, arrows for shuttles, and human gut for the warp, singing an exultant song of carnage. Ritually deposited spindles and loom parts were deposited with the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] ritual wagon at Dejbjerg, Jutland,&lt;ref&gt;Found in the 1880s; noted by Grigsby, John (2005). ''Beowulf and Grendel: the Truth behind England's Oldest Myth''. Watkins. p. 57, 113f. {{ISBN|1-84293-153-9}}. See discussion of the ritual wagons in Danish bogs in Glob, Peter Vilhelm &amp; [[Rupert Bruce-Mitford|Bruce-Mitford, Rupert]] (transl.) (1988). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=5e0tkA6gGT8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved]''. New York Review. pp. 166-71. {{ISBN|1-59017-090-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and are to be associated with the wagon-goddess.

In Germanic mythology, [[Holda]] (Frau Holle) and [[Perchta]] (Frau Perchta, Berchta, Bertha) were both known as goddesses who oversaw spinning and weaving. They had many names.

[[Holda]], whose patronage extends outward to control of the weather, and source of women's fertility, and the protector of unborn children, is the patron of spinners, rewarding the industrious and punishing the idle. Holda taught the secret of making [[linen]] from [[flax]]. An account of Holda was collected by the [[Brothers Grimm]], as the [[fairy tale]] "[[Holda|Frau Holda]]". Another of the Grimm tales, "[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]", which embeds social conditioning in fairy tale with mythic resonances, rewards the industrious spinner with the fulfillment of her mantra:
:''"Spindle, my spindle, haste, haste thee away,''
:''and here to my house bring the wooer, I pray."''

::''"Spindel, Spindel, geh' du aus,''
::''bring den Freier in mein Haus.''"

This tale recounts how the magic spindle, flying out of the girl's hand, flew away, unravelling behind it a thread, which the prince followed, as [[Theseus]] followed the thread of [[Ariadne]], to find what he was seeking: a bride "who is the poorest, and at the same time the richest". He arrives to find her simple village cottage magnificently caparisoned by the magically-aided products of spindle, shuttle and needle.

[[Jacob Grimm]] reported the superstition "if, while riding a horse overland, a man should come upon a woman spinning, then that is a very bad sign; he should turn around and take another way." (''Deutsche Mythologie'' 1835, v3.135)

Also the [[Norns]], female giantesses, weavers of fate, belong in this folklore of weaving.

==Celts==

The goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)|Brigantia]], due to her identification with the Roman [[Minerva]], may have also been considered, along with her other traits, to be a weaving deity.

==French==
Weavers had a repertory of tales: in the 15th century [[Jean d'Arras]], a Northern French storyteller (''[[trouvere]]''), assembled a collection of stories entitled ''Les Évangiles des Quenouilles'' ("Spinners' Tales"). Its [[frame story]] is that these are narrated among a group of ladies at their spinning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mDX2_0Qb03EC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;dq=jean+d%2527arras+Les+%25C3%2589vangiles+des+Quenouilles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=n65ZEKV55V&amp;sig=qhPVWJ1PRk29zltb8KGoqh7jdmY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_0vLPj7XPAhUGOj4KHRxSDDoQ6AEIXTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=jean%2520d'arras%2520Les%2520%25C3%2589vangiles%2520des%2520Quenouilles&amp;f=false|title=The Distaff Gospels: A First Modern English Edition of Les Évangiles des Quenouilles|last=Jeay|first=Madeleine|last2=Garay|first2=Kathleen|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551115603|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baltic==
In Baltic myth, [[Saulė|Saule]] is the life-affirming sun goddess, whose numinous presence is signed by a wheel or a rosette. She spins the sunbeams. The Baltic connection between the sun and spinning is as old as spindles of the sun-stone, amber, that have been uncovered in burial mounds. Baltic legends as told have absorbed many images from Christianity and Greek myth that are not easy to disentangle.

==Finnish==
The Finnish epic, the ''[[Kalevala]]'', has many references to spinning and weaving goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Kalevala|title=Kalevala {{!}} Finnish literature|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hunterian Psalter c. 1170 Eve spinning.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Eve spinning, from the [[Hunterian Psalter]], English, ca 1170]]

==Later European folklore==
"When Adam delved and Eve span..." runs the rhyme; though the tradition that [[Eve]] [[spinning (textiles)|span]] is unattested in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], it was deeply engrained in the medieval Christian vision of Eve. In an [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] from the 13th-century [[Hunterian Psalter]] (''illustration. left'') Eve is shown with distaff and spindle.

In later European folklore, weaving retained its connection with magic.  [[Mother Goose]], traditional teller of [[fairy tale]]s, is often associated with spinning.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, Maria (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTtMH_ezI4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales]''. p. 114. {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was known as "Goose-Footed Bertha" or ''Reine Pédauque'' ("Goose-footed Queen") in French legends as spinning incredible tales that enraptured children.

The daughter who, her father claimed, could spin straw into gold and was forced to demonstrate her talent, aided by the dangerous earth-daemon [[Rumpelstiltskin]] was an old tale when the [[Brothers Grimm]] collected it.  Similarly, the unwilling spinner of the tale ''[[The Three Spinners]]'' is aided by three mysterious old women.  In ''[[The Six Swans]]'', the heroine spins and weaves [[starwort]] in order to free her brothers from a shapeshifting curse.  ''[[Spindle, Shuttle, and Needle]]'' are enchanted and bring the prince to marry the poor heroine.  [[Sleeping Beauty]], in all her forms, pricks her finger on a spindle, and the curse falls on her.&lt;ref&gt;Tatar, Maria (1987). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lTtMH_ezI4UC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Hard Facts of the Grimms' Fairy Tales]''. pp. 115–8, {{ISBN|0-691-06722-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Holman-Hunt, William, and Hughes, Edward Robert - The Lady of Shalott - 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Lady of Shallott'' by [[William Holman Hunt]], painted from 1888 to 1902]]
In [[Alfred Tennyson]]'s poem "[[The Lady of Shalott]]", her woven representations of the world have protected and entrapped [[Elaine of Astolat]], whose first encounter with reality outside proves mortal. [[William Holman Hunt]]'s painting from the poem (''illustration, right'') contrasts the completely pattern-woven interior with the sunlit world reflected in the roundel mirror. On the wall, woven representations of Myth ("[[Hesperides]]") and Religion ("Prayer") echo the mirror's open roundel; the tense and conflicted Lady of Shalott stands imprisoned within the brass roundel of her loom, while outside the passing knight sings "'Tirra lirra' by the river" as in Tennyson's poem.

A high-born woman sent as a hostage-wife to a foreign king was repeatedly given the epithet "weaver of peace", linking the woman's art and the familiar role of a woman as a dynastic pawn. A familiar occurrence of the phrase is in the early English poem ''[[Widsith]]'', who "had in the first instance gone with Ealhild, the beloved weaver of peace, from the east out of Anglen to the home of the king of the glorious Goths, Eormanric, the cruel troth-breaker..."

==Inca==
In [[Inca mythology]], [[Mama Ocllo]] first taught women the art of spinning thread.

==China==
{{See also|The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl}}

*In [[Tang Dynasty]] [[China]], the goddess weaver floated down on a shaft of moonlight with her two attendants.  She showed the upright court official ''Guo Han'' in his garden that a goddess's robe is seamless, for it is woven without the use of needle and thread, entirely on the loom. The phrase "a goddess's robe is seamless" passed into an idiom to express perfect workmanship.  This idiom is also used to mean a perfect, comprehensive plan.
*The Goddess Weaver, daughter of the [[Queen Mother of the West|Celestial Queen Mother]] and [[Jade Emperor]], wove the [[stars]] and their light, known as "[[the Silver River]]" (what Westerners call "[[Milky Way|The Milky Way]] Galaxy"), for heaven and earth.  She was identified with the [[star]] Westerners know as [[Vega]].  In a 4,000-year-old legend, she came down from the Celestial Court and fell in love with the mortal Buffalo Boy (or Cowherd), (associated with the star [[Altair]]).  The Celestial Queen Mother was jealous and separated the lovers, but the Goddess Weaver stopped weaving the Silver River, which threatened heaven and earth with darkness.  The lovers were separated, but are able to meet once a year, on the seventh day of the seventh moon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=unM5hd_V13MC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;lpg=PA429&amp;dq=Chinese+Goddess-Weaver&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qnzhq4U4Pp&amp;sig=f6LtsUkqci3qb-sBMyEqmA2CKcU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lAPvSu2sJomoMa7BsIQM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chinese%20Goddess-Weaver&amp;f=false Jung Chang, ''Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China''], New York: Touchstone, 2003, reprint, GlobalFlair, 1991, p. 429, accessed 2 Nov 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan==
* The Japanese folktale ''[[Tsuru no Ongaeshi]]'' features a weaving theme.  A crane, rescued by a childless elderly couple, appears to them in the guise of a girl who cares for them out of gratitude for their kindness and is adopted as their daughter.  She secretly begins weaving stunningly beautiful cloth for the couple to sell under the condition that they may not see her weave.  Though the couple initially comply, they are overcome with curiosity and find the girl is the crane who has been weaving the cloth from her own feathers, leaving her in a pitiful state.  With her identity discovered, she must leave the remorseful couple.  A variation of the story replaces the elderly couple with a man, who marries the crane when she takes on the form of a young woman.

'''''The Bathers''''' (French: '''''Les Grandes Baigneuses''''') is an [[oil painting]] by French artist [[Paul Cézanne]] first exhibited in 1906. The painting, which is exhibited in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], is the largest of a series of ''Bather'' paintings by Cézanne; the others are in the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City, [[National Gallery, London]], the [[Barnes Foundation]], Philadelphia, and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="cold"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cezanne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Brown |first=Mark |title=Cézanne, reclusive 19th century genius, gets recognition he craved a century on |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/15/france.arts |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Anderson |first=Porter |title=Review: MoMA reunites Cezanne and Pissarro |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/TRAVEL/06/28/moma.cezanne.pissarro/ |publisher=''[[CNN]]'' |date=2005-06-28 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally referred to as the '''''Big Bathers''''' or '''''Large Bathers''''' to distinguish it from the smaller works, the painting is considered one of the masterpieces of modern art,&lt;ref name="cezanne"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kimmelman |first=Michael |title= ART VIEW;Cezanne, in All His Magnificent Mystery |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9401EEDC1639F93AA35755C0A960958260 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=1996-06-09 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often considered Cézanne's finest work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Riding |first=Alan |title= Cezanne: The Hot New Artist of the 90's |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DA1738F937A15753C1A963958260 |publisher=''[[New York Times]]'' |date=1995-10-24 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With each version of the ''Bathers'', Cézanne moved away from the traditional presentation of paintings, intentionally creating works which would not appeal to the novice viewer.&lt;ref name="walther"&gt;{{Citation |last=Walther |first=Ingo F. |authorlink= |title=Masterpieces Of Western Art: A History Of Art In 900 Individual Studies |publisher=[[Taschen]] |year=2002 |pages=512 |isbn=3-8228-1825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to avoid fleeting [[fad]]s and give a timeless quality to his work, and in so doing paved the way for future artists to disregard current trends and paint pieces which would appeal equally to all generations.&lt;ref name="walther"/&gt; The abstract nude females present in ''Large Bathers'' give the painting tension and density.&lt;ref name="walther"/&gt; It is exceptional among his work in symmetrical dimensions, with the adaptation of the nude forms to the triangular pattern of the trees and river.&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, Meyer (1988).

The purchase of the painting, while generally praised, was nevertheless questioned by ''[[The Philadelphia Record]]'', which noted that 41,000 (or ten percent) of Philadelphia's residents were without [[bathtub]]s, and that the money could therefore have been better spent elsewhere.&lt;ref name="cezanne"/&gt; While Cézanne's drawing ability has always been criticized, a critic once said that he "made the ineptly drawn Bathers a warm evocation of leisurely summer bliss."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= |first= |title=I Am a Timid Man |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,822079,00.html |publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date=1952-02-04 |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was featured in the [[BBC Two]] series ''[[100 Great Paintings]]''.

'''''The Siren''''' is a painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]. The painting depicts a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] sitting at the edge of a cliff, [[lyre]] in hand, staring down at a shipwrecked sailor floating in water, who in turn is staring up at her.

According to the William Waterhouse's website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=3|title=John William Waterhouse: The Siren - 1900 « Paintings|publisher=jwwaterhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; this picture was painted in 1900 and is now part of a private collection. The estimated sales price for the painting in 2003 was one million pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2003/11/03/basir03.xml|title=Culture|publisher=telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Siren
He listened in thrall to the song of the siren,
Her voice like a star as it flew through the air.
He drowned in her eyes as she called him to follow,
And likened the sun to the gold of her hair.

She swept up her arms and held him close to her,
Her soft lips caressing the lines on his brow.
He could not resist her, a magic had trapped him,
And nothing could save him, for she had him now.

She pulled him down with her into the clear water,
He gasped as death started the grip on his soul.
His life ebbed away as she dragged him still further,
And laughed when she saw she'd accomplished her goal."
- Charlotte Lester.

'''The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture''' (SPWC) was a Toronto [[Not-for-profit arts organization|arts organization]] in existence from 1986 to 1991 that explored environmental and ecological issues from an artistic perspective in a "quirky and innovative" way.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, "landscape readings"; and a series of cabarets, The Café of Wild Culture.

The organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron "wild culture" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"/&gt; It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists.

The organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.

== Art and ecology ==
The style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of "wild culture" (also see "[[wildculture]]"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of "thinking man's" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists.&lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch"&gt;''Metropolis'', March 30, 1989, Donna Lypchuk, "Mock on the Wild Side".&lt;/ref&gt; The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: "There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail"&gt;''Globe and Mail'', Sept 7, 1988, June Callwood, 'sunday morning landscape readings cultivate food for thought"., p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "wild culture" grew out of multidisciplinary artist [[Whitney Smith (multidisciplinary artist)|Whitney Smith]]'s experience of "a spiritual updraft in the art spheres" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, "Fern Policy", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, "L'Affaire 'Pataphysique", that presented examples of [['pataphysics]] by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.

== Defining wild culture ==
Though there were attempts by the organization to define "wild culture", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared,  where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine [[academic journal]] published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D2.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work.

Before there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture ("the articulated [[ecotone]] between what humans do and what they can't control in nature"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt;

== Programs ==

=== ''The Journal of Wild Culture'' ===
The literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of ''[[The Journal of Wild Culture]]'' being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that "one of the things wild culture ''is'', is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined".&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture".&lt;/ref&gt; The "quirky and innovative" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Organic start ====
Born out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect [[Peter Ferguson]], public relations consultant [[Kim Obrist]] and filmmaker and publisher [[Christopher Lowry]]. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the [[National Geographic Society]] (which published its own journal) and ''FILE'' magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, [[General Idea]], and to the ''[[Utne Reader]]'''s use of other published materials.&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"/&gt; The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer [[Bernard Stockl]] became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied "Journal of Wild Culture" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 "from an anonymous angel" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a" /&gt;

==== Recruitment through social events ====
The premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as "a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Sun'', July 24, 1987, Marion Kane, "Get Down at Wild Culture Hoedown"., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that "half of the experience at "The Journal of Wild Culture" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had "a cult following in Texas".

==== Visual language ====
Smith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. "Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after "Harper's" and "Arts and Architecture": "The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for "creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310055407/http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Difficulties and demise ====
In the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the ''Utne Reader'' editor, [[Eric Utne]], called "indescribable", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of "a career publisher",&lt;ref&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's "Arts Report", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of ''[[Granta]]'' magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, ''Wild Culture'', edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material.

An attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the ''Journal of Wild Culture'' online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was "a notion with a mind of its own" and that "the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there".

=== Landscape Readings ===
Landscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

The readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest,&lt;ref&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture," p. ?.&lt;/ref&gt; which was documented in the forthcoming issue of ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dewdney, photos by David Hlynsky, Fall 1987, "Evidence Revealed During Walk in Park", ''The Journal of Wild Culture'', Vol. I, No. 3., p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artist guides included [[Gordon Rayner]], [[Hank Hedges]], [[M. T. Kelly]], [[June Callwood]], [[Larry Zolf]], [[Joyce Weiland]], and architect [[Donald Schmitt]]. The Readings were created to "give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

=== The Café of Wild Culture ===
The Café of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer [[Marc Glassman]], who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', February 4, 1989, Ingrid Hamilton, "Scene and Heard", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Café was performed first in Toronto at [[The Rivoli]], and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style &lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch" /&gt; played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Café's case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt-ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show.

Smith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt; "I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin". The project was abandoned after a couple of years.

In 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.

== The Journal of Wild Culture 2.0 ==
From September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Whitney|title=Wild Culture info|url=http://www.whitneysmith.ca/wildcultureinfo.htm|work=Information page|publisher=Whitney Smith|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Culture, people page|url=http://www.wildculture.com/people|website=The Journal of Wild Culture|publisher=Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Titan's Goblet''''' is an oil painting by the English-born American landscape artist [[Thomas Cole]]. Painted in 1833, it is perhaps the most enigmatic of Cole's [[allegorical]] or imaginary landscape scenes. It is a work that "defies full explanation", according to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/all/the_titan_s_goblet_thomas_cole/objectview.aspx?page=1&amp;sort=0&amp;sortdir=asc&amp;keyword=titan%27s%20goblet&amp;fp=1&amp;dd1=0&amp;dd2=0&amp;vw=1&amp;collID=0&amp;OID=20010846&amp;vT=1&amp;hi=0&amp;ov=0 The Titan's Goblet. Collections Database, Metropolitan Museum of Art.] Accessed August 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Titan's Goblet'' has been called a "picture within a picture" and a "landscape within a landscape": the goblet stands on conventional terrain, but its inhabitants live along its rim in a world all their own. Vegetation covers the entire brim, broken only by two tiny buildings, a Greek temple and an Italian palace. The vast waters are dotted with sailing vessels. Where the water spills upon the ground below, grass and a more rudimentary civilization spring up.

== Interpretations ==

Cole often provided text to accompany his paintings, but did not comment on ''The Titan's Goblet'', leaving his intentions open to debate. In the 1880s, one interpretation related Coles goblet to the [[world tree]] and specifically to the [[Yggdrasil]] in [[Norse mythology]]. A 1904 auction catalog continued this theme, writing "the spiritual idea in the centre of the painting, conveying the beautiful Norse theory that life and the world is but a tree with ramifying branches, is carefully carried out by the painter".&lt;ref name="Parry126"&gt;Parry, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not obvious, however, that Cole would have been familiar with this concept, and critic Elwood C. Parry suggests that the likeness to any mythological tree is limited to the similarity of the goblet's stem to a tree trunk.  There is nothing about the goblet analogous to branches or roots.&lt;ref name="Parry126"/&gt;

The scale of the massive stone goblet contrasts with that of the traditional landscape scene around it, inviting comparisons with the large stone objects left by ancient races of giants in [[Greek mythology]]—a view endorsed by art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Attributed to Panofsky in fn. 3, Parry, 123&lt;/ref&gt; The painting's title (given by Cole on the back of the canvas) seems to support this idea, as if much time had passed between the creation of this goblet and the current scene. The setting sun, a romantic symbol, also evokes the passage of time.

The dominance of the goblet in the painting might suggest a cosmological interpretation. Parry considers but rejects a comparison with the exterior panels of [[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' (c. 1500), which are generally taken to depict the creation of Earth. Both images are of a contained world, but use water and terrain in differing proportions. Cole's ''Goblet'' offers neither iconography nor an inscription that would confirm a religious interpretation of the picture. Furthermore, the painter has placed the goblet far from the center of the canvas, which minimizes its emblematic significance.

The waters of the goblet, though, can be seen as a civilizing influence. The inhabitants of the goblet have a Utopian existence, pleasure boating on the tranquil waters and living among the temples and leafy woods. Where the waters spill onto the landscape below—where the two worlds interact—signs of life appear. In the background, far from the influence of the goblet's waters, the mountains are desolate and rocky. A similar depiction of civilization by the waterside can be seen in Cole's ''An Evening in Arcady'' (1843).

Louis Legrand Noble was a friend and biographer of Cole, and could have been expected to have some insight into the work. In his commentary, however, there is no mention of these ideas. He wrote, "There [the goblet] stands, rather reposes upon its shaft, a tower-like mossy structure, light as a bubble, and yet a section of a substantial globe. As the eye circles its wide rolling brim, a circumference of many miles, it finds itself in fairy land; in accordance though with nature on her broadest scale... Tourists might travel in the countries of this imperial ring, and trace their fancies on many a romantic page. Here steeped in the golden splendors of a summer sunset, is a little sea from Greece, or Holy Land, with Greek and Syrian life, Greek and Syrian nature looking out upon its quiet waters."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted with ellipsis in Parry, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Parry's 1971 article on the painting instead looks to Cole's first tour to Europe (1829–32) to unravel the imagery of the goblet. Cole visited England and its preeminent landscape painter, [[J.M.W. Turner]], whose work he had mixed feelings about. He was however drawn to Turner's ''[[:commons:File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 064.jpg|Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus]]'' (1829), making two sketches of the painting and another study for a possible treatment of his own, which did not come to fruition. The titular [[cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] is pivotal to the ancient Greek epic ''[[The Odyssey]]'', and Cole's interest in the subject demonstrates his openness to "the creative possibilities of such a Mediterranean scene".&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as Cole researched themes for his painting series ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', he would have encountered the story of [[Mount Athos]] in [[Vitruvius]]'s ''Ten Books on Architecture''. The Ancient Roman writer recounts the suggestion of the architect [[Dinocrates]] to Alexander that the mountain be shaped into "the statue of a man holding a spacious city in his left hand, and in his right a huge cup, into which shall be collected all the streams of the mountain, which shall thence be poured into the sea."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Joseph Gwilt, translator, in Parry, 131&lt;/ref&gt; This fantastical image appeared in 18th- and 19th-century illustrations that Cole may have seen. As Parry writes, "the precedent of a classical architectural fantasy on this scale supplies an alternative to the natural assumption that the Titan's goblet was actually made by a giant who simply left it behind".&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 133&lt;/ref&gt; But a literal rendition of this image may not have suited Cole's art: being a landscape artist, he would have been more comfortable expressing it only topographically, avoiding the need to render a massive stone human form.

[[File:Thomas Cole sketch - Fantastic Fountain and Basins.jpg|thumb|200px|A fantastical sketch of a fountain and basins by Cole, c. 1832–33]]

Cole's drawings&lt;ref&gt;Found in his sketchbooks at the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]&lt;/ref&gt; from his trip to Europe or shortly thereafter also appear to prefigure the ''Goblet''. They show his interest in fountains and basins and are influenced by those he saw during the Italian leg of his voyage, in Florence, Rome, and Tivoli. In one drawing, a series of huge basins adorned with vegetation descends to the sea. Another depicts a single, mossy-rimmed basin of normal size, but the ground-level view makes it appear monumental. Cole's drawings of the Italian [[volcanic lake]]s [[Lake Nemi|Nemi]] and [[lake Albano|Albano]] are also reminiscent of the goblet's waters and rim, insofar as they suggest that a "basic visual analogy was at work in Cole's thoughts, an analogy between [these] actual landscapes he had observed and the shape of the water vessels and basins he imagined."&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Parry also suggests the "unusual, but not impossible" idea that Cole's ''Goblet'' was a landscape artist's answer to the [[still life]] genre. Visiting the home of his patron [[Luman Reed]], an avid art collector, Cole would have seen a still-life painting "''with Goblet and Lemon''" by the 17th-century Dutch artist [[Willem van Aelst]].  The highlight of that painting is a translucent glass goblet. The similarities are basic, with both paintings having a vertical format and an off-center drinking vessel.

== Provenance ==

Cole likely painted the picture in a fairly short period, given its small size and very thin application of paint. (The canvas is very visible in the accompanying image, viewed at full resolution.) He did so without commission, so the subject was purely his own. He asked $100 for the work, apparently based on the size of the painting—his full-scale landscapes at the time fetched $250 to $500. 

Cole sent ''The Titan's Goblet'' to [[Luman Reed]], though it is not clear whether Reed owned it or simply reviewed it. The work was exhibited at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1834 while owned by James J. Mapes. Artist [[John Mackie Falconer]] owned it by 1863. [[Samuel Putnam Avery]] donated the painting in 1904 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;See the Metropolitan Museum of Art entry for provenance.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recognized as a unique artwork, ''The Titan's Goblet'' was the only pre-20th-century American painting included at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]'s "Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism" exhibition of 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Parry, 123&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3699">"...'''the terrorists have won'''" or "...'''then the terrorists win'''" are [[rhetoric]]al phrases which were widely used in the [[United States]] in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]]. The phrase says "that if we pursue some particular course of action, why then, the terrorists have won" (as explained by [[Jeff Greenfield]] of [[CNN]]). &lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/nov/27/news/lv-terrorwar27 A Phrase That Turns Routine Acts Into Acts of War], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', November 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
==Etymology==
The expression had been used before 2001. In 1986, an article in the Journal of the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) reported: {{quote|ABA President William Falsgraf has wisely pointed out that we must not alter fundamental precepts of U.S. law in responding to terrorism.  "If we do," Falsgraf said, "the terrorists have won."&lt;ref&gt;Jeanne B. Clarizio, "Striking at the heart of liberty", in {{cite book |title=ABA Journal vol. 72 (issue of January 1, 1986) |publisher=American Bar Association |location=Chicago, IL |year=1986 |pages=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1DoBn23tmQMC&amp;q=%22the+terrorists+have+won%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22the%20terrorists%20have%20won%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
==History==
In 1995, an editorial about the response to the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in the ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'', of [[Ocala, Florida]] concluded: "Our response to terrorism should be carefully measured. If our [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights suffer as a result of the awful domestic terrorist attack in Oklahoma City the terrorists have indeed, won."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0dYjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xAcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5965,5537372&amp;dq=the-terrorists-have-won&amp;hl=en Hasty laws are not the answer],  ''[[Ocala Star-Banner]]'',  April 27, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  At the same time, an editorial in  the ''Victoria Advocate'' of [[Victoria, Texas]] said: "If Americans begin to yield their own freedoms at home, the terrorists have won."&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aDYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XksDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6418,1374257&amp;dq=the-terrorists-have-won&amp;hl=en Don’t yield our freedoms], ''[[The Victoria Advocate]]'', May 8, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In the months after the September 11 attacks, the expression was often used. One of the most famous instances was on November 4, 2001 by [[Ellen DeGeneres]], who was hosting the [[Emmy Awards]], which had been postponed twice that year for worries that a showy celebration would seem inappropriate in the wake of the attacks.  To lighten the mood, she quipped: "We're told to go on living our lives as usual, because to do otherwise is to let the terrorists win, and really, what would upset the [[Taliban]] more than a gay woman wearing a suit in front of a room full of Jews?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/oscars2007/story/0,,2019540,00.html The Guardian profile: Ellen DeGeneres], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tommy Hollenstein''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[abstract impressionism|abstract impressionist]] painter and [[found object]] sculptor.  A lifelong [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]], Hollenstein has become a highly respected [[Disability in the arts|disabled artist]] who utilizes the tires of his [[wheelchair]] instead of traditional painting methods to create his works.&lt;ref name="la_times_6-10-14"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Laurell|first1=David|title=On the Town: Two artistic venues make a big impression|url=http://www.latimes.com/tn-blr-me-on-the-town-two-artistic-venues-make-a-big-impression-20140610-story.html|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tronc, Inc.|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollenstein has numerous celebrity and art collector patrons, and his art has appeared in numerous private and public installations throughout the [[United States]].  He is also involved in [[philanthropy]], donating paintings and the proceeds of his sales to numerous charitable organizations.

==Biography==

Hollenstein, the son of a restaurateur father and an ex-Marine Corps mother, was raised in [[Canoga Park, Los Angeles|Conoga Park]], in the [[San Fernando Valley]] region of the [[Los Angeles Metropolitan Area]]. As a young man, Hollenstein was an enthusiast of extreme sports, and enjoyed [[skateboarding]], [[surfing]], and [[mountain biking]].&lt;ref name="bh_times"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Takowsky | first1 = Suzanne| date = June 2012 | title=One Picture Says A Thousand Words…|url=https://issuu.com/beverlyhillstimes/docs/beverly_hills_times_magazine_june_2012 | magazine = Beverly Hills Times | location = Beverly Hills, CA | publisher = The Beverly Hills Times, LLC | pages = 20–21, 41| access-date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took an interest in the arts as well, making his first inroads into artistic work in creating [[edible art]] from watermelons. He also trained to become a [[Private investigator|private detective]].&lt;ref name="la_weekly_2009"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Groubert | first1 = Mark | date = 22 April 2009 | title = LA People 2009: Spin Artist – Tommy Hollenstein | url = http://www.laweekly.com/la-life/la-people-2009-spin-artist-tommy-hollenstein-2159459| magazine = LA Weekly | location = Los Angeles | publisher = Voice Media Group | page = 103| access-date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 1985, Hollenstein was involved in a bicycling accident that broke his neck, causing him to become a C4/C5 quadriplegic and confining him to a wheelchair.  While recovering from the injury, Hollenstein was introduced to mouth stick painting, which he rejected because he felt it was too restrictive. Hollenstein initially began working as a private investigator assigned to [[missing person]]s cases, and eventually moved over to working on modified service vans for the handicapped.&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name="new_mobility"&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = Maddox | first1 = Sam | date = April 2008 | title = Tommy Hollenstein: Tracking Art| url = http://www.newmobility.com/2008/04/tommy-hollenstein-tracking-art| magazine = New Mobility | location = Kew Gardens, New York | publisher = United Spinal Association | pages = 32–41| access-date = 2 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollenstein began painting through an incident involving a service dog. Hollenstein's service dog had suffered a stroke, and Hollenstein wanted to memorialize the dog by creating a painting that places the dog's paw prints next to the tracks of his wheelchair.  Hollenstein created two paintings featuring the dog's footprints next to his wheelchair tracks,&lt;ref name="ladn_2005"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Dennis|title=Tracks of His Tears. Artist paints in memory of his best friend: a dog|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/TRACKS+OF+HIS+TEARS+ARTIST+PAINTS+IN+MEMORY+OF+HIS+BEST+FRIEND%3a+A+DOG.-a0133928274|website=Los Angeles Daily News|publisher=Digital First Media|accessdate=3 March 2017|page=1|date=10 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ladn_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCarthy|first1=Dennis|title=Dennis McCarthy: Colorful collaboration of wheels, paws|url=http://www.dailynews.com/20111207/dennis-mccarthy-colorful-collaboration-of-wheels-paws|website=Los Angeles Daily News|publisher=Digital First Media|accessdate=3 March 2017|page=A2|date=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; upon which he realized that he could use the tires of his wheelchair to paint instead of brushes. He then built a studio and began working on paintings at night.  Hollenstein began shopping his paintings to art dealers and had his first solo exhibition in 2005.&lt;ref name="hufpo_3-2-17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Dog Inspires Artist To Paint With His Wheelchair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/06/tommy-hollenstein_n_3709383.html|website=Huffington Post|publisher=AOL|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic style==

Hollenstein also credits his [[Christianity|Christian]] faith as an inspiration in his work, and has created several works with inspirational themes.&lt;ref name="aem_intv"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=John|title=Interview with Painter Tommy Hollenstein|url=http://a-e-m.org/interview-with-painter-tommy-hollenstein/|website=Arts and Entertainment Ministries|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hollenstein's works utilize [[Behr (paint)|Behr]] house paints&lt;ref name="patch_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellantoni|first1=Cassandra|title=Local Artist Keeps Rolling Along With His 'Wheels of Hope' Charity Benefit|url=http://patch.com/california/encino/local-artist-keeps-rolling-along-with-his-wheels-of-hacb6a16b6c|website=Patch|publisher=Hale Global|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pretreated [[Masonite]] boards.&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt;  He brushes paint onto the wheels of his wheelchair, and then uses the wheels to paint the boards, applying layers of color over top of each other over a period of time.  The number of layers in a painting will vary from three all the way up to fifty. Some of Hollenstein's paintings feature noticeable tire track patterns, and others utilize bald tires and other techniques that make it difficult to tell that the art was created with the tires of a wheelchair.  Hollenstein gives most of his finished paintings a one-word title that represents the painting's theme.&lt;ref name= new_mobility /&gt; Hollenstein then uses his leftover brushes and dipsticks to create [[found object]] sculptures.&lt;ref name=bh_times /&gt;

==Patrons==

Hollenstein's patron list includes numerous celebrities in the music and entertainment fields. Actor [[Joaquin Phoenix]] became an early celebrity patron when he purchased two paintings from Hollenstein's first solo exhibition.&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt;  Other celebrity patrons include [[Ringo Starr]], [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] ([[Guns N' Roses]]),&lt;ref name=hufpo_3-2-17 /&gt; [[Elliot Easton]] ([[The Cars]]),&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt; [[Nick Hexum]] ([[311 (band)|311]]), author [[Dean Koontz]],&lt;ref name= new_mobility /&gt; [[Elton John]], and television evangelist [[Joel Osteen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Tommy|url=http://www.tommyhollenstein.com/about-tommy/|website=Tommyhollenstein.com|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malibu-based art collector Lisette Ackerberg, the widow of real estate developer Norman Ackerberg, has assembled one of Southern California's premier private abstract art collections.  The Ackerbeg collection, which includes works by [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], also includes Hollenstein's painting ''Unseen''.&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name= new_mobility /&gt;

==Charity work==

Hollenstein regularly donates paintings and the proceeds of sales to [[Charitable organization|charitable]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organizations]]. Ten percent of all of the sales of Hollenstein's paintings go to [[Canine Companions for Independence]], a non-profit organization that trains [[service dog]]s.&lt;ref name= la_weekly_2009 /&gt;&lt;ref name= new_mobility /&gt;

In 2007, Hollenstein's paintings were featured in an exhibit at the [[Boston Children's Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Exhibits|url=http://www.childrenshospital.org/patient-resources/family-resources/creative-arts-program/art-exhibits|website=Childrenshospital.org|publisher=Boston Children's Hospital|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to Hollenstein coming out on location to the hospital to teach wheelchair-bound children how to paint with the tires of their wheelchairs.&lt;ref name= new_mobility /&gt; In 2008, Hollenstein donated ''Helping Hands,'' a painting which featured the handprints of sixteen rock musicians, including those of [[Ringo Starr]] and [[Joe Walsh]], to the non-profit [[Shane's Inspiration]].&lt;ref name= patch_2011 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Calkins|editor1-first=Meli|title=More Member News|journal=The Paint Rag|date=March 2009|volume=66|issue=3|page=4|url=http://www.sfvartclub.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/2009-03-PaintRag.pdf|accessdate=4 March 2017|publisher=San Fernando Valley Art Club|location=Granada Hills}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hollenstein donated paintings to a concert benefit for Los Angeles-based charity Adopt The Arts that "preserves and creates arts programs in U.S. public schools".&lt;ref name="bravewords_1-16-15"&gt;{{cite web|title=SLASH, BILLY GIBBONS, DUFF MCKAGAN, RICHIE SAMBORA, MATT SORUM And More - Adopt The Arts Concert And Live Auction Raises Over $106,000 In One Night To Fund Music Programs In LAUSD Elementary Schools; Photos Posted|url=http://bravewords.com/news/slash-billy-gibbons-duff-mckagan-richie-sambora-matt-sorum-and-more-adopt-the-arts-concert-and-live-auction-raises-over-106-000-in-one-night-to-fund-music-programs-in-lausd-elementary-schools-photos-posted|website=BraveWords|accessdate=4 March 2017|date=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, a solo exhibition of Hollenstein's work entitled "Wheels of Hope" donated forty percent of its proceeds to six different charitable organizations.&lt;ref name= patch_2011 /&gt;

'''Visual focus depth art''' ('''VFDA''') is a form of [[mixed media]] [[collage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mixed-media|title=mixed-media|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that places an emphasis on the use of three-dimensional application to individual creations of single one-of-a-kind art pieces to emphasize individual meaning in the work. It is a derivative of ''[[Assemblage (art)|assemblage]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) "Assemblage Art". ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed. Retrieved February 7, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''collage''&lt;ref&gt;Collage, essay by Clement Greenberg, July 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[decollage]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See D-De, ArtLex Art Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is similar to the basic mixed-media collage idea of building up various levels of the piece for emphasis. Known in this medium as '''''projections''''', the artist tries in a variety of ways to create a visual image that causes the viewer to focus on certain areas of the art framework that would ordinarily be overlooked or relegated to the background rather than to randomly layer structure creating a whole image of the work.

==Origins==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}While the exact origins of VFDA are unknown, the first artwork of its nature began to appear around 2010 in the street art of various cities in Europe, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]] and [[Amsterdam]]. This appears to have been a response to the expanding use of computer generation in art to both design and create mixed-media collage works that could be essentially pre-designed and mass-produced. Since that time, various artists have produced series of works-known as '''''ensembles'''''—that are individually unique and limited in scope. Common themes of these ensembles range widely from ideological ideas like bohemianism, libertine and socially relevant matters to historical perspective, such as the interpretation of various time periods and eras.

==Structure of the design==
The floor/design base of the piece is used to create a theme or story about the subject.  Sections of the work are then raised to provide emphasis and act as an accent to substantiate the message. VFDA is usually created in single pieces or via limited series depending upon the artist involved and is also generally confined to canvass or wooden framework. Larger scale pieces, such as architectural interpretations, are generally not considered part of this medium. Each VFDA piece is unique is not duplicated in any way with the exception of limited prints. While some artists offer limited prints of the original artwork, the number offered is very limited in scope.

[[File:Femme Fatales VFDA.JPG|thumb|Femme Fatales VFDA]]

==Background variations==
The backgrounds used in VFDA range widely from the use of true vintage pieces such as original period sheet music, fractional currency, foreign money or other items that set the time frame for the piece.  Each of the items used relate the overall, theme of the art. The background can also be structured in segmented form-through the use of '''linear script'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/linear|title=Linear - Definition of linear by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—composed of simply drawn lines with little attempt at pictorial representation, '''mathematic symbolism'''—such as the use of angles and formulas and via '''free-form application'''—concepts chosen by the artist to represent the underlying theme in the work.

[[File:Athena VFDA.JPG|thumb|Athena VFDA]]

VFDA is based on the unique aspect of every piece being created by the artist. Materials used to emphasize the projections include wooden palates measured to the frame, various forms of corkboard, balsa wood and other materials that are hand-cut or machined by the artist to help raise the projections to the level desired. The use of preformed shapes, three-dimensional printing and advanced computer generation of any kind&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick Bloom, Susan (2006). ''Digital Collage and Painting: Using Photoshop and Painter to Create Fine Art''. Focal Press. {{ISBN|0-240-80705-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used to map the work or create the projections is not considered to be part of this art form because the work can be saved, duplicated and even mass-produced.&lt;ref&gt;Lev Manovich (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Wallace Foundation began with the philanthropy of [[DeWitt Wallace|DeWitt]] and [[Lila Bell Wallace|Lila Acheson Wallace]], who together founded [[Reader's Digest Association|The Reader's Digest Association]].&lt;ref&gt;West, Melanie Grayce. [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323949404578312341097271424 "Financial Know-How for Nonprofits Online"] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' (February 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the money they earned from the magazine, which they launched in 1922, the Wallaces contributed to a wide assortment of artistic, cultural and youth-serving causes. They died in the 1980s (Dewitt Wallace in 1981, Lila Wallace in 1984), leaving much of their fortune to four private foundations they had created in their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wallacefoundation.org/learn-about-wallace/history/Pages/default.aspx "The Wallace Foundation: A Brief History"] on the Wallace Foundation website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 a single national foundation, The Wallace Foundation, emerged from the consolidation of these private foundations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/ref/college/collegespecial3/ll_wallacemission.html "College: Wallace Foundation Mission Statement"] on ''[[The New York Times]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major initiatives ==
The Wallace Foundation has five major initiatives underway:

[[File:Suushi Yurei.jpg|thumb|''Yūrei'' by Sawaki Sūshi (1737)]]
'''''Yūrei-zu''''' (幽霊図) are a genre of Japanese art consisting of painted or woodblock print images of ghosts, demons and other supernatural beings. They are considered to be a subgenre of ''fūzokuga'', "pictures of manners and customs."&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"&gt;Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt; These types of art works reached the peak of their popularity in Japan in the mid- to late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Addis"&gt;Addis 1985, 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei''==
Literally translatable as ‘faint (''yū'' - 幽) spirit (''rei'' - 霊),’ ''[[yūrei]]'' is just one of several Japanese words used to refer to spirit beings. Other terms include: ''[[obake]]'' (お化け), ''[[yōkai]]'' (妖怪), ''bōrei'' (亡霊), and ''[[shiryō]]'' (死霊). There is a long tradition of belief in the supernatural in Japan stemming from a variety of influences. Imported sources include [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and [[List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore|Chinese folklore]]. The most notable influence, however, is [[Shinto|Shintō]], a native Japanese [[animism|animistic religion]] which presupposes that our physical world is inhabited by eight million omnipresent spirits.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese ghosts are essentially spirits "on leave" from hell in order to complete an outstanding mission.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"&gt;Richie 1983, 7&lt;/ref&gt; The souls (''reikon'' - 霊魂) of those who die violently, do not receive proper funerary rites, or die while consumed by a desire for vengeance, do not pass peacefully to join the spirits of their ancestors in the afterlife. Instead, their ''reikon'' souls are transformed into ''ayurei'' souls, which can travel back to the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;Monstrous.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to Buddhist belief, the journey from the world of the living (''konoyo'' - この世) to that of the dead (''anoyo'' - あの世) takes 49 days, and it is in this limbo-like phase that they can attend to unresolved issues.&lt;ref&gt;Iwasaki and Toelken 1994, 15&lt;/ref&gt; There is a close relationship between the degree of an individual’s suffering in life and the severity of their actions in the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 27&lt;/ref&gt; While their intentions are not always evil, the results of their actions are almost always damaging for the humans involved.&lt;ref name="Richie 1983, 7"/&gt; Belief held that a ghost could only receive release through the prayers of a living individual that his/her soul be allowed to pass into the underworld.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

==Historical background ==
[[File:Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall LACMA M.84.31.442.jpg|thumb|''Shimobe Fudesuke and the Ghost of the Woman in the Waterfall'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (c. 1865)]]
Images of supernatural beings, as well as gory and grotesque scenes exist on Japanese painted scrolls going back to the medieval period. This tradition continued through the centuries, providing a foundation for ''yūrei-zu'', as well as for violent ''chimidoro-e'' (“bloody pictures” - 血みどろ絵) and ''muzan-e'' (“cruel pictures” - 無残絵) which were to become popular in [[Edo period|Edo Japan]].&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"&gt;Fensom 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are prior examples, ''yūrei-zu'' reached the pinnacle of their popularity in the mid- through late 19th century,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; along with ghost themed ''[[kabuki]]'' plays and ghost tales (''[[kaidan]]'' - 怪談).&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; Scholars link the "persistent popularity"&lt;ref&gt;Bell 2004, 140&lt;/ref&gt; of the occult to the "unsettled social conditions" prevailing during the late Edo,&lt;ref name="Addis" /&gt; which included the oppressive [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa]] regime, the beginnings of westernization, and a number of natural disasters.
&lt;ref&gt;See Addis 1985, 178; Rubin 2000; Harris 2010, 156; Schaap 1998, 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In addition to floods and earthquakes, Japan was blighted by a series of droughts which led to twenty periods of famine between 1675 and 1837 (Dolan and Worden 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' and theatre==
[[File:Funazu - Yoshitoshi ryakuga - Walters 95350.jpg|thumb|''Yoshitoshi ryakuga'' by Tsukioka Yoshitoshi (1882)]]
Japan has long had a vibrant folkloric tradition of ghost stories, and in the early eighteenth century these began to be dramatized for the [[Noh|''nō'']] stage and ''[[bunraku]]'' puppet theatre.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; As ''kabuki'' began to flourish throughout the later 1700s, so too did the number of dramas based on ghost stories, particularly those involving vengeful female ghosts returning to punish their wrong-doers.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; ''Kabuki'', like ''[[ukiyo-e]]'', was a populist art form, which aimed to satisfy the dramatic tastes of a “proletarian clientele”: the rising working and middle classes in [[Edo]] (present-day Tokyo).&lt;ref&gt;Addis 1985, 179&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kabuki'' and ''ukiyo-e'' shared a close kinship, as woodblock artists attempted to tap into “the public’s ever-increasing appetite for tales of the bizarre and thrilling,” and share the ''kabuki'' audience demographic.&lt;ref name="Schaap 1998, 17"/&gt; As Sarah Fensom notes, "that prints of the macabre, the supernatural and the grotesque were so frequently designed and distributed is for the most part a greater reflection of 19th century Japanese tastes than of the agenda of the artists." &lt;ref&gt;2013&lt;/ref&gt; Artists produced images of ghosts as well as of actors in ghost roles, effecting a conflation of three prevailing trends in ''ukiyo-e'' of the period: depictions of the female form ([[Bijinga|''bijin-ga'']]), depictions of supernatural or macabre themes, and depictions of celebrated actors (''kabuki-e'' or ''shibai-e'').

==Censorship==
In an attempt to return Japan to its feudal, agrarian roots, the Tokugawa regime in 1842 instituted the [[Tenpō Reforms|Tempō Reforms]] (''Tempō no kaikaku'' - 天保の改革), a collection of laws governing many aspects of everyday life. In addition to the economy, the military, agriculture and religion, the Reforms reached into the world of art.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Tempō Reforms''&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the Reforms was essentially to valorize frugality and loyalty,&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"&gt;The Fitzwilliam Museum&lt;/ref&gt; thus ostentatious or morally dubious images such as depictions of ''geisha'', ''[[oiran]]'' courtesans and ''kabuki'' actors were banned.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; According to an 1842 decree aimed at print publishers: “To make woodblock prints of Kabuki actors, courtesans and geisha is detrimental to public morals. Henceforth the publication of new works [of this kind] as well as the sale of previously procured stocks is strictly forbidden. In future you are to select designs that are based on loyalty and filial piety and which serve to educate women and children, and you must insure that they are not luxurious.”&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

Given this climate of censorship, some artists used the ''yūrei-zu'' genre "to symbolically and humorously disguise … criticism of the social and political maladies of the day by having fantastic creatures appear as substitutes for real people, especially the ruling elite."&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;Harris 2010, 156&lt;/ref&gt; Such critiques led the government to subsequently ban both ''yūrei-zu'' and ghost plays.&lt;ref name="Rubin" /&gt; The Tempō Reforms were ultimately unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and the strict regulation of art works was no longer enforced after 1845, once the shogunal advisor who had initiated the Reforms left the government.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse 2012, 95&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the rules remained nominally in effect, some artists invoked clever word- and picture-play to circumvent censorship.&lt;ref name="The Fitzwilliam Museum"/&gt;

==''Yūrei-zu'' physical characteristics==
[[File:Hokusai Kohada Koheiji.jpg|thumb|''Kohada Koheiji'' by Hokusai (1831-1832)]]
The ghosts featured in Edo period ''ukiyo-e'' come in various forms. They can appear as animal creatures both real and imagined, such as foxes, cats, dragons and demons. They can also be the discontent spirits of male warriors.&lt;ref&gt;Fensom 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ghosts featured, however, tend to be female, "specifically," as [[Donald Richie]] notes, "dissatisfied females."&lt;ref&gt;1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjects in ''yūrei-zu'' typically correspond to a very specific set of physical characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Jordan 1985, 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davisson 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* long, straight black hair, which is often unkempt
* white or pale-coloured kimono akin to the plain white ''katabira'' (帷子) or ''kyōkatabira'' (経帷子) funerary kimono
* long, flowing sleeves
* some are depicted with a triangular ''[[hitaikakushi]]'' (額隠) forehead cloth also associated with [[Japanese funeral|Japanese funerary tradition]]
* a thin, fragile frame
* outstretched arms, sometimes waving or beckoning
* hands hanging limply from the wrists
* no body below the waist
* often accompanied by ''[[hitodama]]'' (人魂), green, blue or purple floating flames
* transparent or semi-transparent

By nature, they:&lt;ref&gt;Richie 1983, 6&lt;/ref&gt;
* are nocturnal
* avoid running water
* appear in true ghostly guise when reflected in a mirror or water surface

==Notable Edo examples==
[[File:Oyuki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|''Ghost of Oyuki'' by Maruyama Ōkyo (1750–1780)]]

===''The Ghost of Oyuki''===
The earliest ''yūrei-zu'' is considered to be by [[Maruyama Ōkyo]] (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school and one of the most significant artists of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Maruyama Ōkyo''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ghost of Oyuki]]'' (''Oyuki no maboroshi'' - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century &lt;ref&gt;Jordan suggests the painting was produced when Maruyama was “in his mid-forties” (1985, 33n), which would make it c. 1778; however, Stevenson states that it was completed for the shogun in or around 1760 (1983, 10), and yet another source believes it to date from 1750 (Chin Music Press).&lt;/ref&gt; In Maruyama’s naturalistic style,&lt;ref&gt;Apocryphally, Maruyama once painted such a realistic ghost image that it came to life and terrified him. The incident is immortalized in a painting by [[Taiso Yoshitoshi]] (1839-1892) entitled 'Yoshitoshi Ryakuga'. (Art History Reference)&lt;/ref&gt; it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose body tapers into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.”&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"&gt;Jordan 1985, 26&lt;/ref&gt; According to a scroll box inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover,&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson suggests that in the absence of the subject, Maruyama’s dying aunt acted as his model (1983, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; a ''[[geisha]]'' who died young.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt; Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.&lt;ref name="Jordan_a"/&gt;

===Other Edo artists===
All of the pre-eminent ''ukiyo-e'' artists of the later Edo period produced ''yūrei-zu'', including [[Kunisada]], [[Hokusai]] &lt;ref&gt;See the 1831 series ''One Hundred [Ghost] Tales'' (''Hyaku monogatari'')&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], who “designed the largest number of prints portraying ghosts as well as other strange, unusual and fantastic creatures.” &lt;ref name="Harris" /&gt;

Another major producer of ''yūrei-zu'' was [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]] who reputedly had personal encounters with ghosts in 1865 and 1880. In 1865 he produced the series ''One Hundred Ghost Stories of China and Japan'' (''Wakan hyaku monogatari''), his first series to feature ghosts. The original series, which was based on a popular game of the period involving ghost stories, included one hundred images; however, only twenty-six were published.&lt;ref&gt;Chiappa, J. Noel and Levine, Jason M. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His final print series, ''New Forms of 36 Ghosts'' (''Shinkei sanjūrokuten''), was "so freakishly popular," according to Sarah Fensom, "that the blocks from which it was printed wore out."&lt;ref name="Fensom 2012"/&gt;

==Contemporary examples==
[[File:Female Ghost.JPG|thumb|upright|''Female Ghost'' by Kunisada (1852)]]
Although patently no longer as pervasive as during the late Edo period, ''yūrei-zu'' and contemporary variations continue to be produced by Japanese artists in various media. One prominent example is the ''[[nihonga]]'' painter [[Fuyuko Matsui]] (b. 1974), whose ghostly images are described as “beautiful and eerie,”&lt;ref&gt;Japan Echo&lt;/ref&gt; “dark [and] Gothic,” and “disturbing and mesmerizing.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"&gt;Liddell&lt;/ref&gt; Matsui has identified a goal of her works as imparting “a condition that maintains sanity while being close to madness.”&lt;ref name="Liddell"/&gt; Matsui’s colour on silk hanging scroll “Nyctalopia” (2005) is particularly reminiscent of classic ''yūrei-zu'' such as Maruyama’s “The Ghost of Oyuki.”&lt;ref&gt;See image at http://www.matsuifuyuko.com/works-e/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Another artist whose works echo ''yūrei-zu'' is [[Hisashi Tenmyouya]] (b. 1966). Between 2004 and 2005, Tenmyouya completed a series of acrylic on wood paintings entitled ''New Version of Six Ghost Stories'' (新形六怪撰).  The six images are reworkings of famous Japanese ghost stories, such as [[Yotsuya Kaidan|''Tokaido Yotsuya'']] ''Ghost Story'' and ''Kohata Koheiji Ghost Story'', which were rendered in woodblocks by Edo artists.&lt;ref&gt;See images at http://www3.ocn.ne.jp/~tenmyoya/paintings/0_paintings.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also creating contemporary ''yūrei-zu'' in a traditional style is American-born, Japanese-resident artist Matthew Meyer. His ''Japanese Yōkai'' series is collected in his illustrated book ''The Night Parade of One Hundred Demons''. According to Meyer, the intention of his paintings is "to recreate the feeling of old Japanese woodblock prints while adding a contemporary illustrative touch."&lt;ref&gt;http://matthewmeyer.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of ''yūrei-zu'' is also evident in the [[manga]] of [[Shigeru Mizuki]] (b. 1922) and [[Hiroshi Shiibashi]] (b. 1980), both of whom are renowned for their works dealing with traditional Japanese aspects of the supernatural.

The stone-carved '''Zimbabwe Bird''' is the national emblem of [[Zimbabwe]], appearing on the national flags and coats of arms of both Zimbabwe and [[Rhodesia]], as well as on [[Rhodesian dollar|banknotes]] and coins (first on [[Coins of the Rhodesian pound|Rhodesian pound]] and then [[Coins of the Rhodesian dollar|Rhodesian dollar]]). It probably represents the [[Bateleur|bateleur eagle]] or the [[African fish eagle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds from Great Zimbabwe |journal=African Arts|year=1985|volume=18|number=3|pages=68–73, 99–100|author=Thomas N. Huffman|jstor=3336358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review: The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe Symbols of a Nation by Edward Matenga |journal=The South African Archaeological Bulletin|year=2001|volume=56|number=173/174|pages=105–106|author=Paul Sinclair|jstor=3889033}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bird's design is derived from a number of [[soapstone]] sculptures found in the ruins of the ancient city of [[Great Zimbabwe]].

It is now the definitive icon of independent [[Zimbabwe]] with Matenga (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soapstone Birds of Great Zimbabwe|journal=Studies in Global Archaeology|year=2001|volume=16|pages=1–261|author=Edward Matenga}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing over 100 organisations which now incorporate the Bird in their logo. 

==Origins==
The original carved birds are from the ruined city of Great Zimbabwe, which was built by ancestors of the [[Shona people|Shona]], starting in the 11th century and inhabited for over 300 years.&lt;ref name="metessay"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zimb/hd_zimb.htm Great Zimbabwe (11th–15th century) | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins, after which modern Zimbabwe was named, cover some {{convert|730|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and are the largest ancient stone construction in sub-Saharan Africa. Among its notable elements are the [[soapstone]] bird sculptures, about {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=off|0}} tall and standing on columns more than {{convert|90|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall, which were originally installed on walls and monoliths within the city.&lt;ref name="metessay"/&gt; They are unique to Great Zimbabwe; nothing like them has been discovered elsewhere.&lt;ref name="HallStefoff2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Martin|last2=Stefoff|first2=Rebecca|title=Great Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xaVWJCHi7qcC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-515773-4|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various explanations have been advanced to explain the symbolic meaning of the birds. One suggestion is that each bird was erected in turn to represent a new king, but this would have required improbably long reigns.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murray|first1=Paul|last2=Briggs|first2=Philip|title=Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QqsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203|year=2016|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-78477-016-7|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; More probably, the Zimbabwe birds represent sacred or totemic animals of the Shona – the bateleur eagle ([[Shona language|Shona]]: ''chapungu''), which was held to be a messenger from [[Mwari]] (God) and the ancestors, or the fish eagle (''hungwe'') which it has been suggested was the original totem of the Shona.&lt;ref name="Fontein2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fontein|first=Joost|title=The Silence of Great Zimbabwe: Contested Landscapes and the Power of Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ahJDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99|date= 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-41720-2|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial acquisition and return to Zimbabwe==
[[File:Soapstone birds on pedestals.jpg|right|thumb|Three of the Zimbabwe Birds, photographed around 1891]]
In 1889 a European hunter, Willi Posselt, travelled to Great Zimbabwe after hearing about it from another European explorer, Karl Mauch. He climbed to the highest point of the ruins despite being told that it was a sacred site where he should not trespass, and found the birds positioned in the centre of an enclosure around an apparent altar. He later wrote:

{{quote|Each one, including its plinth, had been hewn out of a solid block of stone and measured 4 feet 6 inches in height; and each was set firmly into the ground. There was also a stone shaped like a millstone and about 18 inches in diameter, with a number of figures carved in the border.

I selected the best specimen of the bird stones, the beaks of the remainder being damaged, and decided to dig it out. But while doing so, Andizibi [a local tribesman] and his followers became very excited and rushed around with their guns and [[assegai]]s. I fully expected them to attack us. However, I went on with my work but told Klass, who had loaded two rifles, to shoot the first man he saw aiming at either of us.&lt;ref name="Brown-Lowe2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown-Lowe|first=Robin|title=The Lost City of Solomon and Sheba: An African Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=acU7AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT20|year=2003|publisher=History Press|isbn=978-0-7524-9490-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Posselt compensated Andizibi with a payment of blankets and "some other articles". As the bird on its pedestal was too heavy for him to carry, he hacked it off and hid the pedestal with the intention of returning later to retrieve it.&lt;ref name="Brown-Lowe2003" /&gt; He subsequently sold his bird to [[Cecil Rhodes]], who mounted it in the library of his [[Cape Town]] house, [[Groote Schuur]], and decorated the house's stairway with wooden replicas. Rhodes also had stone replicas made, three times the size of the original, to decorate the gates of his house in England near [[Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Stocking1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuklick|first=Henrika|editor=Stocking, George W.|title=Colonial Situations: Essays on the Contextualization of Ethnographic Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBZ2euwwTGIC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1991|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13123-4|page=135|chapter= Contested Monuments: The Politics of Archeology in Southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German missionary came to own the pedestal of one bird, which he sold to the Ethnological Museum in Berlin in 1907.&lt;ref name="bird"/&gt; 

Rhodes' acquisition of Posselt's bird prompted him to commission an investigation of the Great Zimbabwe ruins by [[James Theodore Bent]], which took place in 1891 following the [[British South Africa Company]]'s invasion of Mashonaland.&lt;ref name="Lhote1963"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lhote|first=Henri|title=Vanished Civilizations of the Ancient World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IgkAQAAMAAJ|year=1963|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bent recorded that there were eight birds, six large and two small, and that there had probably originally been more as there were several additional stone pedestals of which the tops had been broken off.&lt;ref name="Bent1895"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bent|first=James Theodore|title=The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ct63nQEACAAJ|year=1895|publisher=Longmans &amp; Company|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonists erroneously attributed Great Zimbabwe to ancient Mediterranean builders, believing native Africans to be incapable of constructing such a complex structure; thus in Rhodes' mind, as a 1932 guidebook put it, it was "a favourite symbol of the link between the order civilisation derived from the North or the East and the savage barbarism of Southern and Central Africa before the advent of the European."&lt;ref name="Maylam2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maylam|first=Paul|title=The Cult of Rhodes: Remembering an Imperialist in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VbD_mokWhL8C&amp;pg=PT85|year=2005|publisher=New Africa Books|isbn=978-0-86486-684-4|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bent attributed the birds, wholly erroneously, to the [[Phoenicians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bent, p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, a year after the attainment of independence in Zimbabwe, the South African government returned four of the sculptures to the country in exchange for a world-renowned collection of [[hymenoptera]] (bees, wasps and ants) housed in Harare; the fifth remains at Groote Schuur.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016" /&gt; In 2003, the German museum returned its portion of the bird's pedestal to Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name="bird"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3028589.stm|title=Zimbabwe bird 'flies' home"|publisher=BBC News|date= 4 May 2003|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The birds were displayed for a while in the [[Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe|Natural History Museum]] in [[Bulawayo]] and the Museum of Human Sciences in Harare,&lt;ref name="MunyaradziHenry2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munyaradzi|first1=Mawere,|last2=Henry|first2=Chiwaura,|title=African Museums in the Making: Reflections on the Politics of Material and Public Culture in Zimbabwe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stS6CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA128|year=2015|publisher=Langaa RPCIG|isbn=978-9956-792-82-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now housed in a small museum on the Great Zimbabwe site.&lt;ref name="MurrayBriggs2016" /&gt;

==On flags, currency and stamps==
The Zimbabwe bird has been a symbol of Zimbabwe and its predecessor states since 1924. The crest of Southern Rhodesia's coat of arms incorporated the Zimbabwe bird, and over time the bird became a widespread symbol of the colony. The paper money and coins of the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], issued by the [[Bank of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]] also displayed the bird, as did the post-federation flag of Rhodesia. The flag and state symbols of modern Zimbabwe continue to feature the Zimbabwe bird.&lt;ref&gt;Kuklick, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;
