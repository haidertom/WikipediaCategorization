The '''Academy of Performing Arts''' is a theatre centre and a school of theatre and performance, operating since 2010 in Tel Aviv, in collaboration with the Open University of Israel.

==Faculty==
The Academy of Performing Arts was established in 2010 in Tel Aviv by a group of theatre practitioners, among them Professor [[Avraham Oz]]; Professor Ahuva Belkin; actress Sandra Sadeh; directors and actors [[Moni Moshonov]] and [[Oded Kotler]]; director Amit Gazit; and theatre designer and translator [[Tal Itzhaki]], who functions as the general director of the Academy since its establishment; Roni Pisker, actor, director and puppeteer, lighting designer Professor Ben-Tzion Munitz; and Dr [[Chen Alon]], director of community theatre. This nucleus of founders was later joined by many other members of faculty, among them actress and film director [[Michal Bat-Adam]]; director and musician Shosh Reisman; international opera singer Gabi Sadeh; dancer and choreographer Ran Ben-Dror; directors and mime artists Gnady Babitsky and Ophira Laniado; director Mouneer Bakri; Street theatre and performance creators Avi Gibson-Barel and Yinon Zafrir; playwrights Ala Hlehel, Dr Michael Morris-Reich and Gour Koren; Film directors Yankul Goldwasser and Kehat Finkel; directors and actors Amnon Meskin, Sharon Alexander, [[Muhammad Bakri]], Shalom Shmuelov, Dor Peles, Gita Munte and Tahel Ran; actresses Keren Tsur and Ahuva Keren.
Actor and director [[Juliano Mer-Khamis]], the founder of [[the Freedom Theatre]] at the [[Jenin]] refugee camp, was a member of faculty until his assassination on April 4, 2011. The Academy Theatre commemorates him by the "Annual Juliano Mer-Khamis Production."

==Notable alumni==

==Program of studies==
The Academy's curriculum is not unified, and does not operate according to built-in program. Each student selects her/his personal curriculum, consulted by the faculty, reflecting one's proclivities and abilities. The Academy's program is varied in acting and performance methods and styles, attempting to expose the students to a large variety of approaches to theatre and film performance and become, as much as possible, a multi-styled creators and performers. Thus many of the Academy's classes aim both as training workshops as well as performance targeted, leading to a final project finally performed in front of internal or external audience. 
In addition to the regular curriculum, the Academy operates the Academy Theatre which regularly mounts productions of professional standards, involving professional actors, some of whom are the Academy graduates and others graduates of other schools. The Academy also holds public discussions and lectures on cultural and artistic matters, and the Academy bar hosts musical programs and small scale shows. Assembled from donations from various sources, the Academy has one of the largest theatre and culture library in Tel Aviv, and in 2015 the Gideon Tamir reading corner was inaugurated, for the use of students, faculty and the general public.

==Academic degree==
The Academy of Performing Arts, Tel Aviv is not recognized as a higher education institution conferring degrees, yet it collaborates with the Israeli Open University of which it is an official study centre (no. 698). Each semester, according to demand, several classes of the Open University are given, tutored by the faculty of the Open University. Students who graduated from the Academy of Performing Arts, provided they have completed the full curriculum of the Academy, are entitled to apply for recognition of several credits from the studies towards a bachelor's degree. The recommended regular  curriculum of each of the Academy's six semesters consists of at least 20 weekly hours of the Academy classes, plus optional 2 classes from the studies of the open University, all to be selected from the choice of classes offered that semester. 
In addition to the three years full program of studies, the Academy holds shorter programs designed to enable completion of studies for students who studied partial studies at other recognized schools of drama, while recognizing the classes studied in the former frameworks as parts of them full program. Also, the Academy holds on demand basic preparatory programs for students who would like to be admitted later for full programs of studies, whether in the Academy itself or elsewhere.

==Alpha 13 Festival==

As of summer 2017 the Academy theatre has launched the Alpha 13 annual festival, to be held every year celebrating the end of the summer, including a prize competition of stage performances, house and guest productions, as well as music and film events. The 2017 festival consisted of 5 competition shows (selected by an artistic committee from about 30 applying groups and artists), 4 house productions, 7 guest shows and 4 special events of music and film. Most of these shows and events first opened in the festival, and others had their Tel Aviv debut during the four weeks of the festival. The festival major theme was "languages": a frivolous, festive and undisciplined variety of semantic languages (Hebrew, Arabic, Amharic and English), of performance styles, and of artistic genres.

==Theatre productions==
Over the years the repertory of the Academy theatre consisted of a variety of shows, covering various areas of theatre and performance. Some of the most successful shows were ''Split Screen'', a combined intertwined dramatization of short stories by Israeli poet Dalia Rabikowitz and Egyptian novelist [[Naguib Mahfouz]]; [[Commedia dell'Arte]] adaptations of [[Carlo Goldoni]]'s ''Military Lover'' and Leon Katz' ''The Three Cuckolds'';  ''Krum''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqKqxBsxuc4 (Excerpts)] and ''Heffets'' by [[Hanoch Levin]]; [[Federico García Lorca]]'s ''[[The House of Bernarda Alba]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFbsGCxlYUc (Excerpts)]; [[Arthur Miller]]'s ''The Crucible''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7wzoZx0pmw (Excerpts)]; [[Sarah Daniels]]' ''Neaptide''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAV1eri-bgw (Excerpts)] ''Woyzeck'' by [[Büchner]]; [[Harold Pinter]]'s ''[[Ashes to Ashes (play)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' and ''[[Mountain Language]]''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mUFhoyC6i0 (Excerpts)]; ''Good'' by C. P. Taylor [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UX8VUhowpeY (Who by Fire by Leonard Cohen, Hebrew lyrics by Avraham Oz, musical arrangement by Yuval Messner, from the production of ''Good'' at the Academy Theatre)]; Shakespeare's ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUR2FLbMYgU (Jessica's departure, to the lyrics of Serge Reggiani's Ma fille)]; Pam Gems' ''Dusa, Fish, Vy, Stas'' (in Arabic); ''Back River'' by Rachel Shalita; ''[[The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds]]'' by [[Paul Zindel]], [[Jonathan Harvey (playwright)|Jonathan Harvey]]'s ''[[Beautiful Thing (play)|Beautiful Thing]]'', and many others, as well as "playlects" ("play cum lecture"), such as Avraham Oz and his players performing and discussing love, courtship and marriage in Shakespeare [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NMF4K1M0Yc (Oz and players in Shakespeare playlect)].

In [[mathematical optimization]], the '''Ackley function''' is a non-[[convex function]] used as a performance test problem for [[optimization algorithm]]s. It was proposed by David Ackley in his 1987 PhD Dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;Ackley, D. H. (1987) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=sx_VBwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Ackley%20function%22&amp;f=false A connectionist machine for genetic hillclimbing]", Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a 2-dimensional domain it is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x,y) = -20&amp;\exp\left[-0.2\sqrt{0.5\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\right)}\right] \\
&amp; {} -\exp\left[0.5\left(\cos 2\pi x + \cos 2\pi y \right)\right] + e + 20
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Its global optimum point is:  
:&lt;math&gt;f(0,0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2196">An '''adaptation''' is a transfer of a work of art from one medium to another.

Some common examples are:
* [[Film adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[film]] (it may be a novel, non-fiction like journalism, autobiography, comic books, scriptures, plays or historical sources)
* [[Literary adaptation]], a story from a literary source, adapted into another work{{cn|date=March 2018}}
* [[Theatrical adaptation]], a story from another work, adapted into a [[play (theatre)|play]]

There is, however, no end to potential media involved in adaptation. Adaptation is the practice of transcoding (changing the code or 'language' used in a medium) as well as the assimilation of a work of art to other cultural, linguistic, semiotic, aesthetic or other norms. Recent approaches to the expanding field Adaptation Studies reflect these expansion of our perspective. Adaptation occurs as a special case of intertextual and intermedial exchange and the copy-paste culture of digital technologies has produced "new intertextual forms engendered by emerging technologies—mashups, remixes, reboots, samplings, remodelings, transformations— " that "further develop the impulse to adapt and appropriate, and the ways in which they challenge the theory and practice of adaptation and appropriation."&lt;ref&gt;Voigts, Eckart. "Memes and Recombinant Appropriation: Remix, Mashup, Parody" in Thomas Leitch (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Adaptation Studies.'' Oxford: OUP, 2017. http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199331000.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199331000-e-16&lt;/ref&gt;

Transfer of the image often involves a photographic process.

Historically, some types of artworks were prepared on clear polyester [[drafting film]] or similar media for strength, durability and dimensional stability.&lt;ref&gt;American Society of Mechanical Engineers, 2008, "Undimensioned Drawings", [[ASME Y14.31-2008]], ¶4, "Drawings that require strength, durability, and dimensional stability shall be prepared on Class 1 polyester film..."&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern artwork may be stored electronically, such as those created in [[Adobe Illustrator Artwork|Adobe Illustrator file format (.ai)]].

A '''basing diagram''' shows or describes the “pins” of an [[electronic component]]. This part usually has more than two pins, so a basing diagram is needed to show which pin does what. Many basing diagrams also show [[dimension]]s.

'''Besharmi Morcha''', also known as "Slutwalk arthaat Besharmi Morcha", is the Indian equivalent of [[SlutWalk]]. This was an organization started in 2011 by Canadian women who protested Toronto's police public statements suggesting that women could avoid rape and sexual assault by the way they dressed.&lt;ref name="Sarah Bell uk-13739876"&gt;{{cite news| last=   Bell| first=  Sarah| url=  https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13739876| title=  Slutwalk London: 'Yes means yes and no means no'| work=  [[BBC News]]| date=  June 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SlutWalk homepage"&gt;{{cite web| url=  http://www.slutwalktoronto.com/| title=  homepage| publisher=  SlutWalk Toronto| accessdate = May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have conducted events across the world for education about this issue.

==Translation==

Besharmi Morcha ({{lang-hi|बेशर्मी मोर्चा}}) is most often translated into English as "shameless protest" or "shameless front". It has also been translated as “March of the Shameless”&lt;ref name="Reuters001"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/31/idINIndia-58547420110731 |title=Hundreds protest rape in conservative India’s toned down "SlutWalk" |work=Reuters India |date=31 July 2011 |agency=TrustLaw – Thomson Reuters Foundation |author=Bhalla, Nita |location=Delhi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F8MBUbf?url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/31/idINIndia-58547420110731 |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Shameless Campaign".&lt;ref name="SouthAsiaDaily001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2011/07/the-not-at-all-slutty-slut-walk-of-bhopal.html |title=The not-at-all slutty Slut Walk of Bhopal |publisher=[[Mayank Chhaya]] |work=Blog: South Asia Daily |date=21 July 2011 |author=Chhaya, Mayank |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68GrcXhWq?url=http://southasia.typepad.com/south_asia_daily/2011/07/the-not-at-all-slutty-slut-walk-of-bhopal.html |archivedate=8 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besharmi Morcha was chosen as the name in India to address its diverse cultural aspects and languages.&lt;ref name="NameChange001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rememberoursisterseverywhere.com/events/slutwalk-new-delhi |title=Besharmi Morcha, "Shameless Protest" |publisher=rememberoursisterseverywhere.com |date=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F9NV5vc?url=http://www.rememberoursisterseverywhere.com/events/slutwalk-new-delhi |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NameChange002"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.oneindia.in/2011/06/18/no-slutwalk-in-delhi-as-besharmi-morcha-takes-over-aid0120.html | title=No 'SlutWalk' in Delhi as 'Besharmi Morcha' takes over | work=OneIndia News | agency=Greynium Information Technologies Pvt.

The word "[[slut]]" does not translate directly or equivalently into Indian languages such as Hindi. The nearest equivalent direct translation of slut is ''ranɖii'' ({{lang-hi|रंडी}})&lt;ref name="RandiTrans"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%80 |title=Hindi-English translation for "रंडी" |publisher=bab.la |work=bab.la Dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Dld0hS8?url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%80 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "prostitute".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/world/asia/15iht-letter15.html?_r=1 |title=Ready or Not, New Delhi Gets a Women’s Street Protest |work=New York Times |date=14 June 2011 |agency=The New York Times Company |author=NILANJANA S.

Besharmi ({{lang-hi|बेशर्मी}}) translates as shamelessly, brazenly and even boldly. It may imply a quality of obscenity or obscenely.&lt;ref name="BesharmiTrans001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/shabdkosh.php?word=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%80 |title=Get Meaning of besharmi in English. बेशर्मी का मतलब अंग्रेजी में जानिए |publisher=HinKhoj InfoLabs LLP |work=hinkhoj.com Hindi to English dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DpH6jjP?url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/shabdkosh.php?word=%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%80 |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morcha ({{lang-hi|मोर्चा}}) is closely linked to the idea of protest and action. It often indicates political protest and has military overtones.&lt;ref name="MorchaDictionary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE-in-english.html |title=Get Meaning of morcha in English. मोर्चा का मतलब अंग्रेजी में जानिए |publisher=HinKhoj InfoLabs LLP |work=hinkhoj.com Hindi to English dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DkyWkx2?url=http://dict.hinkhoj.com/words/meaning-of-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE-in-english.html |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorchaDictionary2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE |title=Hindi-English translation for "मोर्चा" |publisher=bab.la |work=bab.la Dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Dm01u3N?url=http://en.bab.la/dictionary/hindi-english/%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE |archivedate=6 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besharmi Morcha has multiple meanings that are not readily translated into English. It is generally summed up as meaning "shamelessly and boldly protesting in a united way that others may see as wrong or even obscene".

Observed bursts are named by the number of discrete action potentials they are composed of: a ''doublet'' is a two-spike burst, a ''triplet'' three and a ''quadruplet'' four. Neurons that are intrinsically prone to bursting behavior are referred to as ''bursters'' and this tendency to burst may be a product of the environment or the [[phenotype]] of the cell.

==Physiological context==

===Overview===
Neurons typically operate by firing single [[action potential]] spikes in relative isolation as discrete input [[postsynaptic potential]]s combine and drive the [[membrane potential]] across the [[threshold potential|threshold]]. Bursting can instead occur for many reasons, but neurons can be generally grouped as exhibiting ''input-driven'' or ''intrinsic'' bursting. Most cells will exhibit bursting if they are driven by a constant, subthreshold input&lt;ref name='nesb'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1142/S0218127400000840|title=Neural excitability, spiking and bursting|journal=International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos|date=2000-01-01|first=Eugene|last=Izhikevich|volume=10|issue=6|pages=1171–1266|id= |url=ftp://ftp-sop.inria.fr/odyssee/Team/Olivier.Faugeras/ArticlesCoursENS-MVA/izhikevich-nesb.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2009-11-30 |bibcode = 2000IJBC...10.1171I }}&lt;/ref&gt; and particular cells which are genotypically prone to bursting (called ''bursters'') have complex feedback systems which will produce bursting patterns with less dependence on input and sometimes even in isolation.&lt;ref name="jeffreys1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

In each case, the physiological system is often {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} thought as being the action of two linked subsystems. The ''fast subsystem'' is responsible for each spike the neuron produces.  The ''slow subsystem'' modulates the shape and intensity of these spikes before eventually triggering quiescence.

Input-driven bursting often {{citation needed|date=February 2014}} [[Neural coding|encodes]] the intensity of input into the bursting frequency&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; where a neuron then acts as an [[integrator]]. Intrinsic bursting is a more specialized phenomenon and is believed {{by whom|date=February 2014}} to play a much more diverse role in [[neural computation]]. {{clarify|date=February 2014}}

Bursts differ from [[tonic (physiology)|tonic]] firing, rapid spiking at similar rates to bursting but continuing for long periods of time, in that bursting involves a physiological "slow subsystem" that eventually depletes as the bursting continues and then must be replenished before the cell can burst again (compare ''[[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]]'').&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; During the bursting event, this slow subsystem modulates the timing and intensity of the emitted spikes and is thought {{by whom|date=February 2014}} to be important in the computational aspects {{clarify|date=February 2014}} of the resulting burst pattern. There are many discovered mechanisms of slow subsystems including voltage-&lt;ref name='prebot1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Models of Respiratory Rhythm Generation in the Pre-Botzinger Complex. I.

The slow subsystem also is connected to [[endogenous]] bursting patterns in neurons, where the pattern can be maintained completely by internal mechanism without any [[synapse|synaptic]] input. This process also relies on [[calcium channel]]s, which [[Depolarization|depolarize]] the neuron by allowing an influx of calcium [[ion]]s. So long as internal calcium ion concentrations remain at an elevated level, the neuron will continue to undergo periods of rapid spiking. However, elevated calcium ion levels also trigger a [[Second messenger system|second messenger cascade]] within the cell which lower calcium influx and promote calcium efflux and [[buffer solution|buffering]]. As calcium concentrations decline, the period of rapid bursting ceases, and the phase of quiescence begins. When calcium levels are low, the original calcium channels will reopen, restarting the process and creating a bursting pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bryne|first=John|title=Feedback/recurrent inhibition in nanocircuits|url=http://neuroscience.uth.tmc.edu/s1/introduction.html|work=Neuroscience Online|publisher=University of Texas Health Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistical detection==
In isolation or in mathematical models bursting can be recognized since the environment and state of the neuron can be carefully observed and modulated. When observing neurons in the wild, however, bursting may be difficult to distinguish from normal firing patterns. In order to recognize bursting patterns in these contexts statistical methods are used to determine threshold parameters.

Bursting is characterized by a [[coefficient of variation]] (CV) of the interspike intervals (ISI) that is larger than one, or a [[Fano factor]] of the spike count that is larger than one, because bursting leads to spike patterns that are more irregular than a [[Poisson process]] (which has a CV and Fano factor equal to unity). Alternatively, the [[Serial correlation|serial correlation coefficient]] of the ISI sequence is positive for bursting patterns, because in this case short ISIs tend to be followed by more short ISIs (at least if the bursts consist of more than two spikes).

==Mathematical models==
Neuron behavior is often modeled as single-compartment, non-linear [[dynamical systems]], where the neuron states represent physiological quantities such as membrane voltage, current flow, and the concentrations of various ions intra- and extracellularly. These models most generally take the singularly [[perturbation theory|perturbed]] form

: ''fast subsystem'': &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = f(x, u)&lt;/math&gt;
: ''slow subsystem'': &lt;math&gt;\dot{u} = \mu g(x, u)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are both [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|Hodgkin–Huxley]] style relations, &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector representing the cell parameters relevant to the fast subsystem, &lt;math&gt;\dot{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a vector representing the parameters of the slow modulation subsystem, and &lt;math&gt;\mu \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of the time scales between the fast and slow subsystems.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

Models of neuron dynamics generally exhibit a number of stable and unstable [[attractor]]s in [[phase space]] which represent resting states. When the system is sufficiently perturbed by input stimuli it may follow a complex return path back to the [[stable attractor]] representing an action potential. In bursting neurons, these dynamic spaces [[bifurcation theory|bifurcate]] between quiescent and bursting modes according to the dynamics of the slow system. These two bifurcations may take many forms and the choice of bifurcation both from quiescent to bursting and bursting to quiescent can affect the behavioral aspects of the burster.

The complete classification of quiescent-to-bursting and bursting-to-quiescent bifurcations leads to 16 common forms and 120 possible forms if the dimensionality of the fast subsystem is not constrained.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; Of the most common 16, a few are well studied.

===Square-wave burster===
The '''fold/homoclinic''', also called square-wave, burster is so named because the shape of the voltage trace during a burst looks similar to a square wave due to fast transitions between the resting state attractor and the spiking limit cycle.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;

==Purposes==
Bursting is a very general phenomenon and is observed in many contexts in many neural systems. For this reason it is difficult to find a specific meaning or purpose for bursting and instead it plays many roles. In any given circuit observed bursts may play a part in any or all of the following mechanisms and may have a still more sophisticated impact on the network.

===Multiplexing and routing===
Some neurons, sometimes called ''resonators'', exhibit sensitivity for specific input frequencies and fire either more quickly or exclusively when stimulated at that frequency. Intrinsically bursting neurons can use this [[band-pass filter]]ing effect in order to encode for specific destination neurons and [[multiplexing|multiplex]] signals along a single [[axon]].&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt; More generally, due to short-term synaptic depression and [[Neural facilitation|facilitation]] specific synapses can be resonant for certain frequencies and thus become viable specific targets for bursting cells.&lt;ref name='izhikevich2003'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0166-2236(03)00034-1|title=Bursts as a unit of neural information: selective communication via resonance|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2003|first=Eugene|last=Izhikevich|author2=N Desai |author3=E Walcott |pmid=12591219|volume=26|issue=3|pages=161–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synchronization===
Burst synchronization refers to the alignment of bursting and quiescent periods in interconnected neurons. In general, if a network of bursting neurons is linked it will eventually synchronize for most types of bursting.&lt;ref name="nesb" /&gt;&lt;ref name='rulkov2001'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Regularization of synchronized chaotic bursts|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=March 2001|first=NF|last=Rulkov|volume=86|issue=1|pages=2194|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.183|pmid=11136124|bibcode=2001PhRvL..86..183R|arxiv = nlin/0011028 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='belykh2005'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synchronization of bursting neurons: what matters in the network topology|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2005|first=I|last=Belykh|author2=E de Lange |author3=M Hasler |volume=94|issue=18|pages=2181|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.94.188101|bibcode=2005PhRvL..94r8101B|pmid=15904412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronization can also appear in circuits containing no intrinsically bursting neurons, however its appearance and stability can often be improved by including intrinsically bursting cells in the network.&lt;ref name="prebot2" /&gt; Since synchronization is related to [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] and [[memory]] via [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian plasticity]] and [[long-term potentiation]] the interplay with plasticity and intrinsic bursting is very important{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}.

===Information content and channel robustness===
Due to the all-or-nothing nature of action potentials, single spikes can only encode [[Information theory|information]] in their interspike intervals (ISI). This is an inherently low fidelity method of transferring information as it depends on very accurate timing and is sensitive to noisy loss of signal: if just a single spike is mistimed or not properly received at the synapse it leads to a possibly unrecoverable loss in coding{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Since intrinsic bursts are thought to be derived by a computational mechanism in the slow subsystem, each can represent a much larger amount of information in the specific shape of a single burst leading to far more robust transmission. Physiological models show that for a given input the interspike and interburst timings are much more variable than the timing of the burst shape itself&lt;ref name="kepecs2003" /&gt; which also implies that timing between events is a less robust way to encode information.

The expanded alphabet for communication enabled by considering burst patterns as discrete signals allows for a greater [[channel capacity]] in neuronal communications and provides a popular connection between [[neural coding]] and [[information theory]].

==Example bursting neuron circuits==

===Hippocampus===
The [[subiculum]], a component of the [[hippocampal formation]], is thought to perform relaying of signals originating in the hippocampus to many other parts of the brain.&lt;ref name='swanson1977'&gt;{{cite journal|title=An autoradiographic study of the organization of the efferent connections of the hippocampal formation in the rat|journal=Journal of Computational Neurology|date=1977-03-01|first=LW|last=Swanson|author2=WM Cowan|volume=172|issue=1|pages=49–84|pmid=65364 |url=|format=|doi=10.1002/cne.901720104 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2009-11-30--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In order to perform this function, it uses intrinsically bursting neurons to convert promising single stimuli into longer lasting burst patterns as a way to better focus attention on new stimuli and activate important processing circuits.&lt;ref name='cooper2002'/&gt;&lt;ref name='swadlow2002'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Activation of a cortical column by a thalamocortical impulse|journal=Journal of Neuroscience|date=2002-01-01|first=H|last=Swadlow|author2=A Gusev |author3=T Bezdudnaya |pmid=12196600|volume=22|issue=17|pages=7766–7773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once these circuits have been activated, the subicular signal reverts to a single spiking mode.&lt;ref name='cooper2005'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Output-mode transitions are controlled by prolonged inactivation of sodium channels in pyramidal neurons of subiculum|journal=PLOS Biology|date=June 2005|first=DC|last=Cooper|author2=S Chung |author3=N Spruston |volume=3|issue=6|pages=1123|pmid=15857153|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030175|pmc=1088280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===pre-Bötzinger complex===
The [[Pre-Botzinger complex|pre-Bötzinger complex]] (preBötC) is located in  ventrolateral [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]] and is proposed to generate the rhythm underlying inspiratory efforts in mammals. Since the frequency that the lungs need to operate at can vary according to metabolic demand, preBötC activity is modulated over a wide range of frequencies and is able to entrain the respiratory system to meet metabolic demand. While pacemaker neurons do not necessarily require intrinsically bursting neurons&lt;ref name="rulkov2001" /&gt; the preBötC contains a heterogeneous population of both regular spiking and intrinsically bursting neurons. Intrinsically bursting neurons are thought to make the preBötC oscillations more robust to changing frequencies and the regularity of inspiratory efforts.&lt;ref name='prebot2'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Models of respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Botzinger complex.

===Cerebellar cortex===
[[Cerebellum|Cerebellar]] [[Purkinje cell|Purkinje neurons]] have been proposed to have two distinct bursting modes: [[Dendrite|dendritically]] driven, by dendritic [[Calcium channel|{{chem|Ca|2+}} spikes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Forrest MD, Wall MJ, Press DA, Feng J |title=The Sodium-Potassium Pump Controls the Intrinsic Firing of the Cerebellar Purkinje Neuron |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e51169 |date=December 2012 |pmid=23284664 |pmc=3527461 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0051169 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0051169|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...751169F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Perikaryon|somatically]] driven, wherein the persistent [[Sodium channel|{{chem|Na|+}} current]] is the burst initiator and the [[Calcium-activated potassium channel|SK {{chem|K|+}} current]] is the burst terminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Forrest MD |title=Mathematical Model of Bursting in Dissociated Purkinje Neurons |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=e68765 |date=August 2013 |url=http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0068765 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0068765|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...868765F |pmid=23967054 |pmc=3742666}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purkinje neurons may utilise these bursting forms in information coding to the [[deep cerebellar nuclei]].

In '''computing with words and perceptions (CWP)''', the [[object (computer science)|objects of computation]] are [[words]], [[perception]]s, and [[proposition]]s drawn from a [[natural language]].  The central theme of CWP is the concept of a [[Constraint (mathematics)|generalised constraint]].  The meaning of a proposition is expressed as a generalised constraint.

CWP is a necessary tool when the available information is perception-based or not precise enough to use numbers.

'''Contemporary archaeology''' is a field of archaeological research that focuses on the most recent (20th and 21st century) past, and also increasingly explores the application of archaeological thinking to the contemporary world. It has also been referred to as the archaeology of the 'contemporary past'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchli |first=Victor |first2=Gavin |last2=Lucas |title=Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=4 January 2002 |pages=208 |isbn=9781134571383 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=xK-BAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |jstor=3527092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this term in the United Kingdom is particularly associated with the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory (CHAT) conference group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chat-arch.org |title=CHAT ACT: Agency, Action and Advocacy Moesgaard Museum, Aarhus University, Denmark Friday 26 – Sunday 28 October 2018 |work=Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field forms part of [[historical archaeology]], or the archaeology of the modern period. Unlike [[ethnoarchaeology]], contemporary archaeology studies the recent and contemporary past in its own right, rather than to develop models that can inform the study of the more distant past.

Often informed by anthropological [[material culture studies]], but characterised by putting traditional archaeological methods and practices to new uses, research in this field generally aims to make an archaeological contribution to broader social scientific studies of the contemporary world, focusing especially upon contributing methods of studying material things (objects, landscapes, buildings, material heritage, etc.) to sociological, geographical and political studies of the modern world. The field has developed especially in heritage management, for example through [[English Heritage]]'s "Change and Creation" programme on the landscapes of the later 20th century &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schofield |first=J. |title=The Archaeology of the 20th Century |url=http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230416/http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Contemporary Archaeology aims to explore the characteristics of diverse and rapid change across micro and macro scales by using a range of conventional and experimental [[Archaeology]] investigative techniques. Like all archaeological scholarship and practice, Contemporary Archaeology uses both [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] approaches, which can include archaeological modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=David L. |author-link=David L.

"Quentin Lewis recognized, contemporary archaeology has a firmer footing in the UK and Europe than it does in North America, or at least it is not an especially recognizable scholarly niche quite yet in the US.  The work of scholars in the UK and Europe has turned to some materiality that is admittedly distinctive if not unique, such as the extensive scholarship of the landscapes of 20th century warfare (for instance, English Heritage’s ambitious Cold War Monuments project, Gabriel Moshenska’s work on British air raid shelters and children’s homefront experiences of World War II, Heinrich Natho’s study of Norwegian World War II coastal defenses, and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal’s analysis of Spanish Civil War Monuments); Laura McAtackney’s work on “peace walls” in northern Ireland; Anna Badcock and Robert Johnston’s study of protest camp sites in Derbyshire; and contemporary graffiti (John Schofield has cleverly captivated many journalists and questioned what archaeologists value with his assessment of Sex Pistols graffiti).  Yet for all these distinctive dimensions of British and European heritage we could certainly point to just as many equally interesting material experiences in every corner of North America.  Some of the visibility of contemporary archaeology is inevitably linked to a British and European willingness to conduct material analysis that does not require excavation.  Outside North America a vast number of scholars call themselves archaeologists while studying space, the built environment, and a broad range of material things without necessarily wielding a trowel.  In the US historical archaeology has fashioned a particularly productive niche by focusing on field excavation and everyday materiality, and much of our training is devoted to field methods and analysis of a distinctive range of commodities like ceramics, glass, and faunal remains that are routinely recovered from excavation contexts on nearly any historic period site" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/tag/contemporary-archaeology/ |title=Contemporary Archaeology |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[The Society for Historical Archaeology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a history reaching back as far, at least, as William Rathje's "garbology" project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html |title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage |date=26 January 1976 |access-date=13 November 2018 |magazine=[[TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Archaeology remains a new sub-discipline within the university. In remaining focused on archaeology's ability to tell stories that reach beyond official or formal discourse, Contemporary Archaeology has the potential to offer significant political critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Borderline Archaeology: a practise of contemporary archaeology - exploring aspects of creative narratives and performance cultural production |last=Campbell |first=Fiona |last2=Ulin |first2=Jonna |date=11 June 2004 |publisher=[[Göteborgs universitet]] |isbn=91-85245-01-1 |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/16211/5/gupea_2077_16211_5.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Control System Integrators Association''', or CSIA, is a global, [[not-for-profit]], professional trade association for control [[systems integrator]] companies. Founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Eric|title=CSIA Certification Whitepaper|url=http://www.dmcinfo.com/Portals/0/White%20Papers/CSIA-Certification-Whitepaper-v2.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its activities include certification, annual conferences, industry-specific [[business insurance]], and an industry [[best practices]] manual.

CSIA is the largest organization in North America for independent control system integrators, and represents member firms that provide more than $1 billion annually in industrial automation systems. They have over 500 members as of 3/21/2017, which are listed in their online directory of control systems integrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csiaexchange.com/|title=CSIA Industrial Automation Exchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seneka Starszy Sevilla cropped.JPG|thumb|right|[[Seneca the Elder]] compiled a study of the classic themes in his ten volumes of ''Controversiæ''.]]
A '''''controversia''''' is an exercise in [[rhetoric]]; a form of [[declamation]] in which the student speaks for one side in a notional legal case such as treason or poisoning.  The facts of the matter and relevant law are presented in a persuasive manner, in the style of a legal counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |pages=500–501 |title=Handbook of Literary Rhetoric |author=Heinrich Lausberg, translated by David E. Orton |publisher=BRILL |year=1998 |isbn=9789004107052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The exercise was used in [[ancient Rome]], where it was, with the ''[[suasoria]]'', the final stage of a course in rhetoric at an [[academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Declamation and contestation in satire |author=Susanna Morton Braund |page=148 |title = Roman Eloquence: Rhetoric in Society and Literature |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=9780415125444}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''controversia'' is distinguished from this rhetorical practice because of the complexity of its structural system of argument and the greater range of situations and characters employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric, Volume 1|last=Sloane|first=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=9780195125955|location=Oxford|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction can also be explained in the way students who focused on this exercise end up as forensic [[Public speaking|orators]] while those who trained in ''suasoria'' followed a career in [[deliberative rhetoric]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philo and Paul Among the Sophists|last=Winter|first=Bruce|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1997|isbn=0521591082|location=Cambridge|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Seneca the Elder]] was an expert rhetorician and, from memory, compiled a set of classical themes for this exercise: the ''Controversiæ''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=276 |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome|volume=1 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2010 |isbn=9780195170726}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Controversia'' is demonstrated in the case of [[Quintilian|Quintillian]]'s ''Declamationes Minores'' where ''suasoria'' was turned into this exercise by using a courtroom as a setting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Roman Rhetoric|last=Dominik|first=William|last2=Hall|first2=Jon|publisher=John Wiley &amp; sons|year=2010|isbn=9781405120913|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot addressed the issue of a son who married the daughter of his father's enemy so he could use the [[dowry]] to ransom his who was captured by pirates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8235">'''Cytotoxicity''' is the quality of being [[toxicity|toxic]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s. Examples of toxic agents are an [[immune cell]] or some types of [[venom]], e.g. from the [[Bitis arietans|puff adder]] (''Bitis arietans'') or [[brown recluse spider]] (''Loxosceles reclusa'').

==Cell physiology==
Treating cells with the cytotoxic compound can result in a variety of cell fates. The cells may undergo [[necrosis]], in which they lose membrane integrity and die rapidly as a result of [[cell lysis]]. The cells can stop actively growing and dividing (a decrease in cell viability), or the cells can activate a genetic program of controlled cell death ([[apoptosis]]).

Cells undergoing necrosis typically exhibit rapid swelling, lose membrane integrity, shut down metabolism and release their contents into the environment. Cells that undergo rapid necrosis in vitro do not have sufficient time or energy to activate apoptotic machinery and will not express apoptotic markers. Apoptosis is characterized by well defined cytological and molecular events including a change in the [[refractive index]] of the cell, cytoplasmic shrinkage, nuclear condensation and cleavage of DNA into regularly sized fragments. Cells in culture that are undergoing apoptosis eventually undergo secondary necrosis. They will shut down metabolism, lose membrane integrity and lyse.&lt;ref name=riss1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riss TL, Moravec RA |title=Use of multiple assay endpoints to investigate the effects of incubation time, dose of toxin, and plating density in cell-based cytotoxicity assays |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=51–62 |date=February 2004 |pmid=15090210 |doi=10.1089/154065804322966315 |url=|last2=Moravec }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==

Cytotoxicity assays are widely used by the pharmaceutical industry to screen for cytotoxicity in compound libraries. Researchers can either look for cytotoxic compounds, if they are interested in developing a therapeutic that targets rapidly dividing cancer cells, for instance; or they can screen "hits" from initial high-throughput drug screens for unwanted cytotoxic effects before investing in their development as a pharmaceutical.

Assessing cell membrane integrity is one of the most common ways to measure cell viability and cytotoxic effects. Compounds that have cytotoxic effects often compromise cell membrane integrity. Vital dyes, such as [[trypan blue]] or [[propidium iodide]] are normally excluded from the inside of healthy cells; however, if the cell membrane has been compromised, they freely cross the membrane and stain intracellular components.&lt;ref name="riss1"/&gt; Alternatively, membrane integrity can be assessed by monitoring the passage of substances that are normally sequestered inside cells to the outside. One molecule, [[lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH), is commonly measured using [[LDH assay]]. LDH reduces NAD to NADH which elicits a colour change by interaction with a specific probe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Decker T, Lohmann-Matthes ML |title=A quick and simple method for the quantitation of lactate dehydrogenase release in measurements of cellular cytotoxicity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) activity |journal=J. Immunol. Methods |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=61–9 |date=November 1988 |pmid=3192948 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1759(88)90310-9|url=|last2=Lohmann-Matthes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protease biomarkers have been identified that allow researchers to measure relative numbers of live and dead cells within the same cell population. The live-cell protease is only active in cells that have a healthy cell membrane, and loses activity once the cell is compromised and the protease is exposed to the external environment. The dead-cell protease cannot cross the cell membrane, and can only be measured in culture media after cells have lost their membrane integrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Niles AL, Moravec RA, Eric Hesselberth P, Scurria MA, Daily WJ, Riss TL  |title=A homogeneous assay to measure live and dead cells in the same sample by detecting different protease markers |journal=Anal. Biochem. |volume=366 |issue=2 |pages=197–206 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17512890 |doi=10.1016/j.ab.2007.04.007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be monitored using the 3-(4, 5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide ([[MTT assay|MTT]]) or with 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), which yields a water-soluble product, or the MTS assay. This assay measures the reducing potential of the cell using a colorimetric reaction. Viable cells will reduce the MTS reagent to a colored [[formazan]] product. A similar redox-based assay has also been developed using the fluorescent dye, [[resazurin]]. In addition to using dyes to indicate the redox potential of cells in order to monitor their viability, researchers have developed assays that use [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] content as a marker of viability.&lt;ref name=riss1/&gt; Such ATP-based assays include bioluminescent assays in which ATP is the limiting reagent for the [[luciferase]] reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fan F, Wood KV |title=Bioluminescent assays for high-throughput screening |journal=Assay Drug Dev Technol |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=127–36 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17355205 |doi=10.1089/adt.2006.053 |url=|last2=Wood }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytotoxicity can also be measured by the [[sulforhodamine B]] (SRB) assay, WST assay and [[clonogenic assay]].

Suitable assays can be combined and performed sequentially on the same cells in order to reduce assay-specific false positive or false negative results. A possible combination is LDH-XTT-NR (Neutral red assay)-SRB  which is also available in a kit format.

A label-free approach to follow the cytotoxic response of adherent animal cells in real-time is based on electric impedance measurements when the cells are grown on gold-film electrodes. This technology is referred to as [[electric cell-substrate impedance sensing]] (ECIS). Label-free real-time techniques provide the kinetics of the cytotoxic response rather than just a snapshot like many colorimetric endpoint assays.

==Prediction==
A highly important topic is the prediction of cytotoxicity of chemical compounds based on 
previous measurements, i.e. in-silico testing.&lt;ref name="Reisfeld2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 13677480| year = 2003| author1 = Dearden| first1 = J. C.| title = In silico prediction of drug toxicity| journal = Journal of computer-aided molecular design| volume = 17| issue = 2–4| pages = 119–27| doi=10.1023/A:1025361621494}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For this purpose many
[[QSAR]] and [[virtual screening]] methods have been suggested. An independent comparison
of these methods has been done within the "Toxicology in the 21st century" project.&lt;ref name="TOX21"&gt;"Toxicology in the 21st century Data Challenge" https://tripod.nih.gov/tox21/challenge/leaderboard.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==In cancer==
[[Chemotherapy]] as a treatment of [[cancer]] often relies on the ability of cytotoxic agents to kill or damage cells which are reproducing; this preferentially targets rapidly dividing cancer cells.&lt;ref&gt;Ramin Zibaseresht, Photoactivated Cytotoxins, University of Canterbury, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemotherapy Principles|url=http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/cid/documents/webcontent/002995-pdf.pdf|publisher=American Cancer Society|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immune system==

''[[Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity]]'' (''ADCC'') describes the cell-killing ability of certain [[lymphocyte]]s, which requires the target cell being marked by an [[antibody]]. ''Lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity'', on the other hand, does not have to be mediated by antibodies; nor does ''[[complement-dependent cytotoxicity]]'' (''CDC''), which is mediated by the [[complement system]].

Three groups of cytotoxic [[lymphocyte]]s are distinguished:
* [[Cytotoxic T cell]]s
* [[Natural killer cell]]s
* [[Natural killer T cell]]s

'''Degenerate matter'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/22952145|title=Academic Press dictionary of science and technology|last=|first=|date=1992|publisher=Academic Press|others=Morris, Christopher G., Academic Press.|year=|isbn=0122004000|location=San Diego|pages=662|oclc=22952145}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a highly dense [[state of matter|state]] of [[Fermion|fermionic]] matter in which particles must occupy high states of kinetic energy in order to satisfy the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. The description applies to matter composed of [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s or other fermions. The term is mainly used in [[astrophysics]] to refer to dense stellar objects where gravitational pressure is so extreme that [[Quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are significant. This type of matter is naturally found in stars in their final evolutionary states, like [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s, where thermal pressure alone is not enough to avoid gravitational collapse.

Degenerate matter is usually modelled as an ideal [[Fermi gas]], an ensemble of non-interacting fermions. In a quantum mechanical description, particles limited to a finite volume may take only a discrete set of energies, called [[quantum state]]s. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents identical fermions from occupying the same quantum state. At lowest total energy (when the thermal energy of the particles is negligible), all the lowest energy quantum states are filled. This state is referred to as full degeneracy. This '''degeneracy pressure''' remains non-zero even at absolute zero temperature.&lt;ref name="apod.nasa.gov"&gt;see http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap100228.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Andrew G. Truscott, Kevin E. Strecker, William I. McAlexander, Guthrie Partridge, and Randall G. Hulet, "Observation of Fermi Pressure in a Gas of Trapped Atoms", Science, 2 March 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Adding particles or reducing the volume forces the particles into higher-energy quantum states. In this situation, a compression force is required, and is made manifest as a resisting pressure. The key feature is that this degeneracy pressure does not depend on the temperature but only on the density of the fermions. Degeneracy pressure keeps dense stars in equilibrium, independent of the thermal structure of the star.

A degenerate mass whose fermions have velocities close to the speed of light (particle energy larger than its [[rest mass energy]]) is called '''relativistic degenerate matter'''.

The concept of '''degenerate stars''', stellar objects composed of degenerate matter, was originally developed in a joint effort between [[Arthur Eddington]], [[Ralph Fowler]] and [[Arthur Milne]]. Eddington had suggested that the atoms in [[Sirius|Sirius B]] were almost completely ionised and closely packed. Fowler described white dwarfs as composed of a gas of particles that became degenerate at low temperature. Milne proposed that degenerate matter is found in most of the nucleus of stars, not only in [[compact star]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fowler|first=R. H.|date=1926-12-10|title=On Dense Matter|url=https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/87/2/114/1058897|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|language=en|volume=87|issue=2|pages=114–122|doi=10.1093/mnras/87.2.114|issn=0035-8711|bibcode=1926MNRAS..87..114F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840277483|title=A History of Astronomy : from 1890 to the Present|last=David.|first=Leverington,|date=1995|publisher=Springer London|isbn=1447121244|location=London|oclc=840277483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
{{Main|Fermi gas}}
If a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is cooled and under increasing pressure, it will eventually not be possible to compress the plasma any further. This constraint is due to the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two fermions cannot share the same quantum state. When in this highly compressed state, since there is no extra space for any particles, a particle's location is extremely defined. Since the locations of the particles of a highly compressed plasma have very low uncertainty, their momentum is extremely uncertain. The Heisenberg [[uncertainty principle]] states 
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta p \Delta x \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;,

where Δ''p'' is the uncertainty in the particle's momentum and Δ''x'' is the uncertainty in position. Therefore, even though the plasma is cold, such particles must on average be moving very fast. Large kinetic energies lead to the conclusion that, in order to compress an object into a very small space, tremendous force is required to control its particles' momentum.

Unlike a classical [[ideal gas]], whose pressure is proportional to its [[temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;PV=Nk_{\rm B}T &lt;/math&gt;,
where ''P'' is pressure, ''V'' is the volume, ''N'' is the number of particles—typically atoms or molecules—''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is temperature), the pressure exerted by degenerate matter depends only weakly on its temperature. In particular, the pressure remains nonzero even at [[absolute zero]] temperature. At relatively low densities, the pressure of a fully degenerate gas can be derived by treating the system as an ideal Fermi gas, in this way
:&lt;math&gt;P=K\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{5/3}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''K'' depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas. At very high densities, where most of the particles are forced into quantum states with [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|relativistic energies]], the pressure is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P=K\left(\frac{N}{V}\right)^{4/3}&lt;/math&gt;, 
where ''K'' again depends on the properties of the particles making up the gas.&lt;ref&gt;''Stellar Structure and Evolution'' section 15.3 – R Kippenhahn &amp; A. Weigert, 1990, 3rd printing 1994. {{ISBN|0-387-58013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All matter experiences both normal thermal pressure and degeneracy pressure, but in commonly encountered gases, thermal pressure dominates so much that degeneracy pressure can be ignored. Likewise, degenerate matter still has normal thermal pressure, but at extremely high densities, the degeneracy pressure usually dominates.

Exotic examples of degenerate matter include neutron degenerate matter, [[strange matter]], [[metallic hydrogen]] and white dwarf matter. Degeneracy pressure contributes to the pressure of conventional solids, but these are not usually considered to be degenerate matter because a significant contribution to their pressure is provided by electrical repulsion of [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] and the screening of nuclei from each other by electrons. In metals it is useful to treat the [[Conductor (material)|conduction]] electrons alone as a degenerate [[Free electron model|free electron gas]], while the majority of the electrons are regarded as occupying bound quantum states. This solid state contrasts with degenerate matter that forms the body of a white dwarf, where most of the electrons would be treated as occupying free particle momentum states.

== Degenerate gases ==

Degenerate gases are gases composed of fermions such as electrons, protons, and neutrons rather than molecules of ordinary matter. The electron gas in ordinary metals and in the interior of white dwarfs are two examples. Following the Pauli exclusion principle, there can be only one fermion occupying each quantum state. In a degenerate gas, all quantum states are filled up to the Fermi energy. Most stars are supported against their own gravitation by normal thermal gas pressure, while in white dwarf stars the supporting force comes from the degeneracy pressure of the electron gas in their interior. In neutron stars, the degenerate particles are neutrons.

A fermion gas in which all quantum states below a given energy level are filled is called a fully degenerate fermion gas. The difference between this energy level and the lowest energy level is known as the Fermi energy.

=== Electron degeneracy ===
{{Main|Electron degeneracy pressure}}
In an ordinary fermion gas in which thermal effects dominate, most of the available electron energy levels are unfilled and the electrons are free to move to these states. As particle density is increased, electrons progressively fill the lower energy states and additional electrons are forced to occupy states of higher energy even at low temperatures. Degenerate gases strongly resist further compression because the electrons cannot move to already filled lower energy levels due to the Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons cannot give up energy by moving to lower energy states, no thermal energy can be extracted. The momentum of the fermions in the fermion gas nevertheless generates pressure, termed 'degeneracy pressure'.

Under high densities the matter becomes a degenerate gas when the electrons are all stripped from their parent atoms. In the core of a star, once hydrogen burning in [[nuclear fusion]] reactions stops, it becomes a collection of positively charged [[ion]]s, largely helium and carbon nuclei, floating in a sea of electrons, which have been stripped from the nuclei. Degenerate gas is an almost perfect conductor of heat and does not obey the ordinary gas laws. [[White dwarf]]s are luminous not because they are generating any energy but rather because they have trapped a large amount of heat which is gradually radiated away. Normal gas exerts higher pressure when it is heated and expands, but the pressure in a degenerate gas does not depend on the temperature. When gas becomes super-compressed, particles position right up against each other to produce degenerate gas that behaves more like a solid. In degenerate gases the [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]] of electrons are quite high and the rate of collision between electrons and other particles is quite low, therefore degenerate electrons can travel great distances at velocities that approach the speed of light. Instead of temperature, the pressure in a degenerate gas depends only on the speed of the degenerate particles; however, adding heat does not increase the speed of most of the electrons, because they are stuck in fully occupied quantum states. Pressure is increased only by the mass of the particles, which increases the gravitational force pulling the particles closer together. Therefore, the phenomenon is the opposite of that normally found in matter where if the mass of the matter is increased, the object becomes bigger. In degenerate gas, when the mass is increased, the pressure is increased, and the particles become spaced closer together, so the object becomes smaller. Degenerate gas can be compressed to very high densities, typical values being in the range of 10,000 kilograms per cubic centimeter.

There is an upper limit to the mass of an electron-degenerate object, the [[Chandrasekhar limit]], beyond which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] cannot support the object against collapse. The limit is approximately 1.44&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/105468/Chandrasekhar-limit ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA]&lt;/ref&gt; [[solar mass]]es for objects with typical compositions expected for white dwarf stars (carbon and oxygen with 2 baryons per electron). This mass cutoff is appropriate only for a star supported by ideal electron degeneracy pressure under Newtonian gravity; in [[general relativity]] and with realistic Coulomb corrections, the corresponding mass limit is around 1.38 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;Rotondo, M. et al. 2010, Phys. Rev. D, 84, 084007, https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0154&lt;/ref&gt; The limit may also change with the chemical composition of the object, as it affects the ratio of mass to number of electrons present. Celestial objects below this limit are [[white dwarf]] stars, formed by the gradual shrinking of the cores of [[star]]s that run out of fuel. During this shrinking, an electron-degenerate gas forms in the core, providing sufficient degeneracy pressure as it is compressed to resist further collapse. Above this mass limit, a [[neutron star]] (partially supported by neutron degeneracy pressure) or a [[black hole]] may be formed instead.

=== Neutron degeneracy === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Neutronium]] --&gt;

Neutron degeneracy is analogous to electron degeneracy and is demonstrated in neutron stars, which are partially supported by the pressure from a degenerate neutron gas.&lt;ref name="physics-of-neutron-stars"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Physics of Neutron Stars |first=A. Y. |last=Potekhin |year=2011 |journal= Physics-Uspekhi|volume=53 |issue=12 |pages=1235 |arxiv=1102.5735 |bibcode = 2010PhyU...53.1235Y |doi = 10.3367/UFNe.0180.201012c.1279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse may happen when the core of a white dwarf is above the vicinity of 1.4 [[solar mass]]es, which is the Chandrasekhar limit, and the collapse is not halted by the pressure of degenerate electrons. As the star collapses, the Fermi energy of the electrons increases to the point where it is energetically favorable for them to combine with protons to produce neutrons (via inverse [[beta decay]], also termed [[electron capture]] and "neutronization"). The result is an extremely compact star composed of [[nuclear matter]], which is predominantly a degenerate neutron gas, sometimes called [[neutronium]], with a small admixture of degenerate proton and electron gases (and at higher densities, muons).

Neutrons in a degenerate neutron gas are spaced much more closely than electrons in an electron-degenerate gas because the more massive neutron has a much shorter [[Matter wave|wavelength]] at a given energy. Typical separations are comparable with the size of the neutron and the range of the strong nuclear force, and it is actually the repulsive nature of the latter at small separations that primarily supports neutron stars more massive than 0.7 solar masses (which includes all measured neutron stars). In the case of neutron stars and white dwarfs, this phenomenon is compounded by the fact that the pressures within neutron stars are much higher than those in white dwarfs. The pressure increase is caused by the fact that the compactness of a neutron star causes gravitational forces to be much higher than in a less compact body with similar mass. The result is a star with a diameter on the order of a thousandth that of a white dwarf.

There is an upper limit to the mass of a neutron-degenerate object, the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]], which is analogous to the Chandrasekhar limit for electron-degenerate objects. The limit for objects supported by ideal neutron degeneracy pressure is only 0.75 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, J.R., Volkoff, G.M., 1939, Phys. Rev. 55, 374, http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.55.374&lt;/ref&gt; For more realistic models including baryon interaction, the precise limit is unknown, as it depends on the [[equation of state|equations of state]] of nuclear matter, for which a highly accurate model is not yet available. Above this limit, a neutron star may collapse into a black hole or into other, denser forms of degenerate matter (such as [[QCD matter|quark matter]]) if these forms exist and have suitable properties (mainly related to degree of compressibility, or "stiffness", described by the equations of state).

=== Proton degeneracy ===

Sufficiently dense matter containing protons experiences proton degeneracy pressure, in a manner similar to the electron degeneracy pressure in electron-degenerate matter: protons confined to a sufficiently small volume have a large uncertainty in their momentum due to the [[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. However, because protons are much more massive than electrons, the same momentum represents a much smaller velocity for protons than for electrons. As a result, in matter with approximately equal numbers of protons and electrons, proton degeneracy pressure is much smaller than electron degeneracy pressure, and proton degeneracy is usually modelled as a correction to the [[equations of state]] of electron-degenerate matter.

=== Quark degeneracy ===

At densities greater than those supported by neutron degeneracy, [[QCD matter|quark matter]] is expected to occur. Several variations of this hypothesis have been proposed that represent quark-degenerate states. [[Strange matter]] is a degenerate gas of quarks that is often assumed to contain [[strange quark]]s in addition to the usual [[up quark|up]] and [[down quark|down]] quarks. [[color superconductivity|Color superconductor]] materials are degenerate gases of quarks in which quarks pair up in a manner similar to [[Cooper pair]]ing in electrical [[superconductor]]s. The equations of state for the various proposed forms of quark-degenerate matter vary widely, and are usually also poorly defined, due to the difficulty of modeling [[strong interaction|strong force]] interactions.

Quark-degenerate matter may occur in the cores of neutron stars, depending on the equations of state of neutron-degenerate matter. It may also occur in hypothetical [[quark star]]s, formed by the collapse of objects above the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit|Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff mass limit]] for neutron-degenerate objects. Whether quark-degenerate matter forms at all in these situations depends on the equations of state of both neutron-degenerate matter and quark-degenerate matter, both of which are poorly known. Quark stars are considered to be an intermediate category among neutron stars and black holes. Few scientists claim that quark stars and black holes are one and the same. Not enough data exist to support any hypothesis but neutron stars with awkward spectrums have been used in arguments.{{explanation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Singularity ===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
{{original research section|date=October 2017}}

At densities greater than those supported by any degeneracy, gravity overwhelms all other forces. The stellar body collapses to form a [[black hole]], though this is not well modeled by quantum mechanics. At the same time, the material must be converted from [[fermion]]s, subject to degeneracy pressure, to [[boson]]s, which are not. Current hypothesis suggest gluons as the most likely boson thought possible.

In the [[frame of reference]] that is co-moving with the collapsing matter, [[General Relativity|general relativity]] models without [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanics]] have all the matter ending up in an infinitely dense [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the center of the [[event horizon]]. (If one uses the [[unified field theory|UFT]] [[Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations|Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac system]] or its generalizations, then the singularity is avoided and one ends up with a quark star, possibly surrounded by an event horizon.) It is a general result of quantum mechanics that no fermion can be confined in a space smaller than its own wavelength, making such a singularity impossible, unless only bosons are present, but there is no widely accepted theory that combines general relativity and quantum mechanics sufficiently to tell us what the structure inside a black hole might be. If bosons can be conclusively ruled out, one possible theory is that constituent particles decompose into [[string (physics)|strings]], forming a structure called a [[fuzzball (string theory)|fuzzball]].

'''Design-to-Cost''' (DTC), as part of [[cost management]] techniques, describes a systematic approach to controlling the [[cost]]s of [[product development]] and [[manufacturing cost|manufacturing]]. The basic idea is that costs are designed "into the product", even from the earliest [[concept]] decisions on and are difficult to remove later. Thus costs are seen as an equally important parameter besides feature scope and schedule, the three taken together yielding the well-known [[project triangle]].

By taking the right design decisions as early as during the initiation and [[concept phase]] of the [[product life-cycle]], unnecessary costs at later stages can be avoided. But DTC also tries to capture the necessary measures for cost control during the complete [[development cycle]]. In DTC, cost considerations also become part of extended [[Design specification|requirements specifications]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/ltrs-pdfs/iaa-ceso-11-90.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to the closely related [[target costing]], DTC does not mean a product will exactly reach a defined cost, rather, it is about "considering cost as a design parameter in your product development activities".&lt;ref name=hillerassoc&gt;http://www.hillerassociates.com/design-to-value-versus-design-to-cost-versus-minimum-viable-product/&lt;/ref&gt; DTC can also be contrasted with ''Design-to-value'' which emphasizes the value that can be delivered to the customer, instead of the production costs for the manufacturer or company.&lt;ref name=hillerassoc/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12863">'''Endophenotype''' is a [[genetic epidemiology]] term which is used to separate behavioral [[symptom]]s into more stable [[phenotypes]] with a clear [[genetics|genetic]] connection. The concept was coined by Bernard John and Kenneth R. Lewis in a 1966 paper attempting to explain the [[population distribution|geographic distribution]] of [[grasshopper]]s. They claimed that the particular geographic distribution could not be explained by the obvious and external "exophenotype" of the grasshoppers, but instead must be explained by their microscopic and internal "endophenotype".&lt;ref name="Bernard et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=John|first=Bernard|author2=Kenneth R.

==For schizophrenia==
In the case of [[schizophrenia]], the overt symptom could be a [[psychosis]], but the underlying phenotypes are, for example, a lack of [[sensory gating]] and a decline in [[working memory]]. Both of these traits have a clear genetic component and can thus be called endophenotypes.&lt;ref name=pmid12668349/&gt; A strong candidate for schizophrenia endophenotype is [[prepulse inhibition]], the ability to inhibit the reaction to startling stimuli.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Endophenotypes are quantitative, trait-like deficits that are typically assessed by laboratory-based methods rather than by clinical observation.

The four primary criteria for an endophenotype are that it is present in [[probands]] with the disorder, that it is not state-related (that is, it does not occur only during clinical episodes) but instead is present early in the disease course and during periods of remission, that it is observed in unaffected family members at a higher rate than in the general population, and that it is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Green|first=Michael|last2=Horan|first2=William|last3=Lee|first3=Junghee|date=October 2015|title=Social cognition in schizophrenia|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrn4005|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|volume=16|pages=620–631|doi=10.1038/nrn4005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Some distinct genes that could underlie certain endophenotypic traits in schizophrenia include:
* [[reelin|RELN]] – coding the reelin protein downregulated in patients' brains. In one 2008 study its variants were associated with performance in verbal and visual working memory tests in the nuclear families of the sufferers.&lt;ref name=pmid17684500&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wedenoja J, Loukola A, Tuulio-Henriksson A, Paunio T, Ekelund J, Silander K, Varilo T, Heikkilä K, Suvisaari J, Partonen T, Lönnqvist J, Peltonen L |title=Replication of linkage on chromosome 7q22 and association of the regional Reelin gene with working memory in schizophrenia families |journal=[[Mol.

* [[FABP7]], coding the ''Fatty acid-binding protein 7 (brain)'', one SNP of which was associated with schizophrenia in one 2008 study,&lt;ref name=pmid18001149/&gt; is also linked to [[prepulse inhibition]] in mice.&lt;ref name=pmid18001149&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Watanabe A, Toyota T, Owada Y |title=Fabp7 maps to a quantitative trait locus for a schizophrenia endophenotype |journal=[[PLoS Biol.]] |volume=5 |issue=11 |pages=e297 |date=November 2007 |pmid=18001149 |pmc=2071943 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050297 |url= http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050297|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still uncertain though whether the finding will be replicated for human patients.
* [[CHRNA7]], coding the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 subunit. alpha7-containing receptors are known to improve prepulse inhibition, pre-attentive and attentive states.&lt;ref name=pmid19351547&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Leiser SC, Bowlby MR, Comery TA, Dunlop J |title=A cog in cognition: How the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is geared towards improving cognitive deficits |journal=[[Pharmacology and Therapeutics]] |volume=122 |pages=302–11 |year=2009 |pmid=19351547 |doi=10.1016/j.pharmthera.2009.03.009 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For bipolar disorder==
In [[bipolar disorder]], one commonly identified endophenotype is a deficit in [[face perception|face emotion labeling]], which is found in both individuals with bipolar disorder and in individuals who are "at risk" (i.e., have a first degree relative with bipolar disorder).&lt;ref name="Brotman 2008"/&gt;  Using [[fMRI]], this endophenotype has been linked to dysfunction in the dorsolateral and ventrolateral [[prefrontal cortex]], [[anterior cingulate cortex]], [[striatum]], and [[amygdala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosen|first=H|title=Neurocognitive correlates of emotional stimulus processing in pediatric bipolar disorder: a review.|journal=Postgrad Med|year=2010|pmid=20675973|doi=10.3810/pgm.2010.07.2177|volume=122|issue=4|pages=94–104}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A polymorphism in the ''CACNA1C'' gene coding for the [[voltage-dependent calcium channel]] [[Cav1.2|Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.2]] has been found to be associated with deficits in facial emotion recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Soeiro-de-Souza|first=Marcio|title=The impact of the CACNA1C risk allele on limbic structures and facial emotions recognition in bipolardisorder subjects and healthy controls|journal=Journal of Affective Disorders|year=2012|doi=10.1016/j.jad.2012.03.014|volume=141|pages=94–101|pmid=22464935}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 April 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==For suicide==
The endophenotype concept has also been used in [[suicide]] studies. Personality characteristics can be viewed as endophenotypes that may exert a [[Diathesis–stress model|diathesis]] effect on an individual's susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Although the exact identification of these endophenotypes is controversial, certain traits such as impulsivity and aggression are commonly cited risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwivedi|first=Y|title=The Neurobiological Basis of Suicide|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK107203/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One such genetic basis for one of these at-risk endophenotypes has been suggested in 2007 to be the gene coding for the [[serotonin]] receptor [[5-HT1B receptor|5-HT]]&lt;sub&gt;1B&lt;/sub&gt;, known to be relevant in aggressive behaviors.&lt;ref name=pmid17510950&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zouk H, McGirr A, Lebel V, Benkelfat C, Rouleau G, Turecki G |title=The effect of genetic variation of the serotonin 1B receptor gene on impulsive aggressive behavior and suicide |journal=[[Am.

In [[astrophysics]], what is referred to as "[[entropy]]" is actually the [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic constant]] derived as follows.

Using the first law of [[thermodynamics]] for a [[quasistatic process|quasi-static]], infinitesimal process for a [[hydrostatics|hydrostatic system]]
:&lt;math&gt;dQ = dU-dW.\,&lt;/math&gt;

For an [[ideal gas]] in this special case, the [[internal energy]], U, is only a function of the [[temperature]] T; therefore the partial derivative of [[heat capacity]] with respect to T is identically the same as the full derivative, yielding through some manipulation
:&lt;math&gt;
dQ = C_{V} dT+P\,dV.
&lt;/math&gt;

Further manipulation using the differential version of the [[ideal gas law]], the previous equation, and assuming constant pressure, one finds
:&lt;math&gt;
dQ = C_{P} dT-V\,dP.
&lt;/math&gt;

For an [[adiabatic process]] &lt;math&gt;dQ=0\,&lt;/math&gt; and recalling &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{C_{P}}{C_{V}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, one finds
:{|
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{V\,dP = C_{P} dT}{P\,dV = -C_{V} dT}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP}{P} = -\frac{dV}{V}\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;
|}

One can solve this simple differential equation to find
:&lt;math&gt;
PV^{\gamma} = \text{constant} = K\,
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is known as an expression for the adiabatic constant, K, also called the adiabat. From the ideal gas equation one also knows
:&lt;math&gt;
P=\frac{\rho k_{B}T}{\mu m_{H}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;k_{B}\,&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].
Substituting this into the above equation along with &lt;math&gt;V=[grams]/\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 5/3\,&lt;/math&gt; for an ideal [[monatomic gas]] one finds
:&lt;math&gt;
K = \frac{k_{B}T}{(\rho/\mu m_{H})^{2/3}},
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mu\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mean [[molecular weight]] of the gas or [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]; and &lt;math&gt;m_{H}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the [[Hydrogen atom]], which is extremely close to the mass of the [[proton]], &lt;math&gt;m_{p}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the quantity more often used in astrophysical theory of [[galaxy cluster]]s.
This is what [[astrophysicists]] refer to as "entropy" and has units of [keV cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]. This quantity relates to the thermodynamic entropy as
:&lt;math&gt;
\Delta S = 3/2 \ln K .
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36818">'''Fan fiction''' or '''fanfiction''' (also abbreviated to '''fan fic''', '''fanfic''', '''fic''' or '''ff''') is [[fiction]] about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by [[Fan (person)|fans]] of that work rather than by its creator. Fans may maintain the creator's characters and settings or add their own. It is a popular form of [[fan labor]], particularly since the advent of the Internet.

Fan fiction is rarely commissioned or authorized by the original work's creator or publisher and is rarely professionally published. It may or may not [[Copyright infringement|infringe on the original author's copyright]], depending on the jurisdiction and on such questions as for whether or not it qualifies as "[[fair use]]" (see [[Legal issues with fan fiction]]). Attitudes of authors and copyright owners of original works to fan fiction have ranged from indifference to encouragement to rejection. Copyright owners have occasionally responded with legal action.

The term "fan fiction" came into use in the 20th century as [[copyright|copyright laws]] began to delineate between stories using established characters that were authorized by the copyright holder and those that were unauthorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://reporter.rit.edu/views/fanfiction-legal-battle-creativity|title=Fanfiction: A Legal Battle of Creativity|date=2016-02-05|work=Reporter Magazine|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For earlier works with similar characteristics, see [[Sequel#Unofficial sequels|unofficial sequel]] or [[pastiche]].

Fan fiction is defined by being both related to its subject's [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] [[fictional universe]]  (often referred to as "canon") and simultaneously existing outside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fan-Fiction-TV-Viewers-Have-It-Their-Way-1518184 |title=Fan Fiction—TV Viewers Have It Their Way |author=Schulz, Nancy | date=2001-12-31| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=2018-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most fan fiction writers assume that their work is read primarily by other fans, and therefore presume that their readers have knowledge of the canon universe (created by a professional writer) in which their works are based.

==Earlier meanings of the term==
The term "fan fiction" has been attested in print as early as 1939; in this earliest known citation, it is used in a disparaging way to refer to amateurish science fiction (as opposed to "pro fiction").&lt;ref name="bravenewwords"&gt;{{cite book | title = Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction | editor = Jeff Prucher | year = 2007 | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | location = New York | page = 57 | isbn = 978-0-19-530567-8 | url = https://books.google.pl/books?id=iYzi8m8FbEsC&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term also appears in the 1944 ''Fancyclopedia'', an encyclopedia of fandom [[jargon]]. It is defined there as "fiction about fans, or sometimes about pros, and occasionally bringing in some famous characters from [science fiction] stories". The book also mentions that the term is "[s]ometimes improperly used to mean fan science fiction, that is, ordinary fantasy published in a fan magazine".&lt;ref name="bravenewwords" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fancyclopedia1944"&gt;{{cite book | title = Fancyclopedia | author = "John Bristol" | year = 1944 | publisher = The Fantasy Foundation | url = http://fanac.org/Fannish_Reference_Works/Fancyclopedia/Fancyclopedia_I/f1.html#8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Spockanalia2.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Star Trek'' fanzine ''Spockanalia'' contained the first fan fiction in the modern sense of the term.]]
The modern phenomenon of fan fiction as an expression of fandom and fan interaction was popularized and defined via [[Star Trek fandom|''Star Trek'' fandom]] and their [[fanzine]]s published in the 1960s. The first ''[[Star Trek]]'' fanzine, ''Spockanalia'' (1967), contained some fan fiction; many others followed its example.&lt;ref name="verba2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Boldly Writing: A Trekker Fan &amp; Zine History, 1967-1987 | author=Verba, Joan Marie | year=2003 | publisher=FTL Publications | location=Minnetonka MN | url=http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | isbn=0-9653575-4-6 | access-date=2017-04-03 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910042451/http://www.ftlpublications.com/bwebook.pdf | archive-date=2016-09-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} These fanzines were produced via offset printing and [[mimeograph]]y, and mailed to other fans or sold at [[science fiction conventions]] for a small fee to help recoup costs. Unlike other aspects of fandom, women dominated fan fiction authoring; 83% of ''Star Trek'' fan fiction authors were female by 1970, and 90% by 1973.&lt;ref name = "Coppa in Hellekson and Busse"&gt;{{Cite book | first = Francesca  | last = Coppa  | editor-last = Hellekson  | editor-first = Karen  | editor2-last = Busse  | editor2-first = Kristina  | contribution = A Brief History of Media Fandom  | title = Fan Fiction and Fan Communities in the Age of the Internet  | year = 2006  | pages = 41–59  | place = Jefferson, North Carolina  | publisher = [[McFarland &amp; Company]]  | isbn = 978-0-7864-2640-9 | postscript = &lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar states that fan fiction "fill[s] the need of a mostly female audience for fictional narratives that expand the boundary of the official source products offered on the television and movie screen."&lt;ref name="cbs2000"&gt;{{cite book | title=Science Fiction Culture | publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | author=Bacon-Smith, Camille | pages=112–113 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oCvIZpCSRA0C&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-8122-1530-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fan fiction has become more popular and widespread since the advent of the World Wide Web; according to one estimate, fan fiction comprises one third of all content about books on the Web.&lt;ref name="boog20080918"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |title=Brokeback 33 Percent |work=Mediabistro |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |author=Boog, Jason |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130210011535/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/brokeback-33-percent_b7743?c=rss |archive-date=2013-02-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to traditional fanzines and conventions, [[Usenet group]] [[electronic mailing lists]] were established for fan fiction as well as fan discussion. Online, searchable fan fiction archives were also established. The online archives were initially non-commercial hand-tended and fandom- or topic-specific. These archives were followed by non-commercial automated databases. In 1998, the not-for-profit site [[FanFiction.Net]] came online, which allowed anyone to upload content in any fandom.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news |last=Buechner |first=Maryanne Murray |title=Pop Fiction |date=March 4, 2002 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001950,00.html |accessdate=May 29, 2010 |newspaper=[[Time Magazine]] |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to self-publish fan fiction at an easily accessible common archive that did not require insider knowledge to join, and the ability to review the stories directly on the site, became popular quite quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bradley, Karen|date=Winter 2005|title=Internet lives: Social context and moral domain in adolescent development|journal=New Directions for Youth Development|volume=2005|issue=108|pages=57–76|pmid=16570878|doi=10.1002/yd.142}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One popular example of modern fan fiction is [[E. L. James]]' ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]''. This series was originally written as fan fiction for the ''[[Twilight (novel series)|Twilight]]'' series of books and movies and played off the characters of Bella and Edward. In order to not infringe on copyright issues, James changed the character names to Anna and Christian for the purposes of her novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/holy-crow-fifty-shades-grey-crazy-similar-its-twil-215185|title=Holy crow!

On May 22, 2013, the online retailer [[Amazon.com]] established a new publishing service, [[Kindle Worlds]]. This service would enable fan fiction stories of certain licensed media properties to be sold in the [[Kindle Store]] with terms including 35% of net sales for works of 10,000 words or more and 20% for short fiction ranging from 5000 to 10,000 words. However, this arrangement includes restrictions on content, copyright violations, poor document formatting and/or using misleading titles.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pepitone|first=Julianne|title=Amazon's "Kindle Worlds" lets fan fiction writers sell their stories|url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/05/23/technology/amazon-fan-fiction/?iid=HP_LN&amp;hpt=us_bn5|accessdate=23 May 2013|newspaper=CNN Money|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese dōjinshi===
A similar trend in [[Japanese literature|Japan]] also began appearing around the 1960s and 1970s, where [[Self-published|independently published]] [[manga]] and novels, known as ''[[dōjinshi]]'', are frequently published by [[dōjin]] circles; many of these dōjinshi are based on existing [[manga]], [[anime]], and [[video game]] franchises. [[Mangaka|Manga authors]] like [[Shotaro Ishinomori]] and [[Fujiko Fujio]] formed dōjin groups such as Fujio's {{nihongo|New Manga Party|新漫画党|Shin Manga-tō}}. At this time, dōjin groups were used by artists to make a professional debut. This changed in the coming decades with dōjin groups forming as school clubs and the like. This culminated in 1975 with the [[Comiket]] in Tokyo.

===Genres===
In addition to the "regular" [[list of genres]], which for fanfiction are usually determined by the work they're based on, there are a few genres that are closely associated with fanfic. Often, they also overlap. The genres include:

====Angst====
A story with an angsty mood centered on a character/characters who are brooding, sad, or in anguish.

====AU or alternate universe====
{{Main|Alternative universe (fan fiction)}}
Characters set in a universe other than their own canonical one.

====Crossover====
Works featuring characters, items, or setpieces from multiple fandoms.

====Darkfic====
Stories which are considerably grimmer and/or more depressing than the original, often in deliberate contrast to the canonical work(s). Not all stories tagged as "[[Darkness#Literature|dark]]" count as darkfic.  This is sometimes done with fandoms which are meant to be light-hearted or for children.

====Fix-fic====
A counterpart to darkfic, or perhaps its supergenre, fix-fic or more commonly known as "fix-it", refers to stories which rewrite canonical events that the author disliked, often because they were depressing or incomprehensible.

====Fluff or WAFF====
A story designed to be happy, and nothing else. The plot is usually less relevant in these types of works, as the main focus is to be cheerful. WAFF is short for "Warm And Fuzzy Feelings," and the two terms are quite similar in usage.

====Fusion====
Works blending two settings, and sometimes their casts, into a cohesive whole.

====Hurt/comfort====
A story in which a character is put through a traumatizing experience in order to be comforted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peggy Sue====
A story in which one of the characters is sent back in time, getting a second chance with knowledge of the original plot. Named after the movie ''[[Peggy Sue Got Married]]'', in which this happens to the titular character. [[Groundhog Day (film)|''Groundhog Day'']] is an example of this happening repeatedly. Refers to both the story and the character in this situation. Not related to [[Mary Sue]].

====Rationalist rewrite====
Rebuild fiction that heavily features critical thinking skills and deductive reasoning. Also popularized by ''Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality''.

====Rebuild fiction====
A subtype of fix-fic, wherein aspects of the setting and/or characters are rewritten to be more cohesive. Named for the ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' series, which originally qualified, and popularized by ''[[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality]]''.

====Self-insert====
A genre of fanfiction in which a version of the author is transported to, or discovers they are inside, the world the fanfiction is based on. Almost always [[first-person narration|written in the first person]]. Fanfictions of this type are often also fix-fics.

====Multicross self-insert====
Instead of a single fictional universe, the inserted author is taken to many in a row, and must usually solve some problem or complete some challenge in each place before moving on. Gaining new powers and occasionally companions from each world is common.

====Shipping====
A variant of [[list of genres#romance|romance]], focused on exploring a relationship between two or more characters from the original fandom(s). It has several subgenres, including Slash (which focuses on homosexual pairings, usually of the male variety), [[Femslash]]/Femmeslash/Yuri (same as Slash, but exclusively female/female), Crossover Shipping, which focuses on a romance between characters from multiple fandoms, and "friendshipping", which focuses on platonic relationships.

====Curtainfic====
A subcategory of shipping; describes romantic couples in mundane domestic situations such as picking out [[curtains]].

====Smut====
Smut is sexually explicit or pornographic writing. This could refer to a small portion of a story, or in its entirety.  The terms "lemon" and "lime" are often used to allude to the upcoming sexual scene.

====Songfic====
Songfic, also known as a song fic or a song-fic, is a genre of fan fiction that features a fictional work interspersed with the lyrics of a relevant song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yfOTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Critical Perspectives on Harry Potter|last=Heilman|first=Elizabeth E.|date=2008-09-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135891541|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WbcqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Media Convergence Handbook - Vol. 2: Firms and User Perspectives|last=Lugmayr|first=Artur|last2=Zotto|first2=Cinzia Dal|date=2016-07-23|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642544873|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[portmanteau]] of "song" and "fiction"; as such, one might also see the genre referred to as "songfiction". As many lyrics are under [[copyright]], whether songfics are a violation of that copyright law is a subject of debate. Some fan fiction websites, such as FanFiction.Net, have barred authors from posting songfics with lyrics outside the [[public domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/guidelines/|title=Guidelines|website=FanFiction.net|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an essay in ''Music, Sound, and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', [[University of Sydney]] professor [[Catherine Driscoll]] commented that the genre was "one of the least distinguished modes of fan production" and that "within fan fiction excessive attachment to or foregrounding of popular music is itself dismissed as immature and derivative".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKxBuIcAoeEC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Songfic#v=onepage&amp;q=Songfic|title=Music, Sound and Silence in Buffy the Vampire Slayer|last=Attinello|first=Paul Gregory|last2=Halfyard|first2=Janet K.|last3=Knights|first3=Vanessa|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=9780754660415|pages=114, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vent====
Vent refers to literature written by an author under duress or for therapeutic purposes, normally to calm themselves following a stressful or upsetting situation.

==Other related terms==

===A/N===
An abbreviation of "author's note".  Author's notes can be written at any point during a fanfiction (in some cases interrupting the flow of the piece by appearing within the body of a fanfiction), but are typically found directly before the beginning of a fanfiction or after it has concluded, and also at the starts or ends of chapters if the story is updated periodically. A/N's are used to convey direct messages from the author to the reader regarding the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Canon===
Canon is the original story. This means anything related to the original source including the plot, settings, and character developments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/falcon/moonbeam/terms.html|title=Common Fandom Terms|last=|first=|date=May 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disclaimer ===
{{see also|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
[[Disclaimer]]s are author's notes typically informing readers about who deserves credit for the original source material,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://expressions.populli.net/dictionary.html|title=A Fanspeak Dictionary|last=Freeman|first=Morgan|date=|website=|access-date=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often containing pseudo-legal language disavowing any intent of [[copyright infringement]] or alluding to [[fair use]]. Such "disclaimers" are legally ineffective and based on misunderstandings of [[copyright law]], particularly confusion between illegal copyright infringement and unethical [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/fan-fiction-plagiarism-and-copyright/|title=Fan Fiction, Plagiarism, and Copyright|date=18 March 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fandom ===
A [[fandom]] is a group of fans of a particular work of fiction (e.g. novel, film, television show or video game). Members of a fandom are typically interested in even minor details of the plot/characters of their fandom and often spend a significant portion of their time and energy involved with their interest, that is why most fanfictions are written by members of a particular fandom(s).

===Fangirl/fanboy===
A female/male that is a part of one or more fandoms. Furthermore, the term fangirling/fanboying refers to a moment where a person "geeks out" or gets quite excited about a fandom.

===Fanon===
Fanon is an idea that is widely believed to be true among fans, but is unconfirmed, preventing it from being labelled as canon. Fanon may refer to a whole interpretation of the original work, or to specific details within it.

===Headcanon===
Headcanon is a fan's personal, idiosyncratic interpretation of canon, such as the backstory of a character, or the nature of relationships between characters. It may represent a teasing out of subtext present in the canon, or it may directly contradict canon. If many other fans share this interpretation, it may become fanon.

===Mary Sue===
Also of note is the concept of the "[[Mary Sue]]", a term credited as originating in ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan fiction that has crossed over to the mainstream, at least among editors and writers. In early ''Trek'' fan fiction, a common plot was that of a minor member of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s crew saving the life of Captain Kirk or Mister Spock, often being rewarded with a sexual relationship as a result. The term "Mary Sue", originating in a parody of stories in this [[wish fulfillment]] genre, thus tends to refer to an idealized or fictional character lacking flaws, often representing the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Segall |year=2008 |title=Fan Fiction Writing: New Work Based on Favorite Fiction |publisher=Rosen Pub. |page=26 |isbn=1404213562}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OTP===
An abbreviation of the term "one true pairing", where the author or reader ships (wishes for a romantic relationship between) certain characters from a fandom. Additionally, OTPs are also subsetted as OT3s, which reference the reader's one true bonding with three people; this number can be changed to refer to larger bondings.

===RPF===
An abbreviation of "real person fanfiction". Describes fanfiction-like works written about real people, usually celebrities, instead of fictional characters.

===SI===
An abbreviation of self-insert, usually referring to either a story in the eponymous genre or to the author avatar within one.

===TW===
An abbreviation of "[[trauma trigger|trigger warning]]". Trigger warnings are meant to warn people of content in fics that could be harmful or "triggering" to those who have dealt with situations such as abuse. Fan fiction is tagged using various TWs so that readers may prepare for or avoid certain content. Sometimes CW, an abbreviation of "content warning", is used instead of or in addition to a TW. Trigger warnings are usually inserted when the subject matter of a work deals with things issues like drug abuse, mental illness, abuse, or extreme violence.

==Interactivity in the online era==
Reviews can be given by both anonymous and registered users of most sites, and sites are often programmed to notify the author of new feedback, making them a common way for readers and authors online to communicate directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fanfiction.net/secure/review.php?storyid=3058878&amp;chapter=1&amp;storytextid=9301416' |title=Fanfiction.Net Review Form |publisher=[[Fanfiction.net]] |accessdate=April 24, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is intended for a type of bond between the reader and the writer, as well as helping the author improve their writing skills through [[constructive criticism]], enabling their to produce a better work next time.&lt;ref name="Merlin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |title=Dr. Merlin's Guide to Fanfiction |author=Merlin, Missy |publisher=[[Firefox]] |date=September 13, 2007 |accessdate=May 7, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080523223635/http://firefox.org/news/articles/650/11/Dr-Merlin039s-Guide-to-Fanfiction/Page11.html |archivedate=May 23, 2008 |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, unmoderated review systems are abused to send [[Flaming (Internet)|flames]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], or [[Internet troll|trolling]] messages. As a result, the author of the story can either disable or enable anonymous reviews, depending on their preference. Internet fan fiction gives young writers a wider audience for their literary efforts than ever before, resulting in improved literacy.&lt;ref&gt;Tosenberger, Catherine (2008) "Homosexuality at the Online Hogwarts: Harry Potter Slash Fanfiction" ''Children's Literature'' 36 pp. 185-207 {{doi|10.1353/chl.0.0017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal issues with fan fiction}}
Fan fiction is a [[derivative work]] under [[United States copyright law]].&lt;ref name="legal-derivativeWork"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whoosh.org/issue25/lee1a.html#41 |title=What's "Derivative Work?" |work=A Brief Introduction to Copyright for Fanfiction Authors |author=Lee, A.T. |publisher=Woosh! |date=October 1998 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that fan fiction does not fall under [[fair use]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html Burns, Elizabeth, and Webbr, Carlie. "When Harry Met Bella: Fan fiction is all the rage. But is it plagiarism? Or the perfect thing to encourage young writers?" ''[[School Library Journal]]'', 8/1/2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805092320/http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA6673573.html |date=2009-08-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 ruling by [[United States District Court]] judge Deborah A. Batts, permanently prohibiting publication in the United States of a book by Ryan Cassidy, a Swedish writer whose protagonist is a 76-year-old version of [[Holden Caulfield]] of ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', may be seen as upholding this position regarding publishing fan fiction, as the judge stated, "To the extent Defendants contend that 60 Years and the character of Mr. C direct parodied comment or criticism at ''Catcher'' or Holden Caulfield, as opposed to Salinger himself, the Court finds such contentions to be post-hoc rationalizations employed through vague generalizations about the alleged naivety of the original, rather than reasonably perceivable parody."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Sewell |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/judge-rules-for-salinger-in-copyright-suit/?hp |title=Chan, Sewell.

Others such as the [[Organization for Transformative Works]] uphold the legality of non-profit fan fiction under the fair use doctrine, as it is a creative, [[Transformation (law)|transformative]] process.&lt;ref name="legal-fairUse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Legal |publisher=[[Organization for Transformative Works]] |url=http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |accessdate=September 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001030602/http://transformativeworks.org/faq/legal |archivedate=October 1, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, [[Lucasfilm]] Ltd. sent out a letter to several [[fanzine]] publishers, asserting Lucasfilm's copyright to all [[List of Star Wars characters|''Star Wars'' characters]] and insisting that no fanzine publish [[pornography]]. The letter also alluded to possible legal action that could be taken against fanzines that did not comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |last=Jenkins |first=Henry |title=Quentin Tarantino's Star Wars?: Digital Cinema, Media Convergence, and Participatory Culture |year=2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309235553/http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html |archivedate=March 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harry Potter Lexicon is one case where the encyclopedia-like website about everything in the Harry Potter series, moved towards publishing and commercializing the Lexicon as a supplementary and complementary source of information to the series. Rowling and her publishers levied a lawsuit against the website creator, Steven Vander Ark, and the publishing company, RDR Books, for a breach of copyright. While the lawsuit did conclude in Vander Ark's favor, the main issue in contention was the majority of the Lexicon copied a majority of the Series' material and does not transform enough of the material to be held separately from the series itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwabach|first=Aaron|title=The Harry Potter Lexicon and the World of Fandom: Fan Fiction, Outsider Works and, Copyright|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|year=2009|volume=70|issue=3|pages=387–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the HP Lexicon case is an example of Western culture treatment of fan fiction and copyright law, in China, Harry Potter fan fiction is less addressed in legal conflicts but is used as a cultural and educational tool between Western and Chinese cultures. More specifically, while there are a number of "fake" Harry Potter books in China, most of these books are treated as addressing concepts and issues found in Chinese culture. This transformative usage of Harry Potter in fan fiction is mainly from the desire to enhance and express value to Chinese tradition and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gupta |first=Suman |title=Re-Reading Harry Potter 2nd Ed. |year=2009 |publisher=Basingstoke (UK); New York (US): Palgrave Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent authors have given their blessings to fan fiction, notably [[J.K. Rowling]]. Rowling said she was "flattered" that people wanted to write their own stories based on her fictional characters.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3753001.stm |title=Rowling backs Potter fan fiction |author=Waters, Darren |publisher=BBC |date=May 27, 2004 |accessdate=April 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Stephenie Meyer]] has put links on her website to fan fiction sites about her characters from the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |title=Twilight Series Fansites |publisher=StephenieMeyer.com |accessdate=October 5, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006021434/http://stepheniemeyer.com/ts_fansites.html |archivedate=October 6, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fifty Shades (novel series)|''Fifty Shades'' trilogy]] was developed from a ''Twilight'' fan fiction originally titled ''Master of the Universe'' and published episodically on fan-fiction websites under the pen name "Snowqueen's Icedragon". The piece featured characters named after Stephenie Meyer's characters in ''Twilight'', [[Edward Cullen]] and [[Bella Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=mediabistro.com|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|title=The Lost History of ''Fifty Shades of Grey''|author=GalleyCat|access-date=2015-06-30|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140727045638/http://www.mediabistro.com/galleycat/fifty-shades-of-grey-wayback-machine_b49124|archive-date=2014-07-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1685954/fifty-shades-of-grey-stephenie-meyer.jhtml |title=''Fifty Shades of Grey'': Stephenie Meyer Speaks Out |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of changing views on the subject, author [[Orson Scott Card]] (best known for the ''[[Enders Game]]'' series) once stated on his website, "to write fiction using my characters is morally identical to moving into my house without invitation and throwing out my family." He changed his mind completely and since has assisted fan fiction contests, arguing to the ''Wall Street Journal'' that "Every piece of fan fiction is an ad for my book. What kind of idiot would I be to want that to disappear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano |first=Aja |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/05/07/sci_fi_icon_orson_scott_card_hates_fan_fiction_the_homosexual_agenda_partner/ |title=Orson Scott Card’s long history of homophobia |publisher=Salon.com |date=2013-05-07 |accessdate=2013-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Anne Rice]] has consistently and aggressively prevented fan fiction based on any of her fictional characters (mostly those from her famous ''[[Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its sequels in ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]''). She, along with [[Anne McCaffrey]] (whose stance has been changed by her son, Todd McCaffrey, since her death) and [[Raymond Feist]], have asked to have any fiction related to their series removed from FanFiction.Net.&lt;ref name="bcc-rowling"/&gt; [[George R.R. Martin]], who was selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "2011 Time 100" and is most famous for his epic fantasy series, ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'', is also strongly opposed to fan fiction, believing it to be copyright infringement and a bad exercise for aspiring writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgerrmartin.com/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions - George R.

'''Fat necrosis''' is a form of [[necrosis]] characterized by the action upon [[fat]] by digestive [[enzyme]]s.&lt;ref name="urlCell Injury"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.med.utah.edu/WebPath/CINJHTML/CINJ026.html |title=Cell Injury |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fat necrosis the enzyme [[lipase]] releases [[fatty acids]] from [[triglycerides]]. The fatty acids then complex with [[calcium]] to form [[soaps]].  These soaps appear as white chalky deposits.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1448">'''Fenchel's Law''' is a regularity in [[population ecology]] regarding how exponential population growth is related to the body size of the organism. It was first described by the [[Denmark|Danish]] [[marine biology|marine ecologist]] [[Tom Fenchel]]. It contends that species with larger body sizes tend to have lower rates of population growth.  More exactly, it states that the maximum rate of reproduction decreases with body size at a power of a quarter of the body mass&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00384576 Fenchel, Tom (1974) Intrinsic rate of natural increase: the relationship with body size.  Oecologia 14: 317-326.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fenchel's law may be expressed as an allometric equation: 

:&lt;math&gt; r = {aW^{-0.25}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where '''r''' is the intrinsic rate of natural population growth, '''a''' is a constant that has 3 different values (one for [[unicellular organism]]s, one for [[poikilotherm]]s and one for [[homeotherm]]s), and '''W''' is the average body mass of the organism. This means that if a species ''A'' has a body mass 10 times that of species B, then the maximum population growth rate of ''A'' will be one-half that of species B.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, L.R. &amp; Colyvan, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1705">The '''highly accelerated stress test''' (HAST) method was first proposed by Jeffrey E. Gunn, Sushil K. Malik, and Purabi M. Mazumdar of IBM. 

The acceleration factor for elevated humidity is empirically derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{H} = e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed humidity, ''RH''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the operating-environment humidity, and ''n'' is an empirically derived constant (usually 1 &lt; ''n'' &lt; 5).

The acceleration factor for elevated temperature is derived to be

:&lt;math&gt;AF_T = e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the activation energy for the temperature-induced failure (most often 0.7&amp;nbsp;eV for electronics), ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[operating temperature]] in [[kelvin]]s, and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the stressed temperature.

Therefore the total acceleration factor for unbiased HAST testing is

:&lt;math&gt;AF_\text{HAST} = AF_\text{H} \cdot AF_T =
 e^{\text{const} \cdot (RH_\text{s}^n - RH_\text{o}^n)}
 e^{(E_\text{a}/k)(1/T_\text{o} - 1/T_\text{s})}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Hogel processing unit''' (HPU) is a highly parallel homogeneous computation device dedicated to rendering [[hogel]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lucente|first=Mark|title=Diffraction-Specific Fringe Computation for Electro-Holography|url=http://lucente.us/db/pubs/PhDthesis/contents.html|publisher=MIT Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science|accessdate=Sep 1994}} See, for example, page 55 in [http://lucente.us/db/pubs/PhDthesis/4.pdf "Chapter 4: Diffraction-Specific Computation"], or the [http://lucente.us/db/pubs/PhDthesis/a.pdf "Glossary of Terms and Abbreviations" in Appendix A] on page 151.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[Holography|holographic]] light-field display and encompasses the 3D scene conversion into hogels, the 2D post processing filters on hogels for spatial and color corrections and framebuffer management tasks.   Hogels are similar to a sub-aperture image in a plenoptic radiance image, in that a hogel represents both the direction and intensity of light within a frustum from a given point on the light-field display plane.  The resulting projected light-field is full parallax, allowing the viewer a perspective correct visualization within the light-field display view volume.

[[File:Hogel Plane.png|center|400px|Hogel image plane with rendered hogel volume highlighted in red.]]

The HPU is separated from the host CPU (or GPU) by an expandable, interconnect framework and provides many views (hogels) into a scene per scene frame.  The HPU is physically located in close proximity to the photonic modulation layer of a light-field display and has direct write access to the modulation driver back-buffers.   This reduces the complexity of an HPU interconnect framework and allows the HPU processing pipeline to be as short and efficient as possible.

Synthetic light-field rays are typically rendered as part of a hogel (2D array of rays/RGB pixels) using double-frustum rasterization or ray-tracing/ray-casting algorithms.  These hogel rendering algorithms are greatly accelerated by the use of off-the-shelf (OTS) GPUs, however, there exists a substantial gap between real-time light-field rendering needs in terms of frame-rate, power and form factor requirements and modern GPU capability.

The computed hogel light-field display requires as input a streaming 3D scene and a modeled/virtual display plane for visualization.  The light-field display plane is a 2D array of microlens; hogels are computed at the center of every lens from the perspective of a virtual display plane in model space.  3D operations such as pan, scale, zoom, tilt and rotate are accomplished by transforming the virtual display plane through model space.   For every light-field display update, every hogel must be updated or rendered.    Therefore, if a light-field display had an array of 600 × 600 hogels, then the HPUs would have to compute 360,000 hogels per update.  If each hogel had a directional/angular resolution of 512x512 rays/pixels, then the HPU array would be generating 94,371,840,000 pixels (283,115,520,00 bytes) per update.  At 30 display updates per second (DPS), this equates to 2,831,155,200,000 unique pixels every second for dynamic scenes.

[[File:HPU Overview.png|center|600px|Hogel processing unit overview]]

'''HPU parallelism'''
Since many (possibly hundreds) HPUs would be required to drive a single light-field display, it is important that the HPU be an independent processor, requiring minimal support logic and interconnect.    The HPU interconnect framework should provide scene, command and sync buffering and relay throughout the topology.  Ideally, neither the host system nor the individual HPUs would have knowledge of the interconnect topology or even the depth and breadth of the system.

'''Hogel parallelism (multivew point rendering)'''
A critical component of the HPU is the rendering of multiple viewpoints (hogels) in parallel per rendering pass of the geometry to take advantage of vertex and texture cache coherency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10152">In [[evolutionary developmental biology]], '''homeosis''' is the transformation of one [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] into another, arising from [[mutation]] in or misexpression of certain developmentally critical [[gene]]s, specifically homeotic genes. In animals, these developmental genes specifically control the development of organs on their anteroposterior axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Beyond homeosis—HOX function in morphogenesis and organogenesis|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x/abstract|journal = Differentiation|date = 2003-10-01|issn = 1432-0436|pages = 461–476|volume = 71|issue = 8|doi = 10.1046/j.1432-0436.2003.7108004.x|first = James Castelli-Gair|last = Hombría|first2 = Bridget|last2 = Lovegrove}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, however, the developmental genes affected by homeosis may control anything from the development of a [[stamen]] or petals to the development of chlorophyll.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sattler|first=Rolf|date=October 1998|title=Homeosis in Plants|jstor=2444710|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=75|pages=1606–1617|doi=10.2307/2444710|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeosis may be caused by mutations in [[Hox genes]], found in animals, or others such as the [[MADS-box]] family in plants. Homeosis is a characteristic that has helped [[insect]]s become as successful and diverse as they are.&lt;ref&gt;Lodish et al., 2003. ''Molecular Cell Biology, 5th Edition''. W.H. Freeman and Company, New York.{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutations work by changing segment identity during development. For example, the ''[[Ultrabithorax]]'' [[genotype]] gives a [[phenotype]] wherein metathoracic and first [[abdominal]] segments become mesothoracic segments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/287795a0 |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in [[Drosophila]] |year=1980 |last1=Nüsslein-Volhard |first1=Christiane |last2=Wieschaus |first2=Eric |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |pmid=6776413|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known example is ''[[Antennapedia]]'': a [[gain-of-function]] [[allele]] causes legs to develop in the place of [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/325816a0 |title=Redesigning the body plan of [[Drosophila]] by ectopic expression of the homoeotic gene Antennapedia |year=1987 |last1=Schneuwly |first1=Stephan |last2=Klemenz |first2=Roman |last3=Gehring |first3=Walter J. |journal=Nature |volume=325 |issue=6107 |pages=816–818 |pmid=3821869|bibcode=1987Natur.325..816S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plant morphology|botany]], [[Rolf Sattler]] has revised the concept of homeosis (replacement) by his emphasis on partial homeosis in addition to complete homeosis; this revision is now widely accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2444710 |pages=1606–1617 |last1=Sattler |first1=R. |title=Homeosis in Plants |volume=75 |issue=10 |journal=American Journal of Botany |year=1988 |doi=10.2307/2444710}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeotic mutants in [[angiosperms]] are thought to be rare in the wild: in the annual plant ''[[Clarkia]]'' ([[Onagraceae]]), homeotic mutants are known where the petals are replaced by a second whorl of sepal-like organs, originating via a mutation governed by a single recessive gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/358671a0 |title=Bicalyx is a natural homeotic floral variant |year=1992 |last1=Ford |first1=V. S. |last2=Gottlieb |first2=L. D. |journal=Nature |volume=358 |issue=6388 |pages=671–673|bibcode=1992Natur.358..671F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of lethal or deleterious consequences in floral mutants resulting in distinct morphological expressions has been a factor in the evolution of Clarkia, and perhaps also in many other plant groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2461245 |pages=681–709 |last1=Gottlieb |first1=L. D. |title=Genetics and Morphological Evolution in Plants |volume=123 |issue=5 |journal=The American Naturalist |year=1984 |doi=10.1086/284231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in animals==
Following the work on homeotic mutants by [[Edward B. Lewis|Ed Lewis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A gene complex controlling segmentation in [[Drosophila]] |year=1978 |last1=Lewis |first1=EB |journal=Nature |volume=276 |issue=5688 |pages=565–570 |pmid=103000 |doi=10.1038/276565a0|bibcode=1978Natur.276..565L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenology of homeosis in [[Metazoa|animals]] was further elaborated by discovery of a conserved DNA binding sequence present in many  homeotic proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A conserved DNA sequence in homoeotic genes of the [[Drosophila]] Antennapedia and bithorax complexes |year=1984 |last1=McGinnis |first1=W |last2=Levine |first2=MS |last3=Hafen |first3=E |last4=Kuroiwa |first4=A |last5=Gehring |first5=WJ  |journal=Nature |volume=308 |issue=5958 |pages=428–433 |pmid=6323992 |doi=10.1038/308428a0|bibcode=1984Natur.308..428M }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, the 60 amino acid DNA binding protein domain was named the [[homeodomain]], while the 180 bp nucleotide sequence encoding it was named the [[homeobox]]. The homeobox gene clusters studied by Ed Lewis were named the [[Hox genes]], although it should be noted that many more homeobox genes are encoded by animal [[genome]]s than those in the Hox gene clusters.

The homeotic-function of certain proteins was first postulated to be that of a "selector" as proposed by [[Antonio Garcia-Bellido]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic control of wing disc development in [[Drosophila]]. |year=1975 |last1=Garcia-Bellido |first1=A |journal=Ciba Found. Symp |volume=0 |pages=161–-182 |pmid=1039909}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By definition selectors were imagined to be ([[transcription factor]]) proteins that stably determined one of two possible cell fates for a cell and its cellular descendants in a [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]].   
While most animal homeotic functions are associated with homeobox-containing factors, not all homeotic proteins in animals are encoded by homeobox genes, and further not all homeobox genes are necessarily associated with homeotic functions or ([[mutant]]) phenotypes.
The concept of homeotic selectors was further elaborated or at least qualified by [[Michael Akam]] in a so-called "post-selector gene" model that incorporated additional findings and "walked back" the "orthodoxy" of selector-dependent stable binary switches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes, homeosis and the evolution of segment identity: no need for hopeless monsters.|year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=International Journal of Developmental Biology |volume=42 | pages=445–451 |pmid=9654030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartments]] is deeply intertwined with the selector model of homeosis because the selector-mediated maintenance of cell fate can be restricted into different organizational units of an animal's [[body plan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signals and mechanics shaping compartment boundaries in [[Drosophila]] |year=2015 |last1=Umetsu |first1=D |last2=Dahmann |first2=C |journal=Wiley Interdiscip Rev Dev Biol |volume=4 |pages=407–417 |pmid=25755098 |doi=10.1002/wdev.178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context, newer insights into homeotic mechanisms were found by [[Albert Erives]] and colleagues by focusing on [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] that are co-targeted by homeotic selectors and different combinations of developmental signals.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;
This work identifies a protein biochemical difference between the [[transcription factor]]s that function as homeotic selectors versus the [[transcription factor]]s that function as effectors of developmental signaling pathways, such as the [[Notch signaling pathway]] and the [[Transforming growth factor beta superfamily|BMP signaling pathway]].&lt;ref name="Stroebele"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Integration of Orthogonal Signaling by the Notch and Dpp Pathways in Drosophila |year=2016 |last1=Stroebele |first1=E |last2=Erives |first2=A |journal=Genetics |volume=203 |pages=219–240 |pmid=26975664 |doi=10.1534/genetics.116.186791 |pmc=4858776}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This work proposes that homeotic selectors function to "license" [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer DNAs]] in a restricted [[Compartment (development)|tissue compartment]] so that the enhancers are enabled to read-out developmental signals, which are then integrated via [[Polyglutamine tract|polyglutamine]]-mediated aggregation.&lt;ref name=Stroebele/&gt;

==Homeotic mechanisms in plants==
Like the complex [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] seen in [[animals]], the multicellularity of [[land plants]] is developmentally organized into [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] units via [[transcription factor]] genes with homeotic effects.&lt;ref name="Sablowski"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Control of patterning, growth, and differentiation by floral organ identity genes. |year=2015 |last1=Sablowski |first1=R |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=1065–1073 |pmid=25609826 |doi=10.1093/jxb/eru514}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although plants have homeobox-containing genes, plant homeotic factors tend to possess [[MADS-box]] DNA binding domains.
Animal genomes also possess a small number [[MADS-box]] factors.
Thus, in the independent evolution of [[Multicellular organism|multicellularity]] in plants and animals, different [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] transcription factor families were [[Exaptation|co-opted]] to serve homeotic functions. 
MADS-domain factors have been proposed to function as co-factors to more specialized factors and thereby help to determine organ identity.&lt;ref name=Sablowski/&gt;
This has been proposed to correspond more closely to the interpretation of animal homeotics outlined by [[Michael Akam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hox genes: From master genes to micromanagers |year=1998 |last1=Akam |first1=M |journal=Current Biology |volume=8 |pages=R676 |pmid=9768351 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal learning''' is any learning that is not [[formal learning]] or [[non-formal learning]], such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.

The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education.  The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in [[communities of practice]], to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to [[observational learning|observe]] and participate in social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizations==
[[File:Open House Day 2015 Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Open House Day at [[ESO]]’s Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House Day 2015 – Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1526a/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Informal learning can be characterized as the following:
* It usually takes place outside [[education]]al [[school|establishments]];
* It does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements;
* It is not necessarily planned [[pedagogically]], systematically according to fixed [[course (education)|subject]]s, [[test (student assessment)|test]] and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for [[life]];
* It is experienced directly in its "[[Nature (philosophy)|natural]]" function of everyday life.
* It is often spontaneous and creative.
* It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] (LOPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching-In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities.

==History==
In international discussions, the concept of informal learning, already used by [[John Dewey]] at an early stage and later on by [[Malcolm Knowles]], experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and [[nonformal learning]] in courses ([[P. H. Coombs|Coombs]]/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions ([[K. Watkins|Watkins]]/Marsick, p.&amp;nbsp;12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards [[autodidactic]] and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner ([[D. W. Livingstone|Livingstone]] 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68 et seq.).

==Differences between informal and non-formal learning==
{{main|Non-formal learning}}
As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars.

==Other perspective==
Merriam et al. (2007) state: "Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990, p. 6)" (p.&amp;nbsp;36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as "a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images" (Bennett, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4) and she theorized two possible sub-processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge.

==In American Indigenous communities==
People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=B|author2=L. Alcala |author3=A. Coppens |author4=A. Lopez |author5=O. Ruvalcaba |author6=K. Silva |title=Pitching in and catching on: Learning through intent community participation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These learning experiences rely on children’s incorporation in the community and the child’s attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in.

Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pewewardy|first1=Cornel|title=Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska native students: A review of the literature and implications for practice|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=2002|volume=41|issue=3|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.

An example is the process where children learn slash-and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskins|first=S|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico|last = Alcala|first = et. al.|date = 2014|journal = Human Development |doi = 10.1159/000356763|pmid = |access-date =|volume=57|issue = 2–3|pages=96–115|bibcode = 2001HuDev..44..103S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors.

Rogoff2|title=Side-by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychology and Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]], experiential learning, and apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=M|title=Indigenous Knowledge and Research: The Míkiwáhp as a Symbol for Reclaiming Our Knowledge and Ways of Knowing|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/26/64|journal=The First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]], alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children’s time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göncü|first=A.|title=Children’s and researchers’ engagement in the world|journal=Library of Congress Catalog|year=1999|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the-holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children |journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 55–66|volume = 38|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|first = Pablo|last = Chavajay|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Rogoff|pmid=11806702|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is part of a child’s development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=M.|author2=D.

Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebel|first=M.|title=The dignity of the working child: What children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala think about their work|journal=Working Children's Protagonism: Social Movements and Empowerment in Latin America, Africa and India|year=2001|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children’s social interaction and behavior occur.  Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskin|first=S.|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication as a learning tool===

In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture’s definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the native american student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain.In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. "Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development." Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3195944|title = Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to be Separate-but-Together|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 156–172|last1 = Paradise|first1 = Ruth|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ennew | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Growing up in a culture of respect: child rearing in highland Peru – By Bolin, Inge | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 168–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01604_5.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, E., &amp; Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal and informal education==
To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms "formal" and "informal" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic,  while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students.

==Research and data==
Merriam and others (2007) state: "studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, &amp; Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs" (p.&amp;nbsp;35–36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form.

==Experiences and examples==
Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, "At the Water Cooler of Learning" in Conner, M. L., &amp; Clawson, J.G. (eds.) "Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of [[language acquisition]], a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a 
formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). "Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non-Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring.

Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager.

Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person.

In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in "The Learning Revolution" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries—which offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, "meet the author" events and family history sessions—to run activities such as [http://www.northeastlibraries.org.uk The North East Festival of Learning].

==Trends in formal and informal learning==
40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and [[situational]] in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on [[on-the-job training]].

Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and [[interpersonal skills]] that the “unskilled” labor force requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.

==Business perspective==
The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part—25%—of the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively "adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything.

==Summary==
Lifelong learning, as defined by the [[OECD]], includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2329">'''Integrated human studies''' is an emerging educational field that equips people with [[knowledge]] and competencies across a range of disciplines to enable them to address the challenges facing [[Human|human beings]] this century. It differs from other [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] educational initiatives in that its [[curriculum]] is purpose designed rather than simply an [[Amalgamation (fiction)|amalgamation]] of existing disciplines.

[[Kyoto University]] in Japan has offered a formal course in Integrated Human Studies since 1992 when it reorganized its College of Liberal Arts and Sciences and renamed it the Faculty of Integrated Human Studies. This was subsequently (in 2003) integrated with the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies to create the new Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h.kyoto-u.ac.jp/soujin/index_e.php Kyoto University] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Western Australia]] established the Center for Integrated Human Studies in early 2008. This center brings together the [[science]]s, [[social science]]s, [[Arts and Humanities in Higher Education|arts and humanities]] to focus on the nature and future of humankind. Its fundamental concern is to promote human well-being at an individual, local and global level within a sustainable environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihs.uwa.edu.au Integrated Human Studies, University of Western Australia] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Integration of disciplinary fields has arisen as a response to the “increasing [[Specialization of knowledge|specialization]] of [university] courses to meet the demands of [[Technological change|technological progress]], [[economic growth]] and [[Vocational education|vocational training]]”&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Neville. [http://u08.cgpublisher.com/proposals/237/index_html Abstract for World Universities Forum] (accessed August 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the development of ever narrower fields of study at tertiary level. Proponents of integrated human studies believe that a broader, interdisciplinary approach is needed to enable future [[Decision-making|decision-makers]] to grasp the complexities of the issues facing humankind in the [[21st century]] and craft workable solutions.

From a concept originated in 1922,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironring.ca Origin of the Iron Ring concept]&lt;/ref&gt; the ring is presented to graduates in a closed ceremony known as [[The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]],&lt;ref name="ritual"&gt;"[http://www.ironring.ca/background.php The Calling of an Engineer]", ''[[The Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]'', Retrieved November 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HPa&gt;Petroski 2012, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt;  developed with the assistance of English poet [[Rudyard Kipling]].&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt;

The ring symbolizes the pride which engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer's obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. It is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer – this is determined by the provincial and territorial licensing bodies.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.camp1.ca/wordpress/?page_id=2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Material and design ==

The Iron Ring is made from either [[iron]] or [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; The first ceremony awarding the ring was held in 1925, under the supervision of [[Herbert E. T. Haultain]], professor of mining engineering  at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;

The rings are given in ceremonies held at individual universities, each assigned one of 26 camps of the [[Corporation of the Seven Wardens]]. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except [[Toronto]] have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings.  At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the [[University of Toronto]], [[University of Ottawa]], [[Ryerson University]], [[York University]] and the [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]], continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.

Many incorrectly believe that the rings are made from the steel of a beam from the first [[Quebec Bridge]], which collapsed during construction in 1907. Seventy-five construction workers died in the collapse which was attributed to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers.&lt;ref name="iron_ring"&gt;"[http://www.eir.ca/engineers/ironring.php?link=4 The Iron Ring ]", Engineer-in-Residence, ''[[Professional Engineers Ontario]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudyard Kipling]], who wrote the ritual obligation,&lt;ref name="ritual"/&gt; indicated that the Ring as an allegory in itself be rough, not smoothed, and hammered, and as a ring have no beginning nor end.  There is no evidence that there is any particular history in the source of "Cold Iron" (from the Calling of the Engineer ceremony) for the Ring, nor any intention that there should have been. Remnants of the Quebec Bridge legend still exist in Canada.&lt;ref name=HPa /&gt;&lt;ref name="ringceremony"&gt;J. Jeswiet, "[http://www.networx.on.ca/~njdevil/mainpage/E_Eng/Academic/jj-ring.htm Information Relevant to the Iron Ring Ceremony]", November 22, 2001; Retrieved November 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iron Ring is worn on the [[little finger]] ("[[pinky ring|pinky]]") of the working (dominant) hand.&lt;ref name="ringceremony"/&gt; There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one's obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers.  Some camps offer previously obligated or "experienced" rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.

The Ring itself is small and understated, designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface.  The modern machined ring design is unique, a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.

The [[Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer]] is the ceremony where Iron Rings are given to graduating engineers who choose to obligate themselves to the highest professionalism and humility of their profession. It is a symbol that reflects the moral, ethical and professional commitment made by the engineer who wears the ring.  The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. For some schools, the invitation to witness the ceremony is open to anyone in the engineering profession, and non-obligated engineers may not participate in the ritual.  Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.

== Adoption in the United States ==
[[File:Order of the Engineer Ring (Macro).jpg|thumbnail|200px|right|An example of a plain stainless steel band issued by the [[Order of the Engineer]] in the United States]]

Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the [[United States]], where the [[Order of the Engineer]]&lt;ref name="order"&gt;"[http://www.order-of-the-engineer.org/ About The Order]", ''[[Order of the Engineer]]'', Retrieved November 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an "Obligation of the Engineer"&lt;ref name="oblige"&gt;"[http://www.asce.org/uploadedFiles/Leadership_Training_-_New/OBLIGATION.pdf Obligation of the Engineer]", ''[[American Society of Civil Engineers]]''; Retrieved November 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and receives a stainless steel [[Engineer's Ring]] (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the [[Cleveland State University]] under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.&lt;ref name=HPb&gt;Petroski 2012, p.175-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JFLAP''' (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package) is interactive educational software written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 
for experimenting with topics in the [[computer science]] 
area of [[formal languages]] and [[automata theory]], primarily intended for use at the undergraduate level or as an advanced
topic for high school.  JFLAP allows one to create and simulate structures, such as programming a finite state machine, and 
experiment with proofs, such as converting a [[nondeterministic finite automaton]] (NFA) to a 
deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

JFLAP is developed and maintained at [[Duke University]], with support from the  [[National Science Foundation]] since 1993. It is [[freeware]] and the source code of the most recent version is available, but under some restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/csed/jflap/jflaptmp/aug28-09/license.html|accessdate=2 October 2016|title=JFLAP 7.0 LICENSE|author=Susan H. Rodger}}&lt;/ref&gt; JFLAP runs as a Java application.

==History==

Before JFLAP, there were several software tools related to automata theory developed by [[Susan H. Rodger]] and her students starting around 1990 
in the Computer Science Department at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]. In 1992, the first published paper at a DIMACS 2012 workshop described a related tool called NPDA 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=D. Caugherty |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1992
 |title =NPDA: A Tool for Visualizing and Simulating Nondeterministic Pushdown Automata
 |journal =DIMACS Workshop March 12–14, 1992
 |pages = 365–377
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the paper was published later in 1994 in a DIMACS series).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |author =Nathaniel Dean and Gregory E. Shannon, Editors
 |title = DIMACS Series in Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science: Computational Support for Discrete Mathematics, DIMACS Workshop, March 12-14, 1992
 |year = 1994
 |publisher =American Mathematical Society
 |volume = 15
 |location = United States of America
 |isbn =0821866052
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NPDA then evolved into FLAP, including also finite state machines and Turing machines.
In 1993, a paper on Formal Languages and Automata Package
(FLAP) was published
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. LoSacco |author2=S. H. Rodger |year = 1993
 |title = FLAP: A Tool for Drawing and Simulating Automata
 |journal =EDMEDIA '93, World Conference on Educational Multimedia and Hypermedia
 |pages = 310–317
}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the tool was written in C++ and [[X Window System|X Window]]. Around 1994, Rodger moved to 
[[Duke University]] and continued tool development. Around 1996, FLAP was converted to 
Java and the first paper mentioned JFLAP was published in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=M. Procopiuc, O. Procopiuc |author2=S. Rodger,
 |year =1996
 |title =Visualization and Interaction in the Computer Science Formal Languages Course with JFLAP
 |journal =1996 Frontiers in Education Conference
 |pages = 121–125
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Along the way, other tools were developed as stand alone tools and then later integrated into JFLAP. 
For example, a  paper in 1999 described how JFLAP now allowed one to experiment with construction
type proofs, such as converting an NFA to a DFA to a mininal state DFA, and as another example, 
converting NPDA to CFG and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=E. Gramond  |author2=S. H. Rodger,
 |year =1999
 |title =Using JFLAP to Interact with Theorems in Automata Theory
 |journal =Thirtieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 336–340
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 JFLAP was converted to Swing. In 2005-2007 a study was run with fourteen institutions using 
JFLAP. A paper on this study in 2009 showed that students using JFLAP thought JFLAP made them feel more engaged in the 
class, and made learning the concepts easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 |author1=Susan H. Rodger |author2=Eric Wiebe |author3=Kyung Min Lee |author4=Chris Morgan |author5=Kareem Omar |author6=Jonathan Su |year =2009
 |title = Increasing Engagement in Automata Theory with JFLAP
 |journal =Fortieth SIGCSE Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education
 |pages = 403–407
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of JFLAP is covered on the jflap.org site, and includes 
over 35 students from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] and [[Duke University]] who have worked on 
JFLAP and related tools since 1990.

A paper by Chakraborty, Saxena and Katti entitled "Fifty years of automata simulation: a review" 
in ACM Inroads magazine in December 2011 stated the following about JFLAP:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
 |author1=P. Chakraborty |author2=P.C. Saxena |author3=C. P. Katti |year = 2011
 |title =Fifty years of automata simulation: a review
 |journal =ACM Inroads
 |volume =2
 |issue=4
 |pages = 59–70
 |doi=10.1145/2038876.2038893
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The effort put into developing this tool is unparalleled in the field of simulation of automata. As a result, today it is the most sophisticated tool for simulating automata. It now covers a large number of topics on automata and related fields. The tool is also the best documented among the tools for simulation of automata." and "The tool uses state of the art graphics and is one of the easiest to use. The tool is undoubtedly the most widely used tool for simulation of automata developed to date. Thousands of students have used it at numerous universities in more than a hundred countries."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12710">{{about|the linguistic concept}}

A '''lexicon''', '''word-hoard''', '''wordbook''', or '''word-stock''' is the [[vocabulary]] of a person, [[language]], or branch of [[knowledge]] (such as [[nautical]] or [[medical]]).  In [[linguistics]], a '''lexicon''' is a language's inventory of [[lexeme]]s. The word "lexicon" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|λεξικόν}} (''lexicon''), neuter of {{lang|grc|λεξικός}} (''lexikos'') meaning "of or for words."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlecikos λεξικός] in Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'' (Perseus Digital Library). Sc. βιβλίον "book").&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its [[wikt:wordstock|wordstock]]); and a [[grammar]], a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include [[bound morpheme]]s, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most [[affix]]es).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=OKvziaqXzXwC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;dq=morphemes+lexicon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CB_0QMidAO&amp;sig=1YiUJnAc0kj-Pbh0V6duJhHPktg&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjl99OPt_TTAhWK0xoKHUolARo4ChDoAQgpMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=morphemes%20lexicon&amp;f=false|title=Morphological structure, lexical representation, and lexical access|last2=Taft|first2=Marcus|date=1994|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|last1=Dominiek|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some analyses, [[compound word]]s and certain classes of [[idiom]]atic expressions and other [[collocation]]s are also considered to be part of the lexicon. [[Dictionary|Dictionaries]] represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.

== Size and organization ==

Items in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, [[lexeme]]s are grouped into lemmas. A [[Lemma (morphology)|lemma]] is a group of lexemes generated by [[Inflection#Inflectional morphology|inflectional morphology]]. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the [[citation form]]s and any [[English irregular verbs|irregular forms]], since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. [[Part of speech|Closed categories]], such as [[Determiner (linguistics)|determiners]] or [[pronoun]]s, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily [[Syntax|syntactic]]. Open categories, such as [[noun]]s and [[verb]]s, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more [[Semantics|semantic]] in nature.

== Lexicalization and other mechanisms in the lexicon ==
{{anchor#Lexicalization}}

A central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established ''lexical norms and conventions''. [[Lexicalization]] is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization&lt;ref name="Geert2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Geert |first=Booij |title=The grammar of words : an introduction to linguistic morphology |series=Oxford textbooks in linguistics |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-928042-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a [[Doublet (linguistics)|doublet]], are often close semantically. Two examples are ''[[wikt:aptitude|aptitude]]'' versus ''[[wikt:attitude|attitude]]'' and ''[[wikt:employ|employ]]'' versus ''[[wikt:imply|imply]]''.&lt;ref name="Skeat 2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Skeat |first=Walter |title=A Concise Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wRGhnkZq3HQC |date=2010-04-17 |publisher=Forgotten Books |isbn=978-1-4400-5722-9 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ornan |first=Uzzi |authorlink=Uzzi Ornan |title=The Final Word — Mechanism For Hebrew Word Generation |year=2003 |publisher=Haifa University Press |location=Haifa |language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Innovation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalf |first=Allan |title=Predicting New Words — The Secrets of Their Success |year=2002 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |location=Boston |isbn=0-618-13006-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the planned creation of new roots (often on a large-scale), such as ''slang'', ''branding''.
* Borrowing of foreign words.
* [[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] (composition), the combination of lexemes to make a single word.
* [[Abbreviation]] of compounds.
* [[Acronyms]], the reduction of compounds to their initial letters, such as [[wikt:NASA|NASA]] and [[wikt:laser|laser (from "LASER")]].
* [[Inflection]], a morphology change with a category, such as number or tense.
* [[Morphological derivation|Derivation]], a morphological change resulting in a change of category.
* [[Agglutination]], the compounding of morphemes into a single word.

===Neologisms (new words)===
[[Neologism]]s are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake.&lt;ref name="Jaeger2005"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaeger |first=Jeri J. |title=Kid's slips: what young children's slips of the tongue reveal about language development |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1YGd1FkRgAC |accessdate=8 April 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-8058-3579-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.

===Neologisms that maintain the sound of their external source===
There are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] material:
* Borrowing using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization: guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords
* Borrowing using a target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization: phono-semantic matching, semanticized phonetic matching and phonetic matching.

====Guestwords, foreignisms and loanwords====
The following are examples of external lexical expansion using the [[Source language (translation)|source language]] lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]], by [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Guestword (in German: ''Gastwort''): unassimilated borrowing.
* Foreignism (in German: ''Fremdwort''): foreign word, e.g. phonetic adaptation.
* Loanword (in German: ''Lehnwort''): totally assimilated borrowing, e.g. morphemic adaptation.

====Phono-semantic matches, semanticized phonetic matches and phonetic matches====
The following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using [[Target language (translation)|target language]] lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:&lt;ref&gt;Page 8 in ''Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew'', by Ghil'ad Zuckermann, Palgrave Macmillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phono-semantic matching]] (PSM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item both phonetically and semantically.
* Semanticized phonetic matching (SPM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically, and only in a loose way semantically.
* Phonetic matching (PM): the target language material is originally similar to the source language lexical item phonetically but not semantically.

===Role of morphology===
Another mechanism involves [[Generative grammar|generative]] devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the [[Suffix (linguistics)|suffix]] "-able" is usually only added to [[transitive verb]]s, as in "readable" but not "cryable".

===Compounding===
A compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through [[analogy]], [[Pragmatics|common sense and, most commonly, context]].&lt;ref name="Geert2005" /&gt; Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound.&lt;ref name="Maity2016"&gt;Suman Kalyan Maity, Ritvik Saraf and Animesh Mukherjee (2016). #Bieber + #Blast = #BieberBlast: Early Prediction of Popular Hashtag Compounds. In ''ACM CSCW'', San Francisco, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. 

== Diachronic mechanisms ==

Comparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a [[Historical linguistics|diachronic]] view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to  shape the lexicon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deutscher |first=Guy |authorlink=Guy Deutscher (linguist) |title=The Unfolding of Language: An Evolutionary Tour of Mankind's Greatest Invention  |date=May 19, 2005 |publisher=Metropolitan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.
* [[Assimilation (linguistics)|Phonological assimilation]], the modification of loanwords to fit a new language's sound structure more effectively. If, however, a loanword sounds too "foreign", inflection or derivation rules may not be able to transform it.
* [[Analogy]], where new words undergo inflection and derivation analogous to that of words with a similar sound structure.
* [[Stress (linguistics)|Emphasis]], the modification of words' stress or accenting.
* [[Metaphor]], a form of semantic extension.

== Second-language lexicon ==
{{main|Bilingual lexical access}}

The term "lexicon" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants ([[Brazilian Portuguese]] and [[European Portuguese]], for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a ''[[wikt:cash dispenser|cash dispenser]]'' (British English) as well as an  [[wikt:automatic teller machine|automatic teller machine]] or [[wikt:ATM|ATM]] in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.

When linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/[[concept]] relationship; [[lexical access]] and lexical access failure; how a word's [[phonology]], [[syntax]], and meaning intersect; the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use ([[pragmatics]]); [[language acquisition]]; the history and evolution of words ([[etymology]]); and the relationships between words, often studied within [[philosophy of language]].

Various models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in [[psycholinguistics]], [[neurolinguistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9723">The following is a '''list of the presidents and executive secretaries of the [[Religious Education Association]]'''.

The [[Religious Education Association]] is a nonprofit member association, serving as a professional and learned society for scholars and researchers involved in the field of religious education.  In 2003 it merged formally with the Association of Professors and Researchers in Religious Education. Up until that date, REA presidents could serve for more than a year at a time, while APRRE presidents served for only one year at a time. At the moment of merger, presidential terms were limited to one year and "practitioners" was added to the title of the organization, making it the "Religious Education Association: An Association of Professors, Practitioners and Researchers in Religious Education" (REA: APPRRE).

{{About|biological molecular motors|man-made molecular motors|Synthetic molecular motor}}
'''Molecular motors''' are biological [[molecular machine]]s that are the essential agents of movement in living organisms. In general terms, a [[Engine|motor]] is a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or [[mechanical work]]; for example, many [[protein]]-based molecular motors harness the chemical [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] released by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in order to perform mechanical work.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bustamante C, Chemla YR, Forde NR, Izhaky D |title=Mechanical processes in biochemistry |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=73 |issue= |pages=705–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15189157 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of energetic efficiency, this type of motor can be superior to currently available man-made motors. One important difference between molecular motors and macroscopic motors is that molecular motors operate in the [[Thermal bath (thermodynamics)|thermal bath]], an environment in which the [[Thermal fluctuations|fluctuations]] due to [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|thermal noise]] are significant.

** [[Myosin]]s are responsible for muscle contraction, intracellular cargo transport, and producing cellular tension.

== Theoretical considerations ==
Because the motor events are [[stochastic]], molecular motors are often modeled with the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] or with [[Monte Carlo method]]s. These theoretical models are especially useful when treating the molecular motor as a [[Brownian motor]].

== Experimental observation ==
In experimental [[biophysics]], the activity of molecular motors is observed with many different experimental approaches, among them:

* Fluorescent methods: fluorescence resonance energy transfer ([[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer|FRET]]), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ([[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy|FCS]]), total internal reflection fluorescence ([[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]]).
* [[Magnetic tweezers]] can also be useful for analysis of motors that operate on long pieces of DNA.
* [[Neutron spin echo]] spectroscopy can be used to observe motion on nanosecond timescales.
* [[Optical tweezers]] (not to be confused with [[molecular tweezers]] in context) are well-suited for studying molecular motors because of their low spring constants.
* Scattering techniques: single particle tracking based on [[dark field microscopy]] or [[interferometric scattering microscopy]] (iSCAT)
* Single-molecule [[electrophysiology]] can be used to measure the dynamics of individual ion channels.

Many more techniques are also used. As new technologies and methods are developed, it is expected that knowledge of naturally occurring molecular motors will be helpful in constructing synthetic nanoscale motors.

== Non-biological ==
{{Main|Synthetic molecular motor}}
Recently, [[chemists]] and those involved in [[nanotechnology]] have begun to explore the possibility of creating molecular motors ''de novo.'' These [[synthetic molecular motors]] currently suffer many limitations that confine their use to the research laboratory. However, many of these limitations may be overcome as our understanding of chemistry and physics at the nanoscale increases. One step toward understanding nanoscale dynamics was made with the study of catalyst diffusion in the Grubb's catalyst system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dey|first=Krishna Kanti|last2=Pong|first2=Frances Ying|last3=Breffke|first3=Jens|last4=Pavlick|first4=Ryan|last5=Hatzakis|first5=Emmanuel|last6=Pacheco|first6=Carlos|last7=Sen|first7=Ayusman|date=2016|editor4-last=|title=Dynamic Coupling at the Angstrçm Scale|url=|journal=Angew. Chem.|volume=128|pages=1125–1129|doi=10.1002/ange.201509237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems like the [[nanocar]]s, while not technically motors, are also illustrative of recent efforts towards synthetic nanoscale motors. 

Other non-reacting molecules can also behave as motors. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guha|first=Rajarshi|last2=Mohajerani|first2=Farzad|last3=Collins|first3=Matthew|last4=Ghosh|first4=Subhadip|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|date=2017-10-24|title=Chemotaxis of Molecular Dyes in Polymer Gradients in Solution|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b08783|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=139|issue=44|pages=15588–15591|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b08783|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PC power management''' refers to the mechanism for controlling the power use of [[personal computer hardware]].  This is typically through the use of software that puts the hardware into the lowest power demand state available.  It is an aspect of [[Green computing]].

A typical office PC might use on the order of 90 watts when active (approximately 50 watts for the base unit, and 40 watts for a typical LCD screen); and three to four watts when ‘asleep’. Up to 10% of a modern office’s electricity demand might be due to PCs and monitors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Sleepless of Seattle; Why Windows Power Management Doesn't Always Work, Mark Blackburn, Strategy Analyst, 1E, January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some PCs allow low power settings, there are many situations, especially in a networked environment, where processes running on the computer will prevent the low power settings from taking effect.  This can have a dramatic effect on energy use that is invisible to the user. The monitor may have gone into standby mode, and the PC may appear to be idle, but operational testing has shown that on any given day an average of over 50% of an organisation's computers would fail to go to sleep, and over time this happened to over 90% of the machines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Windows 'Insomnia' (Sleepless PCs) ==
The Windows power management system is based upon an idle timer. If the computer is idle for longer than the preset timeout then the PC may be configured to sleep or hibernate. The user may configure the timeout using the Control Panel. Windows uses a combination of user activity and CPU activity to determine when the computer is idle.

Applications can temporarily inhibit this timer by using the ''SetThreadExecutionState'' API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa373208(VS.85).aspx |title= SetThreadExecutionState Function |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are legitimate reasons why this may be necessary such as burning a DVD or playing a video. However, in many cases applications can unnecessarily prevent power management from working. This is commonly known as Windows 'Insomnia' and can be a significant barrier to successfully implementing power management.

Common causes of 'insomnia' include:

* Legacy or non-power management aware applications
* Open file handles on remote computers
* Faulty mice which can cause pointer drift. This makes the operating system believe that a user is present
* Scheduled maintenance tasks causing significant CPU activity
* High network activity

== Software solutions ==
Operating systems have built-in settings to control power use.  [[Microsoft Windows]] supports predefined power plans and custom [[Sleep mode|sleep]] and [[hibernation (computing)|hibernation]] settings through a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] Power Options applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-create-delete-power-plan-scheme#1TC=windows-7 |title= Windows 10 help|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's [[OS X]] includes idle and sleep configuration settings through the Energy Saver [[System Preferences]] applet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201714 | title= Use the Energy Saver settings on your Mac|publisher=Apple|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, [[Linux distribution]]s include a variety of power management settings and tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Power_management | title= Power management|publisher=ArchLinux|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant market in third-party [[Comparison of power management software suites|PC power management software]] offering features beyond those present in the Windows operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/buyers-guide/Power-Management-Software-for-Windows-Workstations-Buyers-Guide.aspx|title=Power Management Software for Windows Workstations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=power_mgt.pr_power_mgt_comm_packages|title=Energy Star Commercial Packages List}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|author=The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|title=HMC: A Practical Guide to Sustainable Building for Schools|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315230900/http://www.hmcsustainability.org.uk/energy.html|archivedate=15 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Products are targeted at enterprise environments offering [[Active Directory]] integration and per-user/per-machine settings with the more advanced offering multiple power plans, scheduled power plans, anti-insomnia features and enterprise power usage reporting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">The '''reading span task''' ('''RST''') is a common [[memory span]] task widely cited in, and adapted for, investigations of [[working memory]], [[cognitive processing]], and [[reading comprehension]] that was first published by [[Meredyth Daneman]] and [[Patricia Carpenter]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=daneman&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Carpenter, P. A. (1980). Individual differences in working memory and reading. [[Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior]], 19(4), 450-466.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task==

===Original===

The original RST required participants to read series of unconnected sentences aloud and to remember the final word of each sentence of a series (grouped according to the total number of sentences). With each sentence presented on a card, participants were cued to recall the memorized end-of-sentence words in their original order by a blank card at the end of a series. The number of sentences of a series was incrementally increased until a participant's reading span, or the maximum number of final words correctly recalled, was found.

The reading span task was the first instance of the family of "complex span" tasks (as opposed to "simple span" tasks). It is a complex verbal test because it draws upon both storage and processing (i.e., reading) elements of working memory, while simple verbal tests (e.g., word span) require the storage element alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lobley, K.J., Baddeley, A.D., &amp; Gathercole, S.E. (2005). Phonological similarity effects in verbal complex span. ''The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'', ''58A'', 1462–1478.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===

Besides the "listening span" variant also developed by Daneman and Carpenter,&lt;ref name=daneman /&gt; several variants have been developed in recent years based upon the RST.&lt;ref&gt;Desmette, D., Hupet, M., Schelstraete, M.A., &amp; Van der Linden, M.

===Problems===

In an attempt to formulate a standardized version of the RST, numerous problems with the original and variants of it have been critically examined.

==Findings==

Daneman and Carpenter found that reading span was much more strongly related to reading comprehension than word span. Later research corroborated the finding that reading span is more closely related to language comprehension than word span.&lt;ref&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Merikle, P. M. (1996). Working memory and language comprehension: a meta-analysis. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 3, 422-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological basis===

In a twin study of middle-aged men, a heritability rating of .51 was found for reading span, where genetic influences came from a common latent phenotype, viewed as most likely reflecting an executive function component.&lt;ref&gt;Kremen, W., Jacobsen, K., Xian, H., Eisen, S., Eaves, L., Tsuang, M., et al. (2007). Genetics of verbal working memory processes: A twin study of middle-aged men. ''Neuropsychology'', ''21''(5), 569-580. {{doi|10.1037/0894-4105.21.5.569}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Salt]] consumption has been intensely studied for its role in human physiology and impact on human health. In particular, excessive dietary salt consumption over an extended period of time has been associated with [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]], in addition to other adverse health effects.&lt;ref name="millen"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://advances.nutrition.org/content/7/3/438.long | title=The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Scientific Report: Development and Major Conclusions | author=Barbara E Millen, Steve Abrams, Lucile Adams-Campbell, Cheryl AM Anderson, J Thomas Brenna, Wayne W Campbell, Steven Clinton, Frank Hu, Miriam Nelson, Marian L Neuhouser, Rafael Perez-Escamilla, Anna Maria Siega-Riz, Mary Story, Alice H Lichtenstein | journal=Adv Nutr | year=2016 | volume=7 | pages=438–444 | doi=10.3945/an.116.012120|pmid=27184271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Sodium Reduction: An Important Public Health Strategy for Heart Health | author=Mugavero KL, Gunn JP, Dunet DO, Bowman BA | journal=J Public Health Manag Pract | year=2014 | volume=20 | issue=101 | pages=S1-S5 | doi=10.1097/PHH.0b013e3182aa659c | pmid=24322810 | pmc=4450095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;

== Effect of salt on blood pressure ==

[[File:Automatische bloeddrukmeter (0).jpg|thumb|Automated blood pressure device]]

The human body has evolved to balance salt intake with need through means such as the [[renin–angiotensin system]]. In humans, salt has important biological functions. Relevant to risk of cardiovascular disease, salt is highly involved with the maintenance of [[body fluid]] volume, including [[osmotic balance]] in the blood, [[extracellular]] and [[intracellular]] fluids, and resting membrane potential.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Bengt |title=Regulation of body fluids |journal=Annual Review of Physiology |volume=39 |pages=185–200 |year=1977 |last1=Andersson |pmid=322597 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ph.39.030177.001153 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The well known effect of sodium on blood pressure can be explained by comparing blood to a [[solution]] with its [[salinity]] changed by ingested salt. [[Artery walls]] are analogous to a [[selectively permeable membrane]], and they allow solutes, including sodium and chloride, to pass through (or not), depending on [[osmosis]].

Circulating water and [[solutes]] in the body maintain blood pressure in the blood, as well as other functions such as regulation of [[body temperature]]. When salt is ingested, it is dissolved in the blood as two separate ions – Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[water potential]] in blood will decrease due to the increase solutes, and blood [[osmotic pressure]] will increase. While the kidney reacts to excrete excess sodium and chloride in the body, [[Water retention (medicine)|water retention]] causes blood pressure to increase.&lt;ref name="Blaustein"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=324293 |last1=Blaustein |first1=MP |year=1977 |pages=C165–73 |issue=5 |volume=232 |title=Sodium ions, calcium ions, blood pressure regulation, and hypertension: a reassessment and a hypothesis |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |url=http://ajpcell.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=324293 |doi=10.1152/ajpcell.1977.232.5.c165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DASH-Sodium study ===
{{Main article|DASH diet}}

The DASH-Sodium study was a sequel to the original [[DASH diet|DASH]] (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) study. Both studies were designed and conducted by the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]] in the United States, each involving a large, randomized sample.&lt;ref name="Karanja N 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Karanja |first1=N. |last2=Erlinger |first2=T P |last3=Pao-Hwa |first3=L. |last4=Miller |first4=E. R |last5=Bray |first5=G. A |title=The DASH diet for high blood pressure: from clinical trial to dinner table |journal=Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=745–53 |year=2004 |pmid=15478706 |doi=10.3949/ccjm.71.9.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the original study was designed to test the effects of several varying nutrients on blood pressure, DASH-Sodium varies only in salt content in the diet.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sacks |first1=Frank M. |last2=Svetkey |first2=Laura P. |last3=Vollmer |first3=William M. |last4=Appel |first4=Lawrence J. |last5=Bray |first5=George A. |last6=Harsha |first6=David |last7=Obarzanek |first7=Eva |last8=Conlin |first8=Paul R. |last9=Miller |first9=Edgar R. |title=Effects on Blood Pressure of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=344 |issue=1 |pages=3–10 |year=2001 |pmid=11136953 |doi=10.1056/NEJM200101043440101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants were pre-hypertensive or at stage 1 hypertension, and either ate a DASH-Diet or a diet reflecting an "average American Diet". During the intervention phase, participants ate their assigned diets containing three distinct levels of sodium in random order. Their blood pressure is monitored during the control period, and at all three intervention phases.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt;

The study concluded that the effect of a reduced dietary sodium intake alone on blood pressure is substantial, and that the largest decrease in blood pressure occurred in those eating the DASH eating plan at the lowest sodium level (1,500 milligrams per day).&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt; However, this study is especially significant because participants in both the control and DASH diet group showed lowered blood pressure with decreased sodium alone.&lt;ref name="Karanja N 2004"/&gt;

In agreement with studies regarding salt sensitivity, participants of African descent showed high reductions in blood pressure. See [[Salt and cardiovascular disease#Sodium sensitivity|sodium sensitivity]] below.&lt;ref name="Sacks F 2001"/&gt;

== Hypertension and cardiovascular disease ==

There has been strong evidence from [[epidemiological studies]], human and animal intervention experiments supporting the links between high rate of salt intake and hypertension.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cappuccio"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cappuccio |first1=F.

More data is needed to support the conclusions of observational studies which suffer from design flaws.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; Many of these studies are not large enough, nor last long enough to provide conclusions on clinical outcomes for the effect of dietary sodium intake on morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; Previous mixed results and inconclusive interpretation of non-experimental studies may also root from the way sodium is measured in the study.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; The study by Cook and colleagues itself was unable to isolate only a change in sodium. The techniques to reduce sodium included keeping a food diary and reading labels. Cook and colleagues listed other effects of those techniques, including a reduction in fat and calories per day (11g, 200cal), and weight loss of 1 to 3 pounds.&lt;ref name="tohp1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Feasibility and Efficacy of Sodium Reduction in the Trials of Hypertension Prevention, Phase I|journal=Hypertension|year=1993 | doi=10.1161/01.hyp.22.4.502|volume=22|pages=502–512}}.

=== Current trends and campaigns ===

The [[World Health Organization]] issued a 2014 fact sheet to encourage reducing global salt consumption by 30% through 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs393/en/ | title=Salt reduction | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | work=Fact sheet | date=September 2014 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the United States [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] began an initiative encouraging Americans to reduce their consumption of salty foods.&lt;ref name="cdc-init"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/sodiumreductioninitiative.pdf | title=CDC’s Sodium Reduction Initiative: Saving Lives and Money | publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=December 2015 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Heart Association]] defined a daily sodium consumption limit should be 1500 milligrams (contained in less than 0.75 [[teaspoon]] of table salt).&lt;ref name="aha"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/HighBloodPressure/PreventionTreatmentofHighBloodPressure/Shaking-the-Salt-Habit_UCM_303241_Article.jsp#.V1nWYNQrJkg | title=Shaking the Salt Habit | publisher=American Heart Association | date=2016 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2012 [[Health Canada]] report, Canadians in all age groups are consuming 3400&amp;nbsp;mg per day of sodium, more than twice as much as needed.&lt;ref name="hc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/nutrition/sodium/index-eng.php | title=Sodium in Canada | publisher=Health Canada | work=Food and Nutrition | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] stated that the average daily sodium intake for Americans over 2 years of age is 3436&amp;nbsp;milligrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/pdfs/Sodium_Fact_Sheet.pdf | title=Sodium: The facts | publisher=US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date=April 2016 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of sodium consumed by North Americans is from processed and restaurant foods, while only a small portion is added during cooking or at the table.&lt;ref name="cdc-init"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=RD |last2=Donnelly |first2=D |title=Relative contributions of dietary sodium sources |journal=Journal of the American College of Nutrition |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=383–93 |year=1991 |pmid=1910064 |doi=10.1080/07315724.1991.10718167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], half of the member states legislated change in the form of taxation, mandatory nutrition labeling, and regulated nutrition and health claims to address overconsumption of sodium&lt;ref name="kloss"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352364615000024 | title=Sodium intake and its reduction by food reformulation in the European Union — A review | author=Kloss L, Meyer JD, Graeve L, Vetter W | journal=Nutrition &amp; Food Science Journal (NFS Journal) | year=2015 | volume=1 | pages=9–19 | doi=10.1016/j.nfs.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a 2012 EU Salt Reduction Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/nutrition_physical_activity/docs/salt_report1_en.pdf | title=Survey on Members States’ Implementation of the EU Salt Reduction Framework | publisher=[[European Commission]] | date=2012 | accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate about sodium as a health problem ===

Despite few claims to the contrary, most physicians and clinical scientists, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] and the US [[Centers for Disease Control]] recommend that consumers use less salt in their diets, mainly to reduce the risk of high blood pressure and associated cardiovascular diseases in adults and children.&lt;ref name=nih/&gt;&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.cdc.gov/salt/index.htm | title=Salt | publisher=US Centers for Disease Control | work=National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention | date=1 June 2016 | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/press/news/050622 | title=EFSA provides advice on adverse effects of sodium | publisher=European Food Safety Authority | date=22 June 2005 | accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited group of researchers has cast doubts on the generally accepted theory that lowering sodium intake will improve the health of a given population.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Rather than create drastic salt policies based on conflicting data, Alderman and his colleague Hillel Cohen propose that the government sponsor a large, controlled clinical trial to see what happens to people who follow low-salt diets over time. Appel responds that such a trial "cannot and will not be done," in part because it would be so expensive. But unless we have clear data, evangelical antisalt campaigns are not just based on shaky science; they are ultimately unfair. "A great number of promises are being made to the public with regard to this enormous benefit and lives saved," Cohen says. But it is "based on wild extrapolations."&lt;ref&gt;"It is Time to End the War on Salt: The zealous drive by politicians to limit our salt intake has little basis in science."''Scientific American'' Jul 8, 2011. Melinda Wenner Moyer. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/its-time-to-end-the-war-on-salt/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Taken together, our current findings refute the estimates of computer models of lives saved and health care costs reduced with lower salt intake. They do also not support the current recommendations of a generalized and indiscriminate reduction of salt intake at the population level. However, they do not negate the blood pressure-lowering effects of a dietary salt reduction in hypertensive patients."&lt;ref&gt;"Fatal and Nonfatal Outcomes, Incidence of Hypertension, and Blood Pressure Changes in Relation to Urinary Sodium Excretion" ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]''. Stolarz-Skrzypek, et al. May 4, 2011. [http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=899663]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The traditional Japanese diet is very high in salt intake and yet, the Japanese had the highest rate of longevity in the world, and low rates of cardiovascular disease. ". . .we have found that the Japanese dietary pattern is associated with lower CVD mortality, despite the fact that the Japanese dietary pattern appeared to be related to higher sodium intake and high prevalence of hypertension."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shimazu Taichi | year = | title = Dietary patterns and cardiovascular disease mortality in Japan: a prospective cohort study | url = http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/36/3/600.full | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 600–609 | doi=10.1093/ije/dym005|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other adverse cardiovascular effects===
Some studies have shown that salt consumption has been found to increase the risk of [[myocardial infarction]], [[stroke]], [[arterial stiffness]] and [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=cdc/&gt;&lt;ref name="susic"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Susic|first1=D|last2=Frohlich|first2=ED|title=Salt consumption and cardiovascular, renal, and hypertensive diseases: clinical and mechanistic aspects.|journal=Current Opinion in Lipidology|date=February 2012|volume=23|issue=1|pages=11–6|doi=10.1097/MOL.0b013e32834d9c52|pmid=22123673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a few studies, both high (more than 7 g/day) and low salt intake (less than 3 g/day) were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease&lt;ref name="mente_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mente Andrew | year = | title = Associations of urinary sodium excretion with cardiovascular events in individuals with and without hypertension: a pooled analysis of data from four studies | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)30467-6/abstract | journal = The Lancet | volume =  388| issue = | pages =  465–75| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)30467-6 |display-authors=etal | pmid=27216139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased mortality.&lt;ref name="graudal_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Graudal N., Jürgens G., Baslund B., Alderman M.H. | year = | title = Compared with usual sodium intake, low- and excessive-sodium diets are associated with increased mortality: a meta-analysis | journal = Am.

== Sodium sensitivity ==

A diet high in sodium increases the risk of hypertension in people with sodium sensitivity, corresponding to an increase in health risks associated with hypertensions including cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morimoto |first1=A |last2=Uzu |first2=T |last3=Fujii |first3=T |last4=Nishimura |first4=M |last5=Kuroda |first5=S |last6=Nakamura |first6=S |last7=Inenaga |first7=T |last8=Kimura |first8=G |title=Sodium sensitivity and cardiovascular events in patients with essential hypertension |journal=The Lancet |volume=350 |pages=1734–7 |year=1997 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(97)05189-1 |issue=9093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, there is no universal definition of sodium sensitivity; the method to assess sodium sensitivity varies from one study to another. In most studies, sodium sensitivity is defined as the change in mean blood pressure corresponding to a decrease or increase of sodium intake. The method to assess sodium sensitivity includes the measurement of circulating fluid volume and peripheral vascular resistance. Several studies have shown a relationship between sodium sensitivity and the increase of circulating fluid volume or peripheral vascular resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wedler |first1=B |last2=Wiersbitzki |first2=M |last3=Gruska |first3=S |last4=Wolf |first4=E |last5=Luft |first5=FC |title=Definitions and characteristics of salt-sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure: should the diagnosis depend on diastolic blood pressure? |journal=Clinical and experimental hypertension. Part A, Theory and practice |volume=14 |issue=6 |pages=1037–49 |year=1992 |pmid=1424217 |doi=10.3109/10641969209038191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of factors have been found to be associated with sodium sensitivity. Demographic factors which affect sodium sensitivity include race, gender, and age.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in humans |journal=Hypertension |volume=27 |issue=3 Pt 2 |pages=481–90 |year=1996 |pmid=8613190 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.27.3.481}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that the American population of African descent are significantly more salt sensitive than Caucasians.&lt;ref name="Sebastian A 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morris Jr |first1=RC |last2=Sebastian |first2=A |last3=Forman |first3=A |last4=Tanaka |first4=M |last5=Schmidlin |first5=O |title=Normotensive salt sensitivity: effects of race and dietary potassium |journal=Hypertension |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=18–23 |year=1999 |pmid=9931076 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.33.1.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are found to be more sodium sensitive than men; one possible explanation is based on the fact that women have a tendency to consume more salt per unit weight, as women weigh less than men on average.&lt;ref name="Sebastian A 1999"/&gt; Several studies have shown that the increase in age is also associated with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt;

The difference in genetic makeup and family history has a significant impact on salt sensitivity, and is being studied more with improvement on the efficiencies and techniques of genetic testing.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; In both hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, those with haptoglobin 1-1 phenotype are more likely to have sodium sensitivity than people with haptoglobin 2-1 or 2-2 phenotypes. More specifically, haptoglobin 2-2 phenotypes contribute to the characteristic of sodium-resistance in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weinberger |first1=MH |last2=Miller |first2=JZ |last3=Fineberg |first3=NS |last4=Luft |first4=FC |last5=Grim |first5=CE |last6=Christian |first6=JC |title=Association of haptoglobin with sodium sensitivity and resistance of blood pressure |journal=Hypertension |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=443–6 |year=1987 |pmid=3653973 |doi=10.1161/01.hyp.10.4.443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, prevalence of a family history of hypertension is strongly linked with the occurrence of sodium sensitivity.

The influence of physiological factors including renal function and insulin levels on sodium sensitivity are shown in various studies.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; One study concludes that the effect of renal failure on sodium sensitivity is substantial due to the contribution of decreasing the Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in the kidney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koomans, HA |last2=Roos |first2=JC |last3=Boer |first3=P |last4=Geyskes |first4=GG |last5=Mees |first5=EJ |pmid=7040224 |title=Salt sensitivity of blood pressure in chronic renal failure. Evidence for renal control of body fluid distribution in man |year=1982 |pages=190–7 |issue=2 |volume=4 |journal=Hypertension |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7040224 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.4.2.190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, insulin resistance is found to be related to sodium sensitivity; however, the actual mechanism is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Suzuki, Masaaki |last2=Kimura |first2=Y |last3=Tsushima |first3=M |last4=Harano |first4=Y |pmid=10775552 |title=Association of Insulin Resistance With Salt Sensitivity and Nocturnal Fall of Blood Pressure |year=2000 |pages=864–8 |issue=4 |volume=35 |journal=Hypertension |url=http://hyper.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10775552 |doi=10.1161/01.HYP.35.4.864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Potassium and hypertension ==

[[File:2009-07-22-salzverkostung-by-RalfR-03.jpg|thumb|Different salts contain different minerals contents]]

Possible mechanisms by which high intakes of dietary potassium can decrease risk of hypertension and instances of cardiovascular disease have been proposed but not extensively studied.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7733391 |last1=Young |first1=DB |year=1995 |pages=R825–37 |issue=4 Pt 2 |last2=Lin |volume=268 |journal=The American Journal of Physiology |first2=H |last3=McCabe |first3=RD |title=Potassium's cardiovascular protective mechanisms |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=7733391}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies have found a strong inverse association between long-term adequate to high rates of potassium intake and the development of cardiovascular diseases.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The recommended dietary intake of potassium is higher than that of sodium.&lt;ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=AW Caggiula |last2=Wing |first2=RR |last3=Nowalk |first3=MP |last4=Milas |first4=NC |last5=Lee |first5=S |last6=Langford |first6=H |title=The measurement of sodium and potassium intake |pmid=4036845 |date=1985-09-01 |pages=391–8 |issue=3 |volume=42 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=4036845}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, the average absolute intake of potassium of studied populations is lower than that of sodium intake.&lt;ref name="Caggiula, AW 1985"/&gt; According to Statistics Canada, Canadians' potassium intake in all age groups are lower than recommended, while sodium intake greatly exceed recommended intake in every age group.&lt;ref&gt;2004 Canadian Community Health Survey – Nutrition.http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/82-003-x/2006004/article/sodium/4148995-eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been hypothesized that the ratio of potassium to sodium intake accounts for the large difference in the occurrence of hypertension between primitive cultures eating diets made up of mostly unprocessed foods and Western diets which tend to include highly processed foods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Salt substitutes==
{{Main article|Salt substitute}}

The growing awareness of excessive sodium consumption in connection with hypertension and cardiovascular disease has increased the usage of salt substitutes at both a consumer and industrial level.&lt;ref name="meat"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Desmond |first1=E |title=Reducing salt: A challenge for the meat industry |journal=Meat Science |volume=74 |pages=188–96 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2006.04.014 |pmid=22062728 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a consumer level, salt substitutes, which usually substitute a portion of sodium chloride content with [[potassium chloride]], can be used to increase the potassium to sodium consumption ratio.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; This change has been shown to blunt the effects of excess salt intake on hypertension and cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name=millen/&gt;&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; It has also been suggested that salt substitutes can be used to provide an essential portion of daily potassium intake, and may even be more economical than prescription potassium supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sopko |first1=J. A. |title=Salt substitutes as a source of potassium |journal=JAMA |volume=238 |pages=608–10 |year=1977 |doi=10.1001/jama.238.7.608 |issue=7 |pmid=577961 |last2=Freeman |first2=RM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the food industry, processes have been developed to create low-sodium versions of existing products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sofos |first1=John N. |title=Influence of Sodium Tripolyphosphate on the Binding and Antimicrobial Properties of Reduced NaCl-Comminuted Meat Products |journal=Journal of Food Science |volume=50 |pages=1379–83 |year=1985 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1985.tb10481.x |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=A Engstrom |last2=Tobelmann |first2=RC |last3=Albertson |first3=AM |title=Sodium intake trends and food choices |pmid=9022569 |date=1997-02-01 |pages=704S–707S |issue=2 |volume=65 |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9022569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[meat industry]] especially have developed and fine-tuned methods to decrease salt contents in processed meats without sacrificing consumer acceptance.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; Research demonstrates that salt substitutes such as potassium chloride, and synergistic compounds such as [[phosphates]], can be used to decrease salt content in meat products.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

There have been concerns with certain populations' use of potassium chloride as a substitute for salt as high potassium loads are dangerous for groups with [[diabetes]], [[Nephropathy|renal diseases]], or heart failure.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt; The use of salts with minerals such as natural salts have also been tested, but like salt substitutes partially containing potassium, mineral salts produce a bitter taste above certain levels.&lt;ref name="meat"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1492">In [[systems science]], a  '''sampled-data system''' is a [[control system]] in which a continuous-time [[plant (control theory)|plant]] is controlled with a digital device. Under periodic [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampling]], the sampled-data system is time-varying but also periodic; thus, it may be modeled by a simplified discrete-time system obtained by discretizing the plant. However, this discrete model does not capture the inter-sample behavior of the real system, which may be critical in a number of applications.

The analysis of sampled-data systems incorporating full-time information leads to challenging control problems with a rich mathematical structure. Many of these problems have only been solved recently.

{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiosphere''' is the sphere of [[semiosis]] in which [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] processes operate in the set of all interconnected [[Umwelt]]en. The concept was coined by [[Yuri Lotman]] in 1984 and is now applied to many fields, including cultural semiotics generally, [[biosemiotics]], zoosemiotics, geosemiotics, etc. The concept is treated more fully in the collection of Lotman's writings published in English under the title "Universe of the Mind: A Semiotic Theory of Culture"(1990)

==Discussion==
Juri Lotman, a semiotician at [[Tartu University]], Estonia, was inspired by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s terms [[biosphere]] and [[noosphere]] to propose that a semiosphere comes into being when any two [[Umwelt]]en are communicating.{{huh|date=June 2017}} Later, [[Jesper Hoffmeyer]] suggested a variation to the effect that the [[community]] of [[organism]]s occupying the semiosphere will inhabit a "semiotic [[ecological niche|niche]]". This implies that the semiosphere may be partially independent of the Umwelten. [[Kalevi Kull]] argues that this suggestion is not consistent with the nature of semiosis which can only be a product of the behaviour of the organisms in the environment. It is the organisms that create the signs which become the constituent parts of the semiosphere. This is not an adaptation to the existing environment, but the continuous creation of a new environment. Kull believes that it is only possible to accept Hoffmeyer's view as an analogy to the concept of an ecological niche as it is traditionally used in [[biology]], so that the community develops according to the semiotic understanding of the processes which are responsible for the building of Umwelt.

The '''sense of agency''' ('''SA'''), or '''sense of control''', is the [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] of initiating, executing, and controlling one's own [[volition (psychology)|volition]]al actions in the world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2003). The mechanism of self-recognition in human. Behavioural Brain Research, 142, 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the pre-reflective awareness or implicit sense that it is I who is executing bodily movement(s) or thinking thoughts. In normal, non-pathological experience, the SA is tightly integrated with one's "[[sense of ownership]]" (SO), which is the [[pre-reflective awareness]] or [[implicit sense]] that one is the owner of an action, movement or thought. If someone else were to move your arm (while you remained passive) you would certainly have sensed that it were your arm that moved and thus a sense of ownership (SO) for that movement. However, you would not have felt that you were the author of the movement; you would not have a sense of agency (SA).&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00&gt;Gallagher, S. (2000). Philosophical conceptions of the self: implications for cognitive science. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4, 14–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally SA and SO are tightly integrated, such that while typing one has an enduring, embodied, and tacit sense that "my own fingers are doing the moving" (SO) ''and'' that "the typing movements are controlled (or volitionally directed) by me" (SA). In patients suffering from certain forms of pathological experience (i.e., [[schizophrenia]]) the integration of SA and SO may become disrupted in some manner. In this case, movements may be executed or thoughts made manifest, for which the schizophrenic patient has a sense of ownership, but not a sense of agency.{{citation needed lead|date=September 2014}}

Regarding SA for both motor movements and thoughts, further distinctions may be found in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience&lt;ref&gt;Tsakiris M, Schütz-Bosbach S, Gallagher S (2007) On agency and body-ownership: phenomenological and neurocognitive reflections. Conscious Cogn 16:645–660&lt;/ref&gt; and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00&gt;Stephens, G. L., &amp; Graham, G. (2000). ''When self-consciousness breaks: Alien voices and inserted thoughts''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; this is an example of SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions ''themselves''. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements ''per se'' but rather, I am involved with the task at hand.  If I'm subsequently asked if I just performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious "attribution" of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, ''pre''-reflective "sense" of agency.

==Definition==
The concept of [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] implies an active organism, one who desires, makes plans, and carries out actions.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M. (1990). Intention, consciousness, desires and development. Psychological Inquiry, 1, 278–283.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of agency plays a pivotal role in cognitive development, including the first stage of self-awareness (or pre-theoretical experience of one's own mentality), which scaffolds [[theory of mind]] capacities.&lt;ref name=Rochat99&gt;Rochat, P. (1999). Early Social Cognition: Understanding Others in the First Months of Life. Mahawah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} Indeed, the ability to recognize oneself as the agent of a behavior is the way the self builds as an entity independent from the external world.&lt;ref name=JeannerodBBR03/&gt; The sense of agency and its scientific study has important implications in [[social cognition]], [[moral reasoning]], and [[psychopathology]]. The conceptual distinction between SA and SO was defined by philosopher and phenomenologist [[Shaun Gallagher]].&lt;ref name=GallagherTICS00/&gt; Using a different terminology, essentially the same distinction has been made by John Campbell,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John (1999): "Schizophrenia, the Space of Reasons, and Thinking as a Motor Process." Monist 82 (4), 609–625.&lt;/ref&gt; and Lynn Stephens and George Graham.&lt;ref name=StephensGraham00/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

==Neuroscience==
A number of experiments in normal individuals has been undertaken in order to determine the functional anatomy of the sense of agency. These experiments have consistently documented the role of the posterior [[parietal cortex]] as a critical link within the simulation network for self-recognition. Primary sources have reported that activation of the right inferior parietal lobe/temporoparietal junction correlates with the subjective sense of ownership in action execution,&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Georgieff, N., Frith, C. D., Decety, J., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2003). Modulating the experience of agency: a positron emission tomography study. NeuroImage 18, 324–333.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Ruby, P., &amp; Decety, J. (2001). Effect of subjective perspective taking during simulation of action: A PET investigation of agency. Nature Neuroscience 4, 546–550.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}and that posterior parietal lesions, especially on the right side, impair the ability of recognizing one's own body parts and self-attributing one's own movements.&lt;ref&gt;Daprati, E., et al. (2000). Recognition of self produced movement in a case of severe neglect. Neurocase, 6, 477–486{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Accumulating evidence from [[functional neuroimaging]] studies, as well as lesion studies in neurological patients indicates that the right inferior [[parietal cortex]], at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex (TPJ, temporoparietal junction), plays a critical role in the distinction between self-produced actions and actions perceived in others.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, P.L., &amp; Decety, J. (2004). Motor cognition: A new paradigm to study self other interactions. Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 14, 259–263.&lt;/ref&gt; Lesions of this region can produce a variety of disorders associated with body knowledge and self-awareness such as [[anosognosia]], [[asomatognosia]], or [[somatoparaphrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Berlucchi, G., &amp; Aglioti, S. (1997). The body in the brain: neural bases of corporeal awareness. Trends in Neurosciences, 20, 560–564.&lt;/ref&gt;  A primary source has reported that electrical stimulation of the TPJ can elicit out-of-body experiences (i.e., the experience of dissociation of self from the body).&lt;ref&gt;Blanke, O., &amp; Arzy, S. (2005). The out-of-body experience: Disturbed self-processing at the temporo-parietal junction. Neuroscientist, 11, 16–24.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

The investigation of the neural correlates of reciprocal [[imitation]] is extremely important because it provides an ecological paradigm (a situation close to everyday life) to address the issue of the sense of agency.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Sommerville, J.A. (2003). Shared representations between self and others: A social cognitive neuroscience view. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 7, 527–533.&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that reciprocal imitation plays a constitutive role in the early development of an implicit sense of self as a social agent.&lt;ref name=Rochat99/&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}}

A primary source has reported a [[functional neuroimaging]] experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects and while the experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that it is I who am experiencing the movement or thought) as well as the visual and [[somatosensory]] inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., Chaminade, T., Grèzes, J. and Meltzoff, A.N. (2002). A PET exploration of the neural mechanisms involved in reciprocal imitation. Neuroimage 15, 265–272.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

Another approach to understanding the neuroscientific underpinnings of the sense of agency is to examine clinical conditions in which purposeful limb movement occurs ''without'' an associated sense of agency.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The most clear clinical demonstration of this situation is [[alien hand syndrome]]. In this condition, associated with specific forms of brain damage, the affected individual loses the sense of agency without losing a sense of ownership of the affected body part.

==Agency and psychopathology==
[[Marc Jeannerod]] proposed that the process of self-recognition operates covertly and effortlessly. It depends upon a set of mechanisms involving the processing of specific neural signals, from sensory as well as from central origin. Researchers have used experimental situations, in both healthy participants and schizophrenic patients, where these signals can be dissociated from each other and where self-recognition becomes ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannerod, M. (2008). The sense of agency and its disturbances in schizophrenia: a reappraisal. Experimental Brain Research{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=September 2014}} These situations reveal that there are two levels of self-recognition, an automatic level for action identification, and a conscious level for the sense of agency, which both rely on the same principle of congruence of the action-related signals.

Investigation of the sense of agency is important to explain positive symptoms of [[schizophrenia]], like thought insertion and delusions of control.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The core of the problem met by these patients is a disturbance of their sense of agency: the first rank symptoms, which represent one of the major features of the disease, are nothing but a loss of the ability to attribute their own thoughts, internal speech, covert or overt actions to themselves.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Nonattributed or misattributed thoughts and actions then become a material for delusional interpretation and delirium.&lt;ref&gt;Farrer, C., Franck, N., Frith, C.D., Decety, J., Damato, T., &amp; Jeannerod, M. (2004). Neural correlates of action attribution in schizophrenia. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging, 131, 31–44.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}} One primary source reports that the feeling of alien control (i.e., delusions of control) during a movement task in schizophrenic patients is associated with an increased metabolic activity in the right inferior parietal cortex.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, S.A., et al. (1997). A PET study of voluntary movement in schizophrenic patients experiencing passivity phenomena. Brain, 120, 1997–2011.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

==Other aspects of agency==
While the conception of human agency is often confined to its exercise by individuals, [[Albert Bandura]] has argued that individuals often do not have direct control over social conditions or institutional practices that affect their lives; in these circumstances, well-being and security are sought through exercise of proxy agency.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1997). Self-efficacy: The exercise of control. New York: Freeman.{{page needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2014}} For instance, individuals in such circumstances may attempt to persuade others who have expertise, influence, or power to act on their behalf to achieve the outcomes they desire.

Sense of agency has been argued as a prerequisite for human [[morality|moral responsibility]] insofar as self agency underlies the expectation that individuals can be held responsible for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see Kahn, P.H. (1992). Obligatory and discretionary moral judgments. Child Development, 63, 416–430.{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary source inline|date=September 2014}}

'''SkELL''' is an abbreviation of [[Sketch Engine]] for Language Learning.&lt;ref name="raslan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baisa|first1=Vít|last2=Suchomel|first2=Vít|title=SkELL:Web Interface for English Language Learning|journal=Eighth Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2014|pages=63–70|url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/raslan14.pdf#page=71|publisher=NLP Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a web interface for language learning. The main purpose is to help students and teachers of languages. SkELL has its own [[Text corpus|corpus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eflnotes.wordpress.com/tag/james-thomas/ |title=Discovering English with SketchEngine – James Thomas interview |last=Thomas |first=James |publisher= |date=14 June 2015 |website=EFL NOTES |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was gathered so that contained texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt; In the corpus, there are a total of more than 60 million sentences and more than one billion words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/skell/ |title=SkELL |publisher=Lexical Computing Ltd. |date= |website=Sketch Engine |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SkELL interface provides features such as simple search showing words in context, but the maximum of displayed lines ([[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], in fact) is 40. However, the frequency of searched query is located below the search box and expressed with the number ''hits per million''. The second function is [[word sketch]] which enables showing collocates for a given word or words. The last one is named as similar words. It visualises similar words to searched word in a [[word cloud]].

The tool has been available also for the Russian language (since 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina, A., Vitalevna, B. O., Малолетняя, А. П., Olga, K., &amp; Vit, B. (2016).

== Features ==
SkELL offers three types of searches.

* Examples – searching for words and phrases and their all derived forms
* Word sketch – a simplified version of the original word sketch page
* Similar words – based on the Distributional [[thesaurus]] in Sketch Engine, there are not necessarily	synonyms



== Data ==
The corpus for English SkELL consists of [[English Wikipedia]] (special sorted out 130,000 articles), English collection of [[Project Gutenberg]], a subset from the web corpus enTenTen14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš.|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|title=The tenten corpus family|journal=Seventh International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|date=July 2013|pages=125–127|url=|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole [[British National Corpus]], and free new sources.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

=== Processing the data ===
After gathering and pre-cleaning (all structures have removed except sentences) data has run through processing pipe: normalization, [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], TreeTagger for English, and [[Data deduplication|deduplication]]. The further process was a compilation of the corpus using manatee indexing library. In the end, all sentences were scored with the GDEX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=A.|last2=Husák|first2=M.|last3=McAdam|first3=K.|last4=Rundell|first4=M.|last5=Rychlý|first5=P.|title=GDEX: Automatically finding good dictionary examples in a corpus|journal=Proceedings of the XIII EURALEX International Congress|date=July 2008|pages=425–432|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5040252|publisher=EURALEX}}&lt;/ref&gt; tool.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

'''Skipper''' is a visualization tool and [[code generator|code/schema generator]] for PHP [[O/R mapper|ORM frameworks]] like [[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine2]], [[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine]], [[Propel (PHP)|Propel]], and [[CakePHP]], which are used to create [[database abstraction layer]].&lt;ref name="jic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jic.cz/orm-designer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032046/http://www.jic.cz/orm-designer |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch"&gt;http://www.phparch.com/2010/05/orm-designer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"&gt;http://php5.phpmagazine.net/2010/09/orm-designer-reviewed.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheatsheet"&gt;http://www.symfony2cheatsheet.com/#doctrine {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703152651/http://www.symfony2cheatsheet.com/ |date=2014-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Skipper is developed by Czech company '''Inventic, s.r.o.''' based in Brno,&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt; and was known as '''ORM Designer''' prior to rebranding in 2014.&lt;ref name="rebrand"&gt;http://blog.skipper18.com/2014/06/press-release-skipper/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
* Generates visual model from the schema definition files&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Repetitive import/export of schema definitions in supported formats (XML, YML, PHP annotations)&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Schema definition files are automatically generated from the visual model&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Visual representation uses [[ER diagram]] extended by concepts of [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] and [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]]&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Supports customization using .xml configuration files and JavaScript&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-orm-attributes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610104119/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-orm-attributes |archivedate=2014-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-scripts |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223135052/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-scripts |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Does not support direct connections to the database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/mysql-workbench |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419204544/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/mysql-workbench |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Crude and simplistic visual representation and menus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stacktrace.dev-krtcs.net/2013/04/05/orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221205201/http://stacktrace.dev-krtcs.net/2013/04/05/orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
'''Skipper''' was built on the [[Qt (framework)|Qt framework]]. Import/export of the schema definitions uses [[XSLT|XSL]] transformations powered by [[LibXslt]] library. Imported source files are first converted to XML format: no conversion for XML, simple conversion for YML, creating the [[Abstract Syntax Tree]] and its subsequent conversion to XML for PHP annotations.
The import/export scripts are configured in JavaScript and can be freely customized.&lt;ref name="insides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.orm-designer.com/2014/01/magic-behind-orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426002150/http://blog.orm-designer.com/2014/01/magic-behind-orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''Skipper''' was created as an internal tool for the web applications developed by Inventic. It was first published as a commercial tool under the name '''ORM Designer''' in 2009.&lt;ref name="internal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.orm-designer.com/2009/12/new-tool-orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223135048/http://blog.orm-designer.com/2009/12/new-tool-orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goaleurope"&gt;[http://goaleurope.com/2013/08/21/czech-orm-designer-raises-funding-from-angel-investor/ goaleurope.com/ORM-Designer-raises-funding-from-angel-investor]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application was reworked and optimized in January 2013, and released as '''ORM Designer 2'''.&lt;ref name="insides"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-60215550-mladi-programatori-z-brna-zdrazili-svuj-software-trojnasobne-prodeje-zustaly-stejne&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2013 ORM Designer became part of the South Moravian Innovation Center Incubator program (support program for innovative technological startups).&lt;ref name="goaleurope"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tyinternety.cz/2013/03/12/clanek/do-jic-innovation-parku-se-hlasi-41-firem-nejlepsi-vyberou-rostock-vsiansky-a-berdar/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jic.cz/companies-in-the-jic-innovation-park#inventic&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, ORM Designer version 3 was released and rebranded under the name of Skipper&lt;ref name="rebrand"/&gt;

The '''Sálim Ali Centre for Ornithology and Natural History''' (SACON) is a national centre for information, education and research in [[ornithology]] and [[natural history]] in India. It was inspired by and named in honour of [[Salim Ali (ornithologist)|Salim Ali]], the leading pioneer of ornithology in India. It is an autonomous organisation established in 1990 as a public- NGO partnership between the MoEF&amp;CC, and the Bombay Natural History Society(BNHS) under the Centre of Excellence Scheme and registered under the [[Indian Societies Registration Act]].  Its headquarters are at Anaikatti, [[Coimbatore]], [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

'''''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in Australia. It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by [[Melbourne University Press]].

Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.

==Background==

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.{{sfn|Orion|1995}}

===Hume and her research===
Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a [[religious pluralism|religious pluralist]] and leading her to study the discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church in [[Calgary]], it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the [[Church of All Worlds]] and held in the rural outskirts of [[Canberra]]. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess [[Oya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="In publishing this book, I hope that I can dispel some of the fear surrounding the topic and convey a more accurate picture of this little-known movement in Australia."|source=—Lynne Hume, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In preparation for ''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia'', Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]] and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became "not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime." Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, [[Murdoch University]] and at the [[Theosophical Society]] in [[Brisbane]]. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a [[snowball sampling]] method.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Chapter one, entitled "Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;15}} The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=16&amp;ndash;40}} The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=41&amp;ndash;78}} while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=79&amp;ndash;111}}

Chapter five offers an examination of [[rites of passage]] and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=112&amp;ndash;143}} while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=144&amp;ndash;168}} The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=169&amp;ndash;204}} and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=205&amp;ndash;225}} In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=226&amp;ndash;238}}

==Reviews==
Emma Tomalin of [[Lancaster University]] reviewed the work for ''[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]]''. Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being "descriptive rather than discursive", thereby appealing more to those "interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice
than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications."{{sfn|Tomalin|1999|pp=174&amp;ndash;175}}
