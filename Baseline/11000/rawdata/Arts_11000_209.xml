[[File:Burdah Alexandria.jpg|thumb|right|A verse from the ''Qaṣīdat al-Burda'', displayed on the wall of al-Busiri's shrine in Alexandria]]
'''''Qasīdat al-Burda''''' ({{lang-ar|قصيدة البردة}}, "Ode of the Mantle"), or '''''al-Burda''''' for short, is an ode of praise for the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] composed by the eminent [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[Imam al-Busiri]] of [[Egypt]]. The poem whose actual title is ''al-Kawākib ad-Durrīya fī Madḥ Khayr al-Barīya'' ({{lang|ar|الكواكب الدرية في مدح خير البرية}}, "The Celestial Lights in Praise of the Best of Creation"), is famous mainly in the Sunni [[Muslim world]]. It is entirely in praise of Muhammad, who is said to have been praised ceaselessly by the afflicted poet, to the point that the Prophet appeared in a dream and wrapped him in a [[Hırka-i Şerif|mantle]] or cloak; in the morning the poet discovers that God has cured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alahazrat.net/library/englisharticles/qasida/index.htm |title=Anthology of Arabic Poems about the Prophet and the Faith of Islam Containing the Famous Poem of Al-Busaree |access-date=2009-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210135943/http://www.alahazrat.net/library/englisharticles/qasida/index.htm |archive-date=2009-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.alahazrat.net/library/englisharticles/qasida/index.htm |title=The poem of the scarf by Shaikh Faizullah Bhai B. A. - University of Bombay - Published by Taj Company Ltd. |access-date=2009-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091210135943/http://www.alahazrat.net/library/englisharticles/qasida/index.htm |archive-date=2009-12-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bānat Suʿād, a poem composed by [[Ka'b bin Zuhayr]] was originally called as Al-Burdah. He recited this poem in front of Muhammad after embracing Islam. Muhammad was so moved that he removed his mantle and wrapped it over him. The original Burdah is not as famous as the one composed by [[Imam al-Busiri]] even though Muhammad had physically wrapped his mantle over [[Ka'b bin Zuhayr|Ka'b]] not in a dream like in case of [[Imam al-Busiri]].

== Composition ==

Al-Busiri narrated the circumstances of his inspiration to write the ''Burdah'':

{{quote|text=I had composed a number of praise poems for the Prophet, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace, including one that was suggested to me by my friend Zayn al-Dīn Yʿaqūb b. al-Zubayr. Some time after that, I was stricken by fālij (stroke), an illness that paralyzed half of my body. I thought that I would compose this poem, and so I made supplications to the Prophet Muhammad, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace, to intercede for me and (ask God to) cure me. I repeatedly sang the poem, wept, prayed, and asked for intercession. Then I slept and in my dream, I saw the Prophet, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace. He wiped my face with His blessed hands and covered me in His Mantle (Burdah). Then I woke up and found I was able to walk; so I got up and left my house. I had told no one about what had happened.

I encountered a Sufi (faqīr) on my way and he said to me: "I want you to give me the poem in which you praise the Prophet, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace."

I said: "Which one?"

So he said: "The one that you composed during your sickness."

Then he recited the first verse and said: "I swear by God that I heard it in a dream last night being sung in the presence of the Prophet Muhammad, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace. I saw the Prophet, Allah bless Him and salute Him with peace, was pleased with it and covered the person who sang it with His Mantle."

So I recited the poem to him and he memorized it and related his vision to others.|sign=Imam al-Busiri}}

The ''Burda'' is divided into 10 chapters and 160 verses all rhyming with each other. Interspersing the verses is the refrain, "My Patron Deity, confer blessings and peace continuously and eternally on Your Beloved, the Best of All Creation" (Arabic: مولاي صلي و سلم دائما أبدا على حبيبك خير الخلق كلهم). Each verse ends with the Arabic letter ''mīm'', a style called ''mīmīya''. The 10 chapters of the ''Burda'' comprise:

*On Lyrical Love Yearning
*On Warnings about the [[Lataif-e-sitta#Latifat-an-Nafsi|Caprices of the Self]]
*On the [[Na`at|Praise of the Prophet]]
*On His [[Mawlid|Birth]]
*On His [[Islamic view of miracles|Miracles]]
*On the Exalted Stature and Miraculous Merits of the [[Qur'an]]
*On the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Ascension of the Prophet]]
*On the [[Ghazw|Struggle]] of Allah's Messenger
*On Seeking [[Tawassul|Intercession through the Prophet]]
*On Intimate Discourse and the [[Dua|Petition]] of One's State.

== Popularity ==
Sunni [[Muslim]]s have traditionally venerated the poem. It is memorized and recited in congregations, and its verses decorate the walls of public buildings and [[mosque]]s. This poem decorated [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (the mosque of Muhammad) in [[Medina]] for centuries but was erased but for two lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/art/alburda.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: al-Burda|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90 commentaries have been written on this poem and it has been translated into [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]](called Tianfangshijing), and other languages. It is known and recited by a large number of [[Sunni]] [[Muslims]], ordinarily and on special occasions, such as [[Mawlid]], making it one of the most recited poems in the world.

==Translations==
The poem has seen several different translations, into a variety of languages.&lt;ref&gt;See section, "''Popularity''"&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most important translation of recent times is that by [[Timothy Winter]] into English.&lt;ref&gt;"Imam al-Busiri, The Mantle Adorned", Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad), (London: Quilliam Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio==
The full rendition of this famous poem has been produced by The Adel Brothers. They have sung the full poem in over 20 different styles. 'The Mantle of Praise' please see 'External links' below.

==Legacy==
The Burda was accepted within Sunni Islam and was the subject of numerous commentaries by mainstream [[Sunni]] scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1ZsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=Burda+ibn+Hajar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwici6WBlPvQAhXpKsAKHXZ_CmU4ChDoAQgaMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Burda%20ibn%20Hajar&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|last=Meri|first=Josef W.|date=2005-10-31|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781135455965|location=|pages=166|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami]],&lt;ref name=Brill126&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhyX6Dp8pnMC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;dq=Burda+ibn+Hajar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6raOWkfvQAhXCK8AKHfUOBGMQ6AEIPDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Burda%20ibn%20Hajar&amp;f=false|title=The Trans-Saharan Book Trade: Manuscript Culture, Arabic Literacy and Intellectual History in Muslim Africa|last=Krätli|first=Graziano|last2=Lydon|first2=Ghislaine|date=2011-01-01|publisher=BRILL|year=|isbn=9004187421|location=|pages=126|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nazifi]]&lt;ref name=Brill126/&gt; and [[Al-Qastallani|Qastallani]]&lt;ref name="EI2a"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=B. |last2=Menage |first2=V.L. |last3=Pellat |first3=Ch. |last4=Schacht |first4=J. |title=Encyclopaedia of Islam (New Edition) |volume=Volume IV (Iran-Kha) |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Netherlands |date=1997 |origyear=1st. pub. 1978 |isbn=9004078193 |page=737}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also studied by the [[Shafi'i]] hadith master [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] (d. 852 A.H.) both by reading the text out loud to his teacher and by receiving it in writing from a transmitter who heard it directly from Busiri himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JjJBDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=Burda+ibn+Hajar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6raOWkfvQAhXCK8AKHfUOBGMQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Burda%20ibn%20Hajar&amp;f=false|title=Variance in Arabic Manuscripts: Arabic Didactic Poems from the Eleventh to the Seventeenth Centuries - Analysis of Textual Variance and Its Control in the Manuscripts|last=Sobieroj|first=Florian|date=2016-05-24|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|year=|isbn=9783110460001|location=|pages=65|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder of the [[Wahhabi]] sect, [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab|Ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab Najdi]] in contradiction to mainstream [[Sunni]] Islam considered the poem to be idolatory ([[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQN6q16dIjAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Wahhai+mission&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Wahhai%20mission&amp;f=false|title=The Wahhabi Mission and Saudi Arabia|last=Commins|first=David|date=2006-02-20|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=|isbn=9781845110802|location=|pages=59|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''All The Madmen Records ''' was a [[record label]] started by [[The Mob (British punk band)|The Mob]] in [[Yeovil]], [[England]] before relocating to [[London]]. Profits from the band's ''Let The Tribe Increase'' LP were [[Plough back|ploughed back]] into the label, which was then co-organised by members of the collective which published the [[Kill Your Pet Puppy]] zine.

Following the reactivation in 2011 of [[The Mob (British punk band)|The Mob]], the label was relaunched in 2012 as All The Madmen Records Ltd; a collective trading company.

'''Allusion''' is a [[figure of speech]], in which an object or circumstance from unrelated context is referenced covertly or indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=allusion {{!}} Definition of allusion in English by Oxford Dictionaries |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/allusion |website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English |accessdate=1 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A covert, implied or indirect reference" (''[[OED]]''); Carmela Perri explored the extent to which an allusion may be overt, in "On alluding" ''Poetics'' '''7''' (1978), and [[M. H. Abrams]] defined allusion as "a brief reference, explicit or indirect, to a person, place or event, or to another literary work or passage". (Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms'' 1971, ''s.v. "Allusion"'').&lt;/ref&gt; It is left to the audience to make the direct connection;&lt;ref&gt;H.W. Fowler, ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage''.&lt;/ref&gt; where the connection is directly and explicitly stated (as opposed to indirectly implied) by the author, it is instead usually termed a [[reference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/allusion|title=the definition of allusion|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reference|title=the definition of reference|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/allusion |title=Allusion |date=2015 |quote=allusion, in literature, an implied or indirect reference to a person, event, or thing or to a part of another text. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the arts, a literary allusion puts the alluded text in a new context under which it assumes new [[poetic function|meanings and denotations]].&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; It is not possible to predetermine the nature of all the new meanings and inter-textual patterns that an allusion will generate.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"/&gt; Literary allusion is closely related to [[parody]] and [[pastiche]], which are also "text-linking" [[literary device]]s.&lt;ref name="BenPorot76p107"&gt;Ben-Porot (1976) pp.107-8 quotation: {{quotation|The literary allusion is a device for the simultaneous activation of two texts. The activation is achieved through the manipulation of a special signal: a sign (simple or complex) in a given text characterized by an additional larger "referent." This referent is always an independent text. The simultaneous activation of the two texts thus connected results in the formation of intertextual patterns whose nature cannot be predetermined. ... The "free" nature of the intertextual patterns is the feature by which it would be possible to distinguish between the literary allusion and other closely related text-linking devices, such as parody and pastiche.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a wider, more informal context, an allusion is a passing or casually short statement indicating broader meaning. It is an incidental mention of something, either directly or by implication, such as "In the stock market, he met his Waterloo."

==Scope of the term==
[[File:NAMA Tablette 1287.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Backside of a clay tablet from [[Pylos]] bearing the motif of the [[Labyrinth]], an allusion to the mythological fight of [[Theseus#The myth of Theseus and the Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]]]]

In the most traditional sense, ''allusion'' is a literary term, though the word has also come to encompass indirect references to any source, including allusions in [[film]] or the [[visual arts]].&lt;ref name="preminger"&gt;Preminger &amp; Brogan (1993) ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics.'' Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In literature, allusions are used to link concepts that the reader already has knowledge of, with concepts discussed in the story. In the field of film criticism, a film-maker's intentionally unspoken visual reference to another film is also called an [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. It may even be sensed that real events have allusive overtones, when a previous event is inescapably recalled by a current one. "Allusion is bound up with a vital and perennial topic in literary theory, the place of authorial intention in interpretation", William Irwin observed, in asking "What is an allusion?"&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, "What Is an Allusion?" ''Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism'' '''59''' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Without the hearer or reader's comprehending the author's intention, an allusion becomes merely a decorative device. 
Allusion is an economical device, a [[figure of speech]] that uses a relatively short space to draw upon the ready stock of ideas, cultural [[meme]]s or emotion already associated with a topic. Thus, an allusion is understandable only to those with prior knowledge of the covert reference in question, a mark of their [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt;

==Allusion as cultural bond==
The origin of ''allusion'' is in the Latin verb ''ludere, lusus est'' "to play with, jest."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Recognizing the point of allusion's condensed riddle also reinforces cultural solidarity between the maker of the allusion and the hearer: their shared familiarity with allusion bonds them. Ted Cohen finds such a "cultivation of intimacy" to be an essential element of many [[jokes]].&lt;ref&gt;(Cohen, ''Jokes: Philosophical Thoughts on Joking Matters'' [University of Chicago Press] 1999:28f). Irwin 2001:note 8 noted the parallel.&lt;/ref&gt; Some aspect of the referent must be invoked and identified for the tacit association to be made; the allusion is indirect in part because "it depends on something more than mere substitution of a referent."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:288&lt;/ref&gt;

The allusion depends as well on the author's intent; a reader may search out parallels to a figure of speech or a passage, of which the author was unaware, and offer them as unconscious allusions—coincidences that a critic might not find illuminating.{{dubious|date=April 2014}} Addressing such issues is an aspect of [[hermeneutics]].

William Irwin remarks that allusion moves in only one direction: "If A alludes to B, then B does not allude to A. The Bible does not allude to Shakespeare, though Shakespeare may allude to the Bible." Irwin appends a note: "Only a divine author, outside of time, would seem capable of alluding to a later text."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin 2001:289 and note 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the basis for Christian readings of [[Bible prophecy|Old Testament prophecy]], which asserts that passages are to be read as allusions to future events due to Jesus's revelation in {{Bibleref|Luke|24:25-27|TNIV}}.

Allusion differs from the similar term [[intertextuality]] in that it is an intentional effort on the author's part.&lt;ref name="preminger"/&gt; The success of an allusion depends in part on at least some of its audience "getting" it. Allusions may be made increasingly obscure, until at last they are understood by the author alone, who thereby retreats into a [[private language]] (e.g. "Ulalume", by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]).

==Academic analysis of the concept of allusions==
In discussing the richly allusive poetry of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Georgics]]'', R. F. Thomas&lt;ref&gt;R. F. Thomas, "Virgil's ''Georgics'' and the art of reference" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology '' '''90''' (1986) pp 171–98.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished six categories of allusive reference, which are applicable to a wider cultural sphere. These types are:
# ''' Casual Reference''', "the use of language which recalls a specific antecedent, but only in a general sense" that is relatively unimportant to the new context;
# ''' Single Reference''', in which the hearer or reader is intended to "recall the context of the model and apply that context to the new situation"; such a specific single reference in Virgil, according to Thomas, is a means of "making connections or conveying ideas on a level of intense subtlety";
# ''' Self-Reference''', where the ''locus'' is in the poet's own work;
# ''' Corrective Allusion''', where the imitation is clearly in opposition to the original source's intentions;
# ''' Apparent Reference''' "which seems clearly to recall a specific model but which on closer inspection frustrates that intention"; and
# ''' Multiple Reference''' or '''Conflation''', which refers in various ways simultaneously to several sources, fusing and transforming the cultural traditions.

A type of literature has grown round explorations of the allusions in such works as [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' or [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]''.

==Examples==
In [[Homer]], brief allusions could be made to mythic themes of generations previous to the main narrative because they were already familiar to the epic's hearers: one example is the theme of the [[Calydonian Boar|Calydonian boarhunt]]. In [[Hellenistic]] Alexandria, literary culture and a fixed [[literary canon]] known to readers and hearers made a densely allusive poetry effective; the poems of [[Callimachus]] offer the best-known examples.

[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], alluded to the [[Gettysburg Address]] in starting his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech by saying 'Five score years ago..."; his hearers were immediately reminded of [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s "Four score and seven years ago", which opened the Gettysburg Address. King's allusion effectively called up parallels in two historic moments without overwhelming his speech with details.

A [[sobriquet]] is an allusion. By [[metonymy]] one aspect of a person or other referent is selected to identify it, and it is this shared aspect that makes a sobriquet evocative: for example, "the city that never sleeps" is a sobriquet of (and therefore an allusion to) New York.

An allusion may become trite and stale through unthinking overuse, devolving into a mere [[cliché]], as is seen in some of the sections below.

===15 minutes of fame===
[[Andy Warhol]], a 20th-century American artist most famous for his [[pop-art]] images of [[Campbell Soup Company|Campbell soup]] cans and of [[Marilyn Monroe]], commented on the explosion of media coverage by saying, "In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes."
Today, when someone receives a great deal of media attention for something fairly trivial, and he or she is said to be experiencing his or her "[[15 minutes of fame]]", that is an allusion to Andy Warhol's famous remark.

===Lot's Wife/Pillar of Salt===
According to the Book of Genesis, God destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, but Lot, the nephew of Abraham, was given time to escape with his family before the destruction. God commanded Lot and his family not to look back as they fled. Lot's wife disobeyed and looked back, and she was immediately turned into a pillar of salt as punishment for her disobedience.

An allusion to Lot's wife or to a pillar of salt is usually a reference to someone who unwisely chooses to look back once he or she has begun on a course of action or to someone who disobeys an explicit rule or command.

===Cassandra===
In [[Greek mythology]], [[Cassandra]], the daughter of [[Troy|Trojan]] king [[Priam]], was loved by [[Apollo]], who gave her the gift of [[prophecy]]. When Cassandra later angered Apollo, he altered the gift so that her prophecies, while true, would not be believed. Thus, her accurate warnings to the Trojans were disregarded, and disaster befell them.

Today, a "Cassandra" refers to someone who predicts disasters or negative results, especially to someone whose predictions are disregarded.

===Catch-22===
This phrase comes from a novel by [[Joseph Heller]]. ''[[Catch-22]]'' is set on a [[U.S. Army Air Force]] base in [[World War II]]. "Catch-22" refers to a regulation that states an airman's request to be relieved from flight duty can only be granted if he is judged to be insane. However, anyone who does not want to fly dangerous missions is obviously sane, thus, there is no way to avoid flying the missions.

Later in the book the old woman in Rome explains that Catch-22 means "They can do whatever they want to do." This refers to the theme of the novel in which the authority figures consistently abuse their powers, leaving the consequences to those under their command. &lt;!--unnecessarily obscure:Catch-22 as it is currently construed is a misnomer as is "[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]" which is actually "[[Schrodinger's cat]]". (This puts those who know the difference in a double bind but not a Catch-22.)--&gt;

In common speech, "catch-22" has come to describe any absurd or [[no-win situation]].

===T. S. Eliot===
The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot]] is often described as "allusive", because of his habit of referring to names, places or images that may only make sense in the light of prior knowledge. This technique can add to the experience, but for the uninitiated can make Eliot's work seem dense and hard to decipher.

===James Joyce===
The most densely allusive work in modern English may be ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' by [[James Joyce]]. [[Joseph Campbell]] and [[Henry Morton Robinson]] wrote ''[[A Skeleton Key to Finnegans Wake]]'' (1944) that unlocked some of Joyce's most obscure allusions.

'''''Amanda''''' is an early American music television program starring [[Amanda Randolph]] which debuted on the [[DuMont Television Network]] on November 1, 1948. The ending date for the show is unclear, but it still appears in a TV schedule from October 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal%201949/Long%20Island%20City%20NY%20Star%20Journal%201949%20-%208052.pdf Long Island City (NY) ''Star Journal'' (1949)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast history==
Aired in New York City at 9:45am ET on the [[DuMont Television Network]]'s flagship station [[WABD]] (some sources say the show aired 12noon to 12;15pm ET).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kbx7AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52&amp;lpg=PT52&amp;dq=alice+burrows+the+needle+shop&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jyqSkOosYV&amp;sig=05nDjzLG5lCLl-OGoTxL-PiAxbQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ruwhVYSABNjboASd9YDoAg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=alice%20burrows%20the%20needle%20shop&amp;f=false Marsha Cassidy, ''What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s'' (University of Texas Press, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The show was a 15-minute daytime music program starring [[Amanda Randolph]], who hosted the program and sang.

The program is significant as one of the first regularly scheduled television show to feature an [[African-American]] woman as host. On the program, Randolph sang songs ranging from spirituals to [[boogie woogie]]. According to the book ''The Forgotten Network'' (2004), DuMont began offering 4.5 hours of morning and afternoon programming to affiliates in January 1949, but it is not clear which program these included. The program and several other WABD daytime shows seem to appear in [[Pittsburgh]] television schedules (on station WDTV) during 1949,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6MhRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hWoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4800%2C3549198 ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' (January 17, 1949)]&lt;/ref&gt; so the program may have been shown on a network level.

According to the April 30, 1949, edition of newspaper ''Pittsburgh Courier'', the program also featured guest appearances, the first of which was [[Etta Moten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspapers%2023%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201949%2FPittsburgh%20PA%20Courier%201949%20-%200429.pdf Pittsburgh Courier, April 30 1949] at Old Fulton NY Post Cards&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the book ''What Women Watched: Daytime Television in the 1950s'' (University of Texas Press, 2005) by Marsha Cassidy, the DuMont daytime schedule beginning in January 1949 was:

*10-10:30am   ''[[Johnny Olson's Rumpus Room]]''
*10:30-11am  ''Welcome, Neighbors''
*11am-12noon  ''[[The Stan Shaw Show]]''
*12noon-12:15pm   ''Amanda''
*12:15-12:30pm  ''Man in the Street''
*12:30-12:45pm  ''[[Camera Headlines]]''
*12:45-1pm   ''Fashions in Song''
*1-1:30pm   ''[[Okay, Mother]]''
*2:30-3pm  ''[[Inside Photoplay]]'' (''The Wendy Barrie Show'')
*3-3:15pm  ''[[The Needle Shop]]''
*3:15-3:30pm  ''Vincent Lopez Speaking'' (''[[The Vincent Lopez Show]]'')

==Reception==
The program aired as part of the DuMont experiment in [[daytime television]]. While not the first with daytime programming, DuMont's WABD was the first station to offer a schedule that started in the morning and ended after the evening programs; prior to this, daytime programming was occasional with schedules heavy on test patterns.

''Billboard'' magazine gave a very mixed review of the line-up, but ''Amanda'' was one of several program on the schedule they liked, with the magazine saying that the songs were "well-sung" and that "the gal is by far the most entertaining part of the early stretch".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sw4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=%22amanda%22+lass+well-sung+7-10&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zuFCVP5ih8iYBaS4gOAC&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22amanda%22%20lass%20well-sung%207-10&amp;f=false ''Billboard'' (November 13, 1948)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation status==
As with most DuMont program, no episodes are known to exist. Kinescopes of daytime television of the 1940s are exceptionally rare, as are [[kinescope]]s of local programming (since kinescopes were intended for time-delay purposes, all U.S. stations saw little need to record local programming, and this would remain the case for years).

Although DuMont's main stations very occasionally made kinescopes of their local programming (there are more surviving WABD local kinescopes from the late-1940s/1950s than there are for many other stations of the period), most of the local programming is lost. DuMont's archives are alleged to have been dumped into the New York City waterway system and have never been recovered.

'''Anglo-Saxon art''' covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

Anglo-Saxon art survives mostly in [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], a number of very fine [[ivory]] carvings, and some works in metal and other materials. [[Opus Anglicanum]] ("English work") was already recognised as the finest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo-Saxon period remain – the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a rather different sort of embroidery, on a far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most highly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives – there was enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions of the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as well as the Norsemen before them, and the [[English Reformation]] after them, and most survivals were once on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982)'s Chapter 1 gives a detailed analysis of the various causes of destruction of works of art, especially metalwork&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and an effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn remains that survive as they once were.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 10–11; Dodwell (1982), chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in [[fresco]], [[stone carving|stone]], [[ivory carving|ivory]] and [[bone carving|whalebone]] (notably the [[Franks Casket]]), [[metalwork]] (for example the [[Fuller brooch]]), [[Anglo-Saxon glass|glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], many examples of which have been recovered through [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the centuries, especially in churches on the Continent, as the [[Viking]]s, [[Normans]] and [[English Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]] between them left virtually nothing in England except for books and archaeological finds.

==Overview==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 079.jpg|thumb|Bird from the Sutton Hoo shield (part replica)]]
Metalwork is almost the only form in which the earliest Anglo-Saxon art has survived, mostly in Germanic-style jewelry (including fittings for clothes and weapons) which was, before the [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England]], commonly placed in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion, which took most of the 7th century, the fusion of Germanic Anglo-Saxon, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and Late Antique techniques and motifs, together with the requirement for books, created [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, or [[Insular art]], which is also seen in illuminated manuscripts and some carved stone and ivory, probably mostly drawing from decorative metalwork motifs, and with further influences from the British Celts of the west and the [[Franks]].  The [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the far north of England was the crucible of Insular style in Britain, at centres such as [[Lindisfarne]], founded c. 635 as an offshoot of the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish monastery]] on [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], and [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] (674) which looked to the continent.  At about the same time as the Insular [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] was being made in the early 8th century, the [[Vespasian Psalter]] from [[Canterbury]] in the far south, which the missionaries from Rome had made their headquarters, shows a wholly different, classically based art. These two styles mixed and developed together and by the following century the resulting Anglo-Saxon style had reached maturity.

However Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the [[Viking]] invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the [[Canterbury Bible]] of before 850, perhaps well before, "no major [[illuminated manuscript]] is known until well on into the tenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142 (quote), 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Alfred]] (r. 871–899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the [[Danelaw]], and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom.  The final phase of Anglo-Saxon art is known as the Winchester School or style, though it was produced in many centres in the south of England, and perhaps the Midlands also.  Elements of this begin to be seen from around 900, but the first major manuscripts only appear around the 930s. The style combined influences from the continental art of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with elements of older English art, and some particular elements including a nervous agitated style of drapery, sometimes matched by figures, especially in line drawings, which are the only images in many manuscripts, and were to remain especially prominent in medieval English art.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:CodexAureusCanterburyFolios9v10r.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The [[evangelist portrait]] and Incipit to Matthew from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]], one of the "Tiberius group", show the Northumbrian Insular and classicising continental styles that combined and competed in early Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.]] 
Early Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination forms part of [[Insular art]], a combination of influences from Mediterranean, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Migration Period art|Germanic]] styles that arose when the Anglo-Saxons encountered Irish missionary activity in [[Northumbria]], at [[Lindisfarne]] and [[Iona]] in particular.  At the same time the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome and its successors imported continental manuscripts like the Italian [[St. Augustine Gospels]], and for a considerable period the two styles appear mixed in a variety of proportions in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. In the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], of around 700–715, there are carpet pages and Insular initials of unprecedented complexity and sophistication, but the [[evangelist portrait]]s, clearly following Italian models, greatly simplify them, misunderstand some details of the setting, and give them a border with interlace corners.  The portrait of St Matthew is based on the same Italian model, or one extremely similar, used for the figure of [[Ezra]] that is one of the two large miniatures in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] (before 716), but the style there is very different; a far more illusionistic treatment, and an "attempt to introduce a pure Mediterranean style into Anglo-Saxon England", which failed, as "perhaps too advanced", leaving these images apparently as the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 40, 49 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;

A different mixture is seen in the opening from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] (mid-8th century, left) where the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace.  The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of [[Franks|Frankish]] manuscripts of the period.  Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles; the evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of [[hanging bowl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107, Wilson 94&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the so-called "Tiberius group" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with [[Kent]], or perhaps the kingdom of [[Mercia]] in the heyday of the [[Mercian Supremacy]].  It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which "developed trumpet spiral patterns" are found.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 94&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Meister des Evangeliums des Grimbald 001.jpg|thumb|270px|Evangelist portrait from the [[Grimbald Gospels]], early 11th century, in the late Winchester style.]]

The 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts was at its height, from [[scriptoria]] such as those at the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]'s foundation at [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach Abbey]] (though the important [[Echternach Gospels]] were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at [[Tours]], where [[Alcuin of York]] was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834.  Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the ''scriptorium'' survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the [[Salzburg]] area of modern [[Austria]] has a manuscript counterpart in the "Cutbercht Gospels" in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131–133; Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the "[[Winchester]] style" developed.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90&lt;/ref&gt; The first plant ornament, with leaves and grapes, was already seen in an initial in the [[Leningrad Bede]], which can probably be dated to 746. The other large initial in the manuscript is the first [[historiated initial]] (one containing a portrait or scene, here Christ or a saint) in the whole of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The classically derived vine or plant scroll was to largely oust interlace as the dominant filler of ornamental spaces in Anglo-Saxon art, just as it did in much of Europe beginning with [[Carolingian art]], though in England animals within the scrolls remained much more common than abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63–67&lt;/ref&gt; For some long time scrolls, especially in metal, bone or ivory, are prone to have an animal head at one end and a plant element at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Seen by Wilson, 64–67, as "degeneration", this might also be seen as a return to the habits of [[La Tène style]].&lt;/ref&gt; All these changes were not restricted to manuscripts, and may not have been driven by manuscript style, but we have a greater number of manuscripts surviving than works in other media, even if in most cases illuminations are restricted to initials and perhaps a few miniatures.  Several ambitious projects of illumination are unfinished, such as the [[Old English Hexateuch]], which has some 550 scenes in various stages of completion, giving insight into working methods. The illustrations give Old Testament scenes an entirely contemporary setting and are valuable images of Anglo-Saxon life.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts from the Winchester School or style only survive from about the 930s onwards; this coincided with a [[English Benedictine Reform|wave of revival and reform]] within English monasticism, encouraged by King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 924/5-939) and his successors.  Æthelstan promoted [[Dunstan]] (909–988), a practising illuminator, eventually to [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and also [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]] and the French-trained Norseman [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]].  Illumination in a new style appears in a manuscript of the biographies by Bede of St [[Cuthbert]] given by Æthelstan to the monastery in [[Chester-le-Street]] about 937.  There is a [[dedication portrait]] of the king presenting his book to the saint, the two of them standing outside a large church.  This is the first real portrait of an English king, and heavily influenced by Carolingian style, with an elegant inhabited acanthus border.  However, the initials in the text combine Carolingian elements with animal forms in inventive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 156–157; Dodwell (1993), 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Miniatures added in England to the continental Aethelstan Psalter begin to show Anglo-Saxon liveliness in figure drawing in compositions derived from Carolingian and Byzantine models, and over the following decades the distinctive Winchester style with agitated draperies and elaborate acanthus borders develops.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 96–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]] is a masterpiece of the later Winchester style, which drew on Insular, Carolingian, and [[Byzantine art]] to make a heavier and more grandiose style, where the broad classicising [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] foliage sometimes seems over-luxuriant.  Anglo-Saxon illustration included many lively pen drawings, on which the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]], in Canterbury from about 1000, was highly influential; the [[Harley Psalter]] is a copy of it. The [[Ramsey Psalter]] (c. 990) contains pages in both the painted and tinted drawing styles, including the first [[Beatus initial]] with a "lion mask", while the [[Tiberius Psalter]], from the last years before the Conquest, uses mainly the tinted.  Anglo-Saxon culture was coming into increasing contact with, and exchanging influences with, a wider Latin Mediaeval Europe. Anglo-Saxon drawing had a great influence in Northern France throughout the 11th century, in the so-called "Channel school", and Insular decorative elements such as [[interlace (art)|interlace]] remained popular into the 12th century in the [[Franco-Saxon]] style.

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Belt buckle.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Sutton Hoo]], gold and [[niello]] belt buckle]]
Pagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork initially uses the Germanic [[Animal Style]] I and II decoration that would be expected from recent immigrants, but gradually develops a distinctive Anglo-Saxon character, as in the [[Quoit Brooch Style]] of the 5th century. Round disk brooches were preferred for the grandest pieces, over continental styles of ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]'' and Romano-British [[penannular brooch]]es, a consistent Anglo-Saxon taste throughout the period; the [[Harford Farm Brooch]] is a 7th-century example.  Decoration included [[cloisonné]] ("cellwork"), in gold and [[garnet]] for high-status pieces.  Despite a considerable number of other finds, the discovery of the ship-burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], probably interred in the 620s, transformed the history of Anglo-Saxon art, showing a level of sophistication and quality that was wholly unexpected at this date.  The most famous finds are the [[Sutton Hoo helmet|helmet]] and matching suite of [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid]], belt and other fittings of the king buried there, which made clear the source in Anglo-Saxon art, previously much disputed, of many elements of the style of Insular manuscripts.        
[[File:Brit Mus Fuller Brooch.jpg|thumb|The [[Fuller Brooch]]]]

By the 10th century Anglo-Saxon metalwork had a famous reputation as far afield as Italy, where English goldsmiths worked on plate for the altar of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] itself,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 135 for St Peter's; Dodwell (1982) as next ref. for the reputation.&lt;/ref&gt; but hardly any pieces have survived the depredations of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, and the [[English Reformation]], and none of the large-scale ones, shrines, doors and statues, that we know existed, and of which a few contemporary continental examples have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):10–11, 44–47, 61–83, 216ff&lt;/ref&gt; The references to specific works by the 11th century monastic artist [[Spearhafoc]], none of which have identifiably survived, are about works in precious metal, and he is one of a small number of metalwork artists from the period whose name we know and whose work is described in any way. According to several sources, including the [[Normans|Norman]] chronicler [[Goscelin]], who knew him personally, Spearhafoc "was outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithery", the painting very likely mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. It was probably his artistic work which brought into contact with the royal family, and launched his rapid promotion in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):46 and 55, who quotes Goscelin, and Historia:ciii-cv for the other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the imprecise details given, mostly by Goscelin, are therefore valuable evidence of what Anglo-Saxon metalwork was like. Anglo-Saxon skill in gold-engraving, designs and figures engraved on gold objects, is mentioned by many foreign sources, and the few remaining engraved figures closely parallel the far more numerous pen-drawn figures in manuscripts, also an Anglo-Saxon speciality. Wall-paintings, which seem to have sometimes contained gold, were also apparently often made by manuscript illuminators, and Goscelin's description of his talents therefore suggests an artist skilled in all the main Anglo-Saxon media for figurative art – of which being a goldsmith was then regarded as the most prestigious branch.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):58, 79–83, 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; One 11th century lay goldsmith was even a ''[[thegn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 005-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Brooch from the [[Pentney Hoard]], in the Trewhiddle style.]]

Many monastic artists reached senior positions; Spearhafoc's career in metalwork was paralleled in less sensational fashion by his contemporary [[Mannig]], [[Abbot of Evesham]] (Abbot 1044–58, d. 1066),&lt;ref&gt;See Dodwell (1982), passim&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the previous century Saint [[Dunstan]] had been a very successful Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, with some precise details, is given in the chronicle maintained by his abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden:65. History&lt;/ref&gt; His work also had a miracle associated with it – the lay goldsmith Godric stabbed his hand with an [[scratch awl|awl]] during the work on the large shrine at Evesham, which was miraculously healed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;History:159 and Dodwell (1982):65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Spearhafoc and Mannig are the "only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became [[Prior]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):48, 80 and 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final century of the period some large figures in precious metal are recorded; presumably these were made of thin sheets over a wooden core like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]], the largest example of this type of Early Medieval figure to survive from anywhere in Europe. These appear to have been life-size, or nearly so, and were mostly [[crucifix]]es, sometimes with figures of Mary and [[John the Evangelist]] on either side. Patronage by the great figures of the land, and the largest monasteries, became extravagant in this period, and the greatest late Anglo-Saxon churches must have presented a dazzling spectacle, somewhat in the style of [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches. Anglo-Saxon taste revelled in expensive materials and the effects of light on precious metals, which were also embroidered into fabrics and used on wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of decorated elements from some large looted works such as reliquaries were sawn up by Viking raiders and taken home to their wives to wear as jewellery, and a number of these survive in Scandinavian museums.
[[File:Flickr - portableantiquities - Hilt Fitting.jpg|thumb|300px|Gold and [[garnet]] [[cloisonné]] (and mud); military fitting from the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] before cleaning.]]

While larger works are all lost, several small objects and fragments have survived, nearly all having been buried; in recent decades professional archaeology as well as [[metal-detecting]] and deep ploughing have greatly increased the number of objects known.  Among the few unburied exceptions are the secular [[Fuller Brooch]], and two works made in Anglo-Saxon style carried to Austria by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], the [[Tassilo Chalice]] (late 8th century) and the [[Rupertus Cross]].  Especially in the 9th century, Anglo-Saxon styles, sometimes derived from manuscripts rather than metal examples, are found in a great number of smaller pieces of jewellery and other small fittings from across northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 9, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt; From England itself, the [[Alfred Jewel]], with an enamel face, is the best known of a group of finely worked liturgical jewels, and there are a number of high quality disk brooches.  The most ornate of earlier ones are colourful and complicated with inlays and filigrees, but the 9th century [[Pentney Hoard]], discovered in 1978, contained six splendid brooches in flat silver openwork in the "[[Trewhiddle]] style".  In these small but fully formed animals, of no recognisable species, contort themselves in foliage and tendrils that interlace, but without the emphatic geometry of the earlier "ribbon" style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/pentney_hoard_brooches.aspx British Museum] Six disc brooches from the Pentney hoard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ædwen's brooch]], an 11th-century [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] silver disk brooch, shows influence from [[Viking art]], and a fall-off from the highest earlier standards of workmanship.

In 2009 the [[Staffordshire hoard]], a major hoard of over 1,500 fragments of 7th and ?8th century metalwork pieces, mostly gold and military in nature, many with gold and garnet cloisonné inlays of high quality, was found by a metal-detectorist in [[Staffordshire]], then in Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/highlights-of-anglosaxon-hoard-1792388.html Highlights of Anglo-Saxon hoard], [[The Independent]], 24 September 2009, (retrieved 24 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery is far more often found from burials of the early pagan period, as Christianity discouraged grave-goods, even including the personal possessions of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Early Anglo-Saxon jewellery includes various types of ''fibulae'' that are close to their Continental Germanic equivalents, but until [[Sutton Hoo]] rarely of outstanding quality, which is why that find transformed thinking about early Anglo-Saxon art.

The earliest Anglo-Saxon coin type, the silver ''[[sceat]]'', forced craftsmen, no doubt asked to copy Roman and contemporary continental styles, to work outside their traditional forms and conventions in respect of the heads on the [[obverse]], with results that are varied and often compelling.  Later silver [[Penny (English coin)|pennies]], with largely linear relief heads of kings in profile on the obverse, are more uniform, as representatives of what was a stable and respected currency by contemporary European standards.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; A number of complete ''[[seax]]'' knives have survived with inscriptions and some decoration, and sword fittings and other military pieces are an important form of jewellery.  A treatise on social status needed to say that mere ownership of a gilded sword did not make a man a ''[[ceorle]]'', the lowest rank of free men.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental sculpture and wall painting==
[[File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1833413.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bewcastle Cross]] ([[:File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross (2) - geograph.org.uk - 1833421.jpg|alternative view]])]]
Apart from [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], which survives entirely in churches, with only a handful of largely unaltered examples, monumental stone sculpture survives in large stone crosses, an equivalent to the [[high cross]]es of the Celtic areas of Britain. Most sculpture was probably once painted, clarifying the designs, which are mostly in relatively low relief and not finished with great precision, and now almost all badly worn and weathered.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Dating is usually difficult.  Sculpture in wood was very likely more common, but almost the only significant large survival is [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] in [[Durham Cathedral]], probably made in 698, with numerous linear images carved or incised in a technique that is a sort of large-scale engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 50–53&lt;/ref&gt; The material of the earliest recorded crosses is unknown, but may well have been wood. From various references (to its destruction by Christians) there would seem to have been a tradition of Anglo-Saxon pagan monumental sculpture, probably in wood, of which no examples remain (as opposed to later [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] pagan imagery),&lt;ref&gt;No unmixed examples, that is to say. Scenes from Germanic mythology still appear in works of the Christian period, as in the Franks Casket and Gosforth Cross.&lt;/ref&gt; and with which the crosses initially competed.

The Anglo-Saxon crosses have survived less well than those in Ireland, being more subject to [[iconoclasm]] after the [[English Reformation]]. Some featured large figurative sculpture of considerable quality, as on the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]] (both probably around 800). Vine-scroll decoration and [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] are seen in alternating panels on the early Northumbrian Ruthwell, Bewcastle and [[Easby Cross]]es, though the vine-scroll is already more prominent, and has faces to itself. Later [[Southumbria]]n crosses often only use vine-scrolls.  There may be inscriptions, in the runic or Roman scripts, and Latin or [[Old English]], most famously at Ruthwell, where some of the poem the ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'' is inscribed together with Latin texts; more often donors are commemorated. It has also been suggested that as well as paint, they may have been embellished with metalwork and gems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandbach.gov.uk/Guide/Crosses.htm Sanbach crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, Anglo-Saxon crosses are tall and slender compared to Irish examples, many with a nearly square section, and more space given to ornament than figures.  However, there are exceptions, like the massive [[Sandbach Crosses]] from Mercia, with oblong sections mostly covered by figures on the wider faces, like some Irish crosses.  The [[Gosforth Cross]], of 930–950, is a rare example to survive complete; most survivals are only a section of the shaft, and iconoclasts were more concerned to destroy imagery than ornament.  Many crosses must have just fallen over after some centuries; headpieces are the least common survivals, and the Easby Cross was repaired with lead in a way described in early documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93731/stone-carving-the-easby-cross/ V&amp;A Museum], Easby Cross, A.88–1930&lt;/ref&gt; Like many monuments from the area of the [[Danelaw]], the Gosforth Cross combines Christian images with those from pagan mythology; apart from a Crucifixion scene, and perhaps scenes of the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]], all the other images appear to belong to the Norse myth of ''[[Ragnarök]]'', the destruction of the gods, a theme detected in other Christian monuments in Britain and Scandinavia, and which could be turned to Christian advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 18–22; Wilson, 150&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:St Oswald's Priory Anglo-Saxon cross.jpg|thumb|Fragment of cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]]; at right with added, but perhaps not inauthentic, colour.]]

Anglo-Scandinavians took up Anglo-Saxon sculptural forms with great enthusiasm, and in Yorkshire alone there are fragments from more than 500 monumental sculptures of the 10th and 11th centuries.  However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by [[David M. Wilson]] as "generally miserable and slipshod".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–152; 142 "more than 500; 144 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages the successive styles of [[Norse art]] appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the [[Borre style]] are seen, for example in the "ring-chain" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the [[Jelling style]] are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next [[Mammen style]] are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the [[Isle of Man]].  They are "perhaps, dimly" evident in the cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]] (illustrated right).  In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–149, quote 147&lt;/ref&gt; A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the [[Hogback (sculpture)|hogback]], low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end.  Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 149; Laing's typology is shown in 3 pages of drawings [http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015224136/http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm |date=15 October 2012 }} from the ''AS Sculpture Corpus'' website; [http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_p2/1.6781563 photo of good examples from Brompton, Yorkshire]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments, parts of friezes and panels with figure and ornamental carving, have been recovered by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches.  The largest group of Anglo-Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at [[Breedon-on-the-Hill]] in Mercia, with a number of elements of different dates, including lively narrow decorative strip friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], from [[St Mary's Church, Reculver]], in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century).  A ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' and an ''Ascension'' can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 40–41; Wilson, 70–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing equally apart from other survivals is a late slab from the [[Old Minster, Winchester]] which appears to show a section of a large frieze with the story from Germanic mythology of [[Sigmund]], which it has been suggested may have been as long as eighty feet wide, and over four feet high.  There are literary references to secular narrative tapestries, a tradition of which the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is the only survival, and this may have been a stone equivalent, celebrating Sigmund, who was believed to be an ancestor of the intermarried royal houses of both England and [[Denmark]], many of whom were buried in what was then the largest church in England.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 133–134; Dodwell (1982), 137–138; Henderson, 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also clear from literary sources that wall paintings were not uncommon, although not a prestigious form, and fragments of painted plaster have been found, as well as a painted face on a reused stone at [[Winchester]], dating to before 903, and so an important early example of the Winchester figure style.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 92–93; Wilson, 10–13, 155; Golden Age, 44&lt;/ref&gt; A metaphor in a letter of [[Alcuin]] speaks of "stars, like the painted ceiling of a great man's house".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131&lt;/ref&gt; However, no paintings that are at all complete have survived on either wall or panel.

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 010-crop.jpg|thumb|310px|Head of a [[tau cross]], with ''[[Christ Treading on the Beasts]]'', an especially popular subject in England]]
As in the rest of the Christian world, while monumental sculpture was slowly re-emerging from its virtual absence in the Early Christian period, small-scale sculpture in metalwork, [[ivory carving]] and also [[bone carving]] was more important than in later periods, and by no means a "minor art".  Most Anglo-Saxon ivory was from marine animals, especially the [[walrus]], imported from further north. The extraordinary early [[Franks Casket]] is carved from [[whalebone]], which a [[riddle]] on it alludes to. It contains a unique mixture of pagan, historical and Christian scenes, evidently attempting to cover a general history of the world, and inscriptions in [[rune]]s in both Latin and [[Old English]]. We have few Anglo-Saxon panels from book-covers compared to those from [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] but a number of figures of very high quality in high relief or fully in the round.  In the last phase of Anglo-Saxon art two styles are apparent: one a heavier and formal one drawing from Carolingian and Ottonian sources, and the other the Winchester style, drawing from the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and an alternative Carolingian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 88&lt;/ref&gt; A very late [[buxus|boxwood]] casket, now in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is carved all over with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in a provincial but accomplished version of the Winchester style, possibly originating in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and is a unique survival of late Anglo-Saxon fine wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 125–126;[http://www.clevelandart.org/collections/collection%20online.aspx?pid={91ADCD8F-992A-45A5-8599-70835467DF5E}&amp;coid=5870087&amp;clabel=highlights Cleveland Museum of Art], Accession No.: 1953.362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textile art==
[[File:Fleeing bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|left|The English army flee, the final surviving scene of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]   
The textile arts of embroidery and "tapestry", ''[[Opus anglicanum]]'', were apparently those for which Anglo-Saxon England was famous throughout Europe by the end of the period, but there are only a handful of survivals, probably partly because of the Anglo-Saxon love of using threads in precious metal, making the work valuable for scrap.  

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is embroidered in wool on [[linen]] and shows the story of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; it is surely the best known Anglo-Saxon work of art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art-historians.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 195; Dodwell (1982), 138–139. However a number of fringe theories persist – see the article. See also Henderson, 168–177 for an extended appreciation.&lt;/ref&gt; Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry must be exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover very large areas. All kinds of textile arts were produced by women, both nuns and laywomen, but many were probably designed by artists in other media. [[Byzantine silk]]s were available, though certainly expensive, in Anglo-Saxon England, and a number of pieces have been found used in burials and reliquaries.  Probably, as in later vestments, these were often married with locally embroidered borders and panels. If we had more Anglo-Saxon survivals, Byzantine influences would no doubt be apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter V; Dodwell (1993), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most highly valued embroideries were very different, fully worked in silk and gold of silver thread, and sometimes with gems of various sorts sewn in. These were used for vestments, altar-cloths and other church uses, and similar roles in the homes of the elite. Only a few pieces have survived, including three pieces at Durham placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert, probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were made in Winchester between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to the wall-painting fragment from Winchester mentioned above, and an early example of acanthus decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition; [https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/individual-textiles-and-textile-types/religious-vestments-and-other-textiles/st-cuthbert-embroideries St. Cuthbert Embroideries], from Textile Research Centre, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in his Benedictional (see above), which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other materials==
[[File:Claw beaker from Ringmere Farm BM 2005.12-5.1.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Claw beaker]] in glass]]
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] was mostly made in simple forms, with vessels always in a single colour, either clear, green or brown, but some fancy [[claw beaker]]s decorated with large "claw" forms have survived, mostly broken; these forms are also found in northern continental Europe.  Beads, common in early female burials, and some ecclesiastical window glass was more brightly coloured, and several monastic sites have evidence of glass production.  Vessel and bead production probably continued, at a much lower level, from the Romano-British industry, but Bede records that [[Benedict Biscop]] brought glass-makers from [[Gaul]] for window glass at his monasteries.  It is not clear how much Anglo-Saxon glass was imported, but canes of [[millefiori]] coloured glass almost certainly were; one of these was in the purse at Sutton Hoo.  Otherwise recycling of Roman glass may have avoided the need to import raw glass; evidence for the production of this is slender.  Glass is sometimes used as a substitute for garnet in jewellery, as in some pieces from Sutton Hoo. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamel]] was used, most famously in the [[Alfred Jewel]], where the image sits under carved [[rock crystal]], both materials are extremely rare in surviving Anglo-Saxon work.

The unique decorated leather cover of the small Northumbrian [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], the oldest Western [[bookbinding]] to survive unaltered, can be dated to 698 or shortly before.  It uses incised lines, some colours, and relief decoration built up over cord and [[gesso]] or leather pieces. Larger prestige manuscripts had metalwork [[treasure binding]]s, several of which are mentioned, but there may well have been much decorated leatherwork for secular satchels, purses, belts and the like, which contemporaries did not bother to mention and which represents a gap in our knowledge for the Early Medieval period throughout Europe.

==Aftermath==
[[File:The St Cuthbert Gospel of St John. (formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel) is the oldest intact European book. - Upper cover (Add Ms 89000) (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The front cover of the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], 690s; the original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving Western [[bookbinding]]]]

Relatively little art survives from the rest of the century after 1066, or at least is confidently dated to that period.  The art of Normandy was already under heavy Anglo-Saxon influence, but the period was one of massive despoliation of the churches by the small new ruling class, who had almost entirely dispossessed the old Anglo-Saxon elite. Under these circumstances little significant art was produced, but when it was, the style often showed a slow development of Anglo-Saxon styles into a fully Romanesque version.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 17–23, 83–84, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of many individual objects has jumped around across the boundary of the Norman Conquest, especially for sculpture, including ivories. A number of objects are claimed for their period by both the "Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art" and the "English Romanesque art: 1066–1200" exhibition catalogues, despite both being published in 1984.  These include the ivory triangle mount with angels and the "Sigurd" stone relief fragment (discussed above), both from Winchester, and the ivory "pen-case" and ''Baptism'' (illustrated above), both in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively numbers: Golden Age: 114, 140, 132, 117, and Zarnecki: 190, 97, 185, 180.  There are many other examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy, love of complicated twining ornament, and refusal to wholly respect a dignified classical decorum that are displayed in both Insular and Winchester school art had already influenced continental style, as discussed above, where it provided an alternative to the heavy monumentality that [[Ottonian art]] displays even in small objects.  This habit of mind was an essential component of both the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles, where forms of Anglo-Saxon invention such as the inhabited and historiated initials became more important than they ever had in Anglo-Saxon art itself, and works like the [[Gloucester Candlestick]] (c. 1110) show the process in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-Saxon [[iconography|iconographical]] innovations include the animal [[Hellmouth]], the [[Ascension of Christ|ascending Christ]] shown only as a pair of legs and feet disappearing at the top of the image, the horned [[Moses]], St [[John the Evangelist]] standing at the foot of the cross and writing, and [[God the Father]] creating the world with a [[pair of compasses]].  All of these were later used across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest developed depiction of the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' in the West is also found on an Anglo-Saxon ivory, and a late Anglo-Saxon Gospel book may show the earliest example of [[Mary Magdalene]] at the foot of the cross in a ''Crucifixion''.&lt;ref&gt;It is the earliest cited by Schiller, II, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''bridge tower''' ({{lang-de|Brückenturm}}) was a type of [[fortified tower]] built on a [[bridge]]. They were typically built in the period up to [[early modern times]] as part of a [[city wall|city or town wall]] or [[castle]]. There is usually a tower at both ends of the bridge. During the 19th century, a number of bridge towers were built in the [[Gothic Revival]] style – [[Tower Bridge]] in [[London]] is perhaps the best known example; however, many original medieval towers survive across Europe.

== Function ==
[[File:Frankfurt Brückenturm um 1600.jpg|thumb|upright|Bridge tower on the [[Old Bridge, Frankfurt am Main|Old Bridge]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]] around 1600]]
These towers were built in pre-medieval and [[medieval]] times to guard access to the bridge and to enable the charging of  [[road toll (historic)|tolls]] on important [[road]]s crossing rivers, usually near towns and cities. The rivers were often part of the defences of these settlements. As a result, it was important from a defensive perspective that the bridges did not allow attacking enemies to break in. The bridges acted as a bulwark and often had a small [[drawbridge]]. In addition to their genuine protective and defensive functions they also played a symbolic and architectural role. Often these towers were the first public buildings that the travellers saw when approaching the city.

Sometimes, the same building served as bridge tower and [[bridge chapel]], for example at the [[Krämerbrücke]] in [[Erfurt]].

The high cost of such towers was usually paid for by charging tolls. The gates of bridge towers were closed at night, so that no-one could cross the bridge during silent hours.
&lt;!--
Im 19. Jahrhundert wurden [[Neuromanik|neoromanische]] Brückentürme errichtet. Diese Türme dienten vor allem [[Architektur|architektonischer]] Ausschmückung, aber auch militärischen Absicherung. Gelegentlich werden auch moderne [[Pylon (Brückenbau)|Pylone]] vom [[Hängebrücke|Hänge-]] oder [[Schrägseilbrücke]]n als Brückentürme bezeichnet.

Nachdem bis zum Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts die Brückenzölle endgültig abgeschafft wurden, verloren die Türme ihre Funktion. Mit zunehmendem [[Verkehrsstärke|Verkehrsaufkommen]] wurden die Brückentürme zu einem Verkehrshindernis. Daher kam es oft zum [[Abbruch (Bauwesen)|Abbruch]] der Türme. Heute dienen die wenigen erhaltenen Brückentürme als Wahrzeichen der jeweiligen Stadt und sind Anziehungspunkt für Touristen.

A '''cinematographer''' or '''director of photography''' (sometimes shortened to '''DP''' or '''DOP''') is the chief over the camera and light [[film crew|crew]]s working on a [[film]], television production or other live action piece and is responsible for making artistic and technical decisions related to the image. The study and practice of this field is referred to as [[cinematography]].

The cinematographer selects the camera, [[film stock]], [[photographic lens|lens]]es, [[filter (photography)|filter]]s, etc., to realize the scene in accordance with the intentions of the [[film director|director]]. Relations between the cinematographer and director vary; in some instances the director will allow the cinematographer complete independence; in others, the director allows little to none, even going so far as to specify exact camera placement and lens selection. Such a level of involvement is not common once the director and cinematographer have become comfortable with each other; the director will typically convey to the cinematographer what is wanted from a scene visually, and allow the cinematographer latitude in achieving that effect.

Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the [[Coen brothers]]' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. In 2014, [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s [[Batman in film#Christopher Nolan|three ''Batman'' films]], made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''; whilst British cinematographers [[Jack Cardiff]] and [[Freddie Francis]] regularly moved between the two positions.

==History==
[[File:Alex Ferrari.jpg|thumb|A cinematographer on set]]
In the infancy of motion pictures, the cinematographer was usually also the [[Film director|director]] and the person physically handling the camera. As the art form and technology evolved, a separation between director and [[camera operator]] emerged. With the advent of artificial lighting and faster (more light sensitive) [[film stock]]s, in addition to technological advancements in optics, the technical aspects of cinematography necessitated a specialist in that area.

Cinematography was key during the [[silent movie]] era; with no sound apart from [[background music]] and no dialogue, the films depended on lighting, acting, and set.

In 1919 Hollywood, the then-new motion picture capital of the world, one of the first (and still existing) trade societies was formed: the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (ASC), which stood to recognize the cinematographer's contribution to the art and science of motion picture making. Similar trade associations have been established in other countries too.

==Societies and trade organizations==
There are a number of national associations of cinematographers which represent members (irrespective of their official titles) and which are dedicated to the advancement of cinematography. These include:

*the [[American Society of Cinematographers]] (A.S.C.)
*the [[Canadian Society of Cinematographers]] (C.S.C.)
*the [[British Society of Cinematographers]] (B.S.C.)
*the [[Australian Cinematographers Society]] (A.C.S.)
*the [[Cinematographers Guild of Korea]] (C.G.K.)
*the [[Filipino Society of Cinematographers]] (F.S.C.) 
*the [[French Society of Cinematographers]] (A.F.C.)
*the [[Italian Society of Cinematographers]] (A.I.C.) 
*the [[Indian cinematographers|Indian Society of Cinematographers]] (I.S.C.)
*the [[German Society of Cinematographers]] (BVK)
*the [[Netherlands Society of Cinematographers]] (NSC) 
*the [[Spanish Society of Cinematography Works]] (A.E.C)
*the European Federation of Cinematographers / IMAGO
*the Uruguayan Society of Cinematographers (S.C.U)

The A.S.C. defines cinematography as:
:A creative and interpretive process that culminates in the authorship of an original work of art rather than the simple recording of a physical event. Cinematography is not a subcategory of photography. Rather, photography is but one craft that the cinematographer uses in addition to other physical, organizational, managerial, interpretive and image-manipulating techniques to effect one coherent process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''coffin home''' ({{zh|t=義莊|s=义庄|cy=yih-jōng|p=yìzhuāng}}; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{nihongo||義荘|gisō}}) is a temporary [[coffin]] depository where the coffins containing the [[cadaver]]s of recently diseased people are temporarily stored while awaiting transport to the place of burial. The term is also losely used to refer to [[Bedspace apartment]]s.

''Yih-jong'' (義莊) literally means "mansion of righteousness" and originally referred to any [[charitable organization]]. These charities were typically established by prominent families to promote their standing in the community. The designation ''yih-jong'' was first used by Fan's Yih-Jong (范氏義莊), established by [[Song dynasty|Song Dynasty]] imperial chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] in his hometown [[Suzhou]]. Emulating Fan's model, many prominent families founded yih-jongs between the Song and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dyanasties to support their clansmen and local communities, offering charitable services such as [[Orphanage|orphanages]], free schools, [[Disaster response|disaster relief]], and [[Morgue|mortuaries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jscz.gov.cn/pub/jscz/czwh/shzc/201409/t20140929_63427.html|title=清代民间慈善事业-史海摘萃|last=|first=|date=|website=江苏省财政厅|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.sohu.com/a/192738555_750828?_f=m-article_34_feeds_14|title=家族·慈善 {{!}} 北宋范仲淹创立的“范氏义庄”为何持续了800多年？-历史频道-手机搜狐|website=m.sohu.com|language=zh-cn|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''yih-jong'' eventually became a euphemism for "coffin home" or "morgue" by the late 19th century. This is because they were the ''de facto'' [[Funeral director|undertakers]] of dead people whose next of kin could not be found or were too poor to afford funeral services, and provided temporary storage and transport of the coffins and bodies of emigrants who desired burial in their place of origin. The establishment of [[Tung Wah Coffin Home]] in Hong Kong in 1875, named "Tung Wah Yih Jong" (東華義莊) in [[Cantonese|Cantonese Chinese]], firmly entrenched this euphemistic use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Coffin homes are primarily found in [[Greater China]] and places with substantial [[overseas Chinese]] populations. Most coffins that pass through the care of a coffin home are those of [[Migrant worker|migrant workers]] who die in their place of work but who desired burial in their home villages. Coffin homes also provide temporary storage for deceased persons who are unable to afford a [[funeral]] or whose relatives cannot be located.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hk01.com/%E7%A4%BE%E5%8D%80/75579/%E5%A4%A7%E5%8F%A3%E7%92%B0%E6%9B%BE%E6%98%AF%E9%9D%88%E9%AD%82%E4%B8%AD%E8%BD%89%E7%AB%99-%E5%8A%A9%E6%95%B8%E4%BB%A5%E8%90%AC%E8%A8%88%E8%8F%AF%E4%BA%BA%E6%AD%BB%E5%BE%8C-%E5%9B%9E%E5%AE%B6-%E7%9A%84%E6%9D%B1%E8%8F%AF%E7%BE%A9%E8%8E%8A|title=大口環曾是靈魂中轉站：助數以萬計華人死後「回家」的東華義莊|last=呂嘉麗|website=香港01|language=en|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kknews.cc/history/envgez.html|title=解放前，專門寄放棺柩屍體的義莊是什麼樣子的|access-date=2017-11-27|language=zh-tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Croatia}}
'''Croatian art''' describes the [[visual arts]] in [[Croatia]] from medieval times to the present. In [[Early Middle Ages]], Croatia was an important centre for [[art]] and architecture in south eastern Europe. There were many Croatian artists during the [[Medieval]] period, and the arts flourished during the [[Renaissance]]. Later styles in Croatia included [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]].

== Ancient heritage ==
=== Prehistoric art ===
Ancient monuments from [[Palaeolithic]] times are very poor and consist mainly of simple stone and bone objects.

Ancient inhabitants of Mediterranean cultures on the Adriatic Coast and those of [[Pannonian]] cultures in the continental area of the present-day Republic of Croatia, were developing [[Neolithic]] cultures in the boundaries of present-day Republic of Croatia. The Neolithic is marked by the production of [[ceramic]]s and [[sculptures]] with human and animal themes presented as symbolic art. The most investigated are listed chronologically:
*''Starčević culture'' (Pannonian culture named after its founder archaeologist ''Starčević'') had characteristically fine red and ochre ceramics.
*''Istrian culture'' (named after peninsula [[Istria]] in Croatia) which characteristic is stone houses (''Bunja'') without any type of bonding material, natively called dry-wall building (''suhozid''). These types of houses have stayed in use until the 19th century for shepherds.
*''Sopot culture'' and ''Korenovo culture'' (named after towns of ''Sopot'' and ''Korenovo'' in [[Slavonia]]) with original ceramic pots decorated with flat parallel lines, curves or V-shaped cuts.
*''Danilo culture'' (found on [[Adriatic]] coast and islands) was rich with fine dark ceramics decorated with engraved geometrical motifs, spirals and [[meanders]]. *''Danilo culture'' (found on [[Adriatic]] Coast and Islands) was rich with fine dark ceramics decorated with engraved geometrical motifs, spirals and [[meanders]]. Out of this culture developed the ''Hvar culture'' (after large island of Hvar) that is linked with Neolithic [[Greece|Greek]] cultures.
There are also [[Neolithic]] excavation sites in ''Ščitarjevo'' near [[Zagreb]], ''Nakovanj'' on the [[Pelješac]] peninsula and elsewhere.

===Copper Age===
One of the most unusual [[Copper Age]] or [[Eneolithic]] finds is from the ''Vučedol culture'' (named after [[Vučedol]] near [[Vukovar]]). Ceramics are of extraordinary quality with black color, high glow and specific decorative geometrical cuts that were encrusted with white, red or yellow color. Few sculptures have been found.  They are very skilfully and expressively done (like the ''pot in shape of Dove'' with engraved double axe – ''labrys''). People lived on hilltops with [[palisade]] walls. Houses were half buried, mostly square or circular (they were also combined in mushroom shape), with a floor of burned clay and circular fireplace.

===Bronze Age===
Out of that culture emerged [[Bronze Age]] ''Vinkovci culture'' (named after the city of [[Vinkovci]]) that is recognizable by bronze fibulas that were replacing objects like needles and buttons.

The ''Bronze culture'' of the [[Illyrians]], ethno-tribal groups with distinct cultures, and art forms started to emerge from the cultures of the Copper Age.  These Illyrian ethno-tribal areas were found in present-day Croatia, and Bosna and Hercegovina. From the 7th Century BC, ''iron'' replaced bronze and only jewelry and art objects were still made out of bronze. The Celtic [[Halstat]] culture which bordered the Balkan region where the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups were living influenced them, but the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups formed their regional centers slightly differently.
In the northern Balkan Peninsula, the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups had the ''cult of the dead'', as evidenced from the richness of and care for burial sites, from which burial ceremonies are deduced. These burial sites show a long tradition of [[cremation]] and burial in shallow graves.  In the southern Balkan Peninsula, the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups buried their dead are in large stone, or earth [[tumuli]] (natively called – ''gromile'').
Illyrian [[Japod]] tribes had an affinity for decoration with heavy, oversized necklaces out of yellow, blue or white glass paste.  The Illyrian Japod tribes also had affinities for large bronze [[fibula]]s, spiral bracelets, [[diadems]], and [[helmets]] made out of bronze. Small sculptures made of [[jade]] made from the [[Archaic period in Greece|archaic]] [[Ionians|Ionian]] plastic are also found in Japodian tribal areas. Numerous monumental sculptures are preserved, as well as walls of a [[citadel]] called ''Nezakcij'' near present-day [[Pula]], one of the numerous Istrian cities from [[Iron Age]].

===Celtic Entrance to Balkan Peninsula===
In the 4th century BC, the first emergence [[Celts]] into the Illyrian ethno-tribal areas of the Balkans is recorded; they brought the technique of the [[pottery wheel]], new types of fibulas and different bronze and iron belts, which the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups had not independently developed. The Celts also mixed with the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups in Slavonia, Istria, and Dalmatia.  They passed through Greece burning several Greek Polis on their way to settling in Asia Minor (Anatolia) where they remained to be addressed by Saint Paul in his Epistle to the Galatians.

==The Greco-Illyrians &amp; Roman Conquest ==
In the [[Neretva Delta]] in the South, there was the important influence of [[Hellenistic]] Greco-Illyrian tribe of the [[Daors]].  Illyrian tribes conquered Greek colonies on Dalmatian islands.  The Queen [[Teuta]] of ''Issa'' (Today Issa island is known as the island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]].) is famous because she waged wars with [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. But finally, Romans subdued Illyrians ethno-tribal groups in the 1st Century BC.  After that, these [[Illyrian provinces]] became parts of [[Roman Empire|Rome]] and New Rome ([[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenet.hr/default.aspx?id=23037 |title=ART |publisher=Culturenet.hr |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
[[Greece|Greek]] sailors and merchants from the Greek City States of the south of the Balkan peninsula reached almost every part of Mediterranean including the Adriatic Sea coast of present-day Croatia. Greeks also came from [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] on [[Sicily]] in 390 BC to the islands of Vis (''Issa''), [[Hvar]] (''Pharos''), and [[Korčula]] (''Corcyra Nigra'') thereby founding [[city-state]]s amongst the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups. Greek trade cities on the [[Adriatic]] Coast such as ''Tragurion'' (today called [[Trogir]]), ''Salona'' (today called [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]] near present-day [[Split (city)|Split]]), ''Epetion'' (today called [[Stobreč]]), Issa (today called Vis), were geometrically shaped and had [[villa]]s, harbours, public buildings, temples and theatres. Pharos and Issa were strong Greek City States that showed their independence with their own coinage and maritime fleets. Unfortunately, besides painted pots and ceramic [[tanagra]] sculptures, there are few daily living materials remaining of this culture. Two of those are: the ''[[Croatian Apoxyomenos]]'', and the ''Bronze head of goddess Artemis'' from the Greek City State of Issa, which dates from the 4th century BC.  Another example is a ''stone relief of Kairos'' (god of joyfulness) from the Greek City-State Tragurion, which dates from the 3rd Century BC, and is associated with the famous Greek sculptor [[Lysippos]].

While the [[Greek colonies]]  were flourishing on the Adriatic Coast and Islands, on the mainland the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups were organizing their centers. Illyrian ethno-tribal art became greatly influenced by Greek Art, and the Illyrian ethno-tribal groups copied some Greek Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/panorama.asp?id=55 | title=Greek Colonisation of the Eastern Adriatic | work=culturenet.hr | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331024555/http://www.culturenet.hr/v1/english/panorama.asp?id=55 | archivedate=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Romans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artchive.com/artchive/R/roman.html |title=Roman Art |publisher=Artchive.com |date= |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; subdued Greek colonial cities in the 3rd century BC. They have imposed organization based on the military-economical system. Furthermore, Romans subdued Illyrians in the 1st century BC and organized the entire coastal territory by transforming citadels into urban cities. After that the history of these parts is a history of Illyrian provinces of Roman Empire.

Numerous rustic villas, and new urban settlements (the most impressive are ''Verige'' in [[Brijuni]], [[Pula]] and Trogir - formerly Tragurion) demonstrate high level of Roman [[urbanization]]. There have been at least thirty urban cities in [[Istria]], [[Liburnia]] and [[Dalmatia]] with Roman citizenship ([[civitas]]). The best-preserved nets of Roman streets  (decumanus/cardo) are those in ''Epetion'' (Poreč) and ''Jader'' ([[Zadar]]).

The most entirely preserved Roman monuments are in ''Pola'' ([[Pula]]); founded in the 1st century dedicated to [[Julius Caesar]], it is full with classical [[Roman art]] as: stonewalls, two city gates, two temples on [[Forum (Roman)|Forum]], and remains of two theatres, as well as the [[Arch]] from year 30&amp;nbsp;AD, and the temple of August build in years 2 to 14&amp;nbsp;AD, and finally the Fluvian [[Amphitheatre]] (so called – [[Arena]]) from the 2nd century.

In the 3rd century AD, the city of ''Salona'' becomes the largest (it had 40,000 inhabitants) and the most important city of Dalmatia. Near the city emperor [[Diocletian]], born in Salona, build ''the Palace'' (around year 300&amp;nbsp;AD), which is largest and most important monument of late antique architecture in the World. On its pathways, [[Basement|cellar]]s, [[dome]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and courtyards one can trace numerous different art influences from the entire Empire.

Some of the sculptures are: ''the head of a boy, girl and a woman'' from Salona, ''monumental figure of Minerva'' from [[Varaždin]], ''the head of Hercules'' from [[Sinj]], ''sculptures of Roman emperors'' from [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and ''Vid'' near [[Metković]], ''damaged sculpture of emperor'' in [[Zagreb]] Museum etc.

In the 4th century Salona became the center of [[Christianity]] for entire western [[Balkans]]. It had numerous [[basilica]]s and necropolises, and even two saints: ''Domnius'' ([[Duje]]) and [[Anastasius the Fuller|Anastasius]] (''Staš'').

One of few preserved basilicas in western Europe (besides ones in [[Ravenna]]) from the time of early [[Byzantium]] is [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Porec|Poreč]] from the 6th century.

The early Middle Ages brought the [[Migration Period|great migration of the Slavs]] and this period was perhaps a ''[[Dark Age]]'' in the cultural sense until the successful formation of the Slavic states which coexisted with Italic cities that remained on the coast, each of them were modelled like [[Venice]].

In the 7th century the [[Croats]], with other [[Slavs]] and [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], came from Northern Europe to the region where they live today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.org.rs/arheologija/vsedov-slavs_2.html |title=Slavs in the Early Middle Ages | year=1995 | work=Rastko.org.rs | publisher=Project Rastko |last=Sedov | first=Valentin V.|accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were on the level of Iron Age nomadic culture, so they did not know how to enjoy the advantages of urban cities. the country side around Roman cities rivers (like ''Jadro'' near Roman [[Salona]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/barb/hd_barb.htm |title=Barbarians and Romans|last=Holcomb |first=Melanie |work=Metmuseum.org |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|date= |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knindign11thcent.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Croatian dignitary, 11th century, [[Knin]] area]]
The [[Croats]] were open to [[Roman art]] and culture, and first of all to [[Christianity]]. ''First churches'' were built as royal sanctuaries, and influences of Roman art was strongest in Dalmatia where urbanization was thickest, and there was the largest number of monuments. Gradually that influence was neglected and certain simplification, alteration of inherited forms and even creation of original buildings appeared. All of them (dozen large ones and hundreds of small ones) were built with ''roughly cut stone'' (natively called – ''lomljenac'') bounded with a thick layer of "malter" from outside. Large churches are longitudinal with one or three [[naves]] like the [[Church of Holy Salvation, Cetina|Church of Holy Salvation]] on spring of river [[Cetina]] and the [[Church of Saint Cross]] near Nin, both built in the 9th century. The latter has strong semi-circular [[buttresses]] that give a feeling of [[fortification]], emphasizing the [[bell-tower]] positioned in front of the entrance.

Smaller churches are unusually shaped (mainly central) with several [[apses]]. The largest and most complicated central based church from the 9th century is [[Donatus of Zadar|St Donatus]] in [[Zadar]]. Around its circular center – with [[dome]] above – is [[nave]] in shape of a ring with three apses directed to the east; that shape is followed on the second floor forming a [[Long gallery|gallery]]. From those times, with its size and beauty one can only compare the chapel of [[Charlemagne]] in [[Aachen]].

[[Altar]] fence and windows of those churches were highly decorated with transparent shallow string-like [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] that is called ''pleter'' - [[Croatian interlace]] - because the strings were threaded and rethreaded through themselves.

Motifs of those reliefs were taken from Roman art (waves, three-string interlace, pentagrams, net of rhomboids etc.), but while in the Roman art they only made the frame of a sculpture in Dark Ages it fills entire surface. Those reliefs were vividly colored (red, blue and yellow), and because the paintings from that period are not preserved (it is known they existed because they were mentioned in written sources as ''liturgical from Split'', 8th-11th centuries), they remain the only remains of old-Croatian painting.
[[File:Vekenegin evanđelistar.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Illuminated page from [[Vekenega]]'s evangelistary, c. 1096]]

Sometimes the figures from Bible appeared alongside this decoration, like ''relief in Holy Nedjeljica'' in Zadar, and then they were subdued by their pattern. That happened to engravings in early Croatian script – [[Glagolitic]].

Soon, the "Glagolitic" writing was replaced with [[Latin]] on altar fences and [[architrave]]s of old-Croatian churches. Those inscriptions usually mention to whom the church was dedicated, who build it and when it was built, as well who produced the building. That was the way that ''"barbarian newcomers"'' could fit amongst the Romanised natives.

From ''Crown Church of [[King Zvonimir]]'' (so-called ''Hollow Church'' in [[Solin, Croatia|Solin]]) comes to the altar board with the ''figure of the Croatian King'' on the throne with [[Carolingian]] crown, servant by his side and subject bowed to the king. Linear cuts representing lines on the robes are similar to lines on their frontal faces, and also on those of a frame. Today the board is a part of [[Split (city)|Split]] [[cathedral]] [[baptistery]].

Out of artistically applied objects, there are many [[reliquaries]] preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/relc/hd_relc.htm |title=Relics and Reliquaries in Medieval Christianity |work=Metmuseum.org |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|last=Drake Boehm |first=Barbara |date= |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were adored and believed to have magical powers of healing. They were usually shaped as the part of body that was in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12762a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Reliquaries |publisher=Newadvent.org |year=1911 |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That's why the ''relic of Saint James's head'' in Zadar is shaped in form of a head; the tube part has section with stream of arcades with single saint in every one, while a dome-like cover is decorated with medallions bearing symbols of evangelist and Christ on the top.

By uniting with the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] state in the 12th century, Croatia lost its independence, but it did not lose its ties with the south and the west, and instead, this ensured the beginning of a new era of [[Central Europe]]an cultural influence.

===Romanesque art===
[[File:Tafel 027-28 Spalato - Dom, romanische Türflügel vom Hauptportal - Heliografie Kowalczyk 1909.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wooden door of the [[Split Cathedral]] by the sculptor [[Andrija Buvina]] around 1210.]]
Early [[Romanesque art]] appeared in Croatia at the beginning of the 11th century with the strong development of [[monasteries]] and reform of the church. In that period many valuable monuments and artifacts were made. They can be found mainly alongside Croatian coast and nearby lands: Istria, Dalmatia, and Primorje; while artifacts and monuments from Croatian north are scarce. 

In the 11th century, the monumental cities were built along the entire Dalmatian coast. Houses were out of stone, on ground floor there were shops or dinners (natively – ''konoba'') like in cities as: [[Poreč]], [[Rab]], [[Zadar]], [[Trogir]] and [[Split (city)|Split]]. In them the most important buildings were churches. They were commonly stone-built basilicas with three naves, three apses, columns, arches, arcades and wooden roofs; build near [[monasteries]] of [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictian]] monks who came out of Italy. [[St. Peter]] in ''Supetarska Draga'' on the island of Rab (11th century) is the best-preserved church of that type in Croatia. On the same island is ''Cathedral of Rab'' (12th century) that has high-Romanesque [[bell tower]], largest in Dalmatia. It is specific with its openings, which are multiplied as one goes higher floor by floor (Latin: mono-fore, bi-fore, tri-fore, quadro-fore); typical for Romanesque, but also architecturally smart because it makes every next floor a bit lighter than the preceding one.

[[Cathedral of St. Anastasia, Zadar]] (natively - St. Stošija) in Zadar (13th century) is marked outside by a string of blind arch-[[niche (architecture)|niche]]s on both sides and on frontal side where it also has two [[Rose window]]s with radial columns and three portals. Inside it has three naves, slim columns that are supporting a [[Long gallery|gallery]], and flat figurative reliefs.
[[File:Trogir cathedral entrance.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Portal of the [[Trogir cathedral]] by sculptor [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]], c. 1240]]
In Croatian Romanesque sculpture, there was a transformation of decorative interlace relief (natively – pleter) to figurative, which is found on stone ceilings. At the end of the Romanesque period, in [[Istria]], there were workshops of monumental figures. They had geometrical and naturalistic features reminiscent of gothic.
The best examples of Romanesque sculpture are the wooden doors of the [[Split cathedral]] done by [[Andrija Buvina]] (c. 1220) and the stone portal of the [[Trogir cathedral]] done by artisan [[Radovan (master)|Radovan]] (c. 1240). the 

''Main portal of Trogir cathedral'', done by artisan Radovan, is the greatest and the most important monument of medieval sculpture in Croatia. It consists out of four parts: surrounding, on [[doorjamb]], are naked sculptures of [[Adam and Eve]] on both sides, carried by lions; and inside are numerous reliefs with every-day scenes organized in monthly calendar, and scenes from hunting; and finally in the middle are scenes from the life of Christ: from [[Annunciation]] to [[Resurrection]] – positioned in arches around [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]. Finally, in tympanum is the ''Birth of Christ''. The way the figures are formed is very realistic, calling on new gothic [[humanism]], on the trail of the highest achievements of French sculpture (of that in [[Chartres]]). Radovan is oriented toward human counterpart in art; best seen in selection of main scene in the tympanum – instead of the usual Romanesque motif of [[Last Judgement]] he had chosen ''The Nativity''.

Romanesque painting is on walls, on board and in books – [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]]. Early [[fresco]]es are numerous and best preserved in Istria. The mixing of influences of Eastern and Western Europe is evidenced on them, for example, flat, linear drapes and round red circles on their cheeks. Paintings on board are usually ''Madonna with Child'' and painted [[Crucifixion]]s. The oldest [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]s are from the 13th century – [[Gospels|Evangelical]] book from Split and Trogir.

===Gothic art===
The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] art in the 14th century was supported by a culture of city councils, preaching orders (like [[Franciscans]]), and [[knight]]ly culture. It was the golden age of free Dalmatian cities that were trading with Croatian feudal nobility in the continent. Urban organization and evolution of Dalmatian cities can be followed through the continued development and expansion of [[Rab]] and [[Trogir]], the regulation of streets in [[Dubrovnik]], and the integration of [[Split (city)|Split]]. It was also when streets in this region were paved with stone, [[sewage]] canals were re-developed (the Byzantine Empire retained flushing toilettes, whereas this technology was lost in Roman Catholic Europe), and communal facilities were re-established.

The largest urban project of those times in Dalmatia was the complete design of two new towns – ''Small and Large [[Ston]]''.  The most important feature of those towns was a city wall which was about a '' kilometer of wall'' with guard towers along the walls built in the 14th Century.  [[Hadrian's wall]] in [[Scotland]] is the longest wall in Europe, and these walls are of similar importance in the Balkans.  With these walls the entire [[Pelješac]] Peninsula was surrounded and protected from the Adriatic Coast and from the landward part of the cities with an aim to protect the most valuable possession of the [[Republic of Dubrovnik]] – salt from Ston.

Gothic [[fortification]] can be differentiated by its high towers in the shape of a square prism from simple Romanesque ones or round Renaissance ones. The best-preserved ones in Croatia are Istria ([[Hum, Croatia|Hum]], [[Bale (town)|Bale]], [[Motovun]], [[Labin]] etc.) and those on north (''Medvedgrad'' above [[Zagreb]] from year 1260) or on the south ''Sokolac'' in [[Lika]] (14th century).

''Franciscan church in Pula'' built in 1285, is the most representative example of Early Gothic architecture in Croatia. Simple one-nave building with the wooden rib-vault ceiling, with square apse and high stained glass windows, was built from the 13th to 15th centuries.

[[Tatars]] destroyed Romanesque cathedral in Zagreb during their scourge in 1240, but right after their departure, Zagreb received the title of Free City (Freistadt Zagreb) from King [[Béla IV]]. Soon after [[bishop]] Timotej began to rebuild the cathedral in new Gothic style. Building with three naves, polygonal apses and rib-vault had Romanesque round towers. The naves were built in the 14th century, and the vault was finished in the 15th. With the arrival of [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] in the 16th century, high walls and towers surrounded it. Only one tower was finished in the 17th century, while in the 18th the Baroque roof became the landmark of the entire city. With the restoration in the 19th century in Neo-Gothic style it lost its former harmony.

[[File:Hrvoje Vukcic Hrvatinic.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Illumination from [[Hrvoje's Missal|Hrvoje's liturgy]] written by ''Butko'' in Split, 1404.]]

During the 14th century, ''the Split cathedral of St Duje'' and [[cloister]] of Franciscan [[monastery]] in [[Dubrovnik]] were also built. Early Gothic sculpture is represented by already mentioned ''[[Radovan (master)|Radovan]]'s Portal'' in [[Trogir]].

''The Church of St Mark'' in Zagreb was built in 14th and 15th centuries in Late Gothic style. In that manner was also the main portal with portraits of [[St Mark]], [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] and 12 apostles with slightly rounded heads and softly drapes on their clothes. Originally the entire portal was vividly colored as can be seen by the remains of colors on wooden figures.

In those days, [[Zadar]] was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] city. The most beautiful examples of Gothic humanism in Zadar are reliefs in [[gilded]] metal as in ''Arc of St Simon'' by an artisan from [[Milan]] in 1380. On the arc, by the scenes of saints’ life (finding of the body in monastery's cluster, saving the ship in storm etc.) there are historical ones as entering of [[Louis I of Hungary|King Ludovik]] in Zadar or the oath of his wife [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]] over the saints’ grave.

Gothic [[painting]] is less preserved, and finest works are in Istria as [[fresco]]-cycle of ''Vincent from Kastv'' in ''Church of Holy Mary'' in ''Škriljinah'' near ''Beram'', from 1474. Characters are tangible, three-dimensional in the illusion of space. By the scenes from the life of Christ there is also ''The March of the Dead'' (''The Dance of Death''), which is humanistic, late gothic theme, very popular in [[Renaissance]].

[[Paolo Veneziano]] was the greatest painter of the [[Adriatic]] in the 14th century. His works were mixture of [[Byzantine]] [[iconography]] and Gothic [[idealisation]]. He worked on the [[icons]] in Krk, Rab, Zadar, and Trogir. In Dubrovnik, he has done a masterpiece - ''Dubrovnik Crucifixion''.

From that times are the two of the best and most decorated [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[liturgies]] done by monks from Split, – ''Hvals’ Zbornik'' (today in Zagreb) and ''Misal of Bosnian duke [[Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić]]'' (now in [[Istanbul]]).

== Renaissance ==
{{Main|Renaissance in Croatia}}
[[File:Clovio magi.jpg|thumb|right|240px|An illuminated page from [[Giulio Clovio|Clovio]]'s [[Farnese Hours]], 1546.]]
In the late 16th - 17th century, Croatia was divided between three states – northern Croatia was a part of the Habsburg monarchy, Dalmatia was under the rule of [[Venetian Republic]] (with exception of [[Dubrovnik]]) and Slavonia was under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation. Dalmatia was on the periphery of several influences, just as far from Italy as from Ottomans in Bosnia and Austrians in the north, so it thrived from all. In those circumstances in Dalmatia flourished religious and public architecture with a clear influence of [[Italian renaissance]], but still original. Three works out of that period are of European importance, and will contribute to further development of [[Renaissance]]: ''Cathedral of St James in Šibenik, Chapel of Blessed John in Trogir, and Sorkočević's villa in Dubrovnik.''

Only in the kind of environment, free of dogmas and self-governed - far of major governing centers, could it be possible for artisan known as [[Juraj Dalmatinac]] to build a church entirely by his own project – [[Cathedral of St. James, Šibenik|Cathedral of St. James]] in [[Šibenik]], in 1441. Besides mixing Gothic and Renaissance style it was also original because it used stone and [[montage construction]].  What these terms mean is that big stone blocks, [[pilaster]]s, and [[ribs]] were bounded by [[joints]] with [[Groove (engineering)|slots]] on them without concrete in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. This was unique architecture with the so-called three-leaf frontal and half-barrel vaults, the first in Europe. The cathedral and its original stone [[dome]] was finished by [[Nikola Firentinac]] following the original plans of Juraj. On the cathedral, there is a coronal of 72 sculpture portraits on the outside wall of the apses. Juraj himself did 40 of them, and all are unique with original characteristics on their faces.

[[File:Renaissance star-shaped fortress in Karlovac, Croatia (designed in 1774).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Renaissance star-shaped fortress in [[Karlovac]] (designed in 1579)]]

Work on Šibenik cathedral inspired Nicola for his work on the expansion of ''Chapel of Blessed John from Trogir'' in 1468. Just like Šibenik cathedral, it was composed out of large stone blocks with extreme precision.  In cooperation with the student of Juraj Dalmatinac, [[Andrija Aleši]], Nicola has achieved unique harmony of architecture and sculpture according to antique ideals. From inside, there is no flat wall. In the middle of the chapel, on the altar, lies the [[sarcophagus]] of blessed John of Trogir. Surrounding are reliefs of [[putto]]s carrying torches that look like they were peeping out of doors of Underworld. Above them there are niches with sculptures of Christ and apostles, amongst them are putties, circular windows encircled with fruit garland, and a relief of [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]]. All is ceiled with coffered ceiling with the image of God in the middle and 96 portrait heads of angels. With so many faces of smiling children, the chapel looks very cheerful and there is not anything similar in European art of that time.

In the entire area of [[Republic of Dubrovnik]] there were numerous [[villa]]s of nobility, due to their functionality and organization as combinations of renaissance villa and government building. ''Sorkočević's villa'' in ''Lapad'' near Dubrovnik in 1521 is original because of building parts in asymmetrical, dynamic balance.

Renaissance sculptures are linked to some architecture, and the most beautiful one is perhaps relief ''Flagellation of Christ'' by Juraj Dalmatinac on the altar of St Staš in [[Split (city)|Split]] cathedral. Three almost naked figures are caught in vibrant movement.

The most important renaissance painters from Dubrovnik are: [[Lovro Dobričević]], [[Mihajlo Hamzić]] and [[Nikola Božidarević]]. They painted the altar screens with first hints of [[portraits]] in characters, [[linear perspective]] and even [[still life]] motifs.

In [[Northwestern Croatia]], the beginning of the wars with the [[Ottoman Empire]] caused many problems but in the long term, it both reinforced the northern of the ruling [[Habsburgs]]. There was the modest influence of the Renaissance in styles of [[fortification]]. The plan for the fortified city of [[Karlovac]] in 1579 was the first radially built city in the Balkan Peninsula using the so-called "ideal city" plan like is found afterward in Renaissance and Baroque Europe (See [[Baroque]]).  The Muslim Turk Ottomans were a constant threat from the South and East and hindered the over-all development of Serbo-Croatian expression in the region.

The renaissance fort of the Ratkay family in [[Veliki Tabor]] from the 16th century has mixed features of Gothic architecture (high roofs) and renaissance (cluster and round towers) making it an example of [[Mannerism]]. Some of the famous renaissance artists that lived and worked in other countries, like brothers Laurana (In Croatian - Vranjanin, [[Francesco Laurana|Franjo]] and [[Luciano Laurana|Luka]]), miniaturist [[Giulio Clovio|Juraj Klović]] and famous mannerist painter [[Andrija Medulić]] (teacher of [[El Greco]]).

== Baroque and Rococo ==
In the 17th and 18th century Croatia was reunited with the parts of the country that were occupied by [[Venetian Republic]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]. The unity attributed to the sudden flourishing of art in every segment.
In northern Croatia and Slavonia sprung out numerous and worthy works of Baroque art – from urban plans and large forts to churches, palaces, public buildings and monuments, all were done in Baroque style.

Large fortifications with a radial plan, [[ditches]] and numerous towers were built because of constant Ottoman threat. The two largest ones were [[Osijek]] and [[Slavonski Brod]]. Later they become large cities. They were fortified with water and earth – earth mounds with cannons and canals filled with water that was supposed to slow down the approaching enemies.
''The fort of Slavonski Brod'' was the largest in all Croatia, and one of the largest ones in entire Europe because it was bounding fort of Europe toward Ottoman Empire.

Urban planning of Baroque is felt in numerous new towns like [[Karlovac]], [[Bjelovar]], [[Koprivnica]], [[Virovitica]] etc. that had large straight streets, rectangular [[Town square|squares]] in the middle surrounded with buildings as government and military ones as well as representative church.
[[File:PaintStLadZagCath.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Painting from the altar of [[Zagreb Cathedral]], dated c. 1690, usually attributed to [[Bernardo Bobić]]]]
Cities of Dalmatia also got baroque towers and [[bastions]] incorporated in their old walls, like the ones in [[Pula]], [[Šibenik]] or [[Hvar]]. But biggest Baroque undertaking happened in [[Dubrovnik]] in the 17th century after the catastrophic earthquake in 1667 when the almost entire city was destroyed. In Baroque style were rebuilt ''the church of St Vlaho'' on the main square (1715), ''Main Cathedral'' and ''Jesuit college'' with ''church of [[Ignatius of Loyola|St Ignatius]]''. [[Paolo Passalaqua]] united several of those baroque masterpieces with his ''Jesuit Stairway''. That beautiful wide stone stairway with series of convexities and concavities and strong [[balustrade]] (reminiscent of famous ''Spain Stairway Square'' in Rome) actually connected two separate baroque parts of the city - the Jesuit church above and ''[[Ivan Gundulić]] Square'' below.

During the Baroque numerous churches, enchanting us with their size and form were built in all Croatia, thus becoming a crown in every town or a city.
The monastery churches often had an enclosing wall with inner [[porch]]es lavishly decorated, like in ''Franciscan monastery'' in [[Slavonski Brod]] where the columns are as thick as baroque abundance.
The most beautiful one is probably the ''church in Selima'' near [[Sisak]]. It has an oval shape with elliptic dome and concave and convex front with two according to towers. But most luxuriant is the church of ''Maria of the Snow'' in ''Belec'' from 1740 with the entire interior filled with lively [[gilded]] wooden sculptures, frescoes of painter [[Ivan Ranger]] from Austria. Ranger was classic [[Rococo]] painter whose characters were softly painted in graceful positions and optimism of cheerful colors. He also lavishly painted the gothic church in [[Lepoglava]], and ceiling of [[Banqueting Hall]] of ''Bistra Palace'' (one of most beautiful elliptic plans in profane architecture).

Wall painting experienced flourishing in all parts of Croatia, from illusionist frescoes in ''church of Holy Mary'' in [[Samobor]], [[Catherine of Alexandria|St Catherine]] in [[Zagreb]] to Jesuit church in Dubrovnik. Best preserved ones are Rococo frescoes in ''Miljana mansion'' where allegorical seasons and natural elements were depicted through human nature and his reflection on art.

Baroque towers and [[bastions]] were incorporated into the old walls of Dalmatian cities, like the ones in [[Pula]], [[Šibenik]] or [[Hvar]].  The biggest Baroque undertaking in Dalmatia happened in [[Dubrovnik]] in the 17th Century after the catastrophic earthquake of 1667 when almost the entire city was destroyed. In Baroque style were rebuilt ''Church of St Vlaho'' on the main square in 1715, the Catholic ''Main Cathedral'', as well as the ''Jesuit college'' and its accompanying ''church of [[Ignatius of Loyola|St Ignatius]]''. [[Paolo Passalaqua]] united several of those baroque masterpieces with his ''Jesuit Stairway''. The wide stone stairway was built a with series of convexities, concavities and a strong [[balustrade]] (reminiscent of famous ''Spain Stairway Square'' in Rome) thereby connecting two parts of the City, using Baroque style, which were the Jesuit church above and the ''[[Ivan Gundulić]] Square'' below.  During the Baroque numerous Catholic churches crowned most towns in cities due to their large size and opulence.  The Roman Catholic monastery churches often had an enclosing wall with inner [[porch]]es lavishly decorated, like in the ''Franciscan monastery'' in [[Slavonski Brod]] where the columns are thick showing baroque abundance.  The most beautiful one is probably the Roman Catholic ''church in Selima'' near [[Sisak]]. It has an oval shape with an elliptic dome and concave and convex front with two towers. In a very luxuriant Roman Catholic church, ''Maria of the Snow'' in ''Belec'' from 1740 the entire interior is filled with lively [[gilded]] wooden sculptures, frescoes by painter [[Ivan Ranger]] from the Roman Catholic Habsburg Austro-Hungarian Empire. Ranger was a classic [[Rococo]] painter whose characters were softly painted in graceful positions with optimism and cheerful colors. He also lavishly painted the Roman Catholic Gothic church in [[Lepoglava]], and the ceiling of the [[Banqueting Hall]] of ''Bistra Palace'' which is one of most beautiful elliptic plans in profane architecture.

An exchange of artists between Croatia and other parts of Europe happened. The most famous Croatian painter was [[Federiko Benković]] who worked almost his entire life in Italy, while an Italian – [[Francesco Robba]], did the best Baroque sculptures in Croatia. His most beautiful and moving work is ''marble altar of Crucifixion'' in ''Church of Holy Cross'' in [[Križevci, Croatia|Križevci]]. Beside masterly carved body of Christ, there is a theme of [[Abraham]]'s Sacrifice; it is a diagonal composition in anxious tension with several movements of limbs and drapes. Located beside the master marble work of the body of Christ there is a theme of [[Abraham]]'s Sacrifice of Isaac.  The Sacrifice of Isaac is portrayed in a diagonal composition with anxious tension articulated by several movements of limbs and drapes.

== The 19th century ==
[[File:Bukovac Toast.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''The Toast'' by [[Vlaho Bukovac]]]]
In Austrian countries on the beginning of the 19th century (to which Croatia belonged than) building in Classicistic Manner prevailed. In Croatia most prominent architect was ''Bartol Felbinger'' who also built ''City Hall'' in [[Samobor]] (1826) and ''Januševac Castle'' near [[Zagreb]].

[[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement in Croatia was sentimental, gentle and subtle – the real image of bourgeoisie's humble and modest virtues. In architecture, there were simple decorations made of the shallow arch like niches around windows, while the furniture was of mildly bent [[Biedermeier]] furniture, and even in dressing the cheaper materials with cheerful colors prevailed. So, it is no surprise that instead of representative portraits in Croatia [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]] portraits are preferred.

At the end of the 19th century, architect [[Hermann Bolle]] undertook one of the largest projects of European historicism – a half-kilometer-long neo-renaissance arcade with twenty domes on Zagreb cemetery [[Mirogoj]].
[[File:Mrs Kresic Vjekoslav Karas.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Portrait of Mrs. Krešić by [[Vjekoslav Karas]] from 1856]]
At the same time, the cities in Croatia got an important urban makeover. But for size and importance, the urban regulation of ''Downtown Zagreb'' (largely the work of ''Milan Lenuzzio'', 1860–1880) was revolutionary. Between Zagreb's longest street – [[Ilica (street)|Ilica]], and new railway the new geometrical city was built with large public and social buildings like neo-renaissance building of [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] ([[HAZU]] - learned society promoting language, culture, and science from its first conception in 1836; the juxtaposition of the words typically seen in English as "Arts and Sciences" is deliberate, F. Scmidt, 1884), neo-baroque [[Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb|Croatian National Theatre]] (HNK, H. Helmer and F. Fellner, 1895), and to that date very modern [[Art Pavilion in Zagreb|Art Pavilion]] (1898) with montage construction of steel and glass – Croatian "[[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]]", and finally the masterpiece of [[Art Nouveau]] – ''The National Library'' (Lubinski, finished in 1912). This urban plan is bounded by series of parks and [[parkway]]s decorated with numerous fountains, sculptures, avenues and gardens (known as "[[Green Horseshoe]]") making Zagreb one of the first cities built according to new European art theory of "city as a work of art".
[[File:Oton Ivekovic, Dolazak Hrvata na Jadran.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Oton Iveković]], ''The Croats arrival at the Adriatic Sea'']]
The pseudo building that emphasizes all three visual arts is the former building of ''Ministry of Prayer and Education'' in Zagreb (H. Bolle, 1895). Along with rooms in Pompeii style and renaissance cabinet, the large neo-baroque ''"Golden Hall"'' was painted with historic compositions by [[Bela Čikoš-Sesija]] (The ''Baptism of Croats and Split Council''), [[Oton Iveković]] (''Meeting of Koloman and Croatian Nobility''), [[Mato Celestin Medović]] (''The Arrival of Croats''), [[Vlaho Bukovac]] (''[[Frantz Joseph]] in Zagreb'') and decorated with reliefs by [[Robert Frangeš-Mihanović]]. "The Golden Hall" becomes a unified monument of its age, one of few in Europe.

[[Realism (arts)|Realism]] appeared in bourgeois portraits by [[Vjekoslav Karas]]. The characters of his portraits are true expressions of their time.
Realistic landscapes are linked to certain parts of the country – Slavonian forests by artists of [[Osijek]] school, Dubrovnik in works of [[Celestin Medović]], and Dalmatian coast in works of [[Menci Klement Crnčić]].

In sculpture the hard realism ([[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]) of [[Ivan Rendić]] was replaced by [[art nouveau]] composed and moving reliefs by [[Robert Frangeš-Mihanović]]. [[Slava Raškaj]] is particularly notable for her watercolorworks.

[[Vlaho Bukovac]] brought the spirit of [[impressionism]] from Paris, and he strongly influenced the young artists (including the authors of "Golden Hall"). Right after he painted the screen in HNK in Zagreb with the theme of ''Croatian Illyrian Movement'', and symbolic portraits of Croatian Writers in National Library, he founded ''The Society of Croatian Artists'' (1897), the so-called "Zagreb's colorful school". With this society the [[Croatian art of the 20th century|Croatian Modern Art]] started. On the ''Millennium Exhibition'' in [[Budapest]] they were able to set aside all other artistic options in [[Austria-Hungary]].

'''Femina Potens''' ([[Latin]]: ''Powerful Woman'') is a non-profit [[art gallery]] and [[performance art]] space located in [[San Francisco, California]], founded in 2001 by artistic director [[Madison Young]], which seeks to bring greater visibility and advancement to female artists, including [[transgender]] ones.

==History==
Femina Potens was originally a theater company dedicated to producing original works by local female playwrights, actors, and directors. It was formed in [[Cincinnati]] by Madison Young, who later moved to [[San Francisco]] in 2001 to perform with Woman's Will, the Bay Area's all-woman Shakespeare company. After founding, Femina Potens featured such artists as [[Angela Regas]], [[Mari Schaal]], [[Michelle Tea]], [[Aphrodites Hymen]], Dumbwaiter, [[The Reputation]], [[Blevin Blechdom]], along with open mic [[poetry]] events and anarchist crochet circles.

In 2003 Femina Potens then moved to its {{convert|800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} space in the San Francisco Mission district where the gallery started to flourish. In May 2003 Femina Potens found a fiscal sponsor (SF Media Archive) and in November 2004 changed its fiscal sponsorship to Queer Cultural Center and through them received non-profit status. In the past 4 years Femina Potens has produced nearly 300 art and cultural events for the [[LGBTQ]], women, trans, [[queer]] and kink communities in San Francisco. Producing monthly spoken word open mic events, queer film screenings, music and dance events, and month visual art openings. Femina Potens has been recognized for its work in the community by Bitch Magazine, Curve Magazine, MTV's LOGO, Herbivore Magazine, Japan's FOIL Magazine, HERE TV, QTV, San Francisco Guardian, SF Weekly, SF Chronicle, London's [[Skin Two]] Magazine and more.

In 2007 Femina Potens moved into a {{convert|1300|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} store front space in the [[Castro District]] that had been inhabited for 25 years by Image Leather - a landmark in the Castro neighborhood and the [[leather subculture]]. Located at 2199 Market St. San Francisco CA 94114 one block from the Church MUNI Station.  Tenure there was short, and they now reside at 3435 Cesar Chavez St. in San Francisco.

==Notable artists and events==
Femina Potens has worked to bring the best women and transgender artists to the community, coupling world-renowned visual and performing artists with talented new emerging artists. These multi-generational performances and exhibitions encourage to artists to thrive while well-established artists and heroines stand on the same stage or placed on the same wall acting as mentors for fledgling artists.

Femina Potens has had the honor of presenting such artists as [[Judith Halberstam]], [[Annie Sprinkle]], [[Michelle Tea]], [[Carol Queen]], [[Diane Diprima]], [[Charlie Anders]], [[Thea Hillman]], [[Lynne Breedlove]], [[Nina Hartley]], and collaborating with organizations such as Ladyfest Bayarea, Fresh Meat Productions, United Genders of the Universe, BAVAC, Sex Workers Film and Art Festival, The Center for Sex and Culture.

Femina Potens Exhibition Series is sponsored by the Zellerbach Foundation and our Best of the Bay winning spoken word and open mic series is sponsored by the San Francisco Arts Commission and APOCHE. Femina Potens non profit fiscal sponsor is the Queer Cultural Center.

{{about|a literary form|the real estate concept|Fixer-upper|"fixup" in the context of executable formats on computers|Relocation (computer science)}}

A '''fix-up''' (or '''fixup''') is a [[novel]] created from several [[short fiction]] stories that may or may not have been initially related or previously published. The stories may be edited for consistency, and sometimes new connecting material, such as a [[frame story]] or other interstitial narration, is written for the new work. The term was coined by the [[science fiction]] writer [[A. E. van Vogt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Robert|title=A. E. van Vogt: The Weinberg Interview (1980)|url=http://www.icshi.net/sevagram/interviews/weinberg.php|website=Icshi.net|publisher=Isaac Walwyn|accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; who published several fix-ups of his own, including ''[[The Voyage of the Space Beagle]]'',&lt;ref name="liptak20130805"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Liptak |first=Andrew |date=2013-08-05 |title=A.E. van Vogt and the Fix-Up Novel |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/e-van-vogt-and-fix-novel/ |magazine=Kirkus Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the practice (if not the term) exists outside of science fiction. The use of the term in science fiction criticism was popularised by the first (1979) edition of the ''[[Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', edited by [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]], which credited Van Vogt with the creation of the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Nicholls | first = Peter |author2=John Clute| title = New Encyclopedia of Science Fiction | publisher = Orbit | location = London | year = 1999 | isbn = 1-85723-897-4 | page = 432}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/fixup|title=Fixup page at Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (Third Edition)|website=Encyclopedia of Science Fiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The name comes from the modifications that the author needs to make in the original texts to make them fit together as though they were a novel. Foreshadowing of events from the later stories may be jammed into an early chapter of the fix-up, and character development may be interleaved throughout the book. Contradictions and inconsistencies between episodes are usually worked out.

Some fix-ups in their final form are more of a [[short story cycle]] or composite novel rather than a traditional novel with a single main plotline. Examples are [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[The Martian Chronicles]]'' and [[Isaac Asimov]]'s ''[[I, Robot]]'', both of which read as a series of short stories which may share plot threads and characters but which still act as self-contained stories.&lt;ref name="luscher"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5WyidbsLaxQC&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;ots=mnc_goAXNW&amp;pg=PA370#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=A Companion to the American Novel |last=Luscher |first=Robert M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2012 |isbn=9781405101196 |editor-last=Bendixen |editor-first=Alfred |editor-link=Alfred Bendixen |series=Blackwell Companions to Literature and Culture |volume=80 |page=370 |chapter=The American Short-Story Cycle}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, van Vogt's ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' is structured like a continuous novel although it incorporates material from three previous Van Vogt short stories.

Fix-ups became an accepted practice in the 1950s, when science fiction and [[fantasy]]—once published only in magazines—began appearing in book form. Large book publishers like [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] entered the market, greatly increasing demand for fiction. Authors created new manuscripts from old stories to sell to publishers. [[Algis Budrys]] in 1965 described fixups as a consequence of the lack of good supply during the "bad years for quality" of the mid-1950s, although citing ''The Martian Chronicles'' and [[Clifford D. Simak]]'s ''[[City (novel)|City]]'' as among exceptions.&lt;ref name="budrys196510"&gt;{{Cite magazine

[[File:Cône d'Avanton, musée des Antiquités Nationales.jpg|thumb|150px|Avanton gold cone]]

'''Golden hats''' (or '''Gold hats''') ({{lang-de|Goldhüte}}, singular: {{lang|de|Goldhut}}) are a very specific and rare type of [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]] from [[Bronze Age Europe|Bronze Age]] [[Europe]]. So far, four such objects ("cone-shaped gold hats of the Schifferstadt type") are known. The objects are made of thin sheet gold and were attached externally to long conical and brimmed headdresses which were probably made of some organic material and served to stabilise the external gold leaf. The following Golden Hats are known {{As of|2012|5|27|alt=as of 2012}}:

* [[Golden Hat of Schifferstadt]], found in 1835 at [[Schifferstadt]] near [[Speyer]], c. 1400–1300 BC.
* [[Avanton Gold Cone]], incomplete, found at [[Avanton]] near [[Poitiers]] in 1844, c. 1000–900 BC.
* [[Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]], found near [[Burgthann|Ezelsdorf]] near [[Nuremberg]] in 1953, c. 1000–900 BC; the tallest known specimen at c. 90&amp;nbsp;cm.
* [[Berlin Gold Hat]], found probably in [[Swabia]] or [[Switzerland]], c. 1000–800 BC; acquired by the [[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]], [[Berlin]], in 1996.

== Cultural context ==
The hats are associated with the [[Proto-Celtic]]&lt;ref name=ChadCorc&gt;{{cite book|first1=Nora|last1=Chadwick|first2= J. X. W. P. |last2=Corcoran|title=The Celts|date=1970|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|pages=28–33|isbn=0140212116|oclc=631775651}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bronze Age]] [[Urnfield culture]]. Their close similarities in symbolism and techniques of manufacture are testimony to a coherent Bronze Age culture over a wide-ranging territory in eastern France and western and southwestern Germany. A comparable [[Mold cape|golden pectoral]] was found at [[Mold, Flintshire]], in northern Wales, but this appears to be of somewhat earlier date.

The cone-shaped Golden Hats of Schifferstadt type are assumed to be connected with a number of comparable cap or crown-shaped gold leaf objects from [[Ireland]] ([[Comerford Crown]], discovered in 1692) and the Atlantic coast of [[Spain]] (gold leaf crowns of [[Axtroki]] and [[Rianxo]]). Only the Spanish specimens survive.

== Archaeological context ==
The archaeological contexts of the cones are not very clear (for the Berlin specimen, it is entirely unknown). At least two of the known examples (Berlin and Schifferstadt) appear to have been deliberately and carefully buried in antiquity.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Chronology ==
Although none can be dated precisely, their technology suggests that they were probably made between 1200 and 800 BC.

== Function ==
It is assumed{{by whom|date=November 2017}} that the Golden Hats served as religious insignia for the [[deities]] or [[priests]] of a sun cult then widespread in [[Central Europe]]. Their use as head-gear is strongly supported by the fact that the three of four examples have a cap-like widening at the bottom of the cone, and that their openings are oval (not round), with diameters and shapes roughly equivalent to those of a human skull. The figural depiction of an object resembling a [[Pointed hat|conical hat]] on a stone slab of [[the King's Grave]] at [[Kivik]], Southern [[Sweden]], strongly supports their association with religion and cult, as does the fact that the known examples appear to have been deposited (buried) carefully.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

Attempts to decipher the Golden Hats' ornamentation suggest that their cultic role is accompanied or complemented by their use as complex calendrical devices. Whether they were really used for such purposes, or simply presented the underlying astronomical knowledge, remains unknown.

[[File:Gold-Hut klein-cm.png|thumb|left|[[Golden Cone of Ezelsdorf-Buch]]]]
The gold cones are covered in bands of ornaments along their whole length and extent. The ornaments - mostly disks and concentric circles, sometimes wheels - were punched using stamps, rolls or combs. The older examples (Avanton, Schifferstadt) show a more restricted range of ornaments than the later ones.

[[File:Berliner Goldhut-Kalenderfunktion1.JPG|thumb|Calendrical functions of the [[Berlin Gold Hat]]]]
It appears to be the case that the ornaments on all known Golden Hats represent systematic sequences in terms of number and types of ornaments per band.

A detailed study&lt;ref&gt;Menghin 2000, see bibliography&lt;/ref&gt; of the Berlin example, which is fully preserved, claimed that the symbols possibly represent a [[lunisolar]] calendar. The object may have permitted the determination of dates or periods in both [[lunar calendar|lunar]] and [[solar calendar]]s.

Since an exact knowledge of the solar year was of special interest for the determination of religiously important events such as the [[summer solstice|summer]] and [[winter solstice]]s, if astronomical knowledge was depicted on the Golden Hats it would have been of high value to [[Bronze Age]] society. Whether the hats themselves were indeed used for determining such dates, or whether they even represented such knowledge, remains unknown.

The functions hypothesized so far would permit the counting of temporal units of up to 57 months. A simple multiplication of such values could also permit the calculation of longer periods, e.g. [[metonic cycle]]s.

Each symbol, or each ring of a symbol, may represent a single day. Apart from ornament bands incorporating differing numbers of rings there are seemingly special symbols and zones in [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary]] areas, which may have had to be added to or subtracted from the periods in question.

The system of this mathematical function incorporated into the artistic ornamentation has not been fully deciphered so far, but a schematic study of the Berlin Golden Hat and the periods it may delimit has been attempted.

In principle, according to this theory, starting with zone Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, a sum is achieved by adding a relevant contiguous number of neighbouring sections: Z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; .. Z&lt;sub&gt;i+n&lt;/sub&gt;. To reach the equivalent lunar or solar value, from this initial sum must be subtracted the sum of symbols from the intercalary zone(s) within the area counted.

The illustration&lt;ref&gt;Source: Menghin, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; depicts the solar representation on the left and the lunar one on the right. The red or blue fields in zones 5, 7, 16 and 17 are intercalary zones.

The values in the individual fields are reached by multiplying the number of symbols per zone with the number of rings or circles incorporated in each predominant symbol. The special symbols in zone 5 are assigned the value of "38", as indicated by their number.

:''Example''
:''Zone 12 is dominated by 20 repetitions of punched symbol No. 14, a circular disc symbol surrounded by 5 concentric circles.
:''Thus, the symbol has the value of 20 x 5 = 100.
:''The smaller ring symbols placed between the larger repetitions of No. 14 are considered as mere ornaments and thus not counted.

Through this system, the Hats could be used to calculate a lunisolar calendrical system, i.e. a direct reading in either lunar or solar dates, as well as the conversion between them.

The table can be used in the same way as the original Golden Hats may have been. To determine the number of days in a specific time period (yellow fields), the values of the coloured fields above are added, reaching an intermediate sum. If any of the red intercalary zones are included, their sum has to be subtracted. This allows the calculation of 12, 24, 36, 48, 54 and 57 [[synodic month]]s in the lunar system and of 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 54 and 57 sun months (i.e. twelfths of a tropical year).

:''Example
:''To determine a 54 month cycle in the lunar system, the numerical values of the green or blue zones 3 to 21 are added, reaching a sum of 1,739 days. From this, the values of the red intercalary fields 5, 16 and 17 are subtracted, The result is 1739-142=1597 days, or 54 synodic months of 29.5305 days each.''

The overall discrepancy of 2 days to the astronomically accurate value is probably the result of a slight imprecision in the Bronze Age observation of synodic and solar month.

== Manufacture ==
The Golden hats known so far are made from a gold [[alloy]] containing 85-90% [[Gold|Au]], about 10% [[Silver|Ag]] and traces of [[copper|Cu]] and [[tin|Sn]] (&lt; 1% each). They are made of seamless single pieces of gold sheet, hammered to a thinness between {{convert|0.25|mm|in}} (Schifferstadt) and {{convert|0.6|mm|in}} (Berlin). Thus, the cones are surprisingly light considering their size. The Ezelsdorf example, measuring {{convert|89|cm|in}} in height, weighs only {{convert|280|g|oz}}.

Because of the [[tribology|tribological]] characteristics of the material, it tends to harden with increasing deformation (see [[ductility]]), increasing its potential to crack. To avoid cracking, an extremely even deformation was necessary. Additionally, the material had to be softened by repeatedly heating it to a temperature of at least {{convert|750|C|F}}.

Since gold alloy has a relatively low [[melting point]] of about {{convert|960|C|F}}, a very careful [[temperature control]] and an [[isothermal process|isothermal heating process]] were required, so as to avoid melting any of the surface. For this, the Bronze Age artisans used a charcoal fire or oven similar to those used for [[pottery]]. The temperature could only be controlled through the addition of [[oxygen]], using a [[bellows]].

Considering the tribologic conditions and the technical means available at the time, the production even of an undecorated Golden hat would represent an immense technical achievement.

In the course of their further manufacture, the Golden hats were embellished with rows of radial ornamental bands, [[Chasing|chased]] into the metal. To make this possible, they were probably filled with a [[putty]] or [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] based on [[resin|tree resin]] and [[wax]] - in the Schifferstadt specimen, traces of this have survived. The thin gold leaf was structured by chasing: stamp-like tools or moulds depicting the individual symbols were repeatedly pressed into (or rolled along) the exterior of the gold. Combs were also used.

== Exhibitions ==
The gold hats were first brought together for comparison and set in the broader context of the culture of Bronze Age Europe in a 1999 exhibition in [[Bonn]], ''Gods and heroes of the Bronze Age: Europe in the time of Odysseus''. Normally they reside in separate museums, at Berlin ([[Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Berlin)|Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte]]), Speyer (Historisches Museum der Pfalz, the Schifferstadt specimen), Nuremberg ([[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]], the Ezelsdorf one), and [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] ([[Musée d'Archéologie Nationale]]).

The '''Gundestrup cauldron''' is a richly decorated [[silversmithery|silver vessel]], thought to date from between 200 BC and 300 AD,&lt;ref name="Nielsen"&gt;Nielsen, S; Andersen, J; Baker, J; Christensen, C; Glastrup, J; et al. (2005). “The Gundestrup cauldron: New scientific and technical investigations”, ''Acta Archaeologica, 76'': 1-58. {{ISSN|0065-101X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"&gt;Jouttijärvi, Arne (2009), “The Gundestrup Cauldron: Metallurgy and Manufacturing Techniques”, ''Materials and Manufacturing Processes, 24'': 960-966. {{ISSN|1042-6914}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more narrowly between 150 BC and 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;NMD, "The dating and origin of the silver cauldron"; Koch&lt;/ref&gt; This places it within the late [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] period or early [[Roman Iron Age]].  The [[cauldron]] is the largest known example of [[European Iron Age]] silver work (diameter: {{convert|69|cm|in|abbr=on}};  height: {{convert|42|cm|in|abbr=on}}). It was found dismantled, with the other pieces stacked inside the base, in 1891 in a [[peat bog]] near the hamlet of Gundestrup in the [[Aars]] parish of [[Himmerland]], [[Denmark]] ({{coord|56|49|N|9|33|E|}}).&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"&gt;Bergquist, A K &amp; Taylor, T F (1987), “The origin of the Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Antiquity 61'': 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;Taylor, Timothy (1992), “The Gundestrup cauldron”, ''Scientific American, 266'': 84-89. {{ISSN|0036-8733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"&gt;Olmsted, Garrett S (1979), “The Gundestrup cauldron : its archaeological context, the style and iconography of its portrayed motifs and their narration of a Gaulish version of Táin Bó Cúailnge”, ''Collection Latomus 162'' [Latomus: Bruxelle 1979]. {{ISBN|2-87031-102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now usually on display in the [[National Museum of Denmark]] in [[Copenhagen]], with replicas at other museums; during 2015-16 it was in the UK on a travelling exhibition called ''The Celts''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts/ Exhibition page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112064611/http://www.nms.ac.uk/national-museum-of-scotland/whats-on/celts |date=2016-01-12 }}, [[National Museum of Scotland]], 10 Mar - 25 Sep 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cauldron is not complete, and now consists of a rounded cup-shaped bottom making up the lower part of the cauldron, usually called the base plate, above which are five interior plates and seven exterior ones; a missing eighth exterior plate would be needed to encircle the cauldron, and only two sections of a rounded rim at the top of the cauldron survive.  The base plate is mostly smooth and undecorated inside and out, apart from a decorated round medallion in the centre of the interior. All the other plates are heavily decorated with [[repoussé]] work, hammered from beneath to push out the silver.  Other techniques were used to add detail, and there is extensive [[gilding]] and some use of [[inlay|inlaid]] pieces of glass for the eyes of figures.  Other pieces of fittings were found.  Altogether the weight is just under 9 kilograms.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; NMD&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite the fact that the vessel was found in Denmark, it was probably not made there or nearby; it includes elements of [[Gaul]]ish and [[Thrace|Thracian]] origin in  the workmanship, [[metallurgy]], and imagery. The techniques and elements of the style of the panels relate closely to other Thracian silver, while much of the depiction, in particular of the human figures, relates to the [[Celts]], though attempts to relate the scenes closely to [[Celtic mythology]] remain controversial.  Other aspects of the [[iconography]] derive from the [[Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD; Green, 45, Sandars, 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Hospitality on a large scale was probably an obligation for Celtic elites, and although cauldrons were therefore an important item of prestige metalwork, they are usually much plainer and smaller than this.  This is an exceptionally large and elaborate object with no close parallel, except a large fragment from a bronze cauldron also found in Denmark, at [[Rynkeby]];&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 252; Megaws, 174-175; Laings, 85, and 68-69 on the even larger, but very fragmentary, Brå cauldron&lt;/ref&gt; however the exceptional [[wetland deposits in Scandinavia]] have produced a number of objects of types that were probably once common but where other examples have not survived.  It has been much discussed by scholars, and represents a fascinatingly complex demonstration of the many cross-currents in European art, as well as an unusual degree of narrative for [[Celtic art]],&lt;ref&gt;Green, 84&lt;/ref&gt; though we are unlikely ever to fully understand its original meanings.

==Discovery==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup6.jpg|thumb|The central medallion of the base plate, from a replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron was discovered by peat cutters in a small peat bog called Rævemose (near the larger [[Borremose]] bog) on 28 May 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;lpg=PA396&amp;dq=Iconography+of+cernunnos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=p1RDghDrVJ&amp;sig=fwnvbv0_tjE5JR3O_T585-CZ5E8&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Gundestrup%20cauldron&amp;f=false|title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia. Vol. 1-|last=Koch|first=John T.|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781851094400|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish government paid a large reward to the finders, who subsequently quarreled bitterly amongst themselves over its division.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Palaeobotanical investigations of the peat bog at the time of the discovery showed that the land had been dry when the cauldron was deposited, and the peat gradually grew over it. The manner of stacking suggested an attempt to make the cauldron inconspicuous and well-hidden.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt; Another investigation of Rævemose was undertaken in 2002, concluding that the peat bog may have existed when the cauldron was buried.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

The cauldron was found in a dismantled state with five long rectangular plates, seven short plates, one round plate (normally termed the "base plate"), and two fragments of tubing stacked inside the curved base.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In addition, there is a piece of iron from a ring originally placed inside the silver tubes along the rim of the cauldron.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; It is assumed that there is a missing eighth plate because the circumference of the seven outer plates is smaller than the circumference of the five inner plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

A set of careful full-size replicas have been made. One is in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/en/exhibition/kingship-and-sacrifice.aspx National Museum of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; and several are in France, including the [[Musée gallo-romain de Fourvière]] at Lyon and the [[National Archaeological Museum (France)|Musée d'archéologie nationale]] at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]].

==Reconstruction==
Since the cauldron was found in pieces, it had to be reconstructed. The traditional order of the plates was determined by [[Sophus Müller]], the first of many to analyze the cauldron. His logic uses the positions of the trace [[solder]] located at the rim of the bowl. In two cases, a puncture mark penetrating the inner and outer plates also helps to establish the order.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; In its final form, the plates are arranged in an alternation of female-male depictions, assuming the missing eighth plate is of a female.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt; Not all analysts agree with Müller's ordering, however. Taylor has pointed out that aside from the two cases of puncturing, the order cannot be determined from the solder alignments. His argument is that the plates are not directly adjacent to each other, but are separated by a 2&amp;nbsp;cm gap; thus, the plates in this order cannot be read with certainty as the true narrative, supposing one exists.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

==Metallurgy==
[[File:Gundestrupkarret2.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''A''' with the famous horned figure]]
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup5.jpg|thumb|Inside panel '''D''' with bull-slaying, replica]]
The Gundestrup cauldron is composed almost entirely of silver, but there is also a substantial amount of gold for the gilding, tin for the solder and glass for the figures' eyes. According to experimental evidence, the materials for the vessel were not added at the same time, so the cauldron can be considered as the work of artisans over a span of several hundred years. The quality of the repairs to the cauldron, of which there are many, is inferior to the original craftsmanship.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Silver was not a common material in Celtic art, and certainly not on this scale. Except sometimes for small pieces of jewellery, gold or bronze were more usual for prestige metalwork.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 45&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that the Gundestrup cauldron was created, silver was obtained through [[cupellation]] of lead/silver ores.&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; By comparing the concentration of [[isotope geochemistry|lead isotopes]] with the silverwork of other cultures, it has been suggested that the silver came from multiple ore deposits, mostly from [[Celt]]ic northern [[France]] and western [[Germany]] in the pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period. The lead isotope studies also indicate that the silver for manufacturing the plates was prepared by repeatedly melting ingots and/or scrap silver. Three to six distinct batches of recycled silver may have been used in making the vessel.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt; Specifically, the circular "base plate" may have originated as a [[phalera (harness)|phalera]], and it is commonly thought to have been positioned in the bottom of the bowl as a late addition, soldered in to repair a hole.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; By an alternative theory, this phalera was not initially part of the bowl, but instead formed part of the decorations of a wooden cover.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

The gold can be sorted into two groups based on purity and separated by the concentration of silver and copper. The less pure [[gilding]], which is thicker, can be considered a later repair, as the thinner, purer inlay adheres better to the silver. The adherence of the overall gold is quite poor. The lack of mercury from the gold analysis suggests that a fire-gilding technique was not used on the Gundestrup cauldron. The gilding appears to have instead been made by mechanical means, which  explains the function of closely spaced punch marks on the gilded areas.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

An examination of lead isotopes similar to the one used on the silver was employed for the tin. All of the samples of tin soldering are consistent in lead-isotope composition with ingots from [[Cornwall]] in western [[Great Britain|Britain]]. The tin used for soldering the plates and bowl together, as well as the glass eyes, is very uniform in its high purity.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

Finally, the glass inlays of the Gundestrup cauldron have been determined through the use of [[X-ray fluorescence|X-ray fluorescence radiation]] to be of a soda-lime type composition. The glass contained elements that can be attributed to calcareous sand and mineral soda, typical of the east coast of the Mediterranean region. The analyses also narrowed down the production time of the glass to between the second century BC and first century AD.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Flow of raw material==
[[File:Detail of Gundestrup Cauldron.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior plate '''d''']]
The workflow of the manufacturing process consisted of a few steps that required a great amount of skill. Batches of silver were melted in crucibles with the addition of copper for a subtler alloy. The melted silver was cast into flat ingots and hammered into intermediate plates.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt; For the relief work, the sheet-silver was annealed to allow shapes to be beaten into high [[repoussé]]; these rough shapes were then filled with pitch from the back to make them firm enough for further detailing with punches and tracers. The pitch was melted out, areas of pattern were gilded, and the eyes of the larger figures were inlaid with glass. The plates were probably worked in a flat form and later bent into curves to solder them together.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;

It is generally agreed that the Gundestrup cauldron was the work of multiple silversmiths. Using scanning electron microscopy, Benner Larson has identified 15 different punches used on the plates, falling into three distinct tool sets. No individual plate has marks from more than one of these groups, and this fits with previous attempts at stylistic attribution, which identify at least three different silversmiths.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; Multiple artisans would also explain the highly variable purity and thickness of the silver.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jouttijarvi"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:ChaudronDeGundestrup4.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''B''', replica]]
The silverworking techniques used in the cauldron are unknown from the Celtic world, but are consistent with the renowned Thracian sheet-silver tradition. The scenes depicted are not distinctively Thracian, but certain elements of composition, decorative motifs, and illustrated items (such as the shoelaces on the antlered figure) identify it as Thracian work.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Taylor and Bergquist have postulated that the Celtic tribe known as the [[Scordisci]] commissioned the cauldron from native Thracian silversmiths. According to classical historians, the Cimbri, a Teutonic tribe, went south from the lower Elbe region and attacked the Scordisci in 118 BC. After withstanding several defeats at the hands of the Romans, the Cimbri retreated north, possibly taking with them this cauldron to settle in Himmerland, where the vessel was found.&lt;ref name="BergquistTaylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

Nielsen believes that the question of origin is the wrong one to ask and can produce misleading results. Because of the widespread migration of numerous ethnic groups like the Celts and Teutonic peoples and events like Roman expansion and subsequent Romanization, it is highly unlikely that only one ethnic group was responsible for the development of the Gundestrup cauldron. Instead, the make and art of the cauldron can be thought of as the product of a fusion of cultures, each inspiring and expanding upon one another. In the end, Nielsen concludes that, based on accelerator datings from beeswax found on the back of the plates, the vessel was created within the Roman Iron Age at a location somewhere in Central Europe.&lt;ref name="Nielsen"/&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Detail 2 from Gundestrupkarret.jpg|thumb|Exterior plate '''f''', with [[torc]]-wearing head]]
[[File:Gundestrupkedlen- 00054 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Detail from interior plate '''A''']]
[[File:Gundestrup C.jpg|thumb|Interior plate '''C''']]

===Base plate===
The decorated medallion on the circular base plate depicts a bull. Above the back of the bull is a female figure wielding a sword; three dogs are also portrayed, one over the bull's head and another under its hooves.  Presumably all of these figures are in combat; the third dog beneath the bull and near its tail seems to be dead, and is only faintly shown in [[engraving]], and the bull may have been brought down. Below the bull is [[Scroll (art)|scrolling]] ivy that draws from classical Greco-Roman art.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 175-176; NMD, "The bullfight"&lt;/ref&gt;  The horns of the bull are missing, but there is a hole right through the head where they were originally fitted; they were perhaps gold.  The head of the bull rises entirely clear of the plate, and the medallion is considered the most accomplished part of the cauldron in technical and artistic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 256; Laings, 83; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exterior plates===
Each of the seven exterior plates centrally depicts a bust. Plates '''a''', '''b''', '''c''', and '''d''' show bearded male figures, and the remaining three are female.

*On plate '''a''', the bearded man holds in each hand a much smaller figure by the arm. Each of those two reach upward toward a small boar. Under the feet of the figures (on the shoulders of the larger man) are a dog on the left side and a winged horse on the right side.
*The figure on plate '''b''' holds in each hand a sea-horse or dragon.
*On plate '''c''', a male figure raises his empty fists. On his right shoulder is a man in a "boxing" position, and on his left shoulder, there is a leaping figure with a small horseman underneath.
*Plate '''d''' shows a bearded figure holding a stag by the hind quarters in each hand.
*The female figure on plate '''e''' is flanked by two smaller male busts.
*A female figure holds a bird in her upraised right hand on plate '''f'''.  Her left arm is horizontal, supporting a man and a dog lying on its back. Two birds of prey are situated on either side of her head. Her hair is being plaited by a small woman on the right.
*On plate '''g''', the female figure has her arms crossed. On her right shoulder, a scene of a man fighting a lion is shown. On her left shoulder is a leaping figure similar to the one on plate '''c'''.

===Interior plates===
*Plate '''A''' shows an antlered male figure seated in a central position, often identified as [[Cernunnos]]. In his right hand, he holds a [[torc]], and with his left hand he grips a horned serpent a little below the head. To the left is a stag with antlers that are very similar to the human/divine figure. Surrounding the scene are other canine, feline, and bovine animals, some but not all facing the human, as well as a human riding a dolphin. Between the antlers of the god is an unknown motif, possibly a plant or a tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=QSuYDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=replicas+of+the+Gundestrup+cauldron+are+found+in+france+and+ireland&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lEeVG2t0jo&amp;sig=UFd8L8JWX6LejfCJ8QF67NrbA1g&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=replicas%20of%20the%20Gundestrup%20cauldron%20are%20found%20in%20france%20and%20ireland&amp;f=false|title=The Witch's Cauldron: The Craft, Lore &amp; Magick of Ritual Vessels|last=Zakroff|first=Laura Tempest|date=2017-05-08|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|isbn=9780738752525|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On plate '''B''', the large bust of a torc-wearing female is flanked by two six-[[spoke]]d wheels, what seem to be two elephants, and two griffins. A feline or hound is underneath the bust.
*The large bust of a bearded figure holding on to a broken wheel is at the centre of plate '''C'''. A smaller, leaping figure with a [[horned helmet]] is also holding the rim of the wheel. Under the leaping figure is a horned serpent. The group is surrounded by three [[griffin]]s facing left below, and above, two strange animals who look like [[hyena]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Green, 137&lt;/ref&gt; facing right.  The wheel's spokes are rendered asymmetrically, but judging from the lower half, the wheel may have had twelve spokes.
*Plate '''D''' depicts a bull-slaying scene, with the same composition repeated three times across the plate; the only place where such repetition appears on the cauldron.  Three large bulls are arranged in a row, facing right, and each of them is attacked by a man with a sword. A feline and a dog, both running to the left, appear respectively over and below each bull.
*On the lower half of plate '''E''', a line of [[warrior]]s bearing spears and shields march to the left with, bringing up the rear a warrior with no shield, a sword, and a boar-crested helmet. Behind him are three [[carnyx]] players. In front of this group a dog leaps up, perhaps holding them back.  Behind the dog, at the left side of the scene, a figure over twice the size of the others holds a man upside down, apparently with ease, and apparently is about to immerse him in a barrel or cauldron. On the upper half, warriors on horseback with crested helmets and spears ride away to the right, with at the right a horned serpent, fitted in above the tops of the carnyxes, who is perhaps leading them.  The two lines are below and above what appears to be a tree, still in leaf, lying sideways.  This is now most often interpreted as a scene where fallen warriors are dipped into a cauldron to be reborn into their next life, or afterlife.  This can be paralleled in later [[Welsh literature]].&lt;ref&gt;NMD, "The Gundestrup Cauldron - The Cauldron of Fate?"; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, some scholars have interpreted the cauldron's images in terms of the [[Celtic theology|Celtic]] pantheon, and [[Celtic mythology]] as it is presented in much later literature in [[Celtic languages]] from the [[British Isles]].  Others regard the latter interpretations with great suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 176&lt;/ref&gt; Much less controversially, there are clear parallels between details of the figures and Iron Age Celtic artefacts excavated by archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Koch&lt;/ref&gt;  

Other details of the iconography clearly derive from the art of the [[ancient Near East]], and there are intriguing parallels with ancient India and later [[Hindu]] deities and their stories. Scholars are mostly content to regard the former as motifs borrowed purely for their visual appeal, without carrying over anything much of their original meaning, but despite the distance some have attempted to relate the latter to wider traditions remaining from [[Proto-Indo-European religion]].

===Celtic archaeology===
Among the most specific details that are clearly Celtic are the group of [[carnyx]] players.  The carnyx war horn was known from Roman descriptions of the Celts in battle and [[Trajan's Column]], and a few pieces are known from archaeology, their number greatly increased by finds at [[Tintignac]] in France in 2004. [[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote around 60-30 BC (Histories, 5.30):
:''"Their trumpets again are of a peculiar barbarian kind; they blow into them and produce a harsh sound which suits the tumult of war''"

Another detail that is easily matched to archaeology is the [[torc]] worn by several figures, clearly of the "buffer" type, a fairly common Celtic artefact found in Western Europe, most often France, from the period the cauldron is thought to have been made.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-176; Green, 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Other details with more tentative Celtic links are the long swords carried by some figures, and the horned and antlered helmets or head-dresses and the [[boar]] crest worn on their helmet by some warriors.  These can be related to Celtic artefacts such as a helmet with a [[raptor (bird)|raptor]] crest from [[Romania]], the [[Waterloo Helmet]], [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns]] and various animal figures including boars, of uncertain function.  The shield bosses, spurs and horse harness also relate to Celtic examples.&lt;ref&gt;Megaws, 174-177, 160-163; Green, 100-103&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Taranis Jupiter with wheel and thunderbolt Le Chatelet Gourzon Haute Marne.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gallo-Roman]] figure of [[Taranis]]/[[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] with his wheel and thunderbolt, and carrying torcs]]
The antlered figure in plate '''A''' has been commonly identified as [[Cernunnos]], who is named (the only source for the name) on the 1st-century [[Gallo-Roman]] [[Pillar of the Boatmen]], where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs hanging from his antlers.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 78, 135, 137, 147-148, 151&lt;/ref&gt;  Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is.  Otherwise there is evidence of a [[horned god]] from several cultures. 

The figure holding the broken wheel in plate '''C''' is more tentatively thought to be [[Taranis]], the solar or thunder "wheel-god" named by [[Lucian]] and represented in a number of Iron Age images; there are also many wheels that seem to have been [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 147-149&lt;/ref&gt;

===Near East and Asia===
The many animals depicted on the cauldron include [[elephant]]s, a [[dolphin]], [[leopard]]-like felines, and various fantastic animals, as well as animals that are widespread across [[Eurasia]], such as snakes, cattle, deer, boars and birds. [[Celtic art]] often includes animals, but not often in fantastic forms with wings and aspects of different animals combined.&lt;ref&gt;Koch; Megaws, 160-163&lt;/ref&gt;  There are exceptions to this, some when motifs are clearly borrowed, as the boy riding a dolphin is borrowed from Greek art, and others that are more native, like the ram-headed horned snake who appears three times on the cauldron.&lt;ref&gt;Green, 135-139&lt;/ref&gt;  The art of [[Thrace]] often shows animals, most often powerful and fierce ones, many of which are also very common in the ancient Near East, or the [[Scythian art]] of the [[Eurasian steppe]], whose mobile owners provided a route for the very rapid transmission of motifs and objects between the civilizations of Asia and Europe.

In particular, the two figures standing in profile flanking the large head on exterior plate F, each with a bird with outstretched wings just above their head clearly resemble a common motif in ancient [[Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] and [[Persian art]], down to the long garments they wear.  Here the figure is usually the ruler, and the wings belong to a symbolic representation of a deity protecting him. Other plates show [[griffin]]s borrowed from Ancient Greek art of that of the Near East.  On several of the exterior plates the large heads, probably of deities, in the centre of the exterior panels, have small arms and hands, either each grasping an animal or human in a version of the common [[Master of Animals]] motif, or held up empty at the side of the head in a way suggesting inspiration from this motif.

===Celtic mythology===
Apart from Cernunnos and Taranis, discussed above, there is no consensus regarding the other figures, and many scholars reject attempts to tie them in to figures known from much later and geographically distant sources. Some Celticists have explained the elephants depicted on plate '''B''' as a reference to [[Hannibal#Overland journey to Italy|Hannibal's crossing of the Alps]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt; 

Because of the double-headed wolfish monster attacking the two small figures of fallen men on plate '''b''', parallels can be drawn to the Welsh character [[Manawydan]] or the Irish [[Manannán]], a god of the sea and the Otherworld. Another possibility is the Gaulish version of [[Apollo]], who was not only a warrior, but one associated with springs and healing besides.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Olmsted relates the scenes of the cauldron to those of the [[Táin Bó Cuailnge]], where the antlered figure is [[Cú Chulainn]], the bull of the base plate is [[Donn Cuailnge]], and the female and two males of plate '''e''' are [[Medb]], [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]], and [[Fergus mac Róich]].  Olmsted also toys with the idea that the female figure flanked by two birds on plate '''f''' could be Medb with her pets or [[Morrígan]], the Irish war goddess who often changes into a carrion bird.&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Both Olmsted and Taylor agree that the female of plate '''f''' might be [[Rhiannon]] of the [[Mabinogion]]. Rhiannon is famous for her birds, whose songs could "awaken the dead and lull the living to sleep". In this role, Rhiannon could be considered the Goddess of the Otherworld.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Olmsted"/&gt;

Taylor presents a more pancultural view of the cauldron's images; he concludes that the deities and scenes portrayed on the cauldron are not specific to one culture, but many. He compares Rhiannon, whom he thinks is the figure of plate '''f''', with [[Hariti]], an ogress of [[Bactria]]n mythology. In addition, he points to the similarity between the female figure of plate '''B''' and the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Lakshmi]], whose depictions are often accompanied by elephants. Wheel gods are also cross-cultural with deities like Taranis and [[Vishnu]], a god from Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3339">In [[film studies]], '''historical poetics''' is a scholarly approach to studying [[film]], which [[David Bordwell]] outlined in his book ''Making Meaning'' (1989).&lt;ref name=Bhaskar&gt;Ira Stig Bhaskar (2004), "Historical Poetics, Narrative, and Interpretation" in ''A Companion to Film Theory'' (eds. Toby Miller &amp; Robert Stan). Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Bhaskar's article is a critical account of historical poetics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Bordwell argues that theory-driven, interpretative approaches should be eschewed and argued that historical poetics was a better approach to studying film.&lt;ref name=Bhaskar/&gt; Bordwell argues that "[a]ny inquiry into the fundamental principles by which a work in any representational medium is constructed can fall within the domain of poetics."&lt;ref name=Bordwell1&gt;David Bordwell (1989), "Historical Poetics of Cinema" in ''The Cinematic Text'' (ed. R. Barton Palmer). New York: AMS Press, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Jenkins makes a distinction between [[descriptive poetics]] and prescriptive poetics where the former examine "how artworks ''have been'' constructed" and the latter make a case for "how artworks ''should be'' constructed."&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;Henry Jenkins (1989), "Historical Poetics" in ''Approaches to Popular Film'' (ed. Joanne Hollows and Mark Jankovich). Manchester: Manchester UP, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Bordwell's own research falls within the former category while an example of the latter is the ''[[Dogme 95|Dogme 95 Manifesto]]'' by [[Denmark|Danish]] [[Film director|director]]s [[Lars von Trier]] and [[Thomas Vinterberg]].

Bordwell's research into the stylistic changes in Hollywood cinema demonstrates four specific changes: the use of more rapid editing, an increasingly frequent use of very long or very short lenses, a more prevalent use of close shots, and more camera movement.&lt;ref name=Bordwell3&gt;David Bordwell (2002) “Intensified Continuity: Visual Style in Contemporary American Film” in ''Film Quarterly'' 55(3), 16-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bordwell2&gt;David Bordwell (2006) ''The Way Hollywood Tells It. Story and Style in Modern Movies'' Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical poetics and [[neoformalism (film theory)|neoformalism]]&lt;ref&gt;Historical poetics and neoformalism are sometimes used interchangeably, sometimes as related approaches.&lt;/ref&gt; are part of the "post-theory" trend in [[film studies]]. Bordwell has repeatedly argued that some approaches — ones based in "Grand Theories" — do not study films ''per se'' but instead use films to confirm predetermined theoretical frameworks. He and [[Noël Carroll]] coined the term "S.L.A.B. theory" which refers to theorists [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]], [[Lacan]], [[Althusser]], and [[Barthes]].&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Guy Westwell (2012).

Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical poetics is considered to be related to [[cognitive film theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Guy Westwell (2012).

'''Jazz dance''' is the performance dance technique and style that emerged in America in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Billie. "Jazz Dance." The International Encyclopedia of Dance. : Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference. 2005. Date Accessed 20 Mar. 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; Jazz dance began as an African American social dance that had roots in African slave dances. Over time, a clearly defined jazz genre emerged, changing from a [[street dance]] to a theatrical dance performed on stage due to the work by artists such as [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], [[Bob Fosse]], [[Eugene Louis Faccuito]] and [[Gus Giordano]].

==History==
[[File:Congo Square, Armstrong Park, New Orleans, USA2.jpg|thumb|Congo Square]]
[[File:Basic Charleston.png|thumb|Charleston dance]]
[[File:Sweet Charity - Premijera 04.JPG|thumb|Sweet Charity - Bob Fosse choreography]]
The origins of jazz dance can be traced back to the African ritual and celebratory dances from around the eighteenth century. These dances had an emphasis on rhythm, groundedness, and a connection to the earth. They were traditionally done to the beat of African drums such as [[djembe]]s, ashikos, and bougarabous. Also, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] brought ten million Africans and their dances across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. By 1817 in New Orleans, city laws "restricted gatherings of enslaved people to Sunday afternoons in Congo Square, then called Place Publique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neworleanshistorical.org/items/show/745|title=Congo Square: Mythology and Music - Stop 5 of 7 on the Urban Slavery and Everyday Resistance tour {{!}} New Orleans Historical|website=New Orleans Historical|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday afternoon meetings often included the music and dance from the birthplaces of the slaves. The gatherings at Congo Square were shut down and brought back multiple times during the 1800s; when the meetings were shut down, they continued in secret.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In the early 1900s in New Orleans, the new music was combining elements of blues and ragtime. Although the term "jazz" first appeared in print in 1910, [[Jelly Roll Morton]], a New Orleans pianist, claims that he invented jazz in 1902.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howjazzworks.com/index.php/what-is-jazz|title=How Jazz Works|last=Clayton|first=Audrey|website=www.howjazzworks.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, jazz pianist Spencer Williams wrote a song called "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble" which inspired a jazz dance called the "[[shimmy]]". The shimmy is done by holding the body still "except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth". In the same year, jazz music began to spread and became well known in Chicago and New York. This led to the jazz age, which is considered to be from 1920 to 1929. A few of the great musicians in the jazz age were [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and [[Benny Goodman]]. The dances that emerged during this period were the Charleston and the [[Lindy hop]]. The Charleston is "characterized by its toes-in, heels-out twisting steps".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Charleston-dance|title=Charleston {{!}} dance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be done as a solo or with any number of people. The Lindy hop was a wild and spontaneous partner dance that was extremely rhythmically conscious. When the Great Depression began in October of 1929, many people turned to dance. Because of this, the Charleston and the Lindy hop are now considered to be under the umbrella term "swing dance" because they were most popular during the swing era of music (1935-1945).{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The 1930s were also the start of jazz dance being combined into live musical theatre shows and movie musicals. A few of the prominent musical theatre choreographers were Jerome Robbins, Jack Cole and Michael Kidd. They created the dances for ''West Side Story'', ''Gypsy'', ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', and many more. These three choreographers and many of the other important figures in jazz dance choreographed and performed between 1930 and 1980. [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] has his roots in modern and ballet, but he later became known as the father of jazz dance. His style is described as "hip, hard, and cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/cole_essay_levine.pdf|title=Jack Cole (1911-1974)|last=Levine|first=Debra|date=|website=Dance Heritage Coalition|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gus Giordano]] is another key dancer/choreographer. Giordano founded his own company and established the Giordano technique. Another amazing jazz choreographer and dancer that founded a jazz technique was Lynn Simonson. Her technique, unsurprisingly, was called the Simonson technique. She emphasized organic movement with a connection to the music. Lastly, [[Bob Fosse]] developed his signature style of jazz dance. He, like some of the previously mentioned choreographers, worked in the musical theatre business. His brand was a "combination of vaudeville, striptease, magic shows, nightclubs, film and Broadway musicals, all based on social dance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the last 20 years, jazz has evolved and has been defined. There are now many subcategories of jazz that each have their own distinct qualities and characteristics. The style and choreographers that I have mentioned thus far are considered to be a part of ‘classic jazz.’ This jazz is currently seen in companies like [[Giordano Dance Chicago]] and Jazz Roots Dance Company. It is also primarily done to jazz music from the early to mid-1900s. Contemporary jazz became well known because of shows like ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''. [[Mia Michaels]]' earlier work exemplifies this style. Some other companies and choreographers that create contemporary jazz dance are [[Sonya Tayeh]], [[Mandy Moore (choreographer)|Mandy Moore]], and [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]]. Commercial jazz, which has been popular since the ‘80s, combines aspects of hip hop and jazz and is often done to pop music. This style can be seen in the music videos of [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]]. Lastly, commercial jazz often includes more "tricks."

'''''Junk Jet''''' is a non-commercial publication platform, a collaborative format set up to discuss speculative works on topics of art, architecture and [[electronic media]]. It is published by independent igmade.edition, edited and designed by Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest (m-a-u-s-e-r).

== History ==
Self-published Magazine ''Junk Jet'' is founded in 2007 by Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest. It tries to introduce "[[noise]] to signal".

== Issues ==
[[File:Junk Jet n°1 and n°2.jpg|thumb|Junk Jet Magazine, Issues 1 and 2]]
'''Junk Jet n°1'''
noise-and-failure-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the first issue:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
JJ wants to capture and transfer junk’s ambiguities indicating non- function, or at least bad-function implied in the nature of technology, and various forms of mis-use for aesthetic purposes. What could be the aesthetic (non-) function of junk within clean computational aesthetics of electronic media?
Therefore, relevant fields are all sorts of re-use, of wrong- and non-use, and of tinkering (bricoler, basteln) of forms and found objects, of theories and (small) narratives, of fashions and styles, and of course of computers and other electronic devices.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: November 2007&lt;br /&gt;
ISBN: NO-ISBN&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 69 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 25 x 20 x 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

'''Junk Jet n°2'''
the-speculative-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the second issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For the second issue, Junk Jet was looking for the Speculative, focussing on works of unpredictable architectures and volatile spaces within real and virtual environments.
The speculative haunts all systems of production, threatens them with the destruction of their order and with collapse. It continues to appear to all orthodoxies as artifice, as a black magic, which is to be unveiled, because it is somehow effective in an illusive, but absorbing way, which is characteristic to an occasion for a game and its stakes. It is not a rational process, but something that contradicts this frame, something that is recognized as irrational, as feverish, and that therefore is suspected to be dysfunctional, inhuman, or even monstrous.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: November 2008&lt;br /&gt;
ISBN: NO-ISBN&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 100 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 24 x 16.5 x 0.7&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:junkjet3.jpg|thumb|Cover of Junk Jet n°3]]
'''Junk Jet n°3'''
flux-us-flux-you-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The editors write in the third issue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Junk Jet n°3 asked for fluxing architectures, boogie, buildings, rolling rocks, flying architectures, provisory pyramids, and temporary eternities; for all kinds of practical concepts and conceptual practices, for stable happenings and unstable thoughts, for lifted cellars and dugin landmarks, for curtains, mobiles, house boats, bubbles, zeppelins, flying saucers ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: February 2010&lt;br /&gt;
{{ISBN|978-3-00-030127-8}}&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 120 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 18 x 13 x 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;
{{Clear}}
[[File:Junk Jet 4 from 2010.jpg|thumb|Cover of Junk Jet n°4]]
'''Junk Jet n°4'''
statistics-of-mystics-issue&lt;br /&gt;
The fourth issue is about:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
works and theories that make 1 become 2, 2 become 3, 3 …, works that make something out of nothing or nothing out of something, that discover new – even if microscaled – galaxies, that believe in alchemy and maintain a certain kind of apocalyptic thought; works that move from mumbo-jumbo to real magic and back.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Release Date: October 2010&lt;br /&gt;
{{ISBN|978-3-00-032228-0}}&lt;br /&gt;
Number of pages: 88 &lt;br /&gt;
Measurements: 27 x 19 x 1&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;br /&gt;

'''Junk Jet n°5'''
The net.heart-issue, released in 2012, transfers internet things from their digital space into printed media. It reflects the current internet culture with contributions by young internet artist and thinkers. It is an archive impossible with reflecting net.heart of internet culture. It collects objects, internet blogs, and animations from internet and turns them into a magazine. Editors Mona Mahall and Asli Serbest are inspired by the process of collecting objects and documenting archival material.

[[File:Junk Jet n°6 Page 16-17.jpg|thumb|Junk Jet Magazine, Issue 6, inside, images by Clement Valla]]
'''Junk Jet n°6'''
Here and Where Issue, n°6 is about the local in the global culture. It takes the attitude that the global is just the local on world tour. The local is not preserving identity – be that cultural, political, or social – but it is (re)inventing itself as art, activism and enterprise. The local aims at becoming a global subject, without knowing what forces (swarm, viral, etc.) this depends on. There is a downloadable hidden track in the magazine.

This is a list of visual artists who are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]], categorized by primary media. [[Mestizo]] and [[Métis]] artists whose indigenous descent is integral to their art are included, as are [[Siberian Yup'ik]] artists due to their cultural commonalities with Alaskan [[Yup'ik]] people. This list includes notable [[visual artists]] who are [[Inuit people]], [[Alaskan Native]]s, [[Siberian Yup'ik]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]]s, [[First Nations]], [[Métis]], [[Mestizos]], and [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico]], the Caribbean, Central America, and [[Indigenous peoples in South America|South America]]. Indigenous identity is a complex and contested issue and differs from country to country in the Americas. Inclusion to this list is based on legal membership to an Indigenous community, when applicable, or recognition by the relevant indigenous community/communities of the individual as a member of that community.
&lt;!-- Please add only well-established artists who meet the requirements of  [[Wikipedia:Notability (people)]]. Thanks!--&gt;

'''Lydia Goehr''' is a Professor of Philosophy at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=obio&gt;{{cite web|title=Lydia Goehr {{!}} Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophy.columbia.edu/directories/faculty/lydia-goehr|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her research specialties include the [[philosophy of music]], [[aesthetics]], [[critical theory]], the [[philosophy of history]], and [[19th-century philosophy|19th]]- and [[20th-century philosophy]].

==Biography==
Goehr was born in [[London]], on January 10, 1960. She is the daughter of the composer [[Alexander Goehr]] and granddaughter of [[Walter Goehr]]. She received her Ph.D. from [[Cambridge University]], where her dissertation on the ontology of music was supervised by [[Bernard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jacobs, et al. "Goehr." Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 30 Mar. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/53781pg3&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her permanent appointment at Columbia, Goehr has accepted a number of visiting appointments, including a position as Visiting Ernest Bloch Professor at [[UC Berkeley]]'s music department in 1997, as the visiting Aby Warburg Professor at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 2002-2003, as a visiting professor at the [[Free University of Berlin|Freie Universität]] in [[Berlin]] in 2008, and as a visiting professor in the Fu-Berlin SFB Theater und Fest in 2009.&lt;ref name=obio/&gt;

Goehr has written three books, co-edited a fourth, and has published numerous articles in the philosophy of music and critical theory. Her first book, ''The Imaginary Museum of Musical Works: An Essay in the Philosophy of Music'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), was published in 1992, and has since been translated into Greek, Chinese and Italian. Her second book, ''A Quest for Voice: On Music, Politics, and the Limits of Philosophy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford), is based on the Bloch Lectures, delivered at the University of California, Berkeley in 1997. Her third book, published in 2008, is ''Elective Affinities: Musical Essays on the History of Aesthetic Theory'' (Columbia University Press).

Goehr's work focuses on the history of aesthetic theory, attempting to understand the relational nature of norms and power dynamics with the structure that confines them and regulates their practice.&lt;ref name=apacsw&gt;{{cite web|last=DesAutels|first=Peggy|title=Lydia Goehr: November 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her work has focused on the musical arts, and some of it has explored the complicated and often hostile relationship between the various arts, and between the arts and philosophy and religion.&lt;ref name=apacsw/&gt;  She has also engaged with ideas about the legitimacy of war from a [[critical theory]] standpoint, as well as dealt with the [[philosophy of history]] and the [[history of philosophy]].

Goehr has received several awards for her research as well as for her teaching of undergraduate students and mentoring of graduate students. She has been a recipient of the Getty and Guggenheim Fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gf.org/search?search=goehr&amp;x=-1119&amp;y=-67 |title= Guggenheim Fellowships |publisher= Guggenheim Foundation |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/lydiagoehrnovember |title=The American Philosophical Association's Committee on the Status of Women |publisher=APA |date= |accessdate=2013-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Goehr was awarded the H.

In [[feminist theory]], the '''male gaze''' is the act of depicting women and the world, in the [[visual arts]] and [[literature]], from a masculine, heterosexual perspective that presents and represents women as [[Sexual objectification|sexual objects]] for the pleasure of the male viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eaton|first=E.W.|title=Feminist philosophy of art|journal= Philosophy Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 873–893 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | date = September 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-9991.2008.00154.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-aesthetics/|title=Feminist Aesthetics|work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|quote=Assumes a standard point of view that is masculine and heterosexual.

The film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] coined the term ''male gaze'', which is contrasted with the concept of the [[female gaze]];&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jacobsson"&gt;{{Cite report |author= Jacobsson, Eva-Maria |date= 1999 |title= A Female Gaze? |url= http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= [[Royal Institute of Technology|Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan)]] |location= Stockholm, Sweden |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025557/http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |archivedate= 2011-10-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as such, the male gaze is comparable to [[scopophilia]], which is sexual pleasure derived from observing the passive female as object.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|815}}

== Background ==
The concept of the '''male gaze''' was first developed by the feminist film critic [[Laura Mulvey]] in the essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" (1975), in which she proposes that an asymmetry of [[Power (social and political)|power]] between the sexes is a controlling force in cinema; and that the male gaze is constructed for the pleasure of the male viewer, which is deeply rooted in the ideologies and discourses of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Weeks|first=L.

The perspective of the male gaze occurs when the camera places the viewer in the perspective of a heterosexual man whose sight lingers on the curves of a woman's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Streeter | first1 = Thomas | last2 = Hintlian | first2 = Nicole | last3 = Chipetz | first3 = Samantha | last4 = Callender | first4 = Susanna | title = This is Not Sex: A Web Essay on the Male Gaze, Fashion Advertising, and the Pose | url = http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | date = 2005 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20111106152945/http://www.uvm.edu/~tstreete/powerpose/index.html | archivedate = 2011-11-06 | df =  }} Web essay about the male gaze in advertising.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the male gaze displays the woman on two different levels: (i) as an erotic object for the characters in the film story, and (ii) as an erotic object for the male viewer of the film.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} By way of the male gaze, the man emerges as the dominant power within the film fantasy, in which the woman is a passive object for the active gaze of the male viewer. The passive-object and active-viewer pairing is basic to the patriarchal order, and is typical in the "illusionistic narrative film" of mainstream cinema, where the male gaze has precedence over the female gaze — the underlying asymmetry of social and political power, between the sexes.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;{{rp|14}}&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Sassatelli | first = Roberta | title = Interview with Laura Mulvey: Gender, Gaze and Technology in Film Culture | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 123–143 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411398278 | date = September 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411398278 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|127}}

This inequality can be attributed to patriarchy which has been defined as a social ideology embedded in the belief systems of Western culture and in patriarchal societies. It is either masculine individuals or institutions created by these individuals that exert the power to determine what is considered "natural".&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pritchard | first1 = Annette | last2 = Morgan | first2 = Nigel J. | title = Privileging the male gaze: gendered tourism landscapes | journal = Annals of Tourism Research | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 884–905 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | date = October 2000 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0160-7383(99)00113-9 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of time, these constructed beliefs begin to seem "natural" or "normal" because they are prevalent and carry out unchallenged, thus arguing that Western culture has adopted a dyadic, hierarchical ideology which sets masculinity in binary opposition to femininity thus creating levels of inferiority.&lt;ref name="Privileging the Male Gaze"/&gt;

Mulvey describes its two central forms that are based in [[Freud]]'s concept of scopophilia, as: "pleasure that is linked to sexual attraction (voyeurism in extremis) and scopophilic pleasure that is linked to narcissistic identification (the introjection of ideal egos)",&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; in order to demonstrate how women have historically been forced to view film through the "male gaze". It also suggests that the male gaze denies women their human identity, relegating them to the status of objects to be admired for physical appearance and male sexual desires and fantasies.

In "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema", Mulvey discusses several different types of spectatorship that may occur while viewing a film. They can involve unconsciously or, in some cases, consciously engaging in the typical, ascribed societal roles of men and women.

In relation to [[phallocentrism]], films may be viewed in "three different looks"; the first refers to the camera as it records the actual events of the film, the second describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as one engages in watching the film itself, and the third refers to the characters that interact with one another throughout the film. The main idea that seems to bring these actions together is that "looking" is generally seen as an active male role, while the passive role of being looked at is immediately adopted as a female characteristic. It is under the construction of patriarchy that Mulvey argues that women in film are tied to desire and that female characters hold an "appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact". The female actor is never meant to represent a character that directly affects the outcome of a plot or keep the story line going, but is inserted into the film as a way of supporting the male role and "bearing the burden of sexual objectification" that he cannot.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt;

In other words, the woman is passive to the active gaze from the man and can be linked to scopophilia (or scoptophilia), which can be described as pleasure derived from looking. As an expression of [[sexuality]], scopophilia refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], naked bodies, etc. 
In sum, according to Mulvey, the categories of pleasurable viewing are twofold: voyeurism, which derives pleasure from viewing a distant other, and projecting one's fantasies, usually sexual, onto that person, and narcissism, a form of recognition of one's self in the image of another we are viewing. Mulvey also believes that in order to enjoy a film as a woman, or any gender other than male, we must learn to identify with the male protagonist.&lt;ref name=mulvey1975/&gt; [[Wendy Arons]] adds that [[sexualization|hypersexualization]] diminishes the symbolic threat posed by violent female characters in [[action film]]s, "The focus on the body—as a body in ostentatious display of breasts, legs, and buttocks—does mitigate the threat that women pose to 'the very fabric of... society' by reassuring the (male) viewer of his [[Male privilege|privilege]] as the possessor of the objectifying gaze."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Arons | first = Wendy | contribution = "If her stunning beauty doesn't bring you to your knees, her deadly drop kick will": violent women in Hong Kong Kung Fu film | editor-last1 = McCaughey | editor-first1 = Martha | editor-last2 = King | editor-first2 = Neal | editor-link1 = Martha McCaughey | title = Reel knockouts: violent women in the movies | page = 41 | location = Austin, Texas | publisher = University of Texas Press | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mulvey's essay also states that the female gaze is the same as the male gaze. This means that women look at themselves through the eyes of men.&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011"/&gt; The male gaze may be seen by a [[feminist]] either as a manifestation of unequal power between gazer and gazed, or as a conscious or subconscious attempt to develop that [[Gender inequality|inequality]]. From this perspective, a woman who welcomes an objectifying gaze may be simply [[conforming]] to norms established to benefit men, thereby reinforcing the power of the gaze to reduce a recipient to an object. Welcoming such objectification may be viewed as akin to [[exhibitionism]].&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

The possibility of an analogous female gaze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Felluga | first = Dino | title = "Modules on Lacan: on the gaze" ''Introductory guide to critical theory'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050415054601/http://www.sla.purdue.edu/academic/engl/theory/psychoanalysis/lacangaze.html | archive-date = 15 April 2005 | url = http://www.sla.purdue.edu/academic/engl/theory/psychoanalysis/lacangaze.html | publisher = [[Purdue University]] | location = West Lafayette, Indiana, US | date = April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |author= Jacobsson, Eva-Maria |date= 1999 |title= A female gaze? |url= http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |format= pdf |publisher= [[Royal Institute of Technology|Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan)]] |location= Stockholm, Sweden |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025557/http://cid.nada.kth.se/pdf/cid_51.pdf |archivedate= 2011-10-04 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Paul | first = Nalini | title = Other ways of looking: the female gaze in Jean Rhys' ''Wide Sargasso Sea'' | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090127060053/http://www.sharp.arts.gla.ac.uk/issue2/paul.htm | archive-date = 27 January 2009 | url = http://www.sharp.arts.gla.ac.uk/issue2/paul.htm | journal = ESharp (journal run by postgraduates for postgraduates) | volume = 2 | publisher = [[University of Glasgow]] | date = Spring 2004 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kelly | first = Eileen | title = The female gaze | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030201090344/http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2003/01/30/gaze/index_np.html | archive-date = 1 February 2003 | url = http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2003/01/30/gaze/index_np.html | work = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] | publisher = Salon Media Group | date = 30 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; may arise from considering the male gaze. Mulvey argues that "the male figure cannot bear the burden of sexual objectification. Man is reluctant to gaze". Describing ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966), by [[Jean Rhys]], [[Nalini Paul]] indicates that the Antoinette character gazes at Rochester, placing a [[garland]] upon him, making him appear heroic: "Rochester does not feel comfortable with having this role enforced upon him; thus, he rejects it by removing the garland, and crushing the flowers."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;

From the male perspective, a man possesses the gaze because he is a man, whereas a woman has the gaze only when she assumes the male gazer role—when she objectifies others by gazing at them like a man. [[Eva-Maria Jacobsson]] supports Paul's description of the "female gaze" as "a mere cross-identification with masculinity", yet evidence of women's objectification of men—the discrete existence of a ''female gaze''—can be found in the "boy toy" ads published in [[teen magazines]], for example, despite Mulvey's contention that ''the gaze'' is ''property'' of one gender. Whether or not this is an example of female gaze or rather an internalized male gaze is up for debate, along with the other ideas on this subject. In terms of power relationships, the gazer can direct a gaze upon members of the same gender for [[asexuality|asexual]] reasons, such as comparing the gazer's [[body image]] and clothing to those of the gazed-at individual.&lt;ref  name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|127}}

With respect to her essay, Mulvey stressed in a 2011 interview with [[Roberta Sassatelli]]: "First, that the 1975 article "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema" was written as a [[polemic]], and as [[Mandy Merck]] has described it, as a manifesto; so I had no interest in modifying the argument. Clearly I think, in retrospect from a more nuanced perspective, about the inescapability of the male gaze."&lt;ref name="interview-mulvey-2011" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

== Criticizing the male gaze ==

===Matrixial gaze===
[[Bracha Ettinger]] criticizes this notion of the male gaze by her proposition of a ''[[Matrixial Gaze|matrixial gaze]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | title = The matrixial gaze | publisher = Feminist Arts and Histories Network, Department of Fine Art, University of Leeds | location = Leeds, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780952489900 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The matrixial gaze is not operative where a "male gaze" is placed opposite to a "female gaze" and where both positive entities constitute each other from a lack (such an umbrella concept of the gaze would precisely be what scholars such as [[Slavoj Žižek]] claim is the [[Lacan]]ian definition of "The Gaze"). Ettinger's proposal doesn't concern a subject and its object, existing or lacking. Rather, it concerns "trans-subjectivity" and shareability on a partial level, and it is based on her claim concerning a feminine-matrixial difference that escapes the phallic opposition of masculine/feminine and is produced in a process of co-emergence. Ettinger works from the very late Lacan, yet, from the angle she brings, it is the structure of the Lacanian subject itself that is deconstructed to a certain extent, and another kind of feminine dimension appears, with its hybrid and floating matrixial gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Ettinger | first = Bracha | author-link = Bracha Ettinger | contribution = The with-in-visible screen | editor-last = de Zegher | editor-first = M.

===''Ways of Seeing'': the Renaissance nude===
In the book ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'' (1972), John Berger addressed the subject of female [[sexual objectification]] in the arts, noting that "according to usage and conventions, which are at last being questioned, but have by no means been overcome — men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Berger | first = John | author-link = John Berger | contribution = Section 3 | editor-last = Berger | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Berger | title = Ways of seeing | pages = 45, 47 | publisher = [[BBC]] Penguin Books | location = London | year = 1973 | isbn = 9780563122449 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[mores|usages and conventions]] of observation relate the [[objectification|objectifying]] male gaze to Lacan's theory of the [[social alienation]] that results from the psychological split, between seeing one's self and seeing the ideal of one's self. In [[Italian Renaissance painting]], especially in the genre of the nude subject, that perceptual split arises from being both the viewer and the viewed, and from seeing one's self through the [[gaze]] of other people.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Sturken | first1 = Marita | last2 = Cartwright | first2 = Lisa | contribution = Spectatorship, Power, and Knowledge | editor-last1 = Sturken | editor-first1 = Marita | editor-last2 = Cartwright | editor-first2 = Lisa | title = Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture | page = 81 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780198742715 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women and the gaze===
[[Griselda Pollock]], in her article, "Modernity and the Spaces of Femininity" argues that the female gaze can often be visually negated.&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90"&gt;{{citation | last = Pollock | first = Griselda | author-link = Griselda Pollock | contribution = Modernity and the spaces for femininity | editor-last = Pollock | editor-first = Griselda | editor-link = Griselda Pollock | title = Vision and difference: femininity, feminism, and histories of art | pages = 50–90 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1988 | isbn = 9780415007214 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

The spectator view of the picture is from inside the shop but the couple are looking in different places than the view of the spectator. The woman is commenting on an image to her husband, while the husband is being distracted by a nude female painting. The nude female painting is hung within view of the spectator. The woman is looking at another image, but it is out of view of the spectator. The man's gaze has found something more interesting and he has chosen to ignore the woman's comment. According to Pollock, "She is contrasted iconographically to the naked woman.  She is denied the picturing of her desire; what she looks at is blank for the spectator.  She is denied being the object of desire because she is represented as a woman who actively looks, rather than returning and confirming the gaze of the masculine spectator".&lt;ref name="Pollock-pp50-90" /&gt;

Lorraine Gamman has suggested that a female gaze can be distinguished from that of a male through its displacing of [[Scopophilia|scopophilic]] power, not simply the inversion of the male gaze, which creates the possibility of a multiplicity of viewing angles. In fact, for Gamman, "the female gaze cohabits the space occupied by men, rather than being entirely divorced from it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Gamman | first = Lorraine | contribution = Watching the detectives: the enigma of the female gaze | editor-last1 = Gamman | editor-first1 = Lorraine | editor-last2 = Marshment | editor-first2 = Margaret | title = The Female gaze: women as viewers of popular culture | page = 16 | publisher = Real Comet Press | location = Seattle | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780941104425 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for Gamman, the role of the female gaze is not to appropriate the traditional male form of "voyeurism;" its purpose is to disrupt the [[Phallocentric]] power of the male gaze by providing for other modes of looking.

[[Jay David Bolter]] and [[Richard Grusin]] suggest that Mulvey's "male gaze" coincides with "the desire for visual immediacy", the erasure of the medium for uninhibited interaction with the object portrayed, which feminist film theorists treat as "a male desire that takes an overt sexual meaning when the object of representation, and therefore desire, is a woman".&lt;ref name="Remediation"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Bolter | first1 = Jay David | last2 = Grusin | first2 = Richard | contribution = Networks of remediation | editor-last1 = Bolter | editor-first1 = Jay David | editor-last2 = Grusin | editor-first2 = Richard | title = Remediation understanding new media | pages = 64–87 | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780262024525 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} However, Bolter and Grusin consider their term "hypermediacy", the drawing of attention to the medium (or media) and the mediating processes present in a work, to be a manifestation of Gamman's female gaze because it "is multiple and deviant in its suggestion of multiplicity—a multiplicity of viewing positions and a multiplicity of relationships to the object in view, including sexual objects".&lt;ref name="Remediation" /&gt;{{rp|84}} According to Bolter and Grusin, then, hypermediacy, much like the female gaze, works to disrupt the myopic and monolithic male gaze by offering more angles of viewing.

At the 2016 Toronto International Film Festival, [[Jill Soloway]], in her keynote address, tried to define the "female gaze" in film-making (available on YouTube).

The Indian photographer [[Farhat Basir Khan]] attributes the female gaze to anything that's been photographed by a woman which according to Khan is actually breaking the stereotypical view created by "male-constructed" photographs that have shown women in a certain light throughout the history of visual arts. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From her perspective|url=http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=30 March 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602070404/http://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/art/From-her-perspective/article16988924.ece|archivedate=2 June 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of female gaze was central to the exhibition curated by Khan titled 'Feminography' at the [[Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts]] in January 2017.

=== Oppositional gaze ===
[[bell hooks]], in her essay titled "The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Feminism and Visual Cultural Reader.|last=hooks|first=bell|publisher=Amelia Jones|year=|isbn=|location=New York: Routledge, 2003|pages=94–105|chapter=The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectator|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Black women are placed outside of the "pleasure in looking" as an imaginary subject to the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In reading [[Laura Mulvey|Mulvey]]'s essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Cultural Studies: Keywords|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|publisher=Meenakshi Gigi Durham and Douglas Kellner|year=|isbn=|location=2001; Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2006|pages=342–352|chapter=Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; hooks states,"...from a standpoint that acknowledges race, one sees clearly why black women spectators not duped by mainstream cinema would develop an oppositional gaze".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In relation [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]'s [[mirror stage]], during which a child develops self recognition and thus, the [[Ego ideal|ideal ego]], hooks takes up the oppositional gaze as a form of looking back, in search of the Black female body within the idealization of cinematic white womanhood.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The absence of racial relations in the context of feminist theory around the "totalizing category [of] women" engages in a process of denial which refutes the reality that many feminist film critics structure their discourse around white women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a working-class Black woman interviewed by hooks replied, "to see black women in the position white women have occupied in film forever...", is to see a 'transfer' without 'transformation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The oppositional gaze, therefore, encompasses resistance as well as an understanding and awareness of the politics of race and racism via cinematic whiteness inclusive of the male gaze.&lt;!-- any commentary on ''La Dame Indignee''? --&gt;

'''Martin Johnson Heade''' (August 11, 1819 – September 4, 1904) was an American [[Painting|painter]] known for his [[salt marsh]] [[Landscape art|landscapes]], [[seascape]]s, and depictions of tropical birds (such as hummingbirds),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Elizabeth Leto Fulton |title=The Methods and Materials of Martin Johnson Heade |publisher=The Journal of the American Institute for Conservation |year=2002 |display-authors=etal}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lotus blossoms and other [[still life]]s. His painting style and subject matter, while derived from the [[romanticism]] of the time, are regarded by art historians as a significant departure from those of his peers.

Heade was born in [[Lumberville, Pennsylvania]], the son of a storekeeper. He studied with [[Edward Hicks]], and possibly with Thomas Hicks. His earliest works were produced during the 1840s and were chiefly portraits. He travelled to Europe several times as a young man, became an itinerant artist on American shores, and exhibited in Philadelphia in 1841 and New York in 1843. Friendships with artists of the [[Hudson River School]] led to an interest in [[landscape art]].  In 1863, he planned to publish a volume of Brazilian hummingbirds and tropical flowers, but the project was eventually abandoned. He travelled to the tropics several times thereafter, and continued to paint birds and flowers. Heade married in 1883 and moved to [[St. Augustine, Florida]]. His chief works from this period were Floridian landscapes and flowers, particularly magnolias laid upon velvet cloth. He died in 1904. His best known works are depictions of light and shadow upon the salt marshes of New England.

Heade was not a widely known artist during his lifetime, but his work attracted the notice of scholars, art historians, and collectors during the 1940s. He quickly became recognized as a major American artist. Although often considered a [[Hudson River School]] artist, some critics and scholars take exception to this categorization. Heade's works are now in major museums and collections. His paintings are occasionally discovered in unlikely places such as garage sales and flea markets.

==Childhood and early career==
Heade was born (in 1819) and raised in [[Lumberville, Pennsylvania]], a small hamlet along the [[Delaware River]] in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12"&gt;{{citation |editor-last=Roberts |editor-first=Norma J. |title=The American Collections |publisher=[[Columbus Museum of Art]] |year=1988 |isbn=0-8109-1811-0 |page=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Until the mid-1850s, his family ran what is now called the Lumberville Store and Post Office, the village's sole general store. The family spelling of the name was Heed.

Heade received his first art training from the folk artist [[Edward Hicks]], who lived in nearby Newton, and possibly also from Edward's cousin, Thomas Hicks.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  Heade was painting by 1839; his earliest known work is a portrait from that year.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  He traveled abroad and lived in Rome for two years.  He first exhibited his work in 1841, at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, and again in 1843 at the [[National Academy of Design]] in New York.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  Heade began exhibiting regularly in 1848, after another trip to Europe, and became an itinerant artist until he settled in New York in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;Biographical Note.

==Transition to landscape painting==
[[Image:Martin Johnson Heade - Singing Beach, Manchester.jpg|left|thumb|''Singing Beach, Manchester, Massachusetts'', 1862]]

Around 1857 Heade became interested in [[landscape art|landscape]] painting, partly by meeting the established artists [[John Frederick Kensett]] and [[Benjamin Champney]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] of [[New Hampshire]]. Heade moved to [[New York City]] and took a studio in the Tenth Street Studio Building, which housed many of the famous Hudson River School artists of the time, such as [[Albert Bierstadt]], [[Sanford Gifford]], and [[Frederic Edwin Church]].&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  He became socially and professionally acquainted with them, and struck up a particularly close friendship with Church. Landscapes would ultimately form a third of Heade's total oeuvre.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;

==Tropical subjects==
[[File:Martin Johnson Heade-Cattleya Orchid and Three Brazilian Hummingbirds.jpg|thumb|''[[Cattleya Orchid and Three Hummingbirds]]'', 1871]]

Heade's interest in the tropics was piqued at least partly by the impact of [[Frederic Edwin Church|Church]]'s monumental painting ''[[Heart of the Andes]]'' (1859), now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Heade travelled in [[Brazil]] from 1863 to 1864, where he painted an extensive series of small works, eventually numbering over forty, depicting [[hummingbird]]s. He intended the series for a planned book titled "The Gems of Brazil", but the book was never published due to financial difficulty and Heade's concerns about the quality of the reproductions. Heade nevertheless returned to the tropics twice, in 1866 journeying to [[Nicaragua]], and in 1870 to [[Colombia]], [[Panama]], and [[Jamaica]]. He continued to paint romantic works of tropical birds and lush foliage into his late career.

==Salt marsh scenes==
[[Image:HeadeMartinJohnsonSunlightAndShadow.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Sunlight and Shadow: The Newbury Marshes]]'', 1871–75]]

Heade's primary interest in [[landscape art|landscape]], and the works for which he is perhaps best known today, was the New England coastal [[salt marsh]]. Contrary to typical Hudson River School displays of scenic mountains, valleys, and waterfalls, Heade's marsh landscapes avoided depictions of grandeur. They focused instead on the horizontal expanse of subdued scenery, and employed repeating motifs that included small haystacks and diminutive figures. Heade also concentrated on the depiction of light and atmosphere in his marsh scenes. These and similar works have led some historians to characterize Heade as a [[Luminism (American art style)|Luminist]] painter. In 1883 Heade moved to [[Saint Augustine, Florida]] and took as his primary landscape subject the surrounding subtropical marshland.

==Later life and still lifes==
[[File:Martin Johnson Heade Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth NGA.jpg|thumb|''[[Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth]]'', 1890]]

Heade married and moved to [[St. Augustine, Florida]] in 1883.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  He remained there and continued to paint until his death in 1904.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt; During his later years in St. Augustine, Heade painted numerous still lifes of southern flowers, especially [[magnolia]] blossoms laid on velvet. This was a continuation of an interest in still life that Heade had developed since the 1860s. His earlier works in this genre typically depict a display of flowers arranged in an ornate vase of small or medium size on a cloth-covered table. Heade was the only 19th-century American artist to create such an extensive body of work in both still life and [[landscape art|landscape]]. Heade died in St. Augustine in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1381&amp;type=a |author=National Gallery of Art |title=Martin Johnson Heade (American, 1819–1904) |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509140146/http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/tbio?tperson=1381 |archivedate=May 9, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heade and the Hudson River School==
Art historians have come to disagree with the common view that Heade is a [[Hudson River School]] painter, a view given wide currency by Heade's inclusion in a landmark exhibition of Hudson River School [[landscape art|landscape]]s at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1987.

[[File:MJ Heade Lake George, 1862.jpg|thumb|left|''Lake George'', 1862]]

The leading Heade scholar and author of Heade's [[catalogue raisonné]], [[Theodore Stebbins|Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr.]], wrote some years after the 1987 exhibition, "Other scholars—myself included—have increasingly come to doubt that Heade is most usefully seen as standing within that school."

According to the Heade catalogue raisonné, only around 40 percent of his paintings were landscapes. The remaining majority were still lifes, paintings of birds, and portraits, subjects unrelated to the Hudson River School. Of Heade's [[landscape art|landscape]]s, perhaps only 25 percent treated traditional Hudson River School subject matter.

Heade had less interest in topographically accurate views than the Hudson River painters, and instead focused on mood and the effects of light. Stebbins wrote, "If the paintings of the shore as well as the more conventional compositions...might lead one to think of Heade as a Hudson River School painter, the [marsh scenes] make it clear that he was not."&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book |author1=Stebbins Jr. |author2=Theodore E. | title=The Life and Work of Martin Johnson Heade: A Critical Analysis and Catalogue Raisonné| location=New Haven | publisher=Yale University Press| year=2000| isbn=0-300-08183-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and collections==
Heade was not a famous artist during his time, and for much of the first part of the 20th century was nearly forgotten.&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  A re-awakening of interest in 19th-century American art around [[World War II]] sparked new appreciation of his work. Heade's work in particular received critical attention with the exhibition in 1943 of his painting ''Thunderstorm Over Narragansett Bay'' (1868), as part of the show "Romantic Painting in America" at the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="Columbus Museum of Art p.12" /&gt;  Art historians have come to consider him as one of the most important American artists of his generation. His work has inspired contemporary artists such as [[David Bierk]] and [[Ian Hornak]].

His works are in most major American museums, including the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which owns the nation's most outstanding collection of his works, including about 30 paintings as well as numerous drawings and sketchbooks; the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In 1955, Robert McIntyre, art historian and director of the Macbeth Gallery, donated a cache of Heade's personal papers to the [[Archives of American Art]], part of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These papers included, among other things, Heade's sketchbook, notes, and letters from his friend and fellow artist [[Frederic Edwin Church]].  In 2007, these papers were digitized and made accessible on the Web as the [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collectionsonline/headmart/index.cfm Martin Johnson Heade Papers Online].

In 1999 and 2000, Heade was the subject of a major exhibition organized by Theodore E. Stebbins, Jr. It traveled from the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, ending at the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]].

In 2004, Heade was honored with a stamp from the [[U.S. Postal Service]] featuring his 1890 oil-on-canvas painting, "Giant Magnolias on a Blue Velvet Cloth."&lt;ref&gt;United States Postal Service Press Release, [http://www.usps.com/communications/news/stamps/2004/sr04_050.htm Art of Martin Johnson Heade is First-Class Choice for USPS Postage Stamp]. July 22, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; As Stebbins notes in his writings, Heade's work has also been copied and forged extensively. It should be noted, however, that since Heade was not popular during his lifetime, there were few contemporaries who emulated his work. 20th century copies are therefore readily apparent as fakes, since it takes oil paint decades to dry out and harden.

===Discoveries of works by Heade===
[[Theodore Stebbins, Jr.]], now curator of American art at the Harvard University Art Museums,
writes, "...one of the things that has always made the study of Heade's work exciting is the way his paintings continue to turn up in garage sales and other unlikely places all over the country, in a manner that the paintings of Frederic E. Church and [[John F. Kensett]] do not." Stebbins speculates the reason for this was Heade's popularity with middle-class buyers, and his willingness to distribute his works widely across the country. Among the more spectactular Heade discoveries are:
* ''Thunderstorm on Narragansett Bay'', now in the collection of the [[Amon Carter Museum|Amon Carter Museum of American Art]], Fort Worth, Texas, was originally discovered in an antiques store in Larchmont, New York, in 1943 by NYC art dealer Victor Spark.
*''Magnolia Blossoms on Blue Velvet'' and ''Cherokee Roses'', now in private collections, were purchased at an estate sale in Arizona for $60 in 1996. They sold at [[Christie's]] auction house later that year for $937,500 and $134,500 respectively.
*''Two Magnolias on Blue Plush'' was originally purchased for $29 at a rummage sale by a Wisconsin man in 1989. It sold at Christie's auction house in 1999 for $882,500. It is now in the collection of James W. McGlothlin of Bristol, Virginia.
*''Magnolias on Gold Velvet Cloth'' was used to cover a hole in the wall of an Indiana resident for years. The owner became curious about the value of the painting after playing an [[Masterpiece (game)|art-related board game]], and verified its authenticity with a New York art gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/06/04/arts/painting-packs-a-million-dollar-surprise.html|title=Painting Packs a Million-Dollar Surprise|last=Dobrzynski|first=Judith H. |date=4 June 1999|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum of Fine Arts in Houston purchased the work for $1,250,000 in 1999.
* An unnamed Heade salt marsh [[landscape art|landscape]] now titled "River Scene" was discovered in the attic of a Boston-area resident in 2003. It sold at a local auction house to an art dealer for $1,006,250 and was featured on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television show, "Find!". It was purchased by a private collector, and is now on view at the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
* In 2004 a Florida woman was informed of the Heade discovery featured on "Find!" by her son, and inquired about a small 6 by 12&amp;nbsp;inch landscape that had hung in her living room. The painting, which her late husband had purchased for several dollars in St. Augustine in the 1970s, was authenticated as a late Heade marsh landscape. It sold at auction to an art dealer for $218,500.
* A painting was found in a Massachusetts attic in 2006 and consigned to a local auction in Fall River.

'''Michał Paweł Gorstkin-Wywiórski''' (14 March 1861, [[Warsaw]] - 30 May 1926, [[Berlin]]) was a Polish painter; primarily of landscapes and maritime scenes. Because of this, he was also an amateur naturalist and maritime historian.

==Biography==
He was the son of a Russian army officer and his Polish wife.&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.pinakoteka.zascianek.pl/Wywiorski/Wywiorski_bio.htm Brief biography] @ Pinakoteka.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1881 to 1882, he studied chemistry at [[Riga Technical University]] and became a member of {{ill|Arkonia|pl|Arkonia (korporacja)}}, an "academic corporation" devoted to Polish patriotism. It was then that he began adding his mother's maiden name to Gorstkin. A sudden illness forced him to discontinue his studies and return home. 
[[File:M G Wywiórski Barka zaglowa.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sailboat (1918)]]
After a brief stay in Zurich for his health, he decided to study art instead. From 1883 to 1887, he studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Munich]] with [[Karl Raupp]] and [[Nikolaos Gyzis]]. He also took private lessons with [[Józef Brandt]] and [[Alfred Kowalski]].&lt;ref name="A"&gt;[http://www.agraart.pl/nowe/artists/wywiorski-michal-gorstkin-polska-agra-art-aukcje-obrazy-antyki.html Brief biography] @ Agra Art.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, his painting of a Lithuanian forest earned him a second-class medal at the [[Glaspalast (Munich)|Glaspalast]]. After 1895, he lived in Berlin for several years before returning to Poland. While there, at the invitation of [[Wojciech Kossak]] and [[Julian Fałat]], he participated in painting a [[Panorama#Paintings|panorama]] depicting the [[Battle of Berezina]]. This was followed by an invitation from [[Jan Styka]] to work on the [[Transylvania Panorama]].&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; 

After that, he devoted himself to travel, visiting (among many other places) Spain (1899-1900), Egypt (1900-1901), Scandinavia (1903-1904) and the [[Carpathians]] (1906). In Spain, he and Kossak gathered material for a panorama of the [[Battle of Somosierra]], which was never completed because of objections from the Russian authorities.&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; In Egypt, he made sketches for a panorama of the [[Battle of the Pyramids]].

At first, he painted [[Genre art|genre]] scenes dealing primarily with [[Cossacks]] and [[Tatars]].&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; Later, under the influence of the [[Young Poland]] movement, he shifted his interest to landscapes and marine art. He was a member of several art societies and professional groups in [[Poznań]], which was his primary home after 1904.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

The '''National Gallery of Ireland''' ({{lang-ga|Gailearaí Náisiúnta na hÉireann}}) houses the national collection of Irish and European art. It is located in the centre of [[Dublin]] with one entrance on [[Merrion Square]], beside [[Leinster House]], and another on Clare Street. It was founded in 1854 and opened its doors ten years later.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgallery.ie/history|title=History|website=National Gallery of Ireland|language=en|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gallery has an extensive, representative collection of Irish paintings and is also notable for its [[Baroque painting#Italian|Italian Baroque]] and [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch masters]] painting. The current director is Sean Rainbird.

== History ==
In 1853 an [[Exhibition game|exhibition]], the [[Great Industrial Exhibition (1853)|Great Industrial Exhibition]], was held on the lawns of [[Leinster House]] in Dublin. Among the most popular exhibits was a substantial display of works of art organised and underwritten by the railway magnate [[William Dargan]]. The enthusiasm of the visiting crowds demonstrated a public for art, and it was decided to establish a permanent public art collection as a lasting monument of gratitude to Dargan. The moving spirit behind the proposal was the [[barrister]] [[John Edward Pigot]] (1822-1871), son of [[David Richard Pigot]], [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]], and he became one of the first Governors of the Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Ireland Act 1854 section 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  The façade of the National Gallery copies the Natural History building of the [[National Museum of Ireland]] which was already planned for the facing flank of Leinster House. The building itself was designed by [[Francis Fowke]], based on early plans by [[Charles Lanyon]], and was completed and opened in 1864.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57429422|title=1854-2004 : the story of the National Gallery Of Ireland|last=Peter.|first=Somerville-Large,|date=2004|publisher=National Gallery Of Ireland|isbn=1904288081|location=[Dublin]|oclc=57429422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Gallery was not to founded around an existing collection, and when the Gallery opened it had just 112 paintings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1866 an annual purchase grant was established and by 1891 space was already limited.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 1897, the Dowager Countess of Milltown indicated her intention of donating the contents of [[Russborough House]] to the Gallery. This gift included about 223 paintings, 48 pieces of sculpture, 33 engravings, much silver, furniture and a library, and prompted construction from 1899 to 1903 of what is now called the Milltown Wing, designed by [[Thomas Newenham Deane]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/reading-the-pictures-1.126214|title=Reading the pictures|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around this time [[Henry Vaughan (art collector)|Henry Vaughan]] left 31 watercolours by [[J.M.W. Turner]] with the requirement that they could only be exhibited in January, this to protect them from the ill-effects of sunlight. Though modern lighting technology has made this stipulation unnecessary, the Gallery continues to restrict viewing of the Vaughan bequest to January and the exhibition is treated as something of an occasion.

Another substantial bequest came with the untimely death in the sinking of the {{RMS|Lusitania||2}} of [[Hugh Lane]] (1875–1915), since 1914 director of the Gallery; not only did he leave a large collection of pictures, he also left part of his residual estate and the Lane Fund has continued to contribute to the purchase of art works to this day. In addition to his involvement in the Gallery, Hugh Lane has also hoped to found a gallery of modern art, something only realised after his death in [[Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane]]. [[George Bernard Shaw]] also made a substantial bequest, leaving the Gallery a third of royalties of his estate in gratitude for the time he spent there as a youth.

The Gallery was again extended in 1962 with a new wing designed by Frank DuBerry of the [[Office of Public Works]]. This opened in 1968 and is now named the Beit Wing. In 1978 the Gallery received from the government the paintings given to the nation by [[Chester Beatty Library|Chester Beatty]] and in 1987 the Sweeney bequest brought fourteen works of art including paintings by [[Picasso]] and [[Jack B. Yeats]]. The same year the Gallery was once again given some of the contents of [[Russborough House]] when [[Alfred Lane Beit|Alfred Beit]] donated 17 masterpieces, including paintings by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], [[Jan Steen|Steen]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] and [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn]].

In the 1990s a lost [[Caravaggio]], ''[[The Taking of Christ]]'', known through replicas, was discovered hanging in a Jesuit house of studies in Leeson Street in Dublin by [[Sergio Benedetti]], senior conservator of the gallery.  The Jesuits have generously allowed this painting to be exhibited in the Gallery and the discovery was the cause of national excitement. The painting was on loan to an Italian gallery from February until July 2010 as part of Caravaggio's 400th anniversary. In 1997 [[Anne Yeats]] donated sketchbooks by her uncle [[Jack Yeats]] and the Gallery now includes a Yeats Museum. Denis Mahon, a well known art critic, promised the Gallery part of his rich collection and eight painting from his promised bequest are on permanent display, including ''Jacob Blessing the Sons of Joseph'' by [[Guercino]].

== Millennium Wing ==
A new wing, called the Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the previous two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson &amp; Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained. The Millennium Wing is not without its critics: it is unforgiving of poor maintenance and the compromise in the design as required by An Bord Pleanala resulted in a final design diluted from the original competition winning building concept. The circulation space also lacks clarity, but it is generally considered that these flaws are trivial details set against the drama of the building. In line with its Brutalist style, the interior concrete walls are still unsealed.

== Master Development Plan ==
[[File:20130810 dublin025.JPG|thumb|220px|View of interior, c.2013]]
In March 2011, the Office of Public Works (OPW), in association with the Gallery, commenced work on the historic complex at Merrion Square to address a critical need for the repair and renovation of the fabric Of the Dargan(1864) and Milltown(1903) wings, together with the provision of much needed additional accommodation. The first phase of the works programme involved the removal and replacement of the Dargan Wing roof. The next two phases of the project involved the replacement of the Milltown Wing roof, followed by an extensive upgrade of the fabric and services of the two buildings whilst reclaiming their original period elegance. Refurbishment of the two wings were completed in June 2017.

== Location, access and facilities ==
The National Gallery of Ireland is located in the heart of Georgian Dublin. There are two entrances, one at Merrion Square and the other at Clare Street. Admission to the gallery is free and many talks, tours and events as well as the audioguide are also free of charge. The gallery launched a free smartphone app in 2013.

[[Dublin Bus]] routes 4, 7 and 7a all pass by the gallery. The Pearse Street [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] station is 5 minutes on foot as is the Dawson stop on the green line of the [[LUAS]]. The Abbey Street stop of the red line of the [[LUAS]] is a 20-minute walk away. There are two [[dublinbikes]] stations just outside the gallery, one at Clare Street and the other at Merrion Square West.

All galleries and entrances are wheelchair and buggy accessible and there are disabled parking spaces outside the Merrion Square entrance. Tours for the visually and hearing impaired are regularly organised. Visitors with guide dogs are welcome in the gallery. The lecture theatre, AV room and gallery shop are all fitted with a loop system for the hearing impaired.

== Highlights ==
The collection has about 14,000 artworks, including about 2,500 oil paintings, 5,000 drawings, 5,000 prints, and some sculpture, furniture and other works of art.

The [https://www.nationalgallery.ie/what-we-do/library-and-archives library and archive collections] at the National Gallery of Ireland encompass unique and historically significant collections for the study of art history.  The origins of the collections can be traced back to the foundation of the institution over one hundred and sixty years ago. Covering the visual arts from the classical to the contemporary these collections continue to be a vital research element of the National Collection.  The development of the library and archive has been supported principally through public funding and the private donations of generous benefactors.

Open to the public, it has particularly rich holdings relating to the history of western European art from the middle ages on, and the collections relating to Irish and Italian art are extensive. The collection amounts to over 100,000 published volumes, in addition to significant archival holdings.

'''Nursing documentation''' is the record of [[Nursing|nursing care]] that is planned and delivered to individual [[Patient|clients]] by qualified nurses or other [[caregiver]]s under the direction of a qualified nurse.&lt;ref&gt;Urquhart C, Currell R, Grant MJ. Hardiker NR. Nursing record systems: Effects on nursing practice and healthcare outcomes. Cochrane Data- base of Systematic Reviews 2009; (1): 1–66.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; It contains information in accordance with the steps of the [[nursing process]]. Nursing documentation is the principal clinical information source to meet legal and professional requirements,&lt;ref&gt;Daskein R,Moyle W, Creedy D.Aged-care nurses' knowledge of nursing documentation: An Australian perspective. Journal of Clinical Nursing 2009; 18: 2087–2095.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most significant components in nursing care. Quality nursing documentation plays a vital role in the delivery of quality nursing care services through supporting better communication between different care team members to facilitate continuity of care and safety of the clients.

==Purposes==
* A [[Medical record|written record]] of the history, treatment, care, and response of the client while under the care of a health care provider.
* A guide for reimbursement of care costs.
* Evidence of care in a court of law. A legal record that can be used as evidence of events that occurred or treatments given.
* Show the use of the nursing process. It contains observations by the nurses about the client's condition, care, and treatment delivered.
* Provides data for quality assurance studies and shows progress toward expected outcomes.

== Documentation of the nursing process ==
{{See also|Nursing process}}

The internationally accepted nursing process consists of five steps: [[Nursing assessment|assessment]], nursing problem/diagnosis, goal, intervention and evaluation.&lt;ref&gt;Björvell C,Thorell-Ekstrand I.Wredling R.Development of an audit instrument for nursing care plans in the client record. Quality in Health Care 2000; 9: 6–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Nursing process model provides the theoretical framework for nursing documentation. A nurse can follow this model to assess the clinical situation of a client and record a constructive document for nursing communication.

==Content==
Nursing documentation mainly consists of a client's background information or nursing history referred as admission form, numerous [[Assessment for Effective Intervention|assessment forms]], nursing care plan and progress notes. These documents record the client's data captured at the relevant stages of the [[nursing process]].&lt;ref&gt;Blair, W., &amp; Smith, B. (n.d). Nursing documentation: Frameworks and barriers. Contemporary Nurse, 41(2), 160-168.&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections describe the concept, aim, possible structure and content of these nursing documents using the example of nursing documentation in Australian residential [[aged care]] homes.

=== Admission ===
An [[admission note|admission form]] is a fundamental record in nursing documentation. It documents a client's status, reasons why the client is being admitted, and the initial instructions for that client's care.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;"General Info". Archived from the original on 12 March 2009. Retrieved 2009-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; The form is completed by a nurse when a client is admitted to a [[Health facility|health care facility]].

The admission form provides the basic information to establish foundations for further nursing assessment. It usually contains the general data about a client, such as name, gender, age, birth date, address, contact, identification information (ID) and some situational descriptions about marriage, work or other background information. Based on the different nursing care provider's requirements, this form may also record [[Family history (medicine)|family history]], [[past medical history]], [[History of the present illness|history of present illness]], and allergies (see Figure 1).
[[File:Figure 1. A sample admission.png|thumb|Figure 1. A sample admission form for an Australian residential aged care home.]]

=== Assessment ===
The documentation of nursing assessment is the recording of the process about how a judgment was made and its related factors, in addition to the result of the judgment. It makes the process of nursing assessment visible through what is presented in the documentation content.&lt;ref&gt;Oroviogoicoechea C., Elliott B. &amp; Watson S. (2008) Review: evaluating information systems in nursing. Journal of Clinical Nursing 17, 567–575.&lt;/ref&gt;

During nursing assessment, a nurse systematically collects, verifies, analyses and communicates a health care client's information to derive a nursing diagnosis and plan individualized nursing care for the client.&lt;ref&gt;Crisp J., Taylor C., Potter PA. &amp; Perry A.G. (2005) POTTER and PERRY'S fundamentals of nursing (2nd ed). Elsevier Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Complete and accurate nursing assessment determines the accuracy of the other stages of the nursing process.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"&gt;White L. (2002) Documentation and the Nursing Process. Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY&lt;/ref&gt;

The nursing documents may contain a number of assessment forms. In an assessment form, a licensed [[Registered nurse|Registered Nurse]] records the client's information, such as physiological, psychological, sociological, and spiritual status (see Figure 2). The accuracy and completeness of nursing assessment determine the accuracy of care planning in the nursing process.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;L. White, Documentation and the Nursing Process, Delmar Learning, Clifton Park, NY, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 2-1. A sample nursing assessment form for an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 2-1. A sample nursing assessment form for an Australian residential aged care home.]]

=== Nursing care plan ===
The [[nursing care plan]] (NCP) is a clinical document recording the nursing process, which is a systematic method of planning and providing care to clients.&lt;ref name="White L. 2002"/&gt; It was originally developed in hospitals to guide nursing students or junior nurses in providing care to client; however, the format was task-oriented rather than nursing-process-based.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood D. (1996) Nursing care plans: issues and solutions. Nursing Management 27(3), 33-40.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, the NCP is widely used in nursing in various clinical and educational settings as a tool to direct individualized nursing care for clients.&lt;ref&gt;Neilson T., Peet M., Ledsham R. &amp; Poole J. (1996) Does the nursing care plan help in the management of psychiatric risk? Journal of Advanced Nursing 24,1201-1206

The nurses make nursing care plans based on the assessments they have completed previously with a client. There are many ways of structuring nursing care plans in correspondence with the different needs of nursing care in different nursing specialties. For example, a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home may be structured with several sections under each care domain such as pain, mobility, lifestyle, nutrition and continence. The information is recorded in free-text style, and various terms are used singly or in combination to name each of the four sections in the formats that are used by a facility during a particular period (Figure 3).

=== Progress notes ===
A [[progress note]] is the record of nursing actions and observations in the nursing care process.&lt;ref&gt;"UW Internal Medicine Residency Program". Retrieved 2009-04-10&lt;/ref&gt; It helps nurses to monitor and control the course of nursing care.
[[File:Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-1. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home.]]
Generally, nurses record information with a common format. Nurses are likely to record details about a&amp;nbsp;client's clinical status or achievements during the course of the nursing care.
[[File:Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 4. A sample progress note in an Australian residential aged care home.]]

== Recording format ==

=== Paper-based nursing documentation ===
The paper-based nursing documentation has been in place for decades. Client's data are recorded in paper documents. The information in these documents needs to be integrated for sense-making in a nursing decision.

=== Electronic nursing documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation is an electronic format of nursing documentation an increasingly used by nurses. [[Electronic health record|Electronic nursing documentation systems]] have been implemented in health care organizations to bring in the benefits of increasing access to more complete, accurate and up-to-date data and reducing redundancy, improving communication and care service delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang Y, Yu P, Shen J. The benefits of introducing electronic health records in residential aged care facilities:A multiple case study. Interna- tional Journal of Medical Informatics 2012; 81: 690–704.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comparison of the quality of paper-based and electronic documentation ===
Electronic nursing documentation systems are able to produce somewhat better quality data in comparison with paper-based systems, in certain respects depending on the characteristics of the systems and the practice of the various study settings. The common benefits of electronic documentation systems include the improvement of comprehensiveness in documenting the nursing process, the use of standardized language and the recording of specific items about particular client issues and relevance of the message. In addition, electronic systems can improve legibility, dating and signing in nursing records.

For the documentation of nursing assessment, the electronic systems significantly increased the quantity and comprehensiveness of documented assessment forms in each record. In regard to the NCP, the electronic standardized NCPs were graded with a higher total quality score than its paper-based counterpart. In addition, in comparison with the paper-based documentation systems, the electronic systems, due to their automatic functions, were able to improve the format, structure and process features of documentation quality such as legibility, signing, dating, crossing out error and space with a single line and resident identification on every page.

Paper-based documentation has been found to be inferior in comparison with electronic documentation. This is caused by the inherent nature of paper being difficult to update, time-consuming in a recording. Thus, the records are often incomplete, illegible, repetitive and missing signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Ammenwerth E,Eichstadter R,Haux R et al.A randomized evaluation of a computer-based nursing documentation system. Method Inform Med 2001; 40: 61–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home..png|thumb|Figure 3-2. An example of a nursing care plan in an Australian residential aged care home]]
Electronic nursing documentation systems have the potential to improve the quality of documentation structure and format, process and content in comparison with paper-based documentation, as demonstrated in a comparative study of electronic and paper-based nursing admission forms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;&amp;nbsp;Wang, N., Yu, P., &amp; Hailey, D. (2012). Description and comparison of quality of electronic versus paper-based resident admission forms in Australian aged care facilities. International Journal of Medical Informatics, doi:10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2012.11.011&lt;/ref&gt; However, improvement in documentation quality is not necessarily to be brought about by the introduction of electronic nursing documentation system to replace paper-based documentation. For example, Wang et al.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; that although the electronic nursing assessment form contained more documented assessment forms, which covered a wider range of resident care needs, they did not perform better than the previous [null paper-based assessment forms according to] the quality criteria of [null completeness] and timeliness. Therefore, further work on the usage of the electronic documentation systems may focus on improving form design and usage. There is also a need for improvement in compliance with standards in order to better meet the clients' care needs.

== Quality of nursing documentation ==

A study by the National Client Safety Agency (NPSA)&lt;ref&gt;National Clients Safety Agency (2007) Recognising and responding appropriately to early signs of deterioration in hospital clients. NPSA, London. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://tinyurl.com/yk8ao5x&lt;/nowiki&gt; (Accessed 20 November 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; found that poor standards of documentation were a contributory factor in the failure to detect clients who were clinically deteriorating. Nurses are responsible for maintaining accurate records of the care they provide and are accountable if information is incomplete and inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Owen K (2005) Documentation in nursing practice. Nurs Stand 19(32): 48–9&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a quality standard is required for recording of nursing documentation.

The systematic review of nursing documentation audit studies in different settings&lt;ref&gt;Wang N, Hailey D, Yu P. Quality of nursing documentation and approaches to its evaluation: A mixed-method systematic review.Journal of Advanced Nursing 2011; 67: 1858–1875.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the following relevant quality characteristics of nursing documentation:

* Quality of documentation structure and format: relates to constructive features and physical presentation of records such as quantity, completeness, legibility, read- ability, redundancy and the use of abbreviations. 
* Quality of documentation process: the procedural issues of capturing client data such as nurse's signature and designation, date, chronological order, timeliness, regularity of documentation and concordance between documentation and reality. 
* Quality of documentation content: refers to the message from data about a care process. It is concerned with the comprehensiveness, appropriateness and the relation- ship of the five steps of the nursing process. The care issue recorded at each step is also considered.

== Standardized nursing terminology ==
[[NANDA|North American&amp;nbsp;Nursing Diagnosis&amp;nbsp;Association (NANDA)]] nursing diagnosis:

NANDA International (formerly the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association) is a professional organization of nurses standardized nursing terminology that was officially founded in 1982 and develops, researches, disseminates and refines the nomenclature, criteria, and taxonomy of nursing diagnoses.

[[Nursing Interventions Classification|Nursing intervention classification (NIC)]]:

The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) is a care classification system which describes the activities that nurses perform as a part of the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.

[[Nursing Outcomes Classification|Nursing outcome classification (NOC)]]:

The Nursing Outcomes Classification (NOC) is a classification system which describes client outcomes sensitive to nursing intervention.

The [[Omaha&amp;nbsp;System]]:

The Omaha System is a standardized health care terminology consisting of an assessment component (Problem Classification Scheme), a care plan/services component (Intervention Scheme), and an evaluation component (Problem Rating Scale for Outcomes).

International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP):

The International Classification for Nursing Practice (ICNP) is a collaborative project under the auspices of the International Council of Nurses. The ICNP provides a structured and defined vocabulary as well as a classification for nursing and a framework into which existing vocabularies and classifications can be cross-mapped to enable comparison of nursing data.&lt;ref&gt;Wake, M., &amp; Coenen, A. (1998). Nursing diagnosis in the international classification for nursing practice (icnp).&amp;nbsp;''International Journal of Nursing Knowledge,''&amp;nbsp;''5''(4), 335.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structured documentation ==
Structured documentation takes the form of pre-printed guidelines for specific aspects of care and can, therefore, focus nursing care upon diagnoses, treatment aims, client outcomes and evaluations of care.&lt;ref&gt;Dahm M, Wadensten B (2008) Nurses' experiences of and opinions about using standardised care plans in electronic health records; a questionnaire study. J Clin Nurs 17(16): 2137–45&lt;/ref&gt; It can improve client care by replacing the practice of vague, narrative style entries by nurses with cohesive and accurate information determined by the format of the care plan.&lt;ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Irvine K, Tracey M, Scott A, Hyde A, Butler M, MacNeela P (2006) Discursive practices in the documentation of client assessments. Journal of Advanced Nursing 53(2): 151–9&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; The clarity of the recorded information also facilitates clinical auditing and evaluation of documentation practices through.&lt;ref&gt;Saranto K, Kinnunen U (2009) Evaluating nursing documentation-research designs and methods: systematic review. J Adv Nurs 65(3): 464–76&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the introduction of structured documentation and care plans are seen as a means by which nurses can raise standards of record-keeping practice.&lt;ref&gt;Law L, Akroyd K, Burke L (2010) Improving nursing documentation and record-keeping in stoma care. Br J Nurs 19(21): 1328–32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ophelia''''' is a painting by British artist Sir [[John Everett Millais]], completed in 1851 and 1852 and in the collection of [[Tate Britain]] in London. It depicts [[Ophelia]], a character from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', singing before she drowns in a river in Denmark.

The work encountered a mixed response when first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], but has since come to be admired as one of the most important works of the mid-nineteenth century for its beauty, its accurate depiction of a natural landscape, and its influence on artists from [[John William Waterhouse]] and [[Salvador Dalí]] to [[Peter Blake (artist)]] and [[Ed Ruscha]].

==Theme and elements==
The painting depicts Ophelia singing while floating in a river just before she drowns. The scene is described in Act IV, Scene VII of ''Hamlet'' in a speech by [[Gertrude (Hamlet)|Queen Gertrude]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cazbo.co.uk/ThePainting/Aboutthepainting/AboutthePainting.htm Millais Ophelia: Behind the painting]". Retrieved on 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Photograph of John Everett Millais by Charles Dodgson.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[John Everett Millais]] in 1865, by [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|Charles Dodgson]] (Lewis Carroll)]]

The episode depicted is not usually seen onstage, as in Shakespeare's text it exists only in Gertrude's description. Out of her mind with grief, Ophelia has been making garlands of wildflowers. She climbs into a willow tree overhanging a brook to dangle some from its branches, and a bough breaks beneath her. She lies in the water singing songs, as if unaware of her danger ("incapable of her own distress"). Her clothes, trapping air, have allowed her to temporarily stay afloat ("Her clothes spread wide, / And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up."). But eventually, "her garments, heavy with their drink, / Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay" down "to muddy death".

Ophelia's death has been praised as one of the most poetically written death scenes in literature.&lt;ref&gt;For one example of praise see ''The Works of Shakespeare'', in 11 volumes (''Hamlet'' in volume 10), edited by Henry N. Hudson, published by James Munroe and Company, 1856: “This exquisite passage is deservedly celebrated. Nothing could better illustrate the Poet's power to make the description of a thing better than the thing itself, by giving us his eyes to see it with.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Ophelia's pose—her open arms and upwards gaze—also resembles traditional portrayals of saints or martyrs, but has also been interpreted as erotic.

The painting is known for its depiction of the detailed [[flora]] of the river and the riverbank, stressing the patterns of growth and decay in a natural [[ecosystem]]. Despite its nominal Danish setting, the landscape has come to be seen as [[quintessentially English]]. ''Ophelia'' was painted along the banks of the [[Hogsmill]] River in [[Surrey]], near [[Tolworth]], Greater London. Barbara Webb, a resident of nearby [[Old Malden]], devoted much time to finding the exact placement of the picture, and according to her research, the scene is located at Six Acre Meadow, alongside Church Road, Old Malden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Webb|first=Barbara C.L.|title=Millais and the Hogsmill River|location=[England]|publisher=B. Webb|year=1997|isbn=0-9530074-0-5}} For a description of Webb's findings, see {{citation|title=Millais and the Hogsmill River|url=http://www.ewell-probus.org.uk/archive/Millias%20and%20the%20Hogsmill%20River.htm|publisher=[[Probus Clubs|Probus Club]] of [[Ewell]]|accessdate=11 October 2007}}.

The flowers shown floating on the river were chosen to correspond with Shakespeare's description of Ophelia's garland. They also reflect the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] interest in the "[[language of flowers]]", according to which each flower carries a symbolic meaning. The prominent red [[Poppy (flower)|poppy]]—not mentioned by Shakespeare's description of the scene—represents sleep and death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-ophelia-n01506/text-summary Millais's ''Ophelia'']. Tate Gallery Online. Retrieved on 16 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an early stage in the painting's creation, Millais painted a [[European water vole|water vole]]—which an assistant had fished out of the Hogsmill—paddling next to Ophelia. In December 1851, he showed the unfinished painting to Holman Hunt's relatives. He recorded in his diary, "Hunt's uncle and aunt came, both of whom understood most gratifyingly every object except my water rat. The male relation, when invited to guess at it, eagerly pronounced it to be a [[hare]]. Perceiving by our smiles that he had made a mistake, a rabbit was then hazarded. After which I have a faint recollection of a dog or a cat being mentioned." Millais painted the water vole out of the final picture, although a rough sketch of it still exists in an upper corner of the canvas hidden by its frame.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

In keeping with the tenets of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], of which he was a member, Millais used bright colours, gave high attention to detail and faithful truth to nature.  This rendition of Ophelia is the epitome of the PRB style; first, because of the subject matter, depicting a woman who has lived a life awaiting happiness, only to find her destiny on the verge of death: the vulnerable woman is a popular subject among Pre-Raphaelite artists. Also, Millais utilizes bright, intense colours in the landscape to make the pale Ophelia contrast with the nature behind her. All this is evident in the vivid attention to detail in the brush and trees around Ophelia, the contouring of her face, and the intricate work Millais did on her dress.

==Painting process==
[[File:Siddal-self-portrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|An 1854 self-portrait by [[Elizabeth Siddal]], who acted as Millais' model for Ophelia.&lt;ref&gt;Elkan, Jenny. "[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=494&amp;tabview=bio Elizabeth Eleanor Siddal]". Tate Gallery. Retrieved on 16 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Millais produced ''Ophelia'' in two separate stages: He first painted the landscape, and secondly the figure of Ophelia. Having found a suitable setting for the picture, Millais remained on the banks of the [[Hogsmill River]] in [[Ewell]]—within a literal stone's throw of where fellow Pre-Raphaelite [[William Holman Hunt]] painted ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]''—for up to 11 hours a day, six days a week, over a five-month period in 1851.

This allowed him to accurately depict the natural scene before him. Millais encountered various difficulties during the painting process. He wrote in a letter to a friend, "The flies of Surrey are more muscular, and have a still greater propensity for probing human flesh. I am threatened with a notice to appear before a magistrate for trespassing in a field and destroying the hay&amp;nbsp;... and am also in danger of being blown by the wind into the water. Certainly the painting of a picture under such circumstances would be greater punishment to a murderer than hanging." By November 1851, the weather had turned windy and snowy. Millais oversaw the building of a hut "made of four hurdles,&lt;ref&gt;A ''hurdle'' is "a portable panel usually of wattled withes and stakes used especially for enclosing land or livestock": {{citation|title=[Definition of "hurdle"]|url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/hurdle|publisher=Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary|accessdate=11 October 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; like a sentry-box, covered outside with straw". According to Millais, sitting inside the hut made him feel like [[Robinson Crusoe]]. William Holman Hunt was so impressed by the hut that he had an identical one built for himself.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Ophelia was modelled by artist and muse [[Elizabeth Siddal]], then 19 years old. Millais had Siddal lie fully clothed in a full bathtub in his studio at 7 [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;A [[blue plaque]] identifies the building as the place where "The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in 1848".&lt;/ref&gt; As it was now winter, he placed oil lamps under the tub to warm the water, but was so intent on his work that he allowed them to go out. As a result, Siddal caught a severe cold, and her father later sent Millais a letter demanding £50 for medical expenses.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; According to Millais' son, he eventually accepted a lower sum.&lt;ref&gt;J.G. Millais, ''Life and Letters of John Everett Millais'', vol 1, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
When ''Ophelia'' was first publicly exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1852, it was not universally acclaimed. A critic in ''[[The Times]]'' wrote that "there must be something strangely perverse in an imagination which souses Ophelia in a weedy ditch, and robs the drowning struggle of that lovelorn maiden of all pathos and beauty",&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 1 May 1852; pg. 8; Issue 21104: Exhibition of the Royal Academy -(Private View)&lt;/ref&gt; while a further review in the same newspaper said that "Mr. Millais's Ophelia in her pool ... makes us think of a dairymaid in a frolic".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Even the great art critic [[John Ruskin]], an avid supporter of Millais, while finding the technique of the painting "exquisite", expressed doubts about the decision to set it in a Surrey landscape and asked, "Why the mischief should you not paint pure nature, and not that rascally wirefenced garden-rolled-nursery-maid's paradise?"&lt;ref&gt;James, William (ed.) "The Order of Release: The Story of John Ruskin, Effie Gray and John Everett Millais". New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1947, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, [[Salvador Dalí|Salvador Dali]] wrote glowingly in an article published in a 1936 edition of the French [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] journal ''[[Minotaure]]'' about the artistic movement that inspired the painting. "How could Salvador Dalí fail to be dazzled by the flagrant surrealism of [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|English Pre-Raphaelitism]]. The Pre-Raphaelite painters bring us radiant women who are, at the same time, the most desirable and most frightening that exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dali|first=Salvador|date=June 15, 1936|title=The Spectral Surrealism of the Pre-Raphaelite Eternal Feminine|url=|journal=Minotaure|volume=8|pages=46-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later went on to re-interpret Millais' painting in a 1973 work entitled ''Ophelia's Death.'' 

In 1906, Japanese novelist [[Natsume Sōseki]] called the painting "a thing of considerable beauty" in one of his novels; since then, the painting has been highly popular in Japan. It was exhibited in Tokyo in 1998 and travelled there again in 2008.

}}
The painting has been widely referred to and pastiched in art, film. and photography, notably in [[Laurence Olivier]]'s ''[[Hamlet (1948 film)|Hamlet]]'' where it formed the basis for the portrayal of Ophelia's death. A scene in [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' was modeled on the painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/wes-craven-last-house-left-anniversary-obit/|title=''Last House on the Left'' 43 years later|last=Witzke|first=Sean|date=|website=Grantland|publisher=|access-date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the video for [[Nick Cave]]'s song "[[Where the Wild Roses Grow]]" depicts [[Kylie Minogue]] mimicking the pose of the image.&lt;ref&gt;Radenburg, Katja, ''Ik Ophelia'', Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork is also referenced in ''[[Fire_with_Fire_(1986_film)|Fire With Fire]]'', a 1986 film in which a schoolgirl is replicating the central image as the protagonists meet.  The imagery of the painting is evoked in the prologue of [[Lars von Trier]]'s ''[[Melancholia (2011 film)|Melancholia]]'', where [[Kirsten Dunst]]'s character Justine floats in a slow-moving stream. [[Christian Death]] has used this art as a cover of its 1984 [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[The Wind Kissed Pictures]]''. In the 2009 video game [[Brutal Legend]], one of the protagonists (and later antagonists) is a young woman named Ophelia who seeks vengeance on the player character Eddie Riggs after drowning in the Sea of Black Tears.

==Provenance and valuation==
''Ophelia'' was purchased from Millais on 10 December 1851 by the art dealer Henry Farrer for 300 [[guinea (British coin)|guineas]]. Farrer sold the painting to B.G. Windus, an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite art, who sold it on in 1862 for 748 guineas. The painting is held at [[Tate Britain]], London, and is valued by experts as worth at least £30 million.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[File:Meister der Pietà von Avignon 004.jpg|thumb|[[Enguerrand Quarton]]. ''Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon''. Oil on wood, 163cm x 219cm. [[Musée du Louvre]]]]

'''''Pietà of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon''''' is an oil painting of the mid-15th century that is considered one of the outstanding works of art of the late [[Middle Ages]]. Following its appearance at an exhibition in 1904 its authorship was disputed, though it has since been accepted as the work of [[Enguerrand Quarton]]. It is now in the [[Musée du Louvre]].

The [[Pietà]], where the dead Christ is supported by his grieving mother, is a common theme of late-medieval religious art, but this is one of the most striking depictions, "perhaps the greatest masterpiece produced in France in the 15th century" ([[Edward Lucie-Smith]]).&lt;ref&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. ''A Concise History of French Painting'', p. 26, Thames &amp; Hudson, London, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinctive from previous depictions of the subject—which were often characterized by overt displays of grief and trauma—by virtue of its restraint. The composition is stable, with the Virgin's hands together in prayer, rather than clutching the body of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2847602 Denny, Don. Notes on the Avignon Pieta, ''Speculum'', Medieval Academy of America, 1969.]&lt;/ref&gt; The curved back form of Christ's body is highly original, and the stark, motionless dignity of the other figures is very different from Italian or Netherlandish depictions. The style of the painting is unique for its time: the grouping of the figures appears somewhat primitive, yet the conception evidences both great breadth and delicacy, the latter quality especially evident in the specificity of the portraits and the elegant gesture of St. John's hands at Christ's head.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}

The bare background landscape falls away to a horizon broken by the buildings of [[Jerusalem]], but instead of a sky there is plain gold leaf with stamped and incised [[halo (religious iconography)|haloes]], borders and inscriptions. The [[donor portrait|clerical donor]], portrayed with Netherlandish realism, kneels to the left.  The painting came from [[Villeneuve-lès-Avignon]], just across the [[Rhône River|Rhône]] from [[Avignon]], and is sometimes known as the "Villeneuve Pietà".
It can also be suggested that the buildings depicted on the left background are an imaginary representation of [[Istanbul]] and the church of [[Hagia Sophia]]. The city had fallen to the [[Ottomans]] in 1453, a few years before the estimated creation of the painting and the main subject (Pieta) can be considered as a lament to the fall of the eastern part of Christendom.

Before its widely accepted attribution to Quarton, some art historians thought the painting might be by a Catalan or Portuguese master; it was, according to art historian [[Lawrence Gowing]], "the subject of dispute among protagonists of every school along the seaboard between Lisbon and Messina."{{sfn|Gowing|1987|p=72}} Quarton, known to be working in Avignon by 1447, painted two pictures there in the early 1450s which bear comparison to this painting.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}

For Gowing,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The agony of the picture is suffered with a rare restraint. No demonstrative expression could match the tragedy of this body, distended as if dreaming. We are in the presence of the simplicity of sorrow. Against the bare skyline, in the gray-gold of the medieval twilight, the scene seems inexpressibly grand.{{sfn|Gowing|1987}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[drama]], a '''scene'''  is a unit of action, often a subdivision of an [[Act (drama)|act]]. 

==French scene==
A "French scene" is a scene in which the beginning and end are marked by a change in the presence of characters onstage, rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George, Kathleen (1994) ''Playwriting: The First Workshop'', Focal Press, {{ISBN|978-0-240-80190-2}}, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Obligatory scene==
From the French ''scène à faire'', an obligatory scene is a scene (usually highly charged with emotion) which is anticipated by the audience and provided by an obliging playwright. An example is ''[[Hamlet]]'' 3.4, when Hamlet confronts his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J. A.|authorlink=J. A. Cuddon|editor=C. E.

The '''Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy School of Art''' ('''Sir J.J. School of Art''') is the oldest art institution in [[Mumbai]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2002-10-06/mumbai/27317318_1_sir-jj-school-friends-students Mumbai’s oldest and most prestigious art institution, the Sir JJ School of Art.] ''[[Times of India]]'', 6 October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and is affiliated with the [[University of Mumbai]]. The school grants bachelor's degrees in [[fine art]] and [[sculpture]], and [[Master's degree]]s in fine art.

==History==

===Early history===
[[File:Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy.png|thumb|[[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]] and his Chinese secretary (1783–1859) portrait at the Sir J. J. School of Art]]

The School was founded in March 1857, named after [[Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy]], a businessman and philanthropist, who donated Rs. 100,000 for its endowment. Operations were managed by a committee headed by the Chief Justice of Bombay. The School's first class was in drawing, and began on 2 March 1857. Classes were held at the [[Elphinstone Institution]]. [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] became Principal of the School in 1865. He later became famous for copying the murals in the [[Ajanta Caves]] temple complex, a project which lasted from 1872 to 1891, and which the School's students assisted in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=224832 Art heritage, saved by sunshine law]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''[[Indian Express]]'', 2 March 2007. "...when the Public Works Department took up repainting of the building, the paintings had been shifted to the terrace and may have been washed out after the 26/7 deluge two years ago.(2005)"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, management of the school was taken over by the Government of India. Also in 1866, [[John Lockwood Kipling|Lockwood Kipling]], who had become a professor of the School in 1865, established three ''[[Wikt:atelier|ateliers]]'' for (i) Decorative Paintings, (ii) Modelling; and (iii) Ornamental Wrought Iron Work, and became its first dean. He was the father of the author [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was born on the School's campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation Kipling house to become museum] ''[[Times of India]]', Oct 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, the school moved to its own building, where it is currently situated. The building was designed by architect George Twigge Molecey,&lt;ref name=bre&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-11-07/mumbai/27946139_1_stone-walls-restoration-heritage-buildings After years, Sir JJ School of Art begins to BREATHE] ''[[Times of India]]'', Nov 7, 2008. "Kipling House (Dean's Bungalow)The original cottage was brought down in the early 1900s and a new house built on the same spot."&lt;/ref&gt; in  [[neo Gothic]] architecture.&lt;ref name=tt&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-03-03/mumbai/27877604_1_art-world-bronze-bust-clay Celebrating 150 years] ''[[Times of India]]', 3 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The School campus, including the Kipling House, better known as the Dean's Bungalow, is classified as Grade II heritage structure by the Government of Maharashtra, and underwent a restoration in 2002-2006, and again in 2008.&lt;ref name=bre/&gt;

Drawing instruction as a subject was introduced in 1879 and a programme for training drawing teachers was started in 1893. In 1891 the Lord Reay Art Workshops (now known as the Department of Art-Crafts) were established.

===1900s===
The School had an important tradition in [[architecture]]. In 1900. the School offered its first course in architecture, taught by [[John Begg]], later Consulting Architect of Bombay and of the Government of India. A complete 4-year programme was established in 1908 under Begg's assistant [[George Wittet]]. In 1917, architect [[Claude Batley]] became a visiting professor; he was Principal of the School from 1923 to 1943, and is commemorated in the Claude Batley Architectural Gallery for architectural exhibitions, opened in 1996.

In 1896, the Draughtsman's classes, the nucleus of the Department of Architecture, were added. This Department was later organised for a 3 years Diploma Course which was duly recognised by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|R.I.B.A. Board]].

In 1910, the [[George Clarke, 1st Baron Sydenham of Combe|Sir George Clarke]] Studies and Laboratories were built for the advanced study of crafts, pottery being the first craft taken up for study. In 1929, the head of the School was renamed "Director", and in 1935, the Department of Commercial Art was also started.

In 1937 [[M.R. Acharekar]] was appointed deputy director and continued his tenure till 1939. Shri. V. S. Adurkar was the first Indian head of the school, succeeding [[Claude Batley]] as Director in 1943.

===Post-independence===
In 1958, the school was divided, with the Departments of Architecture and Applied Art becoming the [[Sir J. J. College of Architecture]] and [[Sir J.J. Institute of Applied Art]] respectively.

In 1981, the School became affiliated with the [[University of Mumbai]].

Meunier, Dubois (holding copies of ''L'Art libre'' and '' L'Art Universel''); standing, Lambrichs, Artan, Rops, Raeymaeckers, J.B. Meunier, Smits, Baron, De la Charlerie]]

The '''Société Libre des Beaux-Arts''' ("Free Society of Fine Arts") was an organization formed in 1868 by Belgian artists to react against [[Academic art|academicism]] and to advance [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] painting and artistic freedom. Based in [[Brussels]], the society was active until 1876, by which time the aesthetic values it espoused had infiltrated the official Salon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/01_HISTORIEK/02_HISTORIEK.cfm?VER=85 Arto: Aperçus historiques] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217222929/http://www.arto.be/CONTENT/FR/01_HISTORIEK/02_HISTORIEK.cfm?VER=85 |date=2009-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It played a formative role in establishing [[avant-gardism]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Kaplan, entry on "Société Libre des Beaux-Arts," in ''The Grove Dictionary of Art. From Renaissance to Impressionism: Styles and Movements in Western Art, 1400–1900'' (St. Martin's Press, 2000), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition of the Free Society was held in 1868&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; to provide an alternative art space beyond the Salon. Three exhibitions were held in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The society's [[manifesto]] was written by {{Interlanguage link multi|Camille van Camp|nl}} and published 31 January 1869. It promoted the "free and individual interpretation of nature" characteristic of Realist art, along with avant-garde concepts such as "struggle, change, freedom, progress, originality and tolerance."&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

The society published the periodicals ''L'Art Libre'', a bi-monthly review (1871–72), and ''L'Art Universel'' (1873–76). In the first issue of ''L'Art Libre'', they collectively asserted:

{{cquote|Artistic independence must be spawned by force. It is our desire that art be free. The art of our time must return to man and nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Avec force l'indépendance artistique doit éclore. Nous voulons que l'art soit libre. L'art de notre époque doit retourner à l'homme et la nature.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The goals of the Free Society were influenced by aesthetic ideals set forth by [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school|Barbizon artists]] and by the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]. "Modernity" and "sincerity" were keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; Official cultural critics were at first openly hostile. Two early champions, however, were the critics [[Camille Lemonnier]], a member, who urged that they should "be of their own time," and Théo Hannon (1851-1916), who saw them as rebels against artificiality.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

A group portrait by society member Edmond Lambrichs shows the 16 artists of the original organizing committee.&lt;ref&gt;''Grove'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; The society attracted in particular landscape painters working at the [[Atelier (art)|Atelier]] Saint-Luc of Brussels, also known as the Académie de Saint-Luc (''ca.'' 1846–1864).&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Dubois (painter)|Louis Dubois]], [[Félicien Rops]], [[Constantin Meunier]] and [[Louis Artan de Saint-Martin]] are considered leading members.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Robert-Jones, ''The history of Painting in Belgium'' (Renaissance du Livre, 1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the society's members had also belonged to the Artistic and Literary Circle of Brussels and the Royal Belgian Society of Watercolorists.&lt;ref&gt;''Cercle artistique et littéraire de Bruxelles'' and ''Société royale belge des Aquarellistes.''&lt;/ref&gt; After the society dissolved, several members joined groups such as ''La Chrysalide'' and ''[[Les XX]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Arto: Aperçus historiques.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spring Ice''''' is a 1915–16 [[oil painting]] by Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]]. The work was inspired by a sketch completed on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]] in [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]]. The completed canvas is large, measuring 72.0 × 102.3 cm (28⅜ × 40¼ in). Painted over the winter of 1915–16, it was completed in Thomson's shack behind the [[Studio Building (Toronto)|Studio Building]] in [[Toronto]]. The painting was produced as he was in the peak of his short art career and is considered one of his most notable works. While exhibited in a show put on by the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], the work received mixed to positive reviews. In 1916 it was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] and has remained in the collection ever since.

In the spring of 1915 Thomson returned to [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]] earlier than he had in any previous year.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} In a letter to [[James MacCallum]], he reported that he had already painted twenty-eight sketches by 22 April.{{sfnb|Thomson|1915}}{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} He became fascinated with the "opening of the waters" as the ice on the lakes began to melt. This ice is apparent in the sketch ''River'', which was likely painted early in the season and preceding ''Spring Ice''. The close of the day is indicated by the turquoise, yellow and lavender sky.{{sfnb|Murray|2004|p=112}}

The year overall was particularly productive for Thomson, himself reporting that he had painted 128 sketches by September. He began to more consistently use hard wood-pulp board for sketching, something he picked up from [[J. E. H. MacDonald]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}} From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes. He spent much of his summer travelling across the province, hunting and sketching.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=131}} From the end of September to mid-October, Thomson spent his time at Mowat,{{sfnb|Little|1955|p=205}} a village on the north end of Canoe Lake.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=102}} By November he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb.{{sfnb|Ghent|1949}}{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=46}} In late November Thomson returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him,{{sfnb|Addison|Harwood|1969|p=84}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=179}} renting it for $1 a month ({{Inflation|CA|1|1915|fmt=eq|r=0|cursign=CAD$}}).{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=13}}{{efn|group=note|In his 1959 piece, "My Memories of Tom Thomson," [[Thoreau MacDonald]] (son of [[J.

''Spring Ice'' is among the dozen or so paintings expanded from a small sketch into a larger canvas work.{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=181}} The smaller sketches were done [[en plein air]]—in this case likely painted a little north of Hayhurst's Point on [[Canoe Lake (Nipissing District)|Canoe Lake]]{{sfnb|Saunders|1947|p=170}}{{sfnb|Little|1970|p=34}}—through the spring, summer and fall.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|pp=59–60}} The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio—an old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in [[Rosedale, Toronto]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=127}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|pp=181–85}}{{sfnb|Brown|1998|pp=151, 158}}

===Sketch (spring 1915)===

Curator Charles Hill has written that the ''Sketch for Spring Ice'' was almost certainly done with [[A. Y. Jackson]]'s 1914 canvas ''A Frozen Lake'' in mind.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}}{{efn|group=note|Under the National Gallery of Canada, Jackson's painting is instead known as ''Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A. Y. Jackson: Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park |url=https://www.gallery.ca/collection/artwork/frozen-lake-early-spring-algonquin-park |website=www.gallery.ca |publisher=National Gallery of Canada |accessdate=11 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curator Charles Hill has noted that this is a common mistake arising due to the two paintings ''A Frozen Lake'' and ''Early Spring, Algonquin Park'' being exhibited next to one another in 1914. ''Frozen Lake, Early Spring, Algonquin Park'' is a combination of the two titles.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 130n107}}}} Thomson likely saw the painting in November 1914 before Jackson took it away in December to be exhibited.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|loc=p. 130n107}} The composition recalls Thomson's earlier work from his design career, using a group of trees in the foreground to establish a lake and low-lying hills in the background.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=71}} By 1914 Thomson was displaying an increasing interest in the motifs of both ice breaking up on a river as well as rock in the lower foreground. In these earlier examples, the foreground tends to cut a diagonal across the painting while the trees subtly obscure the far shore. A. Y. Jackson experimented with this idea in his own 1914 painting, ''Lake Shore, Canoe Lake''.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=125}} In the ''Sketch for Spring Ice'', a gentler rise to the left instead establishes the foreground with only a few brushstrokes used to paint the brown ground. Charles Hill has further written that, "the relationship of foreground, middle and distance is more fluid than in ''[[Northern River (painting)|Northern River]]'', opening the view of the water and far shore."{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=132}}

===Canvas (winter 1915–16)===

The final canvas for ''Spring Ice'' shares similarities to ''In the Northland'', another work produced over the same winter. A key difference is that ''Spring Ice'' emphasizes the horizontal, seen with both the foreground, lake and hills existing in bands stacked on top of one another, and further emphasized by the open space and the trees being placed on the far left and right of the foreground.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

While the sketch utilizes "muddy, warm tones," the canvas instead uses brighter, more highly keyed colours. The brighter greens, pinks, yellows, blues and whites are not too striking, with a pale blue lightly put on top of the final work to lower the overall contrast. The different regions of colour are readily apparent within the foreground. In the background, [[Terra cotta (color)|terra cotta]] is painted over with blue.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=135}}

==Provenance and exhibition==
In March and April 1916 Thomson exhibited ''Spring Ice'' and three canvases with the [[Ontario Society of Artists]] (OSA). The other paintings were ''In the Northland'' (at that time, titled ''The Birches''), ''Moonlight'' and ''October'' (then titled ''The Hardwoods''), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915–16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Murray |first1=Joan |title=Exhibition: 1916 OSA |url=http://tomthomsoncatalogue.org/exhibitions/entry.php?id=149 |website=tomthomsoncatalogue.org |accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}} Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the [[National Gallery of Canada]] wanted to purchase ''In the Northland'', but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to instead purchase ''Spring Ice.''{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=136}} They bought it for $300 ({{Inflation|CA|300|1916|fmt=eq|r=-2|cursign=CAD$}}).{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=13}}{{sfnb|Murray|2002b|p=316}}{{sfnb|Silcox|Town|2017|p=47}}

Reception to Thomson's paintings at this time were mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the ''[[Toronto Star|Toronto Daily Star]]'' wrote, "Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper."{{sfnb|Fairbairn|1916}} A more favourable take came from artist [[Edmund Wyly Grier|Wyly Grier]] in ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'': {{quote|Tom Thomson again reveals his capacity to be modern and remain individual. His early pictures—in which the quality of naivete had all the genuineness of the effort of the tyro and was not the counterfeit of it which is so much in evidence in the intensely rejuvenated works of the highly sophisticated—showed the faculty for affectionate and truthful record by a receptive eye and faithful hand; but his work today has reached higher levels of technical accomplishment. His ''Moonlight'', ''Spring Ice'' and ''The Birches'' are among his best.{{sfnb|Grier|1916}}}} In ''The Canadian Courier'', painter [[Estelle Muriel Kerr|Estelle Kerr]] similarly spoke positively, describing Thomson as "one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects.{{sfnb|Kerr|1916|p=13}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9526">'''Strategy guides''' are instruction books that contain hints or complete solutions to specific [[video game]]s.  The line between strategy guides and walkthroughs is somewhat blurred, with the former often containing or being written around the latter. Strategy guides are often published in print, both in book form and also as articles within [[video game journalism|video game magazine]]s. In cases of exceptionally popular game titles, guides may be sold through more mainstream publication channels, such as bookstores or even newsstands. Some publishers also sell [[E-Book]] versions on their websites.

Strategy guides marketed as "official" are written by game distributors themselves or licensed to a specialty publishing house; [[Prima Games]] (a division of [[Random House]]) and Piggyback Interactive (a division of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]) specialise in writing official guides for various companies. There are also a number of publishers who make unlicensed, "unofficial" strategy guides, and many of today's mainstream publishers began by making such guides.

==Typical contents==
The contents of a strategy guide varies between game genres. Typically, the guides contain:
* Detailed [[gameplay]] information, for example, maneuvers that are not detailed in the manual.
* Complete maps of the game, which show the placement of all items (including hidden and hard-to-find ones).
* Detailed instructions for specific locations on how to proceed from there.
* Explanations of puzzles.
* Details of enemies, including techniques on defeating individual enemies (especially [[boss (video games)|bosses]]), the segment for minor enemies is commonly referred to as a [[bestiary]].
* Checklist of collectible items.
* Cheats and game editing, although this has been less common in official guides.
* Walkthroughs to help the player complete levels.
* Advice on tactics and strategies for use in multi-player (games with multi-player only)

==Publishing before game release==
In order to be released at the same time as the game, commercial strategy guides are often based on a pre-release version of the game, rather than the final retail version; BradyGames' guide for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', for instance, included some misplaced item locations and a slightly different map, which made some directions impossible to follow. BradyGames rectifies such mistakes by offering free [[errata]] pages for download from their [[website]].

Strategy guides are sometimes published before the game itself is published.  This can be risky because there is always the chance that a game will end up not being released.  In January [[2001 in video gaming|2001]], Prima published a guide ({{ISBN|0-7615-3125-4}}) for the [[Dreamcast]] version of ''[[Half-Life (video game)|Half-Life]]'', which was canceled late in development when [[Sega]] discontinued the [[video game console|console]].

A number of other sites contain strategy guides, and videos in a number of niche areas, such as Role Playing Games or First Person Shooters. These sites may attract a more limited set of viewers, but can include more depth of content. Video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have given rise to [[Video game walkthrough|video walkthroughs]] using programs such as [[Fraps]], which allows players to more easily mirror the strategies being described. These videos are re-posted to a number of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|title=Example of YouTube Video Re-posts|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109051251/http://www.hiddenarea.com/search/label/Video%20Post|archivedate=2016-01-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game wikis are used as both strategy guides and documentation. Content is generated and edited completely by users. Wikis allow for information to updated if a developer introduced a new patch to the game. Wiki farms such as [[Fandom (website)|Fandom]] and [[Gamepedia]] host a large number of unofficial video game wikis while wikis can be integrated into the overall site such as [[IGN|IGN Wikis]]. While most wikis are considered unofficial and not supported by the developer, some developers may choose to do so for various reasons. These reasons may include resolving copyright issues and [[real world trading]] that may be found on unofficial wikis. For example, [[ArenaNet]] hosts an official wiki for ''[[Guild Wars]]'' and ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'', citing that "it's often more complete and useful than the documentation that ArenaNet generates internally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:About|title=About Guild Wars Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information on the wiki is integrated into the game, allowing players to access information from in game. Although the wiki is hosted by ArenaNet, the site is run and moderated by the community and contributions are released under GNU Free Document License (GDFL) similar to sites such as Wikipedia.

Aside from the quality of the content, the community aspect of fan walkthroughs is significant. One perspective argues that walkthroughs are shared stories for gamers and game fans.  In creating walkthroughs, gamers actively create meaning for the games.  This is similar to activities of traditional media such as books, films and television (e.g., [[Fan Fiction]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|title=Zelda 64 and Video Game Fans: A Walkthrough of Games, Intertextuality, and Narrative|journal=[[Television &amp; New Media]]|year=2003|volume=4|issue=3|page=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increasing availability of free online FAQs and walkthroughs has taken away some of the demand for commercial strategy guides, although there is still a large market for them. Print guides often feature extensive picture-by-picture walkthroughs, maps, and game art, none of which is possible in the [[plain-text]] works hosted by prominent sites such as [[GameFAQs]]. Some newer sites allow strategy guides to be hosted in formats that allow pictures and videos, which further undercuts the advantages of print strategy guides.

Some publishers have tried combining their printed books with the [[Internet]]. In [[2000 in video gaming|2000]], the ''[[Final Fantasy IX|Final Fantasy IX Official Strategy Guide]]'' was published by BradyGames, but much of the information was contained on Square's [[PlayOnline]] website. This seemed like a good way to promote PlayOnline, while creating a guide that would have updatable content, but it was widely panned. Players saw no need of buying a book if a significant part of the content was online; and there was no point paying for online content from one site, if it was available for free on another site. As a result, Square abandoned the online strategy guide concept and released complete printed guides for future games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |title=Square's Innovative Strategy Guide Strategy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617055414/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/readers/ |archivedate=June 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source mistakes==
Some companies  will, at times, make mistakes in the book about the game itself, such as stating that "Character A" has a relationship with "Character B", despite there being no relationship. In a strategy guide for ''[[Diddy Kong Racing]]'' they referred to characters with terms such as "The Dinosaur" and "The Octopus" instead of their names.

Games journalist and guide writer [[Alan Emrich]] has severely criticized recent strategy guides for:
*Containing only facts which should have been in the game manual, e.g. about the [[user interface]].
*Failing to teach users how to improve their play.
*Failing to provide information which helps them to make decisions, e.g. about the capabilities and costs of units and buildings.
*Being inaccurate, often because the developers have tweaked the game during the publication [[lead time]].

The faults, he says, are mainly caused by the game publishers' and guide publishers' haste to get their products on to the market;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''''Bean eater''''' (Italian: ''Mangiafagioli'') is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Baroque]] painter [[Annibale Carracci]]. Dating from 1580-1590 (probably 1583-1585), it is housed in the gallery of [[Palazzo Colonna]] of [[Rome]].&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Rome|year=2011|publisher=Hachette|isbn=9780297857853|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u3TsPpSRLRAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is connected to the contemporary ''[[Butcher's Shop (Annibale Carracci)|Butcher's Shop]]'' (now at Oxford), for it shares the same popularesque style. Painted in Bologna, it is a broadly and realistically painted still life, which owes much to Flanders and Holland.&lt;ref name=Hibbard&gt;{{cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=Caravaggio|year=1985|publisher=Westview Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780064301282|page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carracci was also influenced in the depiction of everyday life subjects by [[Vincenzo Campi]] and [[Bartolomeo Passarotti]]. Manifest is Carracci's capability to adapt his style, making it "lower" when concerning "lower" subjects like the ''Mangiafagioli'', while in his more academic works (such as the broadly contemporary ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Carracci)|Assumption of the Virgin]]'') he was able to use a more classicist composure with the same ease.

'''''The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist''''' is an [[oil painting]] by the Italian artist [[Caravaggio]]. According to Andrea Pomella in ''Caravaggio: An Artist through Images'' (2005), the work is widely considered to be Caravaggio's masterpiece as well as "one of the most important works in Western painting."&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pomella|first=Andrea|title=Caravaggio: an artist through images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JDH4lOa8qRgC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=28 June 2010|year=2005|publisher=ATS Italia Editrice|isbn=978-88-88536-62-0|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] has described ''The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist'' as one of the ten greatest works of art of all time: "Death and human cruelty are laid bare by this masterpiece, as its scale and shadow daunt and possess the mind."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website =[[The Guardian]]|url =https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/mar/21/the-10-greatest-works-art-ever|title =The 10 greatest works of art ever|first =Jonathan|last =Jones|date =21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The painting, in oil on canvas, is {{cvt|12|feet|m}}  by  {{cvt|17|feet|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partel|first=Francis J.|date=2011|title=The Chess Players, a Novel of the Cold War at Sea|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=5NYBiLaTD3MC&amp;pg=PA287&amp;dq=baroque+architecture+in+merchant+street+valletta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitp4XK-tjRAhXHXRQKHWGOBgUQ6AEIMDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%20architecture%20in%20merchant%20street%20valletta&amp;f=false|publisher=Navy Log LLC|isbn=9780615414515|page=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent are the vivid [[red]] and warm [[yellow]] colours, common to the Baroque period with the use of [[chiaroscuro]].&lt;ref name="sammut"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Scientia|last=Sammut|first=E.|date=1949|title=Caravaggio in Malta|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Scientia%20(Malta)/Scientia.%2015(1949)2(Apr.-Jun.)/03.pdf|volume=15|issue=2|pages=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts the execution of [[John the Baptist]] while nearby [[Salome]] stands with a golden platter to receive his head. Another woman, who has been identified as [[Herodias]] or simply a bystander who realizes that the execution is wrong,&lt;ref name="Harris2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harris|first=Ann Sutherland|title=Seventeenth-century art &amp; architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xd0CuzsPYJcC&amp;pg=PA48|year=2005|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=978-1-85669-415-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gaul2007"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gaul|first=Simon|title=Malta Gozo &amp; Comino, 4th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fevix8jSqg0C&amp;pg=PA109|date=1 October 2007|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-86011-365-9|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; stands by in shock while a jailer issues instructions and the executioner draws his dagger to finish the beheading. The scene, popular with Italian artists in general and with Caravaggio himself, is not directly inspired by the [[Bible]], but rather by the tale as related in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="Hibbard1985"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hibbard|first=Howard|title=The Caravaggio: Reflections on Political Change and the Clinton Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SwLpTgpjAVYC&amp;pg=PA228|date=1983|publisher=Harper &amp; Row,|isbn=978-0-06-430128-2|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the only work by Caravaggio to bear the artist's signature, which he placed in red blood spilling from the Baptist's cut throat.&lt;ref name="Rowland2005"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rowland|first=Ingrid Drake|title=From heaven to Arcadia: the sacred and the profane in the Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yke1Kx4v9sYC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2005|publisher=New York Review of Books|isbn=978-1-59017-123-3|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable empty space in the image, but because the canvas is quite large the figures are approximately life-sized.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caravaggio drew the background for his work from his memories of his time in a prison of the Knights of Malta.&lt;ref name="VarrianoCaravaggio2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Varriano|first=John L.|title=Caravaggio: the art of realism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YMhkLIxpOWkC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2006|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02717-3|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically of his later paintings, the number of props and the detail in the props used is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Varriano (2006), 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Salome with the Head of John the Baptist-Caravaggio (1610).jpg|thumb|left|[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio), London|''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist'', Caravaggio (London)]]]]
Completed in 1608 in [[Malta]], the painting had been commissioned by the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of Malta]] as an [[altarpiece]];&lt;ref name="CaravaggioPomella2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varriano (2006), pp. 74, 116.&lt;/ref&gt; it was the largest altarpiece which Caravaggio would ever paint.&lt;ref name="Patrick2007"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Patrick|first=James|title=Renaissance and Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6ZJlLHLPY8C&amp;pg=PA194|year=2007|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7651-1|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It still hangs in [[St. John's Co-Cathedral]], for which it was commissioned and where Caravaggio himself was inducted and briefly served as a knight.&lt;ref name="Rowland2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick2007"/&gt; Caravaggio's service to the Order was brief and troubled, however, as he was soon a [[fugitive]] from justice, having escaped while imprisoned for an unrecorded crime.&lt;ref name="Gaul2007"/&gt; When Caravaggio was defrocked ''in absentia'' as a "foul and rotten member" by the Order about six months after his induction, the ceremony took place in the Oratory, before this very painting.&lt;ref name="Gaul2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WarwickCaravaggio2006"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Warwick|first=Genevieve|title=Caravaggio: Realism, Rebellion, Reception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvOqwz1M0BUC&amp;pg=PA30|year=2006|publisher=University of Delaware Press|isbn=978-0-87413-936-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CaravaggioSalomeMadrid.jpg|thumb|right|[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio), Madrid|''Salome with the Head of John the Baptist'', Caravaggio (Madrid)]]]]
Caravaggio did several pieces depicting the moments after the event depicted here. One of these is on display in London's [[National Gallery]]; the other, in the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. It is believed that one of these may be the image that Caravaggio was said to have sent in an effort to appease [[Alof de Wignacourt]], [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] of the Knights who expelled Caravaggio, but this is not certainly known.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist'' has been badly damaged,&lt;ref name="HagenHagen2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hagen|first1=Rose-Marie|author2=Rainer Hagen|title=What great paintings say|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOzohrk8Mm8C&amp;pg=PA216|date=2 February 2002|publisher=Taschen|isbn=978-3-8228-2100-8|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it did receive some restoration in the 1950s prior to a notable exhibition in [[Rome]] in 1955–56, which brought the work considerable attention.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard (1985), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; It was during the restoration that Caravaggio's signature in the blood became visible to modern viewers.&lt;ref name="Hammill2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hammill|first=Graham L.|title=Sexuality and Form: Caravaggio, Marlowe, and Bacon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhcWIlk-67IC&amp;pg=PA95|date=15 December 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-31519-5|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The signature is a matter of some dispute. The work is signed ''f. Michelang.o'' (the ''f'' to indicate his brotherhood in the order),&lt;ref&gt;Warwick (2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is popularly claimed that Caravaggio signed "I, Caravaggio, did this" in confession of some crime—perhaps connected to the 1606 death of Ranuccio Tomassoni at Caravaggio's hands, which had caused the painter to flee Rome.&lt;ref name="Pencak2002"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Pencak|first=William|title=The films of Derek Jarman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZiBbPphZEwC&amp;pg=PA70|date=October 2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1430-7|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peachment2003"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Peachment|first=Christopher|title=Caravaggio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9UyHvUxDVcC&amp;pg=PA168|date=6 May 2003|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-312-31448-4|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jackson1995"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jackson|first=Earl|title=Strategies of deviance: studies in gay male representation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o2ZfhAYmNoYC&amp;pg=PA81|year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-33115-1|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Fifer''''' or '''''Young Flautist''''' is a painting by French painter [[Édouard Manet]], made in 1866. It is usually kept in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris, and is now{{when|date=December 2017}} on loan to the [[Louvre Abu Dhabi]] museum in [[Abu Dhabi]], [[UAE]].

==History==
On a trip to Spain in 1865, Édouard Manet visited the Prado, where the art of [[Diego Velázquez]] was a revelation. Upon his return to Paris in 1866, he began work on a new painting, depicting an anonymous regimental fifer of the Spanish army. In this picture, Manet presents the uniformed boy, in a manner that imitates and inverts the formula of Vélazquez's court portraits, against a barely inflected, flattened background of neutral tone, thus frustrating attempts to assess the figure's true size and, by extension, importance. 

The painting, entitled ''Le fifre,'' was rejected by the jury of the Salon of 1866. Outraged by the jury's decision, Émile Zola, an early champion of Manet's art, published a series of articles in the newspaper ''L'Évenement,'' that praised Manet's realist style and modern content.  Following the example of Gustave Courbet, in May 1867, Manet personally funded and mounted an exhibition of his own work in a pavilion at the edge of the Éxposition universelle. The exhibition included ''Le fifre,'' which was ridiculed in the popular press for its unusual brushwork and inscrutable spatial setting.

The painting was acquired by Durand-Ruell in 1872 and again in 1893. Between 1873 and 1893, the painting was owned by Manet's friend, composer and baritone [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]]. ''Le fifre'' was accepted by the French government in lieu of taxes on the estate of its last private owner, the Count Isaac de Camondo, and entered the national collections in 1911. It was displayed at the Louvre from 1914 until 1947, when it was relocated to the Musée du Jeu de Paume. In 1986, it was moved to its current home in the Musée d'Orsay, the national museum of 19th-century art.

It was included in a large exhibition of Manet's work in 1884, a year after his premature death, and was included in the sweeping Manet retrospective held at the Grand Palais in 1983, the 100th anniversary of the artist's death.

==Analysis==
As with a painting by Velázquez, Manet conceived a shallow depth, where vertical and horizontal planes are barely distinguishable.&lt;ref name="orsay"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/colecciones/obras-comentadas/busqueda/commentaire/commentaire_id/le-fifre-317.html?no_cache=1 |title=El pífano |publisher=Musée d'Orsay |language=|accessdate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peter H. Feist, in ''The Player fife'', Manet showed the appeal of "the decorative effect of a large single figure, with emphatic contours and placed before a background surface."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feist |first=Peter H. |edition= Walther, Ingo H. |title=El impresionismo |year= 2006|publisher=Taschen |place=Colonia |language=Spanish |isbn=978-3-8228-5052-7 |page=76 |chapter=En camino hacia la propia posición}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against a monochrome background, the figure is boldly highlighted with a reduced palette of colors mostly laid on in a thick [[impasto]] which brings forth the very sharp black of the jacket and shoes, along with the red pants, white strap, spats and so on. Thus, the figure stands "firm, smooth and alive."&lt;ref name="salvat"&gt;{{cite book |author=VV.AA. |title= Historia del arte: El realismo. El impresionismo |year=2005 |publisher=Salvat / El País |isbn=84-471-0336-6 |pages=135–36 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="orsay"/&gt;

Moreover, as in Velázquez's work, Manet also portrayed an anonymous character, a teenage musician of the band of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon III)|Imperial Guard]] of Napoleon III, who was sent to Manet by commander Lejosne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=VV.AA. |title= Historia del arte: El realismo. El impresionismo |year=2005 |publisher=Salvat / El País |isbn=84-471-0336-6 |page=126 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treated like a grandee of Spain."&lt;ref name="orsay"/&gt; Additional models may have also posed for the figure: the likenesses of both Léon Leenhoff and [[Victorine Meurent]] have been seen in the boy's face and figure.&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Carol.

'''The Louisville Palace''' (also known as the '''Palace Theatre''') is a music venue in [[downtown Louisville|downtown]] [[Louisville, Kentucky]], located in the city's theater district, on the east side of Fourth Street, between Broadway and Chestnut Street. It has a [[seating capacity]] of 2,700 people and is owned by [[Live Nation Entertainment|Live Nation]].  The historic landmark opened on September 1, 1928, and was designed by architect [[John Eberson]].&lt;ref name=lpalace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisvillepalace.com/VenueInfo#history|title=The Louisville Palace Theater|publisher=Live Nation Worldwide, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally known as the Loew's and United Artists State theatre.

''The Palace'' exhibits a [[Spanish Baroque architecture|Spanish Baroque]] motif with [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s, [[balconies]] and [[turret]]s. [[Cobalt blue]], bursts of red and gold indirectly light all of the niches, coves and entrances. Above is a curved, [[vaulted ceiling]] with 139 sculptures of the faces of historical figures. The theater room inside ''The Palace'' is heavily ornamented and displays an imitation nighttime sky on the ceiling.

The theater is two [[storey|stories]] with a floor and a balcony.  Both floors contain [[bar (counter)|bar]]s that run the width of the building behind the theater, separated by a grand lobby of intricate art and architecture.

Although the exterior had fallen behind the interior, the Palace was re-dedicated in 1994 and is now a premiere venue.&lt;ref name=lpalace/&gt;

Its uncommon appearance has made it a popular venue for musicians to record live performances (including [[Third Day]] &amp; [[Alison Krauss]]).  On June 2, 1983, [[A Flock Of Seagulls]] performed at the Palace and the show was recorded for broadcast by NBC's [[The Source]]. The theatre features an array of popular [[film|movie]]s, old and new, as well as concerts by popular artists.

'''''The Song of Love''''' (also known as '''''Le chant d'amour''''' or '''''Love Song'''''; 1914) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. It is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was "founded" by [[André Breton]] in 1924. 

It depicts an outdoor architectural setting similar to other works by de Chirico at this time. This time however, the main focus is a small wall on which is mounted a [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek sculpted]] head and a surgeon's glove. Below it is a green ball. On the horizon is the outline of a locomotive, an image that recurs several times during this period of de Chirico's career.

"'''The Three Aunts'''" is a Norwegian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Peter Christen Asbjørnsen]] and [[Jørgen Moe]] in ''[[Norske Folkeeventyr]]''.&lt;ref&gt;George Webbe Dasent, ''Popular Tales from the Norse'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/authors/asbjornsenmoe/threeaunts.html "The Three Aunts"]  Edinburgh: David Douglass, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A poor man made his living by shooting.  He had lost his wife, and one day, his pretty daughter decided to go seek her fortune.  She got a place with the queen, and worked so hard that she became a favorite.  The other women, jealous, told the queen that she had claimed to be able to spin a pound of flax in twenty-four hours.  The queen set her to do it.  She begged a room for herself but never having spun flax, could not do it.  An old woman came to her, got the story from her, and on the promise that the girl would call her "Aunt" on her wedding day, did the spinning for her.

The queen was pleased with it, making the other women more jealous.  They said the girl had said she could weave it all in twenty-four hours, and the queen set her to the task again.  Another old woman wove it for it, for the same price.  Then the women claimed she could sew it all into shirts in twenty-four hours, and a third old woman sewed them for the same price.

The queen decided to marry her to the prince, because such a worker would never need to hire working women.  The women came. The first was a hag with a nose three ells long, the second had a humped back, the third eyes like saucers, but the bride greeted them as "Aunt" and the prince had to seat them at the high table.  He asked why they were so hideous.  The first blamed her nose on her spinning, and the second her back on her weaving, and the third her eyes on her sewing.  The prince said that his bride would no longer spin, weave, or sew.

{{Puzzles}}
'''Tiling puzzles''' are [[puzzle]]s involving two-dimensional [[packing problem]]s in which a number of flat shapes have to be assembled into a larger given shape without overlaps (and often without gaps).  Some tiling puzzles ask you to dissect a given shape first and then rearrange the pieces into another shape.  Other tiling puzzles ask you to dissect a given shape while fulfilling certain conditions.  The two latter types of tiling puzzles are also called [[dissection puzzle]]s. 

Tiling puzzles may be made from [[wood]], [[metal]], [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], [[plastic]] or any other sheet-material. Many tiling puzzles are now available as [[computer game]]s.

Tiling puzzles have a long history. Some of the oldest and most famous are [[jigsaw puzzle]]s and the [[Tangram]] puzzle.

[[Image:Chinese Sunset.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Example of a tiling puzzle that utilizes [[negative space]].]]

Other examples of tiling puzzles include:
* [[Conway puzzle]]
* [[Domino tiling]], of which the [[mutilated chessboard problem]] is one example
* [[Eternity puzzle]]
* [[Geometric magic square]]
* [[Puzz-3D]]
* [[Squaring the square]]
* [[Tantrix]]
* [[T puzzle]]
* [[Pentomino]]es

Many three-dimensional [[mechanical puzzle]]s can be regarded as three-dimensional tiling puzzles.

The '''Vick Foundation''' was established &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vickfoundation.com/en/index.html Official site]&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2004 to award an annual prize for best [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] [[novel]]. There is also a competition for the most popular short-listed book, based on votes cast by the general public. In 2008, the award will celebrate its 5th anniversary, and the foundation is on the path to becoming an institution in Bulgaria.

==History==
Vick's initiative was acclaimed by those who saw in the prize a new opportunity for the Bulgarian literature after almost 15 years of standstill.

A permanent committee, which includes [[Stefan Danailov]], the current Minister of Culture of [[Bulgaria]], elects а jury. Other members in the committee are Raymond Wagenstein, Boyan Biolchev, Nedyalko Yordanov, Hristo Droumev and Ivan Granitski. The jury changes each year and they select a short list of six Bulgarian novels from which the winner is chosen. One of the member making up the 2008 jury is [[Meglena Kuneva]], the current European commissioner in [[Bulgaria]].

The aim of the foundation is also to enable others to gain access into Bulgarian literature, especially for the literary world beyond Bulgaria.

The award ceremony each year is well attended by members of Bulgarian society and journalist, as can be seen by the [http://www.vickfoundation.com/bg/gallery.html photo gallery on the website]. The event is covered by TV channels in Bulgaria and causes quite a media furor annually. [[KariZa]] and other well-known performers have graced the stages during the award ceremony and the ceremonies are known to be of much entertainment value.

The competition is organised with the support of [[Translation Company EVS]]
