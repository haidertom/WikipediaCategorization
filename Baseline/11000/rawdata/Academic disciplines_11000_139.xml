      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18584">'''Action selection''' is a way of characterizing the most basic problem of intelligent systems: what to do next. In [[artificial intelligence]] and computational [[cognitive science]], "the action selection problem" is typically associated with [[intelligent agents]] and [[animat]]s—artificial systems that exhibit complex behaviour in an [[agent environment]]. The term is also sometimes used in [[ethology]] or animal behavior.

One problem for understanding action selection is determining the level of abstraction used for specifying an "act". At the most basic level of abstraction, an atomic act could be anything from ''contracting a muscle cell'' to ''provoking a war''. Typically for any one action-selection mechanism, the set of possible actions is predefined and fixed.

Most researchers working in this field place high demands on their agents: 
* The acting [[Intelligent agent|agent]] typically must select its action in [[agent environment|dynamic]] and [[agent environment|unpredictable]] environments. 
* The agents typically act in [[Real-time computing|real time]]; therefore they must make decisions in a timely fashion.
* The agents are normally created to perform several different tasks. These tasks may conflict for resource allocation (e.g. can the agent put out a fire and deliver a cup of coffee at the same time?)
* The environment the agents operate in may include [[humans]], who may make things more difficult for the agent (either intentionally or by attempting to assist.) 
* The agents themselves are often intended to [[computer model|model]] animals or humans, and animal/human [[behaviour]] is quite complicated.

For these reasons action selection is not trivial and attracts a good deal of research.

== Characteristics of the action selection problem ==

The main problem for action selection is [[complexity]]. Since all [[computation]] takes both time and space (in memory), agents cannot possibly consider every option available to them at every instant in time. Consequently, they must be [[bias]]ed, and constrain their search in some way. For AI, the question of action selection is ''what is the best way to constrain this search''? For biology and ethology, the question is ''how do various types of animals constrain their search? Do all animals use the same approaches? Why do they use the ones they do?''

One fundamental question about action selection is whether it is really a problem at all for an agent, or whether it is just a description of an [[emergence|emergent]] property of an intelligent agent's behavior. However, if we consider how we are going to build an intelligent agent, then it becomes apparent there must be ''some'' mechanism for action selection. This mechanism may be highly distributed (as in the case of distributed organisms such as [[social insect]] colonies or [[slime mold]]) or it may be a special-purpose module.

The action selection mechanism (ASM) determines not only the agent’s actions in terms of impact on the world, but also directs its perceptual [[attention]], and updates its [[memory]]. These [[egocentric]] sorts of actions may in turn result in modifying the agents basic behavioural capacities, particularly in that updating memory implies some form of [[machine learning]] is possible. Ideally, action selection itself should also be able to learn and adapt, but there are many problems of [[combinatorics|combinatorial complexity]] and computational [[tractable problem|tractability]] that may require restricting the search space for learning.

In AI, an ASM is also sometimes either referred to as an [[agent architecture]] or thought of as a substantial part of one.

== AI mechanisms ==

Generally, artificial action selection mechanisms can be divided into several categories: [[automated planning and scheduling|symbol-based systems]] sometimes known as classical planning, [[distributed systems|distributed solutions]], and reactive or [[reactive planning|dynamic planning]]. Some approaches do not fall neatly into any one of these categories. Others are really more about providing [[scientific model]]s than practical AI control; these last are described further in the next section.

=== Symbolic approaches ===
{{main|Automated planning and scheduling}}
Early in the [[history of artificial intelligence]], it was assumed that the best way for an agent to choose what to do next would be to compute a [[Logical argument|probably optimal]] plan, and then execute that plan. This led to the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis, that a physical agent that can manipulate symbols is [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient]] for intelligence. Many [[software agents]] still use this approach for action selection. It normally requires describing all sensor readings, the world, all of ones actions and all of one's goals in some form of [[predicate logic]]. Critics of this approach complain that it is too slow for real-time planning and that, despite the proofs, it is still unlikely to produce optimal plans because reducing descriptions of reality to logic is a process prone to errors.

[[Satisficing]] is a decision-making strategy which attempts to meet criteria for adequacy, rather than identify an optimal solution. A satisficing strategy may often, in fact, be (near) optimal if the costs of the decision-making process itself, such as the cost of obtaining complete information, are considered in the outcome calculus.

'''Goal driven architectures''' – In these [[symbol]]ic architectures, the agent's behaviour is typically described by a set of goals. Each goal can be achieved by a process or an activity, which is described by a prescripted plan. The agent must just decide which process to carry on to accomplish a given goal. The plan can expand to subgoals, which makes the process slightly recursive. Technically, more or less, the plans exploits condition-rules. These architectures are [[reactive planning|reactive]] or hybrid. Classical examples of goal driven architectures are implementable refinements of [[BDI software agent|belief-desire-intention]] architecture like [http://www.marcush.net/IRS/irs_downloads.html JAM] or [http://urtax.ms.mff.cuni.cz/ive/public/about.php IVE].  

=== Distributed approaches ===

In contrast to the symbolic approach, distributed systems of action selection actually have no one "box" in the agent which decides the next action. At least in their idealized form, distributed systems have many [[Module (programming)|modules]] running in parallel and determining the best action based on local expertise. In these idealized systems, overall coherence is expected to emerge somehow, possibly through careful design of the interacting components. This approach is often inspired by [[artificial neural networks]] research. In practice, there is almost always ''some'' centralised system determining which module is "the most active" or has the most salience. There is evidence real biological brains also have such [[Executive system|executive decision systems]] which evaluate which of the competing systems deserves the most [[attention]], or more properly, has its desired actions [[disinhibited]].
* [[ASMO (cognitive architecture)|ASMO]] is an attention-based architecture developed by Rony Novianto. It orchestrates a diversity of modular distributed processes that can use their own representations and techniques to perceive the environment, process information, plan actions and propose actions to perform.
*Various types of [[Winner-take-all in action selection|winner-take-all]] architectures, in which the single selected action takes full control of the motor system
* '''Spreading activation''' including [[Maes Nets (ANA)]]
* '''Extended Rosenblatt &amp; Payton''' is a spreading activation architecture developed by Toby Tyrrell in 1993. The agent's behaviour is stored in the form of a hierarchical [[connectionist|connectionism]] network, which Tyrrell named free-flow hierarchy. Recently exploited for example by [http://vrlab.epfl.ch/Publications/pdf/Sevin_Thalmann_CGI_05.pdf de Sevin &amp; Thalmann] (2005) or [http://cyber.felk.cvut.cz/gerstner/eth/download/dpdk2.pdf Kadleček] (2001).
* '''[[Behavior based AI]]''', was a response to the slow speed of robots using symbolic action selection techniques. In this form, separate modules respond to different stimuli and generate their own responses. In the original form, the [[subsumption architecture]], these consisted of different layers which could monitor and suppress each other's inputs and outputs.
* '''[[Creatures (artificial life program)|Creatures]]''' are virtual pets from a computer game driven by three-layered [[artificial neural network|neural network]], which is adaptive. Their mechanism is reactive since the network at every time step determines the task that has to be performed by the pet. The network is described well in the paper of [http://www.cp.eng.chula.ac.th/~vishnu/gameResearch/AI/creatures.pdf Grand et al.] (1997) and in [http://www.double.co.nz/creatures/ The Creatures Developer Resources]. See also the [http://creatureswiki.net/ Creatures Wiki].

=== Dynamic planning approaches ===

Because purely distributed systems are difficult to construct, many researchers have turned to using explicit hard-coded plans to determine the priorities of their system.

Dynamic or [[reactive planning]] methods compute just one next action in every instant based on the current context and pre-scripted plans. In contrast to classical planning methods, reactive or dynamic approaches do not suffer [[combinatorial explosion]]. On the other hand, they are sometimes seen as too rigid to be considered [[Artificial general intelligence|strong AI]], since the plans are coded in advance. At the same time, natural intelligence can be rigid in some contexts although it is fluid and able to adapt in others.

Example dynamic planning mechanisms include:
* '''[[Finite state machine|Finite-state machines]]''' These are [[reactive planning|reactive]] architectures used mostly for computer game agents, in particular for first-person shooters [[Computer game bot|bots]], or for virtual movie actors. Typically, the state-machines are hierarchical. For concrete game examples, see [http://www.gamasutra.com/gdc2005/features/20050311/isla_pfv.htm Halo 2 bots paper] by Damian Isla (2005) or [http://www.kbs.twi.tudelft.nl/Publications/MSc/2001-VanWaveren-MSc.html the Master's Thesis about Quake III bots] by Jan Paul van Waveren (2001). For a movie example, see [[Softimage]].
* Other '''structured reactive plans''' tend to look a little more like conventional plans, often with ways to represent [[hierarchical]] and [[sequential]] structure. Some, such as PRS's 'acts', have support for [[partial plan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ai.sri.com/~prs/|title=PRS-CL: A Procedural Reasoning System|author=Karen L. Myers|work=[[Artificial Intelligence Center]]|publisher=[[SRI International]]|accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many agent architectures from the mid-1990s included such plans as a "middle layer" that provided organization for low-level [[behavior based AI|behavior modules]] while being directed by a higher level real-time planner. Despite this supposed [[interoperability]] with automated planners, most structured reactive plans are hand coded (Bryson 2001, ch. 3). Examples of structured reactive plans include [[James Firby]]'s [http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~firby/raps/ RAP] System and the [[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]]'s [http://ai.stanford.edu/users/nilsson/trweb/tr.html Teleo-reactive plans]. PRS, RAPs &amp; TRP are no longer developed or supported. One still-active (as of 2006) descendent of this approach is the Parallel-rooted Ordered Slip-stack Hierarchical (or [http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~jjb/web/posh.html POSH]) action selection system, which is a part of Joanna Bryson's Behaviour Oriented Design.

Sometimes to attempt to address the perceived inflexibility of dynamic planning, hybrid techniques are used. In these, a more conventional AI planning system searches for new plans when the agent has spare time, and updates the dynamic plan library when it finds good solutions. The important aspect of any such system is that when the agent needs to select an action, some solution exists that can be used immediately (see further [[anytime algorithm]]).

=== Others ===
* [http://CogniTeam.com CogniTAO] is a decision making engine it based on [[Belief–desire–intention software model|BDI]] (belief-desire-intention), it includes built in teamwork capabilities.
* [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]] is a [[symbol]]ic [[cognitive architecture]]. It is based on condition-action rules known as [[Production system (computer science)|productions]]. Programmers can use the Soar development toolkit for building both reactive and planning agents, or any compromise between these two extremes.
* '''[http://www.ai-center.com/projects/excalibur/index.html Excalibur]''' was a research project led by Alexander Nareyek featuring any-time planning agents for computer games. The architecture is based on structural [[constraint satisfaction]], which is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]] technique.
* [[ACT-R]] is similar to Soar. It includes a [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] learning system to help prioritize the productions.
* ABL/Hap
* '''[[Fuzzy control system|Fuzzy architectures]]''' The [[fuzzy logic|Fuzzy approach]] in action selection produces more smooth behaviour than can be produced by architectures exploiting boolean condition-action rules (like Soar or POSH). These architectures are mostly [[reactive planning|reactive]] and [[symbol]]ic.

== Theories of action selection in nature ==

Many dynamic models of artificial action selection were originally inspired by research in [[ethology]]. In particular, [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Nikolaas Tinbergen]] provided the idea of an [[innate releasing mechanism]] to explain instinctive behaviors ([[fixed action pattern]]s). Influenced by the ideas of [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]], Lorenz developed this into a "[[psychohydraulic]]" model of the [[motivation]] of behavior. In ethology, these ideas were influential in the 1960s, but they are now regarded as outdated because of their use of an [[energy flow (ecology)|energy flow]] metaphor; the [[nervous system]] and the control of behavior are now normally treated as involving information transmission rather than energy flow. Dynamic plans and neural networks are more similar to information transmission, while spreading activation is more similar to the diffuse control of emotional / hormonal systems.

[[Stan Franklin]] has proposed that '''action selection''' is the right perspective to take in understanding the role and evolution of [[mind]].  See his page on [http://www.msci.memphis.edu/~franklin/paradigm.html the action selection paradigm].

The [[Indiana University]] '''Archives of Traditional Music''' holds over 100,000 audio and video individual recordings across over 3500 collections of field, broadcast, and commercial recordings. Its holdings are primarily focused on audiovisual recordings relating to research in the academic disciplines of [[ethnomusicology]], [[folklore]], [[anthropology]], [[linguistics]], and various area studies.

==History==
The archive was initiated by [[George Herzog]] at [[Columbia University]] in 1936.  It was modeled on the [[Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv]], where Herzog had worked as an assistant to [[Erich von Hornbostel|Erich M. von Hornbostel]] from 1921–1924. Herzog brought the nascent archive to [[Indiana University]] in 1948 when he was appointed as professor in the Department of Anthropology. The archive was formally established at Indiana University in 1954 under its second director, [[George List]], as the Archives of Folk and Primitive Music.  Its present name, the Archives of Traditional Music, was adopted in 1964 when it became a division of the Folklore Institute.&lt;ref name="ATM Booklet"&gt;{{cite book|title=Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|date=1970|publisher=Indiana University Archives of Traditional Music Folklore Institute|location=Bloomington, IN|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Following insights gained through the Sound Directions Project about a looming crisis in time-based media preservation, staff at the ATM pursued a collaborative strategy for saving its media holdings. In 2008, they participated in a small coalition of archivists and librarians at Indiana University that began a survey of the audio-visual materials held on the Bloomington Campus. The survey was prompted by the recognition that the university held a large amount of time-based media in danger of deterioration and playback obsolescence. This survey revealed that the Bloomington campus held more than a half-million audiovisual recordings across eighty units and that large portions of the University's holdings were at risk for loss. Following the publication of a survey report in 2009, the Office of the Vice Provost for Research funded a preservation planning document under the aegis of what was known as the Media Preservation Initiative (MPI).&lt;ref name="Media Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/media-preservation-initiative.html|title=MPI|publisher=Indiana University Archive of Traditional Music|accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the recommendations of the planning document, Indiana University President Michael McRobbie announced a 15 million dollar commitment to the preservation of audio and video recordings on the Bloomington campus.  The resulting endeavor was renamed the Media Preservation and Digitization Initiative (MDPI) which formed a partnership with Memnon Archiving Services to digitally preserve 280,000 audio and video recordings by 2020.&lt;ref name="Media Digitization and Preservation Initiative"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mdpi.iu.edu/index.php |title=MDPI|publisher=Media and Digitization and Preservation Initiative |accessdate=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, 12,000 films from Indiana University's Moving Image Archives and other campus collections, including the Archives of Traditional Music were added to the efforts of MDPI. As the largest holder of unique and rare audiovisual recordings at Indiana University, nearly all of the archives' 100,000 recordings will be digitized by 2020 through this initiative. MDPI was the first – and as of 2018 the only – university-based media preservation effort in the United States on this scale.

==Projects==

===Archive of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories===
The AHEYM Project has collected nearly 400 interviews related to Jewish life before, during, and after World War II. Conducted primarily in Yiddish, the interviewees come from small towns throughout Ukraine, Moldova, Romania, Hungary and Slovakia. The current online exhibit cover daily life, foodways, Jewish life between the wars, religion, World War II and the Holocaust, and Jewish life after World War II. The archive can be explored by location, person, or subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iub.edu/~aheym/index.php|title=AHEYM - The Archives of Historical and Ethnographic Yiddish Memories - Home - Indiana University|website=www.iub.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preservation and cataloging of AHEYM Project recordings was funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities.

===Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive===
The EVIA Digital Archive is a project created to host a digital archive of ethnographic videos for educational use. The projected originated from a collaboration between Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eviada.webhost.iu.edu/Scripts/default.cfm|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|publisher=Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive|accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnomusicology Multimedia===
EM publishes books and supplemental audiovisual material on [[Ethnomusicology]] in order to aid scholars in research. EM offers access to Annotation Management System (AMS), which allows authors to upload audiovisual material and link it to content in their text. EM is a joint project between Indiana   and Temple Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ethnomultimedia.org/about.html|title=About Ethnomusicology Online|website=ethnomultimedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoagy Carmichael Online===
The [[Hoagy Carmichael]] Project at [[Indiana University]] was a project funded by IMLS between 1999 and 2000 to digitize and preserve the extensive collection of items related to Hoagy Carmichael that are housed at Indiana University. This early digital collection website aimed to present in its entirety the complete Carmichael collection. The collection contains sound recordings, letters, photographs, lyric sheets, correspondence, as well as personal effects.  It offers a biography and a virtual tour of the Carmichael Room located at the Archives of Traditional Music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlib.indiana.edu/collections/hoagy/intro/collec_over/|title=Overview of the Hoagy Carmichael Collection|website=www.dlib.indiana.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aidoh''' is an [[shortening]] for ''Art In Defence Of Humanism''. AIDOH was created by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]] as a [[interest group|group]] focusing on the inhuman treatment of [[people]] in different countries related to political, religious or economic interests. The group has with several occasions started a public debate about the individual countries overconsumption or governments repressive treatment of its own [[people]].

==Manifests==

===My inner beast (1993)===
[[Pigs]] in coats made of 1 ton black [[concrete]]. Is named one of the biggest art [[happening]]s in [[Europe]]. 20 sculptures were placered on public places in [[Europe]] without official approval. It took 55 hours to put the "pigs" up, and the [[happening]] created a lot of public debate.

===The silent death (1995)===
In connection with [[UN]]'s sociale [[summit]] in [[Copenhagen]], were there placed 750 dolls, that pictured dead children in the age of 3–9 years. They were placed on street lamps, benches, fountains and other places to symbolizes the 35.000 children's that dies every day in the [[world]].

===[[Pillar of Shame]] (1997)===
Were placed in [[Hong Kong]] June 4, 1997. Since it has been placed in many other places in the world where the governments does not respect the [[human right]]s. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is in copper and is 8 meters tall. It consists of more than 50 tangled human bodies in pain. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is like a [[Nobel Prize]] in injustice.

===[[WTO]] Hong Kong (2005)===
Following sculptures were placed in [[Hong Kong]] at December 2005:
* Mad Cow Disease
* The survival of the fattest
* Hunger match

===[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] (2006)===
[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] is a number of art installations, that puts focus on Catholics prohibition against the use of [[condoms]]. It consists of a crucified pregnant teenager. It has been exhibited in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Kenya]].

'''Berkeley Earth''' is a [[Berkeley, California]] based independent 501(c)(3) [[non-profit]] focused on land temperature data analysis for [[climate science]].  Berkeley Earth was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) with the goal of addressing the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding [[global warming]] and the [[instrumental temperature record]]. The project's stated aim was a "transparent approach, based on data analysis."&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.berkeleyearth.org/index.php |title=Berkeley Earth home page |accessdate=26 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821233330/http://berkeleyearth.org/index.php |archive-date=2013-08-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, Berkeley Earth became an independent non-profit.  In August 2013, Berkeley Earth was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the US government. The primary product is air temperatures over land, but they also produce a global dataset resulting from a merge of their land data with HadSST.

Berkeley Earth founder [[Richard A. Muller]] told ''[[The Guardian]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we are bringing the spirit of science back to a subject that has become too argumentative and too contentious, ....we are an independent, non-political, non-partisan group. We will gather the data, do the analysis, present the results and make all of it available. There will be no spin, whatever we find. We are doing this because it is the most important project in the world today. Nothing else comes close.&lt;ref name=Sample&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/feb/27/can-these-scientists-end-climate-change-war |title=Can a group of scientists in California end the war on climate change? |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-02-27 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The team's preliminary findings, data sets and programs were published beginning in December 2012. The study addressed scientific concerns including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data [[selection bias]]. The Berkeley Earth group concluded that the warming trend is real, that over the past 50 years (between the decades of the 1950s and 2000s) the land surface warmed by 0.91±0.05&amp;nbsp;°C, and their results mirror those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]],  NASA's [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, and the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]].  The study also found that the [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt;

==Initial results==
After completing the analysis of the full land temperature data set, consisting of more than 1.6 billion temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world, and originated from more than 39,000 temperature stations worldwide, the group submitted four papers for peer-review and publication in scientific journals. The Berkeley Earth study did not assess temperature changes in the oceans, nor try to assess how much of the observed warming is due to human action.&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt; The Berkeley Earth team also released the preliminary findings to the public on October 20, 2011 in order to promote additional scrutiny. The data sets and programs used to analyze the information, and the papers undergoing peer review were also made available to the public.&lt;ref name=bbcBlack&gt;{{Cite news|title=Global warming 'confirmed' by independent study |first=Richard |last=Black |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15373071 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21533360 |title=Climate change: The heat is on |work=[[The Economist]] |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111021144716.htm |title=Cooling the Warming Debate: Major New Analysis Confirms That Global Warming Is Real |work=[[Science Daily]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Berkeley Earth study addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The team's initial conclusions are the following:&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=SciDaily1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/oct/20/global-warming-study-climate-sceptics |title=Global warming study finds no grounds for climate sceptics' concerns |first=Ian |last=Sample |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[urban heat island]] effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), the [[Hadley Centre]] and [[NASA]]'s GISS Surface Temperature Analysis. The team found that the urban heat island effect is locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to the average land temperature rise, as the planet's urban regions amount to less than 1% of the land area. The study also found that while stations considered "poor" might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend.
*Global temperatures closely matched previous studies from NASA GISS, NOAA and the Hadley Centre, that have found global warming trends. The Berkeley Earth group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911&amp;nbsp;°C, just 2% less than NOAA's estimate. The team scientific director stated that "...this confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions."&lt;ref name=bbcBlack/&gt;
*About 1/3 of temperature sites around the world with records of 70 years or longer reported cooling (including much of the United States and northern Europe). But 2/3 of the sites show warming. Individual temperature histories reported from a single location are frequently noisy and/or unreliable, and it is always necessary to compare and combine many records to understand the true pattern of global warming.
*The [[Atlantic multidecadal oscillation]] (AMO) has played a larger role than previously thought. The [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO) is generally thought to be the main reason for inter-annual warming or cooling, but the Berkeley Earth team's analysis found that  the global temperature correlates more closely with the state of the Atlantic Multidecadal ''Oscillation'' index, which is a measure of sea surface temperature in the north Atlantic.

The Berkeley Earth analysis uses a new methodology and was tested against much of the same data as NOAA and NASA. The group uses an algorithm that attaches an automatic weighting to every data point, according to its consistency with comparable readings. The team claims this approach allows the inclusion of outlandish readings without distorting the result and standard statistical techniques were used to remove [[outlier]]s. The methodology also avoids traditional procedures that require long, continuous data segments, thus accommodating for short sequences, such as those provided by temporary weather stations. This innovation allowed the group to compile an earlier record than its predecessors, starting from 1800, but with a high degree of uncertainty because at the time there were only two weather stations in America, just a few in Europe and one in Asia.&lt;ref name=Econ1011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature1011/&gt;

===Reactions===
Given project leader Muller's well-publicised concerns regarding the quality of climate change research, other critics anticipated that the Berkeley Earth study would be a vindication of their stance. For example, when the study team was announced, [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]], a blogger who popularized several of the issues addressed by the Berkeley Earth group study, expressed full confidence in the team's methods:

{{quote|text=I'm prepared to accept whatever result they produce, even if it proves my premise wrong. ... [T]he method ''isn't'' the madness that we've seen from NOAA, NCDC, GISS, and CRU, and, there aren't any monetary strings attached to the result that I can tell. ...

When the initial results were released, and found to support the existing consensus, the study was widely decried by deniers. Watts spoke to ''The New York Times'', which wrote: "Mr. Watts ... contended that the study's methodology was flawed because it examined data over a 60-year period instead of the 30-year-one that was the basis for his research and some other peer-reviewed studies. He also noted that the report had not yet been peer-reviewed and cited spelling errors as proof of sloppiness."&lt;ref name=NYT1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/climate-study-does-not-placate-skeptics/?ref=earth |title=Climate Study Does Not Placate Skeptics |first=Leslie |last=Kaufman |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/science/earth/21climate.html |title=Climate Skeptics Stay Unswayed |work=New York Times |date=October 21, 2011 |page=A25 |accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Mosher, a co-author of a book critical of climate scientists, also disapproved saying that the study still lacked transparency. He said: "I'm not happy until the code is released and released in a language that people can use freely."&lt;ref name=NYT1011/&gt; (The code and dataset were by then available from the Berkeley Earth Data page.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111225024628/http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth Data as updated 2011-10-21], [http://berkeleyearth.org/data/ Berkeley Earth: Data Overview] (current)&lt;/ref&gt;) [[Stephen McIntyre]], editor of [[Climate Audit]], a climato-skeptics [[blog]], said that "the team deserves credit for going back to the primary data and doing the work" and even though he had not had an opportunity to read the papers in detail, he questioned the analyses of urban heating and weather station quality.&lt;ref name=Nature1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/111020/full/news.2011.607.html |title=Different method, same result: global warming is real |first=Jeff |last=Tollefson |work=[[Nature News]] |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-10-22 |doi=10.1038/news.2011.607}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scientist1011&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn21074-sceptical-climate-scientists-concede-earth-has-warmed.html |title=Sceptical climate scientists concede Earth has warmed |first=Michael |last=Marshall |work=[[New Scientist]] |date=2011-10-21 |accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the study was well received by Muller's peers in climate science research. [[James Hansen]], a leading climate scientist and head of [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] commented that he had not yet read the research papers but was glad Muller was looking at the issue. He said "It should help inform those who have honest scepticism about global warming."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Phil Jones (climatologist)|Phil Jones]] the director of the [[Climatic Research Unit]] (CRU) at the [[University of East Anglia]], said: "I look forward to reading the finalised paper once it has been reviewed and published. These initial findings are very encouraging and echo our own results and our conclusion that the impact of urban heat islands on the overall global temperature is minimal."&lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; [[Michael E. Mann|Michael Mann]], director of the Earth System Science Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]], commented that "...they get the same result that everyone else has gotten," and "that said, I think it's at least useful to see that even a critic like Muller, when he takes an honest look, finds that climate science is robust."&lt;ref name=Scientist1011/&gt; Peter Thorne, from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative, said: "This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways." &lt;ref name=Guardian1011/&gt; The ice core research scientist Eric Steig wrote at RealClimate.org that it was unsurprising that Berkeley Earth's results matched previous results so well: "Any of various simple statistical analyses of the freely available data ...show... that it was very very unlikely that the results would change".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2011/10/berkeley-earthquake-called-off/ |first=Eric |last=Steig |title=Berkeley earthquake called off |publisher=RealClimate.org |date=6 December 2004 |accessdate=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expanded scope==
Since the publication of its papers in 2013, Berkeley Earth has broadened its scope. Berkeley Earth has three program areas of work: 1) further scientific investigations on the nature of climate change and extreme weather events, 2) an education and communications program, and 3) evaluation of mitigation efforts in developed and developing economies, with a focus on energy conservation and the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/science Berkeley Earth  Science]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications Berkeley Earth  Education &amp; Communications] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204083539/http://berkeleyearth.org/education-and-communications |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation Berkeley Earth Mitigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204080520/http://berkeleyearth.org/mitigation |date=December 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==July 2012 announcement==
In an [[op-ed]] published in the ''[[New York Times]]'' on 28 July 2012, Muller announced further findings from the project. He said their analysis showed that average global land temperatures had increased by {{convert|2.5|F-change|1}} in 250 years, with the increase in the last 50 years being {{convert|1.5|F-change|1}}, and it seemed likely that this increase was entirely due to human caused [[greenhouse gas]] emissions. His opening paragraph stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Call me a converted skeptic. Three years ago I identified problems in previous climate studies that, in my mind, threw doubt on the very existence of global warming. Last year, following an intensive research effort involving a dozen scientists, I concluded that global warming was real and that the prior estimates of the rate of warming were correct. I'm now going a step further: Humans are almost entirely the cause.&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012"/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]]. Their analysis, set out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the [[urban heat island]] effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions. Muller said he still found "that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed."&lt;ref name="NYT 28 July 2012" /&gt;

== In rotordynamics ==
[[File:Campbelldiagram.png|thumb|300px|Analytical Campbell Diagram for a Simple Rotor]]
In [[Rotordynamics|rotordynamical]] systems, the eigenfrequencies often depend on the rotation rates due to the induced [[gyroscopic]] effects or variable hydrodynamic conditions in [[fluid bearing]]s. It might represent the following cases:

1. ''Analytically'' computed values of [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]] as a function of the shaft's rotation speed. This case is also called "whirl speed map".&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;

| date = 2003-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such chart can be used in turbine design as shown in the numerically calculated Campbell diagram example illustrated by the image: analysis shows that there are well-damped critical speed at lower speed range. Another critical speed at mode 4 is observed at 7810 rpm (130&amp;nbsp;Hz) in dangerous vicinity of nominal shaft speed, but it has 30% damping - enough to safely ignore it.

[[File:Campbell Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Campbell Diagram of a steam turbine]]

2. ''Experimentally'' measured vibration response spectrum as a function of the shaft's rotation speed ([[waterfall plot]]), the peak locations for each slice usually corresponding to the [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]].

== In acoustical engineering ==

In [[acoustical engineering]], the Campbell diagram would represent the pressure spectrum [[waterfall plot]] vs the machine's shaft rotation speed (sometimes also called ''3D noise map'').

All [[carbohydrates]] absorbed in the [[small intestine]] must be [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] to [[monosaccharide]]s prior to absorption.  Hydrolysis precedes transport of monosaccharides in hamster intestine. From sucrose, glucose is taken up much faster than fructose. Monosaccharide transport saturates with [[glucose|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]] at 30 mM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid=6492000 |title=Hamster intestinal disaccharide absorption: extracellular hydrolysis precedes transport of the monosaccharide products |last1= Alvarado |first1= F |last2= Lherminier |first2= M |last3= Phan |first3= HH |journal= [[The Journal of Physiology]] |date= October 1984 |volume=355 |pages=493–507 |doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1984.sp015434 |pmc=1193506}}&lt;!--|accessdate= October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digestion]] of [[starch]] begins with the action of [[saliva]]ry [[alpha-amylase]]/[[ptyalin]], although its activity is slight in comparison with that of [[pancreatic amylase]] in the small intestine. Amylase hydrolyzes starch to alpha-[[dextrin]], which are then digested by gluco-[[amylase]] (alpha-dextrinases) to [[maltose]] and [[maltotriose]]. The products of digestion of alpha-[[amylase]] and alpha-[[dextrinase]], along with dietary [[disaccharide]]s are hydrolyzed to their corresponding [[monosaccharide]]s by [[enzyme]]s ([[maltase]], [[isomaltase]], [[sucrase]] and [[lactase]]) present in the [[brush border]] of the small intestine. In the typical [[Western pattern diet|Western diet]], digestion and absorption of carbohydrates is fast and takes place usually in the [[duodenum|upper small intestine]]. However, when the diet contains carbohydrates not easily digestible, digestion and absorption take place mainly in the [[ileum|ileal]] portion of the intestine.

Digestion of food continues while simplest elements are absorbed. The absorption of most digested food occurs in the small intestine through the brush border of the [[epithelium]] covering the [[Intestinal villus|villi]] (small hair-like structure). It is not a simple [[diffusion]] of substances, but is active and requires energy use by the epithelial cells.

During the phase of carbohydrate absorption, [[fructose]] is transported into the [[Enterocyte|intestinal cell]]'s [[cytosol]], [[glucose]] and [[galactose]] competes with other [[sodium]] transporter required for operation. From the [[cytosol]], monosaccharides pass into the [[capillary|capillaries]] by simple or [[facilitated diffusion]].

Carbohydrates not digested in the small intestine, including [[resistant starch]] foods such as [[potato]], [[bean]], [[oat]], [[wheat flour]], and several [[monosaccharide]] [[oligosaccharides]] and starch, are digested in a variable when they reach the [[large intestine]]. The [[bacterial flora]] [[metabolize]] these compounds [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic]]ally in the absence of [[oxygen]]. This produces [[gas]]es ([[hydrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]) and [[short-chain fatty acid]]s ([[acetate]], [[propionate]], [[butyrate]]). The gases are absorbed and excreted by [[breath]]ing or through the [[anus]] ([[flatulence]]). [[Fatty acid]]s are rapidly metabolized. [[Butyrate]] is used mainly by cells in the [[Colon (anatomy)|colon]] and acetate is absorbed into the [[blood]] and taken up by the [[liver]], [[muscle]] and other [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]]. [[Propionate]] is an important precursor of glucose in some [[animal]]s, but not [[human]]s.

The '''Centre of Full Employment and Equity''' or '''CofFEE'''&lt;ref name=new&gt;[http://e1.newcastle.edu.au/coffee/ Centre of Full Employment and Equity website]&lt;/ref&gt; is an official research centre of the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], and has operated since 1998.  CofFEE's membership is drawn from the disciplines of [[economics]], [[politics]], [[sociology]] and [[geography]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/source/centre-full-employment-and-equity Centre of Full Employment and Equity], Australian Policy online&lt;/ref&gt;

CofFEE states that it seeks to undertake and promote research into the goals of full employment, [[price stability]] and achieving an economy that delivers equitable outcomes for all.  Its main focus is on [[macroeconomics]], [[labour economics]], [[regional development]] and [[monetary economics]].

==Main aims==
The stated main aims of the Centre are to "promote research aimed at restoring [[full employment]]", and achieving "an economy that delivers equitable outcomes for all", and also  determining how effective regional labour markets can be in creating employment for the disadvantaged.

==Research programs==
Research programs of public interest include: work on the [[Job guarantee]] scheme and public sector employment, in general, in [[OECD]] countries; the development of alternative labour-market indicators (hours-based measures of labour underutilisation); creating effective employment arrangements for youth with [[psychosis]]; creating effective local labour-markets; advancing spatial research by reconstructing [[Australia]]’s economic geography; and a multi-level modelling approach for understanding "socio-economic opportunity and vulnerability."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsay, Tony &amp; and Christopher Lloyd, [[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]].

'''Conservation psychology''' is the scientific study of the reciprocal relationships between [[human]]s and the rest of [[nature]], with a particular focus on how to encourage [[conservation movement|conservation]] of the [[natural environment|natural world]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"&gt;Saunders, C.D. 2003. The Emerging Field of Conservation Psychology. Human Ecology Review, Vol. 10, No, 2. 137–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a specialty area within [[psychology]] itself, it is a growing field for scientists, researchers, and practitioners of all disciplines to come together and better understand the earth and what can be done to preserve it. This network seeks to understand why humans hurt or help the environment and what can be done to change such behavior. The term "conservation psychology" refers to any fields of psychology that have understandable knowledge about the environment and the effects humans have on the natural world. Conservation psychologists use their abilities in "greening" psychology and make society [[ecologically sustainable]].&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ Myers, Gene.

January 20, 2002.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219133545/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~gmyers/cp/ |date=December 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of conservation psychology is oriented toward environmental sustainability, which includes concerns like the conservation of [[natural resources|resources]], conservation of [[ecosystem]]s, and quality of life issues for humans and other [[species]].&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

One common issue is a lack of understanding of the distinction between conservation psychology and the more-established field of [[environmental psychology]], which is the study of transactions between individuals and all their physical settings, including how people change both the built and the natural environments and how those environments change them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, R. 2007. Environmental Psychology: Principles and Practice (4th ed.). Colville, WA: Optimal Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental psychology began in the late 1960s (the first formal program with that name was established at the City University of New York in 1968), and is the term most commonly used around the world. Its definition as including human transactions with both the natural and built environments goes back to its beginnings, as exemplified in these quotes from three 1974 textbooks: "Environmental psychology is the study of the interrelationship between behavior and the built and natural environment"&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P.A., Fisher, J. D., &amp; Loomis, R.J.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Philadelphia PA: Saunders (p. 6).&lt;/ref&gt; and "...the natural environment is studied as both a problem area, with respect to [[environmental degradation]], and as a setting for certain recreational and psychological needs",&lt;ref&gt;Ittelson, W.H., Proshansky, H.M., Rivlin, L.G., Winkel, G.H. 1974. Environmental Psychology: An Introduction. New York: Hold, Rinehart, and Winston (p. 6),&lt;/ref&gt; and a third that included a chapter entitled The Natural Environment and Behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Heimstra, N.W. &amp; McFarling, L.H.  1974. Environmental Psychology. Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation psychology, proposed more recently in 2003 and mainly identified with a group of US academics with ties to zoos and environmental studies departments, began with a primary focus on the relations between humans and animals. Introduced in ecology, policy, and biology journals, some have suggested that it should be expanded to try to understand why humans feel the need to help or hurt the environment, along with how to promote conservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clayton|first=S|author2=Brook, A|title=Can Psychology Save the World?  A Model for Conservation Psychology|journal=[[Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy]] |date=Dec 2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=87–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pioneers in this field==
Psychologists from all fields including philosophy, biology, sociology, industrial and organizational, health, and consumer psychology, along with many other subfields like environmental education and [[conservation biology]] come together to put their knowledge to practice in educating others to work together and encourage a congruous relationship between humans and the environment around them. These psychologists work together with places such as zoos and aquariums. Zoos and aquariums may seem to only be places of recreation and fun but are actually trying hard to put positive messages out and to educate the public on the homes and needs of the animals that live there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bitgood|first=Stephen C.|title=Environmental psychology in museums, zoos, and other exhibition centers|year=2002|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc|location=NJ|isbn=0-471-40594-9|pages=461–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are trying to find ways to interact and teach the public the consequences of their day to day actions to the animals and the environment rather than simply viewing the animals. Psychologists and sociologists have been visiting workshops and think tanks at the zoos to evaluate if the animals are being viewed and shown to the best of their ability while still giving informative knowledge to the public.

==Research to consider==
What characterizes conservation psychology research is that in addition to descriptive and theoretical analyses, studies will explore how to cause the kinds of changes that lessen the impact of human behavior on the natural environment, and that lead to more sustainable and harmonious relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Zelezny, L.C. &amp; Schultz, P.W. (eds.). 2000. Promoting environmentalism. Journal of Social Issues 56, 3, 365–578.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Werner, C.M. 1999. Psychological perspectives on sustainability. In E. Becker and T. Jahn (eds.), Sustainability and the Social Sciences: A Cross-Disciplinary Approach to Integrating Environmental Considerations into Theoretical Reorientation, 223–42. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the research being done with respect to conservation is estimating exactly how much land and water resources are being used by each human at this point along with projected future growth.  Also important to consider is the partitioning of land for this future growth.  Additionally, conservation efforts look at the positive and negative consequences for the biodiversity of plant and animal life after humans have used the land to their advantage.  In addition to creating better conceptual models, more applied research is needed to: 1) identify the most promising strategies for fostering ways of caring about nature, 2) find ways to reframe debates and strategically communicate to the existing values that people have, 3) identify the most promising strategies for shifting the societal discourse about human–nature relationships, and 4) measure the success of these applications with respect to the conservation psychology mission.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; The ultimate success of conservation psychology will be based on whether its research resulted in programs and applications that made a difference with respect to environmental sustainability. We need to be able to measure the effectiveness of the programs in terms of their impact on behavior formation or behavior change, using tools developed by conservation psychologists.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt;

== Present research and future planning ==
Conservation psychology research has broken down the four most important tenets of promoting positive conservation attitudes into "the four 'I's".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Vugt|first=Mark|title=Averting the Tragedy of the Commons: Using Social Psychological Science to Protect the Environment|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=1 June 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=169–173|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01630.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include: Information, Identity, Institutions, and Incentives.  Research has been done in all four categories.

=== Information ===
Studies have shown that the way in which crises are presented is a key predictor for how people will react to them.  When people hear that they personally can help to alleviate a crisis through their conservation efforts, just by simple actions with their personal energy use, they are more likely to conserve.  However, if people are told that the other people around them are overusing energy, it increases selfish behavior and causes people to actually consume more.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"&gt;{{cite journal|last=SAUNDERS|first=CAROL D. |author2=BROOK, AMARA T. |author3=EUGENE MYERS, OLIN|title=Using Psychology to Save Biodiversity and Human Well-Being|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 June 2006|volume=20|issue=3|pages=702–705|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00435.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching people about the benefits of conservation, including easy ways to help conserve, is an effective way to inform about and promote more environmentally friendly behavior.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huber|first=Patrick R.|author2=Greco, Steven E. |author3=Thorne, James H. |title=Boundaries Make a Difference: The Effects of Spatial and Temporal Parameters on Conservation Planning*|journal=The Professional Geographer|date=24 June 2010|volume=62|issue=3|pages=409–425|doi=10.1080/00330121003788309}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, research has shown that making sure people understand more about the boundaries of land they can help preserve actually improves positive attitudes towards conservation.  When people know more about local regions they can help protect, they will care more.  Knowing more about the regions includes knowing the extent of the [[biodiversity]] in that region, and being sure that the ecosystem will remain healthy and protected.  Cost analysis is another important factor.  People do not want to take risks on valuable lands, which in places like California, could be worth billions.&lt;ref name="Huber 409–425"/&gt;

=== Identity ===
In general, people like to fit in and identify with their peer social groups.  Studies have shown people identify more intimately with close friends and family, which is why conservation campaigns try to directly address the most people.&lt;ref name="SAUNDERS 702–705"/&gt;  The "think of the children" argument for conservation follows this logic by offering a group everyone can relate to and feel close to.  Studies have also shown that this need to fit in among peer social groups can be reinforced positively or negatively: giving positive feedback on energy bills for conserving in their homes encourages people to continue lower energy use.  Examples of negative [[reinforcement]] include the use of negative press against companies infamous for heavy pollution.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

Another interesting line of research looks at how people identify positively or negatively with certain issues.  One relevant idea is the notion of "consistency attitudes".  Studies have shown that people tend to take a good association they have, and then use this to make positive or negative links with other, related things.  For example, if someone thinks it is a good idea to protect old Pacific forests, this will positively form a link to also want to protect smaller forests and even grasslands.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bright|first=Alan D.|author2=Barro, Susan C. |author3=Burtz, Randall T. |title=Attitudes Toward the Protection and Restoration of Natural Areas Across Three Geographic Levels: An Examination of Interattitude Consistency1|journal=Journal of Applied Social Psychology|date=1 November 2001|volume=31|issue=11|pages=2301–2321|doi=10.1111/j.1559-1816.2001.tb00177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This same line of thinking can cause someone who supports the protection of old Pacific forests to start thinking negatively about the creation of more logging roads.  Other studies on consistency attitudes have shown that, with one particular issue, people like to align their preferences with each other.  This has been shown repeatedly while looking at political ideologies and racial attitudes, and studies have shown that this can also include environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  Finally, other studies have shown that how people identify an ecosystem geographically can affect their concern for it.&lt;ref name="Bright 2301–2321"/&gt;  For instance, when people think of saving the rainforests, they often think of this as a global problem and support it more readily.  However, lesser known but still significant local ecosystems remain ignored and unprotected.

=== Institutions ===
Another approach that has been considered is the use of organized institutions and government as the leaders for promoting conservation.  However, these leaders can only be effective if they are trusted.  Studies from previous crises where conserving resources was extremely necessary showed that people were more likely to obey energy restrictions and follow certain leaders when they felt they could trust the people directing them.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  People need to understand that they are being encouraged to act a certain way out of necessity, and that they are not being misled.

=== Incentives ===
Incentivizing conservation through rewards and fines is another approach.  Studies have shown that people who identify more with their community need less incentives to conserve than those who do not identify strongly with their surrounding community.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  For corporations, monetary incentives have been shown to work for companies showing some effort to make their buildings and practices more "green".&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;  Studies have also shown that doing something as simple as putting a water meter in homes has helped incentivize conservation by letting people track their energy consumption levels.  Finally, studies have shown that when giving fines, it is better to start with very small and then raise it for repeated violations.  If the fines are too high, the issue becomes too economic, and people start to mistrust the authorities enforcing the fines.&lt;ref name="Van Vugt 169–173"/&gt;

==Main concepts==
Conservation psychology assesses as a whole four different concepts. At the country's first Conservation Psychology conference these four things were discussed. The first is the main original topic of the field, and the other three are topics with a previous history in [[environmental psychology]].

The first topic being discussed is the connection of humans and animals. The Multi-Institutional Research Project (MIRP) works diligently on finding ways to develop a compassionate stance towards animals in the public eye. Many different questions were assessed to find answers to questions concerning ways to help develop loving attitudes for animals and the earth. With these questions and answers, effective educational and interpretive programs were made that would help review the progress.

The second concept that was discussed at the conference concerned connections of humans and places. A new language of conservation will be supported if there are abundant opportunities for meaningful interactions with the natural world in both urban and rural settings. Unfortunately, as biodiversity is lost, every generation has fewer chances to experience nature.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, P.K., Jr. 1999. The human relationship with nature. Development and culture. Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. 2006. Biodiversity conservation and the extinction of experience. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution: in press.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many questions asked concerning how humans in their everyday lives could be persuaded or educated well enough to make them want to join in programs or activities that help maintain biodiversity in their proximity. Local public and private organizations were asked to come together to help find ways to protect and manage local land, plants, and animals. Other discussions came to whether people on an individual or community level would voluntarily choose to become involved in maintaining and protecting their local biodiversity. These plus many other important questions were contemplated. Techniques in marketing are a key tool in helping people connect to their environment. If an identity could be connected from the environment to towns becoming more urbanized, maybe those living there would be more prone to keep it intact.

The third discussion covered the aspects of producing people who act [[environmentally friendly]]. Collectively, any activities that support sustainability, either by reducing harmful behaviors or by adopting helpful ones, can be called conservation behaviors. Achieving more sustainable relationships with nature will basically require that large numbers of people change their reproductive and consumptive behaviors.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Any action, small or large, that helps the environment in any way is a good beginning to a future of generations who only practice environmentally friendly behavior. This may seem to be a far-fetched idea but with any help at all in educating those who do not know the repercussions of their actions could help achieve this. Approaches to encouraging a change in behavior were thought about carefully. Many do not want to change their way of life. A more simplistic lifestyle rather than their materialistic, current lives hurt their environment around them rather than help, but could people willingly change? To take public transportation rather than drive a car, recycling, turning off lights when they are not needed, all these things are very simple yet a nuisance to actually follow through with. Would restructuring tax-code help people to want to change their attitudes? Any concept to reach the goal of helping people act ecologically aware was discussed and approached. Some empirical evidence shows that simply "being the change you want to see in the world" can influence others to behave in more environmentally friendly ways as well.&lt;ref&gt;Sussman, R., &amp; Gifford, R. (2013). Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places. Environment &amp; Behavior, 45, 323-343, DOI: 10.1177/0013916511431274.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth and final point at the first Conservation Psychology convention was the discussion of the values people have to their environment. Understanding our relationship to the natural world well enough so that we have a language to celebrate and defend that relationship is another research area for conservation psychology. According to the [[biophilia hypothesis]], the [[human]] species evolved in the company of other life forms, and we continue to rely physically, emotionally, and intellectually on the quality and richness of our affiliations with natural diversity.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; A healthy and diverse natural environment is considered an essential condition for human lives of satisfaction and fulfillment.&lt;ref&gt;Kellert, S.R. &amp; Wilson E.O. (eds.). 1993. The Biophilia Hypothesis. Washington, DC: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Where did they get these values and are they ingrained to the point they cannot be changed? How can environmentally educated people convey value-based communication to a community, a nation, or even on a global level? National policy for this model is something that is desired but under such a strong political scrutiny this could be very challenging. Advocates for biodiversity and different programs came together to try to find methods of changing Americans' values concerning their environment and different methods to express and measure them.

==Connection of conservation in biology and psychology==
[[Conservation biology]] was originally conceptualized as a crisis-oriented discipline, with the goal of providing principles and tools for preserving biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Soule, M.E. (1987). History of the Society for Conservation Biology: How and why we got here. Conservation Biology, 1, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a branch of biology that is concerned with preserving genetic variation in plants and animals. This scientific field evolved to study the complex problems surrounding habitat destruction and species protection. The objectives of conservation biologists are to understand how humans affect biodiversity and to provide potential solutions that benefit both humans and non-human species. It is understood in this field that there are underlying fields of biology that could readily help to have a better understanding and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Biological knowledge alone is not sufficient to solve conservation problems, and the role of the social sciences in solving these problems has become increasingly important.&lt;ref&gt;Mascia, M.B.; Brosius, J.P.; Dobson, T.A.; Forbes, B.C.; Horowitz, L.; McKean, M.A. &amp; N.J. Turner. 2003. Conservation and the social sciences. Conservation Biology 17: 649–50.&lt;/ref&gt; With the knowledge of conservation biology combined with other fields, much was thought to be gained. Psychology is defined as the scientific study of human thought, feeling, and behavior.&lt;ref name="Myers"/&gt; Psychology was one of the fields that could take its concepts and apply them to conservation. It was also always understood that in the field of psychology there could be much aid to be given, the field only had to be developed. Psychology can help in providing insight into moral reasoning and moral functioning, which lie in the heart of human–nature relationships.&lt;ref name="Saunders"/&gt; Everyone that is now involved from the field of psychology had knowledge of ways to conceptualize the relationship of humans to their environment. Biology has always been involved in advances of conservation considering biodiversity, and the organisms in it are part of the main field of biology. Psychology has been absent from conservation for some time, but educators and scientists are realizing that with the help of both we can come to a better understanding of humans and their social interactions with their environment and everything in it.

In contrast, the vi–ii–V–I or [[circle progression]] from classical theory contains four chords of two or three different qualities: major, minor, and possibly a [[dominant seventh chord]]; all of which, however, are diatonic to the key. Thus diversity is achieved within a stable and fixed tonal center.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27246">'''Crosslinguistic influence''' ('''CLI''')&amp;nbsp;refers to the different ways in which one language can affect another within an individual speaker. It typically involves two languages that can affect one another in a bilingual speaker.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Serratrice|first=Ludovica|year=2013|title=Cross-linguistic influence in bilingual development Determinants and mechanisms|url=|journal=Linguistic approaches to bilingualism|volume=3|pages=3–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; An example of CLI is the influence of Korean on a Korean native speaker who is learning Japanese or French.&amp;nbsp;Less typically, it could also refer to an interaction between different&amp;nbsp;[[dialect]]s&amp;nbsp;in the mind of a monolingual speaker.&amp;nbsp;CLI can be observed across&amp;nbsp;[[List of language subsystems|subsystems of languages]]&amp;nbsp;including pragmatics, semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology, phonetics, and orthography.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Odlin, Terence (2003). "Cross-Linguistic Influence". ''The Handbook of Second Language Acquisition''. Oxford: Blackwell. p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Discussed further in this article are particular subcategories of CLI—transfer, attrition, the complementarity principle, and additional theories.

== History ==
The question of how languages influence one another within a bilingual individual can be addressed both with respect to mature bilinguals and with respect to bilingual language acquisition. With respect to bilingual language acquisition in children, there are several hypotheses that examine the internal representation of bilinguals' languages. Volterra and Taeschner proposed the ''Single System Hypothesis,''&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; which states that children start out with one single system that develops into two systems. This hypothesis proposed that bilingual children go through three stages of acquisition.
* In Stage I there is a single lexicon that contains words from both languages, and there is a single syntactic system. Children in this stage will never have a translation equivalent for a word in the other language. Translation equivalents are two corresponding words in two separate languages with the same meaning. Also, it is common for the child to use two different languages in a single utterance. The syntactic rules are hard to define because of the lack of two-word and three-word utterances by the bilingual child.
* In Stage II there are two lexicons, but there is one syntactic system. In addition, there is evidence for language separation because at this stage children become less likely to mix their languages. Across both languages, the same syntactic rules are applied. For example, Japanese has subject-object-verb word order (SOV), and English has subject-verb-object word order (SVO). An English-Japanese bilingual might apply only one of these word orders to all utterances, regardless of what language the utterance is in.
* In Stage III there are two lexicons and two syntactic systems, with adult-like separation of the languages. When a child reaches this stage they are considered fully "bilingual."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Volterra|first=Virginia|last2=Taeschner|first2=Traute|year=1978|title=The acquisition and development of language by bilingual children|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Virginia_Volterra/publication/296194110_113_Volterra_V_Taeschner_T_1978_The_acquisition_and_development_of_language_by_bilingual_children_Journal_of_Child_Language_5_pp_311-326_Reprinted_2007_in_In_L_Wei_ed_The_bilingual_reader_301_-_320_Ne/links/56d2f48608ae4d8d64a76693/113-Volterra-V-Taeschner-T-1978-The-acquisition-and-development-of-language-by-bilingual-children-Journal-of-Child-Language-5-pp-311-326-Reprinted-2007-in-In-L-Wei-ed-The-bilingual-reader-301.pdf|journal=Journal of Child Language|volume=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In response to the ''Single System Hypothesis'', a different hypothesis developed regarding the idea of two separate language systems from the very beginning. It was based on evidence of monolinguals and bilinguals reaching the same milestones at approximately the same stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;Cantone, K. (1999). Das Genus im Italienischen und Deutschen: Empirische Untersuchung zum bilingualen Erstspracherwerb. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Natascha (1990). "Developing two gender assignment systems simultaneously". ''J. Meisel''. Two first languages. Early grammatical development in bilingual children: 194-243.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, bilingual and monolingual children go through identical patterns of grammar development. This hypothesis, called the ''Separate Development Hypothesis'', held the notion that the bilinguals acquiring two languages would internalize and acquire the two languages separately. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from lack of transfer and lack of acceleration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Paradis, Johanne; Genessee, Fred (1996). "Syntactic acquisition in bilingual children: Autonomous or interdependent?". ''Studies in Second Language Acquisition.'' '''18''': 1-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer is a grammatical property of one language used in another language. Acceleration is the acquisition of a feature in language A facilitating the acquisition of a feature in language B.&lt;ref&gt;Mishina-Mori, Satomi (2005). "Autonomous and interdependent development of two language systems in Japanese/English simultaneous bilinguals: Evidence from question formation". ''First Language''. '''25''': 292-293&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Dutch-English bilingual children, there were no instances of transfer across elements of morphology and syntactic development, indicating that the two languages developed separately from each other.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;De Houwer, Annick (1990). ''The acquisition of two languages from birth'': ''A case study''. Cambridge: CUP&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in a study of French-English bilingual children, there were no instances of acceleration because [[Finite verb|finiteness]] appeared much earlier in French than it did in English, suggesting that there was no facilitation of the acquisition of finiteness in English by acquisition in French.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Under this hypothesis, bilingual acquisition would be equivalent to monolingual children acquiring the particular languages.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In response to both the previous hypotheses mentioned, the ''Interdependent Development Hypothesis'' emerged with the idea that there is some sort of interaction between the two language systems in acquisition. It proposed that there is no single language system, but the language systems are not completely separate either.  This hypothesis is also known as the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'', developed by Hulk and Müller. The ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'' states that influence will occur in bilingual acquisition in areas of particular difficulty, even for monolingual native language acquisition. It re-examined the extent of the differentiation of the language systems due to the interaction in difficult areas of bilingual acquisition.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Hulk, Aafke; Müller, Natascha (2000). "Bilingual first language acquisition at the interface between syntax and pragmatics". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''3''': 227-244.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller, Natascha; Hulk, Aafke (2001). "Crosslinguistic influence in bilingual language acquisition: Italian and French as recipient languages". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''4''': 1-53.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for this hypothesis comes from delay, acceleration, and transfer in particular areas of bilingual language acquisition. Delay is the acquisition of a property of language A later than normally expected because of the acquisition of language B.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; CLI is seen when the child has a dominant language, such as Cantonese influencing English when Cantonese is the dominant language,&lt;ref&gt;Yip, Virginia; Matthews, Stephen (2006). "Assessing Language Dominance in Bilingual Acquisition: A Case for Mean Length Utterance Differentials". ''Language Assessment Quarterly''. '''3''': 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; and it will only occur in certain domains. Below are the two proposals represented in the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'' where CLI may occur.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Simultaneous Language Acquisition|last=Yip|first=Virginia|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may occur where there is an interface.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  An interface, for example, could be between syntax and pragmatics of [[Dislocation (syntax)|dislocations]].  Dislocations are a grammatical option in French under certain pragmatic conditions (e.g. ''Je l'aime, ça'' 'I like it, that'), which have been studied in French-English bilinguals positioning of the word ''that''. French-English bilinguals make use of this device when they move ''that'' to a dislocated position of the periphery of the sentence in English. The placement of ''that'' was dislocated in English sentences because of the influence from French on English syntax. For example, French-English bilingual children may produce ''Is a big one this?'' instead of meaning to say ''Is this a big one?''  The children produced significantly more of these dislocations in English than monolingual English children.&lt;ref&gt;Notley, Anna (2005).  ''Romance Languages and Linguistic Theory 2005''. Benjamins. pp. 231-234.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It may occur where is an overlap between two languages with language A allowing only one option and language B allowing two options. One option of language B overlaps with an option in language A.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, French allows adjectives before and after a noun, but English only allows adjectives before the noun.  There is an overlap in the correct placement of adjectives between these two languages, and there will be transfer, especially with postnominal adjectives in French. For example, French-English bilinguals might produce ''un blanc chien'' "a white dog" instead of ''un chien blanc'' "a dog white."&lt;ref&gt;Nicoladis, Elena (2006). "Cross-linguistic transfer in adjective-noun strings by preschool bilingual children". ''Bilingualism: Language and Cognition''. '''9''': 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since the development of the ''Crosslinguistic Hypothesis'', much research has contributed to the understanding of CLI in areas of structural overlap, directionality, dominance, interfaces, the role of input, and the role of processing and production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Transfer==

In linguistics, [[language transfer]] is defined by behaviorist psychologists as the subconscious use of behaviors from one language in another. In the Applied Linguistics field, it is also known as exhibiting knowledge of a native or dominant language (L1) in one that is being learned (L2).&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cross-linguistic Influences in the Second Language Lexicon|last=Arabski|first=Janusz|publisher=Multilingual Matters|year=2006|isbn=9781853598562|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transfer occurs in various language-related settings, such as acquiring a new language and when two languages or two dialects come into contact. Transfer may depend on how similar the two languages are and the intensity of the conversational setting. Transfer is more likely to happen if the two languages are in the same language family.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It also occurs more at the beginning stages of L2 acquisition, when the grammar and lexicon are less developed. As the speaker's L2 proficiency increases, they will experience less transfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=T.|year=2016|title=Dominant Language Transfer in the comprehension of L2 learners and heritage speakers|url=|journal=International Journal of Applied Linguistics|volume=26|pages=190–210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacquelyn Schachter]] (1992) argues that transfer is not a process at all, but that it is improperly named. She described transfer as "an unnecessary carryover from the heyday of behaviorism." In her view, transfer is more of a constraint on the L2 learners' judgments about the constructions of the acquired L2 language. Schachter stated, "It is both a facilitating and a limiting condition on the hypothesis testing process, but it is not in and of itself a process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Acquisition and Language Disorders : Language Transfer in Language Learning : Revised edition.|last=Gass|first=Susan|last2=Selinker|first2=Larry|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=1992|isbn=9789027224682|location=Amsterdam, NL|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Language transfer can be positive or negative. Transfer between similar languages often yields correct production in the new language because the systems of both languages are similar.  This correct production would be considered positive transfer.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; An example involves a Spanish speaker (L1) who is acquiring Catalan (L2). Because the languages are so similar, the speaker could rely on their knowledge of Spanish when learning certain Catalan grammatical features and pronunciation. However, the two languages are distinct enough that the speaker’s knowledge of Spanish could potentially interfere with learning Catalan properly.

Negative transfer ([[language transfer|Interference]])&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; occurs when there are little to no similarities between the L1 and L2. It is when errors and avoidance are more likely to occur in the L2. The types of errors that result from this type of transfer are underproduction, overproduction, miscomprehension, and production errors, such as substitution, calques, under/overdifferentiation and hypercorrection.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Transfer – Cross-linguistic Influence in Language Learning.|last=Odlin|first=Terence|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1989|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underproduction (Avoidance) ===

[[Avoidance speech|Underproduction]] as explained by Schachter (1974),&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Schachter, J. (1974), AN ERROR IN ERROR ANALYSIS1. Language Learning, 24: 205–214. doi:10.1111/j.1467-1770.1974.tb00502.x&lt;/ref&gt; is a strategy used by L2 learners to avoid producing errors when using structures, sounds, or words which they are not confident about in the L2. Avoidance is a complex phenomenon and experts do not agree on its causes or exactly what it is.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title='A second language classic reconsidered--the case of Schachter's avoidance'.  Second Language Research 8: 231-77|last=Kamimoto|first=T.|last2=Shimura|first2=A.|last3=Kellerman|first3=E.|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=231–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition|last=Ellis|first=Rod|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|isbn=0194371891|location=Walton Street, Oxford|pages=304–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Hebrew speakers acquiring English, may understand how the passive voice, 'a cake is made', works, but may prefer active voice, 'I make a cake,' thus avoiding the passive construction. Kellerman (1992) distinguishes three types of avoidance: (1) learners of the L2 make anticipations or know there is a problem with their construction and have a vague idea of the target construction, (2) the target is known by the L1 speaker, but it is too difficult to use in given circumstances; such as conversational topics that the L1 speaker may have a deficiency in or (3), the L1 speaker has the knowledge to correctly produce and use the L2 structure but is unwilling to use it because it goes against the norms of their behavior.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

=== Overproduction ===

Overproduction refers to an L2 learner producing certain structures within the L2 with a higher frequency than native speakers of that language. In a study by Schachter and Rutherford (1979), they found that Chinese and Japanese speakers who wrote English sentences overproduced certain types of cleft constructions:   
* 'It is very unfortunate that...'   
and sentences that contained ''There are''/''There is'' which suggests an&lt;nowiki/&gt; influence of the topic marking function in their L1 appearing in their L2 English sentences.

=== Production errors ===

Substitution is when the L1 speaker takes a structure or word from their native language and replaces it within the L2.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Odlin (1989) shows a sentence from a Swedish learner of English in the following sentence.
* Swedish Structure on English:
** But sometimes I must go bort.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; 
Here the Swedish word ''bort'' has replaced its English equivalent ''away''.
* Polish learner of English:
** English ''think'' pronounced as [''fink''] because of the influence of the Polish accent on English pronunciation.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
A [[Calque]] is a direct "loan translation" where words are translated from the L1 literally into the L2.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Cassell's French Dictionary: French-English, English-French|last=|first=|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|year=1962|isbn=|location=New York|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* English ''skyscraper'' literally translates in French as ''gratte-ciel'' ("scrapes-sky")&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;
* Polish ''palec'' ''srodkowy'' literally translates to a ''finger'' ''middle'' in English.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* [[Scottish Gaelic]] "a' coimhead air adhart" (literal translation of "looking forwards"), c.f. native expression, "Tha fiughair agam ris" ("I have anticipation of it")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamb|first1=William|title=Scottish Gaelic (2nd Edition)|url=https://www.academia.edu/2488427/Scottish_Gaelic_2nd_Edition_|accessdate=18 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Overdifferentiation occurs when distinctions in the L1 are carried over to the L2.
* An English L1 learner of Polish applies different vowel lengths of English (e.g. /i/ and /i:/) to their Polish due to the use of vowel distinctions in English.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Underdifferentiation occurs when speakers are unable to make distinctions in the L2.
* A Polish learner of English assumes the words ''borrow'' and ''lend'' are equivalent in meaning, since both correspond to ''posyzyc'' in Polish.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
* [[Scottish Gaelic]] learners whose first language was English pronounce the phonemes /l̪ˠ/, /l/, and /ʎ/ identically, since English has only one lateral phoneme.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Hypercorrection is a process where the L1 speaker finds forms in the L2 they consider to be important to acquire, but these speakers do not properly understand the restrictions or exceptions to formal rules that are in the L2, which results in errors, such as the example below.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Routledge Dictionary of Language and Linguistics|last=Bussmann|first=H|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=|location=London:Routledge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish speakers of English may say: potato pronounced as [pota:to] paralleled tomato [toma:to]&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Attrition ==
Also related to the idea of languages interfering with one another is the concept of language attrition. [[Language attrition]], simply put, is language loss. Attrition can occur in an L1 or an L2.  According to the ''Interference Hypothesis'' (also known as the ''Crosslinguistic Influence Hypothesis''), language transfer could contribute to language attrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bardovi-Harlig|first=Kathleen|last2=Stringer|first2=David|year=2010|title=Variables in Second Language Attrition: Advancing the State of the Art|url=|journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition|volume=32|pages=1–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a speaker moved to a country where their L2 is the dominant language and the speaker ceased regular use of their L1, the speaker could experience attrition in their L1. However, [[Second-language attrition|second language attrition]] could just as easily occur if the speaker moved back to a place where their L1 was the dominant language, and the speaker did not practice their L2 frequently. Attrition could also occur if a child speaker’s L1 is not the dominant language in their society. A child whose L1 is Spanish, but whose socially dominant language is English, could experience attrition of their Spanish simply because they are restricted to using that language in certain domains.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Much research has been done on such speakers, who are called [[Heritage language learning|heritage language learners]]. When discussing CLI, attrition is an important concept to keep in mind because it is a direct result of two or more languages coming into contact and the dominance of one over the other resulting in language loss in a speaker.

==Complementarity principle==
Grosjean (1997) explained the complementarity principle as the function of language use in certain domains of life leading to language dominance within that domain for a given speaker.&lt;ref&gt;Grosjean, F. (1997). The bilingual individual. Interpreting, 2(1/2), 163-187&lt;/ref&gt; This dominance in certain domains of life (e.g. school, home, work, etc.) can lead to apparent Crosslingusitic Influence within a domain. One study found that CLI was occurring within the speech of the studied bilinguals, but the intensity of influence was subject to the domains of speech being used.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, Peter, and Li Wei. Handbook of Multilingualism and Multilingual Communication. Berlin: Mouton De Gruyter, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Argyri and Sorace (2007) found, much like many other researchers, that language dominance plays a role in the directionality of CLI.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Argyri, Efrosyni; Sorace, Antonella (2007).Crosslinguistic influence and language dominance in older bilingual children. Bilingualism: Language and Cognition. 10(1), 79-99.&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers found that the English dominant bilinguals had an influence of English on their Greek (concerning preverbal subjects specifically, but also the language in general), but not from their Greek to their English. On the other hand, the Greek dominant bilinguals did not show evidence of Greek influence on their English.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

This supports the notion that bilinguals who do not receive sufficient exposure to both languages acquire a "weaker language" and a "dominant language," and depending on similarities or differences between the languages, effects can be present or absent like that of the Greek-English example above. The effect of CLI can be primarily seen as a unidirectional occurrence, in that the L2 is likely to be affected by the L1, or simply the dominant language is more likely to affect the weaker, than the reverse. This supports the idea of individuals' susceptibility to crosslinguistic influences and the role of dominance. Take for example bilinguals who use different languages for different domains in their life; if a Spanish-English bilingual primarily uses Spanish in the home, but English in school you would expect to see English influences while speaking about school topics in Spanish and similarly you would expect Spanish influences on English when speaking about the home in English because in both instances the language being used is weaker in that domain. This is to say that not only do you see CLI from one language to another, but depending on the domains of use and the degree of proficiency or dominance, CLI can be a significant influence on speech production.

==Additional theories==
Some researchers believe that CLI may be a result of "contact-modified input," or linguistic input modified or affected by some other source such as another language.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Hauser-Grüdl, N., Guerra, L. A., Witzmann, F., Leray, E., &amp; Müller, N. (2010). Cross-linguistic influence in bilingual children: Can input frequency account for it? Lingua, 120(11), 2638-2650. doi:10.1016/j.lingua.2010.06.008&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that the environment surrounding the learning of another language can influence what is actually being learned. Take for example the fact that most L2 learners are receiving input or teachings from similarly speaking bilinguals; Hauser-Grüdl, Guerra, Witzmann, Leray, and Müller (2010) believe that the language being taught has already been influenced by the other in the teachers' minds and, therefore, the input the learner is receiving will exhibit influence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These L2 learners will replicate influences because their input of the L2 is not as pure as input from a monolingual; meaning, what appears as CLI in the individual isn't really CLI of their L1 on their L2, but the effects of acquiring input that has already been modified. This theory has led some people to believe that all input for L2 learning will be affected and resemble CLI; however, this is not a well-supported theory of CLI or its function in L2 acquisition.

Other researchers believe that CLI is more than production influences, claiming that this linguistic exchange can impact other factors of a learner’s identity. Jarvis and Pavlenko (2008) described such affected areas as experiences, knowledge, cognition, development, attention and language use, to name a few, as being major centers for change because of CLI.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Jarvis, S., &amp; Pavlenko, A. (2008). Crosslinguistic influence in language and cognition. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas suggest that crosslinguistic influence of syntactic, morphological, or phonological changes may just be the surface of one language’s influence on the other, and CLI is instead a different developmental use of one’s brain.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Future research==
CLI has been heavily studied by scholars, but there is still much more research needed because of the multitude of components that make up the phenomenon. Firstly, the [[Linguistic typology|typology]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of particular language pairings needs to be researched to differentiate CLI from the general effects bilingualism and bilingual acquisition.

Also, research is needed in specific areas of overlap between particular language pairings and the domains that influence and discourage CLI.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For example, most of the research studies involve European language combinations, and there is a significant lack of information regarding language combinations involving non-European languages, indigenous languages, and other minority languages.

More generally, an area of research to be further developed are the effects of CLI in [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] acquisition of three or more languages.  There is limited research on this occurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On the genesis and development of L3 research, multilingualism and multiple language acquisition|last=Aronin|first=Larissa|last2=Hufeisen|first2=Britta|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking for granted an equal [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|moral status]] as [[person]]s, '''difference feminism''' asserts that there are differences between men and women but that no value judgment can be placed upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feministvoices.com/carol-gilligan/|title = Carol Gilligan |website= Psychology's Feminist Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "difference feminism" developed during the "equality-versus-difference debate" in American feminism in the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scott|first1=Joan|title=Deconstructing Equality-Versus-Difference: Or, the Uses of Post-structuralist Theory for Feminism|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1988|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.2307/3177997|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; but subsequently fell out of favor and use. In the 1990s feminists addressed the binary logic of "difference" versus "equality" and moved on from it, notably with postmodern and/or deconstructionist approaches that either dismantled or did not depend on that dichotomy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bock|first1=Gisela|last2=James|first2=Susan|title=Beyond Equality and Difference|date=1992|publisher=Routledge|isbn = 9780415079891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|location = London|isbn = 9781446228043}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism did not require a commitment to [[gender essentialism|essentialism]]. Most strains of difference feminism did not argue that there was a biological, inherent, ahistorical, or otherwise "essential" link between womanhood and traditionally feminine values, habits of mind (often called "ways of knowing"&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schiebinger|first1=Londa|title=Has Feminism Changed Science?|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=2 footnote 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists simply sought to recognize that, in the present, women and men are significantly different and to explore the devalued "feminine" characteristics.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tandon|first1=Neeru|title=Feminism: A Paradigm Shift|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some strains of difference feminism, for example [[Mary Daly]]'s, argue not just that women and men were different, and had different values or different ways of knowing, but that women and their values were superior to men's.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; This viewpoint does not require essentialism, although there is ongoing debate about whether Daly's feminism is essentialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoagland|first1=Sarah Lucia|last2=Frye|first2=Marilyn|title=Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sandilands|first1=Catriona|title=The Good-Natured Feminist Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy|date=1999|pages=chapter 5: "Cyborgs and Queers"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Difference feminism was developed by feminists in the 1980s, in part as a reaction to popular liberal feminism (also known as "[[equality feminism]]"), which emphasized the similarities between women and men in order to argue for equal treatment for women. Difference feminism, although it still aimed at equality between men and women, emphasized the differences between men and women and argued that identicality or sameness are not necessary in order for men and women, and masculine and feminine values, to be treated equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voet|first1=Rian|title=Feminism and Citizenship|date=1998|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberal feminism aimed to make society and law gender-neutral, since it saw recognition of gender difference as a barrier to rights and participation within liberal democracy, while difference feminism held that gender-neutrality harmed women "whether by impelling them to imitate men, by depriving society of their distinctive contributions, or by letting them participate in society only on terms that favor men".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grande Jensen|first1=Pamela|title=Finding a New Feminism: Rethinking the Woman Question for Liberal Democracy|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difference feminism drew on earlier nineteenth-century strains of thought, for example the work of German writer [[Elise Oelsner]], which held that not only should women be allowed into formerly male-only spheres and institutions (e.g. public life, science) but that those institutions should also be expected to change in a way that recognizes the value of traditionally devalued feminine ethics (like care [see [[ethics of care]]]). On the latter point, many feminists have re-read the phrase "difference feminism" in a way that asks "what difference does feminism make?" (e.g. to the practice of science) rather than "what differences are there between men and women"?&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

== Essentialism and Difference Feminism==
Some have argued that the thought of certain prominent second-wave feminists, like psychologist [[Carol Gilligan]] and radical feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]], is "essentialist." In philosophy essentialism is the belief that "(at least some) objects have (at least some) essential properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental vs Essential Properties|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/essential-accidental/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of sexual politics essentialism is taken to mean that "women" and "men" have fixed essences or essential properties (e.g. behavioral or personality traits) that cannot be changed. However, essentialist interpretations of Daly and Gilligan have been questioned by some feminist scholars, who argue that charges of "essentialism" are often used more as terms of abuse than as theoretical critiques based on evidence,&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyes|first1=Cressida J.|title=Anti-Essentialism in Practice: Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy|journal=Hypatia|date=1997|volume=13|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1997.tb00009.x|pages=142–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Braidotti|first1=Rosi|title="Essentialism" in Feminism and Psychoanalysis: A Critical Dictionary|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not accurately reflect Gilligan&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; or Daly's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suhonen|first1=Marja|title="Toward Biophilic Be-ing: Mary Daly's Feminist Metaethics and the Question of Essentialism" in Feminist Interpretations of Mary Daly|date=2000|publisher=Penn State University Press|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; views.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8606">'''Editio Octava Critica Maior''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament produced by [[Constantin von Tischendorf]]. It was Tischendorf's eighth edition of the Greek Testament, and the most important, published between 1864 and 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Edition==
The first volume was issued in 11 parts, beginning in 1864. They were published in two volumes in 1869 and 1872. The edition was accompanied by a rich critical apparatus in which he assembled all of the variant readings that he or his predecessors had found in manuscripts, versions, and fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

Tischendorf died before he could finish his edition, and the third volume, containing the Prolegomena, was prepared and edited by [[C. R. Gregory]] and issued in three parts (1884, 1890, 1894).&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt;&lt;ref name = Waltz/&gt;

Tischendorf gave the evidence known in his time. He used 64 [[List of New Testament uncials|uncial manuscripts]], a single [[List of New Testament papyri|papyrus manuscript]], and a small number of [[List of New Testament minuscules|minuscule manuscripts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The number of inaccuracies is  smaller than in 20th-century manual editions.&lt;ref name = Aland/&gt;

Tischendorf did not have a detailed textual theory. In practice he had a strong preference for the readings of the manuscript of his own discovery – [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. His text is eclectic but generally the [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]]. It has also  something from the [[Western text-type]], especially when it agrees with [[Codex Bezae]].&lt;ref name = Waltz&gt;Robert Waltz, [http://pericopedeadultera.com/RECON/Tisch-App.html ''Tischendorf's Apparatus'']&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of his work Tischendorf had practically no access to [[Codex Vaticanus]], and it was published too late to alter the basic structure of Tischendorf's edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Influence ==

Tischendorf's ''Editio Octava'' and ''[[The New Testament in the Original Greek]]'' of [[Brooke Foss Westcott|Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort|Hort]] were sufficient to make the [[Textus Receptus]] obsolete for the scholarly world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

According to [[Eberhard Nestle]] the text of the eighth edition differs from the seventh edition in 3,572 places.&lt;ref name = Nestle/&gt; Nestle has accused this edition of giving weight to the evidence of [[Codex Sinaiticus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Metzger|first1=Bruce M.|authorlink1=Bruce M.

The '''Ewa Reactor''' was [[Poland]]'s first research [[nuclear reactor]]. Its name was derived from the first letters of the [[Polish language|Polish]] words: '''''E'''ksperymentalny'' (Experimental), '''''W'''odny'' (Water), and '''''A'''tomowy'' (Atomic) as a reference to [[Ève Curie]].

==History==
The reactor was activated on June 14, 1958, in the Instytut Badań Jądrowych (Institute of Nuclear Research) (Currently the Instytut Energii Atomowej [Atomic Energy Institute] ) in [[Otwock]] near [[Warsaw]]. It was deactivated it in February 1995 due to a shortage of [[uranium]] for experiments, and reactivated in April of the same year after the acquisition of new fuel. The reactor is currently deactivated and partially dismantled.

Ewa was based on the Soviet [[LWR|VVR]]-S design, had an initial power of 2 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]], was fueled by [[Uranium enrichment|enriched uranium]], and moderated by pressurized water. In 1963 and 1967, the reactor underwent two major overhauls that improved the safety of the reaction and allowed for the use of better enriched fuels. After these changes, the reactor's power increased first to 4 MW and ultimately to 10 MW. Its primary use was for producing radioactive [[isotopes]]. It functioned an average of 3500 hours a year.

Because of its design, the reactor is currently considered a potential site for the future site of storage of the spent fuel from the [[Maria reactor]].

'''Gambuh''' is an ancient form of [[Bali]]nese dance-drama. It is accompanied by musicians in a [[gamelan]] gambuh ensemble.&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/gambuh |title=Gambuh |author=Oxford Encyclopedia of Theatre and Performance |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gambuh is one of the oldest surviving forms in Balinese performing arts,&lt;ref name="Bandem"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=834127 |title=Gambuh: A Classical Balinese Dance-Drama in ''Asian Music''|author=I Made Bandem and Fredrik deBoer |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1978 |volume=10 |pages=115–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenzer"/&gt; dating to the [[Majapahit#Decline|late Majapahit]] era (ca. 15th century) with very little known change since this time.&lt;ref name="Bandem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susilo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/v1n2-art5.html |title=Gambuh: A Dance-Drama of the Balinese Courts in Explorations in ''Southeast Asian Studies: A Journal of the Southeast Asian Studies Student Association'', Vol 1, No. 2, Fall 1997 |author=Emiko Susilo |publisher=University of Hawai'i Southeast Asian Studies Student Association |year=1997 |accessdate=2011-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604033810/http://www.hawaii.edu/cseas/pubs/explore/v1n2-art5.html |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emiko Susilo writes, "when the dance-dramas of Majapahit came to Bali, they had the new task of ''preserving'' the tradition of a fallen dynasty"&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  (emphasis in original).  It also introduced a new element of narrative to Balinese performing arts that influenced other forms of dance-drama on the island, such as [[topeng]] masked dance and [[arja]] opera.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  For centuries it was supported by patronage at the royal courts of Bali's aristocracy, during which it achieved its greatest heights of sophistication.  As the courts fell apart in the bloody [[History of Bali#Dutch seizure of Bali island|wars with the Dutch]], this support evaporated and much of the art of gambuh was lost.  Like the many other arts that formerly depended on royal patronage, gambuh found some community support by playing for temple ceremonies.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

Gambuh is now nearly extinct.  In 1997, Susilo observed, "In total there are perhaps only four groups that perform in the Gambuh style."&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  It is unpopular even among Balinese performers.  The dance and music are technically exacting and complex; the dialogue requires knowledge of the [[Kawi language]].  Performances are long and, unlike [[wayang]] shows, contain no comic relief, making demands of potential audiences.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;

==Dramatic components==
Combining dance, music, and acting, gambuh draws on the narrative material of the Malat, a series of poems about the fictional Javanese Prince, [[Raden Panji]], an incarnation of [[Wisnu]].  On his wedding night, he is separated from his fiancée, [[Candra Kirana]], beginning an epic in which the two lovers search for each other over years and across wide areas of medieval Java.  They finally meet on the field of battle, recognize each other through their disguises, and live happily ever after.&lt;ref name="Susilo"/&gt;  Other characters include members of the court and their servants.  The refined (alus) characters speak in [[Kawi language|Kawi]], an old literary tongue, which is translated for the audience into contemporary [[Balinese language]] by the characters of lower status.&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;

==Gamelan Gambuh==
A complete gamelan gambuh requires approximately 17 musicians to accompany the dance-drama.  The main instruments in gambuh performances are very low bamboo flutes called [[suling]] gambuh, between 75 and 100&amp;nbsp;cm in length and 4 and 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  There are usually four such flutes, but sometimes as few as two or as many as six.&lt;ref name="Rembang"&gt;{{cite book |title=Music Gambuh Batuan dan Pedungan |authors=I Nyoman Rembang, I Wayan Sudiana, Tilman Seebass, Wayne Vitale (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suling gambuh play melodies along with a [[rebab]] while percussion instruments fill out the sound with a variety of timbres and rhythms: a medium-sized [[gong]], a small gong called [[kajar (instrument)|kajar]], two [[kendang]], a chime called [[klenang]], a bell tree called [[gentorag]], [[rincik]] (reminiscent of a [[Gamelan gong kebyar#Ceng-Ceng|cengceng]]), a metallophone called [[kenyir]], [[kangsi (music)|kangsi]], and [[gumanak]].&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tenzer"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=0-945971-30-3 |title=Balinese Gamelan |author=Tenzer, Michael |publisher=Periplus Editions |year=1991}} Page 20.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last three of those instruments—the kenyir, kangsi, and gumanak—are not currently found in any other gamelan ensemble of Bali.&lt;ref name="Rembang"/&gt;

'''Hubble's law''', also known as the '''Hubble–Lemaître law''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press |date=29 October 2018 |title=IAU members vote to recommend renaming the Hubble law as the Hubble–Lemaître law |url=https://www.iau.org/news/pressreleases/detail/iau1812/?lang |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |accessdate=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the observation in [[physical cosmology]] that:
# Objects observed in [[Extragalactic astronomy|deep space]]—extragalactic space, 10 mega[[parsec]]s (Mpc) or more—are found to have a [[redshift]], interpreted as a relative velocity away from [[Earth]];
# This [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]]-measured velocity of various [[galaxy|galaxies]] receding from the Earth is approximately [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their distance from the Earth for galaxies up to a few hundred megaparsecs away.&lt;ref name="riess99" /&gt;&lt;ref name="perlmutter99" /&gt;

Hubble's law is considered the first observational basis for the [[expansion of the universe]] and today serves as one of the pieces of evidence most often cited in support of the [[Big Bang]] model.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Cosmos Controversy: The Universe Is Expanding, but How Fast? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/20/science/hubble-constant-universe-expanding-speed.html |date=20 February 2017 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=21 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Coles&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, though the Hubble constant &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is roughly constant in the velocity-distance space at this moment in time, the '''Hubble parameter''' &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, which the Hubble constant is the current value of, changes with time, so the term 'constant' is sometimes thought of as somewhat of a misnomer. Moreover, two years later Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of cosmic expansion, and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;

The law is often expressed by the equation {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''D''}}, with ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the constant of proportionality—Hubble constant—between the "proper distance" ''D'' to a galaxy, which can change over time, unlike the [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving distance]], and its velocity ''v'', i.e. the [[derivative]] of proper distance with respect to cosmological time coordinate. (See ''[[Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance|uses of the proper distance]]'' for some discussion of the subtleties of this definition of 'velocity'.) Also, the SI unit of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, but it is most frequently quoted in ([[kilometre|km]]/[[second|s]])/Mpc, thus giving the speed in km/s of a galaxy {{convert|1|Mpc|km|sigfig=3}} away. The reciprocal of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[#Hubble time|Hubble time]].

| The [[European Space Agency|ESA]] [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck Surveyor]] was launched in May 2009. Over a four-year period, it performed a significantly more detailed investigation of cosmic microwave radiation than earlier investigations using [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]] [[radiometer]]s and [[bolometer]] technology to measure the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. On 21 March 2013, the European-led research team behind the Planck cosmology probe released the mission's data including a new CMB all-sky map and their determination of the Hubble constant.

A decade before Hubble made his observations, a number of [[physicists]] and [[mathematician]]s had established a consistent theory of the relationship between [[spacetime|space and time]] by using [[Einstein's field equations]] of [[general relativity]]. Applying the most [[Big Bang#Underlying assumptions|general principles]] to the nature of the [[universe]] yielded a [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] solution that conflicted with the then-prevailing notion of a [[static universe]].

===FLRW equations===
In 1922, [[Alexander Friedman]]n derived his [[Friedmann equations]] from [[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]], showing that the universe might expand at a rate calculable by the equations.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parameter used by Friedmann is known today as the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]] which can be considered as a [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] form of the [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportionality constant]] of Hubble's law. [[Georges Lemaître]] independently found a similar solution in 1927. The Friedmann equations are derived by inserting the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|metric for a homogeneous and isotropic universe]] into Einstein's field equations for a fluid with a given [[density]] and [[pressure]]. This idea of an expanding spacetime would eventually lead to the [[Big Bang]] and [[Steady State Theory|Steady State]] theories of cosmology.

===Lemaître's Equation===
In 1927, two years before Hubble published his own article, the Belgian priest and astronomer [[Georges Lemaître]] was the first to publish research deriving what is now known as Hubble's Law. According to the Canadian astronomer [[Sidney van den Bergh]], "The 1927 discovery of the expansion of the universe by Lemaître was published in French in a low-impact journal. In the 1931 high-impact English translation of this article a critical equation was changed by omitting reference to what is now known as the Hubble constant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=van den Bergh|first1=Sydney|title=The Curious Case of Lemaître's Equation No. 24|eprint=1106.1195|class=physics.hist-ph|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now known that the alterations in the translated paper were carried out by Lemaitre himself.&lt;ref name = Livio /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Block|first1=David|title='Georges Lemaitre and Stigler's law of eponymy' in Georges Lemaître: Life, Science and Legacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|pages=89–96|edition=Holder and Mitton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape of the universe===
Before the advent of [[Big Bang|modern cosmology]], there was considerable talk about the size and [[shape of the universe|shape]] of the [[universe]]. In 1920, the [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Shapley-Curtis debate]] took place between [[Harlow Shapley]] and [[Heber Doust Curtis|Heber D. Curtis]] over this issue. Shapley argued for a small universe the size of the [[Milky Way galaxy]] and Curtis argued that the universe was much larger. The issue was resolved in the coming decade with Hubble's improved observations.

===Cepheid variable stars outside of the Milky Way===
Edwin Hubble did most of his professional astronomical observing work at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], home to the world's most powerful telescope at the time. His observations of [[Cepheid variable]] stars in spiral [[nebula]]e enabled him to calculate the distances to these objects. Surprisingly, these objects were discovered to be at distances which placed them well outside the [[Milky Way]]. They continued to be called "nebulae" and it was only gradually that the term "galaxies" took over.

The parameters that appear in Hubble's law, velocities and distances, are not directly measured. In reality we determine, say, a supernova brightness, which provides information about its distance, and the redshift ''z'' = ∆''λ''/''λ'' of its spectrum of radiation. Hubble correlated brightness and parameter ''z''.

Combining his measurements of galaxy distances with [[Vesto Slipher]] and [[Milton Humason]]'s measurements of the [[redshifts]] associated with the galaxies, Hubble discovered a rough proportionality between redshift of an object and its distance. Though there was considerable [[variance|scatter]] (now known to be caused by [[peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]]—the 'Hubble flow' is used to refer to the region of space far enough out that the recession velocity is larger than local peculiar velocities), Hubble was able to plot a trend line from the 46 galaxies he studied and obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 500&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc (much higher than the currently accepted value due to errors in his distance calibrations). (See [[cosmic distance ladder]] for details.)

At the time of discovery and development of Hubble's law, it was acceptable to explain redshift phenomenon as a [[Doppler shift]] in the context of special relativity, and use the Doppler formula to associate redshift ''z'' with velocity. Today, in the context of general relativity, velocity between distant objects depends on the choice of coordinates used, and therefore, the redshift can be equally described as a Doppler shift or a cosmological shift (or gravitational) due to the expanding space, or some combination of the two.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cosmological constant abandoned===
{{main|Cosmological constant}}
After Hubble's discovery was published, [[Albert Einstein]] abandoned his work on the [[cosmological constant]], which he had designed to modify his equations of general relativity to allow them to produce a static solution, which he thought was the correct state of the universe. The Einstein equations in their simplest form model generally either an expanding or contracting universe, so Einstein's cosmological constant was artificially created to counter the expansion or contraction to get a perfect static and flat universe.&lt;ref name=mapcc&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hubble's discovery that the universe was, in fact, expanding, Einstein called his faulty assumption that the universe is static his "biggest mistake".&lt;ref name=mapcc /&gt; On its own, general relativity could predict the expansion of the universe, which (through [[Tests of general relativity|observations]] such as the [[Gravitational lens|bending of light by large masses]], or the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|precession of the orbit of Mercury]]) could be experimentally observed and compared to his theoretical calculations using particular solutions of the equations he had originally formulated.

In 1931, Einstein made a trip to [[Mount Wilson Observatory|Mount Wilson]] to thank Hubble for providing the observational basis for modern cosmology.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The discovery of the linear relationship between [[redshift]] and distance, coupled with a supposed linear relation between [[recessional velocity]] and redshift, yields a straightforward mathematical expression for Hubble's law as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;v = H_0 \, D&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional velocity, typically expressed in km/s.
* ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is Hubble's constant and corresponds to the value of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; (often termed the '''Hubble parameter''' which is a value that is [[time-variant system|time dependent]] and which can be expressed in terms of the [[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]]) in the Friedmann equations taken at the time of observation denoted by the subscript ''0''. This value is the same throughout the universe for a given [[comoving time#Comoving coordinates|comoving time]].
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the [[comoving distance]], which is constant) from the [[galaxy]] to the observer, measured in [[mega-|mega]] [[parsec]]s (Mpc), in the 3-space defined by given [[cosmological time]]. (Recession velocity is just ''v'' = ''dD/dt'').

Hubble's law is considered a fundamental relation between recessional velocity and distance. However, the relation between recessional velocity and redshift depends on the cosmological model adopted, and is not established except for small redshifts.

For distances ''D'' larger than the radius of the [[Hubble sphere]] ''r''&lt;sub&gt;HS&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;, objects recede at a rate faster than the [[speed of light]] (''See'' [[Comoving distance#Uses of the proper distance|Uses of the proper distance]] for a discussion of the significance of this):

:&lt;math&gt;r_{HS} = \frac{c}{H_0} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Since the Hubble "constant" is a constant only in space, not in time, the radius of the Hubble sphere may increase or decrease over various time intervals. The subscript '0' indicates the value of the Hubble constant today.&lt;ref name=Keel/&gt; Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating (''see'' [[Accelerating universe]]), meaning that, for any given galaxy, the recession velocity dD/dt is increasing over time as the galaxy moves to greater and greater distances; however, the Hubble parameter is actually thought to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some ''fixed'' distance D and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is the universe expanding faster than the speed of light?|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|website=Ask an Astronomer at Cornell University|accessdate=5 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031123150109/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=575|archivedate=23 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Redshift velocity and recessional velocity===
[[Redshift]] can be measured by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen α-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference. Thus redshift is a quantity unambiguous for experimental observation. The relation of redshift to recessional velocity is another matter. For an extensive discussion, see Harrison.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harrison |first=E. |date=1992 |title=The redshift-distance and velocity-distance laws |journal=[[The Astrophysical Journal]] |volume=403 |issue= |pages=28–31 | bibcode=1993ApJ...403...28H |doi=10.1086/172179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redshift velocity====
The redshift ''z'' is often described as a ''redshift velocity'', which is the recessional velocity that would produce the same redshift ''if'' it were caused by a linear [[Doppler effect]] (which, however, is not the case, as the shift is caused in part by a [[Metric expansion of space|cosmological expansion of space]], and because the velocities involved are too large to use a non-relativistic formula for Doppler shift). This redshift velocity can easily exceed the speed of light.&lt;ref name=Madsen&gt;{{cite book

The motivation behind the "redshift velocity" terminology is that the redshift velocity agrees with the velocity from a low-velocity simplification of the so-called [[Relativistic Doppler effect|Fizeau-Doppler formula]].&lt;ref name=Sartori&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda_e}-1 = \sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{v}{c}}{1-\frac{v}{c}}}-1 \approx \frac{v}{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''λ&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''λ&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the observed and emitted wavelengths respectively. The "redshift velocity" ''v&lt;sub&gt;rs&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not so simply related to real velocity at larger velocities, however, and this terminology leads to confusion if interpreted as a real velocity. Next, the connection between redshift or redshift velocity and recessional velocity is discussed. This discussion is based on Sartori.&lt;ref name=L_Sartori&gt;{{cite book|last=Sartori |first=L. |date=1996 |title=Understanding Relativity |pages=304–305 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-20029-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Recessional velocity====

Suppose ''R(t)'' is called the ''[[Scale factor (cosmology)|scale factor]]'' of the universe, and increases as the universe expands in a manner that depends upon the [[Physical cosmology|cosmological model]] selected. Its meaning is that all measured proper distances ''D(t)'' between co-moving points increase proportionally to ''R''. (The co-moving points are not moving relative to each other except as a result of the expansion of space.) In other words:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {D(t)}{D(t_0)} = \frac{R(t)}{R(t_0)},&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"Introduction to Cosmology", Matts Roos&lt;/ref&gt;

where ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is some reference time. If light is emitted from a galaxy at time ''t&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' and received by us at ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, it is redshifted due to the expansion of space, and this redshift ''z'' is simply:

:&lt;math&gt;z = \frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1. &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose a galaxy is at distance ''D'', and this distance changes with time at a rate ''d&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;D''. We call this rate of recession the "recession velocity" ''v&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt;v_r = d_tD = \frac {d_tR}{R} D. &lt;/math&gt;

We now define the Hubble constant as

:&lt;math&gt;H \equiv \frac{d_tR}{R}, &lt;/math&gt;

and discover the Hubble law:

:&lt;math&gt; v_r = H D. &lt;/math&gt;

From this perspective, Hubble's law is a fundamental relation between (i) the recessional velocity contributed by the expansion of space and (ii) the distance to an object; the connection between redshift and distance is a crutch used to connect Hubble's law with observations. This law can be related to redshift ''z'' approximately by making a [[Taylor series]] expansion:

:&lt;math&gt; z = \frac {R(t_0)}{R(t_e)} - 1 \approx \frac {R(t_0)} {R(t_0)\left(1+(t_e-t_0)H(t_0)\right)}-1 \approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0), &lt;/math&gt;

If the distance is not too large, all other complications of the model become small corrections and the time interval is simply the distance divided by the speed of light:

:&lt;math&gt; z \approx (t_0-t_e)H(t_0) \approx \frac {D}{c} H(t_0), &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; cz \approx D H(t_0) = v_r. &lt;/math&gt;

According to this approach, the relation ''cz'' = ''v&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' is an approximation valid at low redshifts, to be replaced by a relation at large redshifts that is model-dependent. See [[#redshift|velocity-redshift figure]].

===Observability of parameters===
Strictly speaking, neither ''v'' nor ''D'' in the formula are directly observable, because they are properties ''now'' of a galaxy, whereas our observations refer to the galaxy in the past, at the time that the light we currently see left it.

For relatively nearby galaxies ([[redshift]] ''z'' much less than unity), ''v'' and ''D'' will not have changed much, and ''v'' can be estimated using the formula &lt;math&gt;v = zc&lt;/math&gt; where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]]. This gives the empirical relation found by Hubble.

For distant galaxies, ''v'' (or ''D'') cannot be calculated from ''z'' without specifying a detailed model for how ''H'' changes with time. The redshift is not even directly related to the recession velocity at the time the light set out, but it does have a simple interpretation: ''(1+z)'' is the factor by which the universe has expanded while the photon was travelling towards the observer.

===Expansion velocity vs relative velocity===
In using Hubble's law to determine distances, only the velocity due to the expansion of the universe can be used. Since gravitationally interacting galaxies move relative to each other independent of the expansion of the universe,&lt;ref name="AM-20170818"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scharping |first=Nathaniel |title=Gravitational Waves Show How Fast The Universe is Expanding |url=http://www.astronomy.com/news/2017/10/gravitational-waves-show-how-fast-the-universe-is-expanding |date=18 October 2017 |website=[[Astronomy (magazine)|Astronomy]] |accessdate=18 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; these relative velocities, called [[Peculiar velocity|peculiar velocities]], need to be accounted for in the application of Hubble's law.

The [[Redshift-space distortions|Finger of God]] effect is one result of this phenomenon. In [[Virial theorem|systems that are gravitationally bound]], such as galaxies or our planetary system, the expansion of space is a much weaker effect than the attractive force of gravity.

=== Time-dependence of Hubble parameter ===

Although &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is commonly called the Hubble constant, this is a misnomer since it is constant in space (at a fixed time), but varies with time in nearly all cosmological models; the Hubble parameter is a more correct term, with &lt;math&gt;H_0 &lt;/math&gt; denoting the present-day value.

Another common source of confusion is that the [[accelerating universe]] does ''not'' imply that the Hubble parameter is actually increasing with time; since &lt;math&gt; H(t) \equiv \dot{a}(t)/a(t) &lt;/math&gt;, in most accelerating models &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; increases relatively faster than &lt;math&gt;\dot{a}&lt;/math&gt; so H decreases with time. (The recession velocity of one chosen galaxy does increase, but different galaxies passing a sphere of fixed radius cross the sphere more slowly at later times).

On defining the dimensionless [[deceleration parameter]] 
:&lt;math&gt;  q \equiv - \frac {\ddot{a}\, a} {\dot{a}^2} &lt;/math&gt;, it follows that 
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dH}{dt} = -H^2 (1+q) &lt;/math&gt;

From this it is seen that the Hubble parameter is decreasing with time, unless &lt;math&gt; q &lt; -1 &lt;/math&gt;; the latter can only occur if the universe contains [[phantom energy]], regarded as theoretically somewhat improbable.

However, in the standard [[Lambda-CDM]] model, &lt;math&gt; q &lt;/math&gt; will tend to -1 from above in the distant future as the cosmological constant becomes increasingly dominant over matter; this implies that &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; will approach from above to a constant value of &lt;math&gt; \approx 57 &lt;/math&gt; km/s/Mpc, and the scale factor of the universe will then grow exponentially in time.

===Idealized Hubble's law===
The mathematical derivation of an idealized Hubble's law for a uniformly expanding universe is a fairly elementary theorem of geometry in 3-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]]/Newtonian coordinate space, which, considered as a [[metric space]], is entirely [[Cosmological principle|homogeneous and isotropic]] (properties do not vary with location or direction). Simply stated the theorem is this:
{{bquote|Any two points which are moving away from the origin, each along straight lines and with speed proportional to distance from the origin, will be moving away from each other with a speed proportional to their distance apart.}}

In fact this applies to non-Cartesian spaces as long as they are locally homogeneous and isotropic; specifically to the negatively and positively curved spaces frequently considered as cosmological models (see [[shape of the universe]]).

An observation stemming from this theorem is that seeing objects recede from us on Earth is not an indication that Earth is near to a center from which the expansion is occurring, but rather that ''every'' observer in an expanding universe will see objects receding from them.

===Ultimate fate and age of the universe===
[[Image:Friedmann universes.svg|thumb|400px|The [[age of the universe|age]] and [[ultimate fate of the universe]] can be determined by measuring the Hubble constant today and extrapolating with the observed value of the deceleration parameter, uniquely characterized by values of density parameters (Ω&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; for [[matter]] and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; for [[dark energy]]). A "closed universe" with Ω&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 1 and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 comes to an end in a [[Big Crunch]] and is considerably younger than its Hubble age. An "open universe" with Ω&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 and Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 expands forever and has an age that is closer to its Hubble age. For the [[accelerating universe]] with nonzero Ω&lt;sub&gt;Λ&lt;/sub&gt; that we inhabit, the age of the universe is coincidentally very close to the Hubble age.]]

The value of the Hubble parameter changes over time, either increasing or decreasing depending on the value of the so-called [[deceleration parameter]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;q = -\left(1+\frac{\dot H}{H^2}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In a universe with a deceleration parameter equal to zero, it follows that ''H'' = 1/''t'', where ''t'' is the time since the Big Bang. A non-zero, time-dependent value of &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; simply requires [[integral|integration]] of the Friedmann equations backwards from the present time to the time when the [[particle horizon|comoving horizon]] size was zero.

It was long thought that ''q'' was positive, indicating that the expansion is slowing down due to gravitational attraction. This would imply an age of the universe less than 1/''H'' (which is about 14 billion years). For instance, a value for ''q'' of 1/2 (once favoured by most theorists) would give the age of the universe as 2/(3''H''). The discovery in 1998 that ''q'' is apparently negative means that the universe could actually be older than 1/''H''. However, estimates of the [[age of the universe]] are very close to 1/''H''.

===Olbers' paradox===
{{Main|Olbers' paradox}}
The expansion of space summarized by the Big Bang interpretation of Hubble's law is relevant to the old conundrum known as [[Olbers' paradox]]: if the universe were [[Infinity|infinite]], [[static universe|static]], and filled with a uniform distribution of [[star]]s, then every line of sight in the sky would end on a star, and the sky would be as [[brightness|bright]] as the surface of a star. However, the night sky is largely dark. Since the 17th century, astronomers and other thinkers have proposed many possible ways to resolve this paradox, but the currently accepted resolution depends in part on the [[Big Bang]] theory and in part on the Hubble expansion. In a universe that exists for a finite amount of time, only the light of a finite number of stars has had a chance to reach us yet, and the paradox is resolved. Additionally, in an expanding universe, distant objects [[recessional velocity|recede]] from us, which causes the light emanating from them to be [[redshift]]ed and diminished in brightness.&lt;ref&gt;

===Dimensionless Hubble parameter===
Instead of working with Hubble's constant, a common practice is to introduce the '''dimensionless Hubble parameter''', usually denoted by ''h'', and to write the Hubble's parameter ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as ''h''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;km&amp;nbsp;[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Parsec|Mpc]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, all the relative uncertainty of the true value of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; being then relegated to ''h''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally a reference value different to 100 may be chosen, in which case a subscript is presented after ''h'' to avoid confusion; e.g. h&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt; H_0 = 70 \, h_{70} &lt;/math&gt; km&amp;nbsp;s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mpc&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which implies &lt;math&gt; h_{70} = h / 0.7 &lt;/math&gt;.

This should not be confused with the [[Dimensionless physical constant|dimensionless value]] of Hubble's constant, usually expressed in terms of [[Planck units]], with current  of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;×[[Planck time|''t''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;]]&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.18&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−61&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Determining the Hubble constant==
[[File:Recent Hubble's Constant Values.png|thumb|right|Value of the Hubble Constant including measurement uncertainty for recent surveys.&lt;ref name="planck_overview"/&gt;]]
The value of the Hubble constant is estimated by measuring the [[redshift]] of distant galaxies and then [[cosmic distance ladder|determining the distances to the same galaxies]] (by some other method than Hubble's law). Uncertainties in the physical assumptions used to determine these distances have caused varying estimates of the Hubble constant.&lt;ref name="NYT-20170220" /&gt;
 
The observations of astronomer [[Walter Baade]] led him to define distinct "[[stellar population|populations]]" for stars (Population I and Population II). The same observations led him to discover that there are two types of [[Cepheid variable]] stars. Using this discovery he recalculated the size of the known universe, doubling the previous calculation made by [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Baade W (1944) The resolution of Messier 32, NGC 205, and the central region of the Andromeda nebula.

In October 2018, scientists presented a new third way (two earlier methods, one based on [[redshift]]s and another on the [[cosmic distance ladder]], gave results that do not agree), using information from [[gravitational wave]] events (especially those involving the [[Neutron star merger|merger of neutron stars]], like [[GW170817]]), of determining the Hubble Constant, essential in establishing the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].&lt;ref name="PHYS-20181022"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lerner |first=Louise |title=Gravitational waves could soon provide measure of universe's expansion |url=https://phys.org/news/2018-10-gravitational-universe-expansion.html |date=22 October 2018 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=22 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20181017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Hsin-Yu |last2=Fishbach |first2=Maya |last3=Holz |first3=Daniel E. |title=A two per cent Hubble constant measurement from standard sirens within five years |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0606-0 |date=17 October 2018 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi=10.1038/s41586-018-0606-0 |accessdate=22 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earlier measurement and discussion approaches===
For most of the second half of the 20th century the value of &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; was estimated to be between 50 and {{nowrap|90 (km/s)/Mpc}}.

The value of the Hubble constant was the topic of a long and rather bitter controversy between [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]], who claimed the value was around 100, and [[Allan Sandage]], who claimed the value was near 50.&lt;ref name="Overbye"/&gt; In 1996, a debate moderated by [[John N. Bahcall|John Bahcall]] between [[Sidney van den Bergh]] and [[Gustav Andreas Tammann|Gustav Tammann]] was held in similar fashion to the earlier [[Great Debate (astronomy)|Shapley-Curtis debate]] over these two competing values.

This previously wide variance in estimates was partially resolved with the introduction of the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the universe in the late 1990s. With the ΛCDM model observations of high-redshift clusters at X-ray and microwave wavelengths using the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]], measurements of anisotropies in the [[cosmic microwave background]] radiation, and optical surveys all gave a value of around 70 for the constant.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

More recent measurements from the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck mission]] indicate a lower value of around 67;&lt;ref name="planck_overview"/&gt; although, even more recently, in February 2018, a higher value of 73 has been determined using an improved procedure involving the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20180222" /&gt;

''See table of measurements above for many recent and older measurements.''

===Acceleration of the expansion===
{{Main|Accelerating universe}}
A value for &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; measured from [[standard candle]] observations of [[Type Ia supernova]]e, which was determined in 1998 to be negative, surprised many astronomers with the implication that the expansion of the universe is currently "accelerating"&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although the Hubble factor is still decreasing with time, as mentioned above in the [[Hubble's law#Interpretation|Interpretation]] section; see the articles on [[dark energy]] and the [[ΛCDM model]]).

==Derivation of the Hubble parameter==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2014}}

Start with the [[Friedmann equations|Friedmann equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H^2 \equiv \left(\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3}\rho - \frac{kc^2}{a^2}+ \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the Hubble parameter, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scale factor (universe)|scale factor]], ''G'' is the [[gravitational constant]], &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the normalised spatial curvature of the universe and equal to −1, 0, or 1, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[cosmological constant]].

===Matter-dominated universe (with a cosmological constant)===

If the universe is [[Matter-dominated era|matter-dominated]], then the mass density of the universe &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; can just be taken to include matter so

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho_m(a) = \frac{\rho_{m_{0}}}{a^3},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{m_{0}}&lt;/math&gt; is the density of matter today. We know for nonrelativistic particles that their mass density decreases proportional to the inverse volume of the universe, so the equation above must be true. We can also define (see [[density parameter]] for &lt;math&gt;\Omega_m&lt;/math&gt;)

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G};&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_m \equiv \frac{\rho_{m_{0}}}{\rho_c} = \frac{8 \pi G}{3 H_0^2}\rho_{m_{0}};&lt;/math&gt;

therefore:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\rho_c \Omega_m}{a^3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also, by definition,

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_k \equiv \frac{-kc^2}{(a_0H_0)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_{\Lambda} \equiv \frac{\Lambda c^2}{3H_0^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where the subscript nought refers to the values today, and &lt;math&gt;a_0=1&lt;/math&gt;. Substituting all of this into the Friedmann equation at the start of this section and replacing &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a=1/(1+z)&lt;/math&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;H^2(z)= H_0^2 \left( \Omega_m (1+z)^{3} + \Omega_k (1+z)^{2} + \Omega_{\Lambda} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Matter- and dark energy-dominated universe ===

If the universe is both [[Matter-dominated era|matter-dominated]] and [[dark energy]]-dominated, then the above equation for the Hubble parameter will also be a function of the [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state of dark energy]]. So now:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \rho_m (a)+\rho_{de}(a),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho_{de}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density of the dark energy. By definition, an equation of state in cosmology is &lt;math&gt;P=w\rho c^2&lt;/math&gt;, and if this is substituted into the fluid equation, which describes how the mass density of the universe evolves with time, then

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\rho}+3\frac{\dot{a}}{a}\left(\rho+\frac{P}{c^2}\right)=0;&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\rho}{\rho}=-3\frac{da}{a}(1+w).&lt;/math&gt;

If ''w'' is constant, then

:&lt;math&gt;\ln{\rho}=-3(1+w)\ln{a};&lt;/math&gt;

implying:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=a^{-3(1+w)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, for dark energy with a constant equation of state ''w'', &lt;math&gt;\rho_{de}(a)= \rho_{de0}a^{-3(1+w)}&lt;/math&gt;. If this is substituted into the Friedman equation in a similar way as before, but this time set &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;, which assumes a spatially flat universe, then (see [[Shape of the universe]])

:&lt;math&gt;H^2(z)= H_0^2 \left( \Omega_m (1+z)^{3} + \Omega_{de}(1+z)^{3(1+w)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

If the dark energy derives from a cosmological constant such as that introduced by Einstein, it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;w=-1&lt;/math&gt;. The equation then reduces to the last equation in the matter-dominated universe section, with &lt;math&gt;\Omega_k &lt;/math&gt; set to zero. In that case the initial dark energy density &lt;math&gt;\rho_{de0}&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carroll|first1=Sean|title=Spacetime and Geometry: An Introduction to General Relativity|edition=illustrated|date=2004|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=San Fraancisco|isbn=978-0-8053-8732-2|page=328|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SKFQgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{de0} =  \frac{\Lambda c^2}{8 \pi G} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \Omega_{de}=\Omega_{\Lambda}.&lt;/math&gt;

If dark energy does not have a constant equation-of-state w, then

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_{de}(a)= \rho_{de0}e^{-3\int\frac{da}{a}\left(1+w(a)\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

and to solve this, &lt;math&gt;w(a)&lt;/math&gt; must be parametrized, for example if &lt;math&gt;w(a)=w_0+w_a(1-a)&lt;/math&gt;, giving

:&lt;math&gt;H^2(z)= H_0^2 \left( \Omega_m a^{-3} + \Omega_{de}a^{-3\left(1+w_0 +w_a \right)}e^{-3w_a(1-a)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Other ingredients have been formulated recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Units derived from the Hubble constant==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2014}}

===Hubble time===
The Hubble constant &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; has units of inverse time; the '''Hubble time''' ''t&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is simply defined as the inverse of the Hubble constant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawley|first1=John F.|last2=Holcomb|first2=Katherine A.|title=Foundations of modern cosmology|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-853096-1|pages=304|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;t_H \equiv \frac{1}{H_0} = \frac{1}{67.8\textrm{(km/s)/Mpc}} = 4.55\cdot 10^{17}\textrm{s}  = 14.4 \text{ billion years}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is slightly different from the age of the universe which is approximately 13.8 billion years. The Hubble time is the age it would have had if the expansion had been linear, and it is different from the real age of the universe because the expansion is not linear; they are related by a dimensionless factor which depends on the mass-energy content of the universe, which is around 0.96 in the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]].

We currently appear to be approaching a period where the expansion of the universe is exponential due to the increasing dominance of [[vacuum energy]]. In this regime, the Hubble parameter is constant, and the universe grows by a factor [[E (mathematical constant)|''e'']] each Hubble time:

:&lt;math&gt;H \equiv \frac{\dot a}{a} = \textrm{constant} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad a \propto e^{Ht} = e^{\frac{t}{t_H}}&lt;/math&gt;

Over long periods of time, the dynamics are complicated by [[general relativity]], [[dark energy]], [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], etc., as explained above.

===Hubble length===
The Hubble length or Hubble distance is a unit of distance in cosmology, defined as &lt;math&gt;cH_0^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; — the speed of light multiplied by the Hubble time. It is equivalent to 4,550 million parsecs or 14.4 billion light years. (The numerical value of the Hubble length in light years is, by definition, equal to that of the Hubble time in years.) The Hubble distance would be the distance between the Earth and the galaxies which are ''currently'' receding from us at the speed of light, as can be seen by substituting &lt;math&gt;D=cH_0^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; into the equation for Hubble's law, {{nowrap|''v'' {{=}} ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''D''}}.

===Hubble volume===
{{main|Hubble volume}}
The Hubble volume is sometimes defined as a volume of the universe with a [[Comoving and proper distances|comoving]] size of &lt;math&gt;cH_0^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; The exact definition varies: it is sometimes defined as the volume of a sphere with radius &lt;math&gt;cH_0^{-1},&lt;/math&gt; or alternatively, a cube of side &lt;math&gt;cH_0^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt; Some cosmologists even use the term Hubble volume to refer to the volume of the [[observable universe]], although this has a radius approximately three times larger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2358">The '''Hubert Curien Laboratory''' or ''Laboratoire Hubert Curien ''is a joint research unit (UMR 5516) of [[Jean Monnet University|the University of Saint-Etienne]], the National Research Centre [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]], and (since 2016) the [[École supérieure d'optique|Institut d'Optique Graduate School]]. It is composed of about 90 researchers, professors and assistant professors, 20 	engineers and administrative staff, and 130 Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researcher. This makes the Hubert Curien Laboratory with a total of about 240 staff the most important research structure of [[Saint-Etienne]].

The various research activities of the laboratory are organized into two scientific departments:  "[[Optics]], [[photonics]] and [[microwave]]" and "[[Computer science]], [[Telecommunication|telecom]] and [[Image analysis|image]]". The research activity is structured into scientific projects within 6 main teams: "Micro/Nano structuring", "Radiation-matter Interaction", "Image Science &amp; computer vision", "Data Intelligence", "Connected Intelligence" and "Secure Embedded Systems &amp; Hardware Architectures."

The Hubert Curien laboratory coordinates the laboratory of excellence MANUTECH-SISE and the equipment of excellence MANUTECH-USD in partnership with some laboratories of the [[University of Lyon]] (LTDS, LDF, LaMCoS) and the company HEF. The partners aim at understanding the surface phenomena such as
[[wear]], [[friction]], [[wetting]], etc. They also aim at creating and controlling the surface functionalities, and at developing advanced manufacturing processes of surfaces and interfaces of different level, in particular processes of  ultrafast laser texturation.

In the last few years, the laboratory has paying a special attention to interdisciplinary scientific projects including in materials and surface engineering, in [[image processing]], in [[Computer vision]] or in [[artificial intelligence]].

The term '''human biocomputer''', coined by [[John C. Lilly]], refers to the "hardware" of the [[human anatomy]]. This would include the [[brain]], [[internal organs]], and other human organ systems such as [[cardiovascular]], [[digestion|digestive]], [[endocrine]], [[immune]], [[Integumentary system|integumentary]], [[lymphatic]], [[muscular]], [[Nervous system|nervous]], [[reproductive]], [[respiratory]], [[skeletal]], and [[urinary]] systems. The biocomputer has stored program properties, and self-metaprogramming properties, with limits determinable and to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

== General clarification ==
The levels of the human biocomputer are explained thus:
Levels from one to two are the boundaries between external reality and the body. Certain energies and materials (heat, light, sound, food, and secretions) pass through this boundary in special places. Levels two to three are the boundaries of body and brain, in which special structures such as blood vessels, nerve fibers, and cerebrospinal fluid pass. Levels four through eleven are in the brain circuitry, and is the software inside the biocomputer. Levels after ten are termed unknown. This is to allow an openeness for future scientific research, and discoveries. This is also to illustrate the unwillingness to subscribe to any dogmatic belief, to encourage creative, courageous and imaginative investigation, to emphasize the necessity for unknown factors on all levels, and to point out the [[heuristic]] nature of this schema.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Mind ===
[[Mind]], which is defined as the sum total of all the programs and metaprograms (and even supraself metaprograms) of a human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; This is the software and is looked at as the opposite of the hardware.
=== Brain ===
The brain is defined as the visible, palpable living set of structures to be included in the human biocomputer.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stored programs ===
A stored program is defined as a set of instructions which are placed in memory storage of the biocomputer, and which control the biocomputer when orders are given for that program to be activated.&lt;ref&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; These programs can be activated by the same biocomputer, another biocomputer, or a situation outside of the biocomputer.

=== Metaprogramming ===
Metaprogramming is defined as a set of instructions, descriptions, and implementations of related thoughts and actions(programs).&lt;ref name="potter"&gt;Lilly, Potter (2004), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;  Self metaprogramming involves the creation, revision, and reorganization of programs and metaprograms.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

[[Image:Ion Beam Shepherd.png|thumb|right|500px| Ion-beam shepherd (IBS) deorbiting a space debris]]

An '''ion-beam shepherd''' ('''IBS''') is a concept in which the orbit and/or attitude of a spacecraft or a generic orbiting body is modified by having a beam of quasi-neutral plasma impinging against its surface to create a force and/or a torque on the target. [[Ion thruster|Ion and plasma thrusters]] commonly used to propel spacecraft can be employed to produce a collimated plasma/ion beam and point it towards the body.
The fact that the beam can be generated on a "shepherd" spacecraft placed in proximity of the target without physical attachment with the latter provides an interesting solution for space applications such as space debris removal, asteroid deflection and space transportation in general. 
The [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM) is exploring this concept&lt;ref&gt;C. Bombardelli and J. Peláez, "Sistema de modificación de la posición y actitud de cuerpos en órbita por medio de satélites guía", Patent number P201030354. Presented at the Spanish Patent Office on March 11, 2010. PCT Patent Application PCT/ES2011/000011&lt;/ref&gt; by developing analytical and numerical control models in collaboration with the [[Advanced Concepts Team]] of the European Space Agency. The concept has also been proposed independently by [[JAXA]] and [[CNES]].

==How it works==
The force and torque transmitted to the target originate from the momentum carried out by the plasma ions (typically xenon) which are accelerated to a few tens of kilometer per second by an ion or plasma thruster. The ions that reach the target surface lose their energy following nuclear collision in the substrate of the target material.
In order to keep a constant distance between the target and the shepherd spacecraft the latter must carry a secondary propulsion system (e.g. another ion or plasma thruster) compensating for the reaction force created by the targeted ion beam.

==Applications==
The concept has been suggested as a possible solution for active space debris removal,&lt;ref&gt;C. Bombardelli and J. Peláez, "Ion Beam Shepherd for Contactless Space Debris Removal ", Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, Vol. 34, No. 3, May–June 2011, pp 916–920. http://sdg.aero.upm.es/PUBLICATIONS/PDF/2011/AIAA-51832-628.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Kitamura «Large Space Debris Reorbiter using Ion Beam Irradiation », 61 st International Astronautical Congress, Prague, Czech Republic, Paper IAC-10.A6.4.8, September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Bonnal, J.M. Ruault, P. Bultel, and M.C. Desjean, «High Level Requirements for an Operational Space Debris Deorbiter», 61 st International Astronautical Congress, Prague, Czech Republic, Paper IAC-10.A6.4.5, September 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V.S. Aslanov, A.S. Ledkov, «Attitude Motion of Cylindrical Space Debris during Its Removal by Ion Beam», Mathematical Problems in Engineering, vol. 2017, Article ID 1986374, 7 pages, https://www.hindawi.com/journals/mpe/2017/1986374/&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for accurate deflection of Earth threatening asteroids.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bombardelli and J. Peláez, «Ion Beam Shepherd for Asteroid Deflection », Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics, Vol. 34, No. 4, July–August 2011, pp. 1270–1272, http://sdg.aero.upm.es/PUBLICATIONS/PDF/2011/AIAA-51640-157.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Further in the future the concept could play an important role in areas such as space mobility, transportation, assembly of large orbital infrastructures and small asteroid capturing in Earth orbit.

==Control==
Beam divergence angles of  ion and plasma thrusters, typically greater than 10 degrees make it necessary to have the shepherd flying not more than a few target diameters away if efficient beam overlap is to be reached. Proximity formation flying guidance  and control as well as collision avoidance are among the most critical technological challenges of the concept.

'''Jawahir Thontowi''' was born in [[West Java]], on 8 September 1956. He is currently working as a lecturer in the [[Universitas Islam Indonesia]]. His education background is from the Law faculty of the Islamic University of Indonesia and on 1999 graduated his PhD from [[University of Western Australia|the University of Western Australia]] concerning [[Legal anthropology|Legal Anthropology]].

He was a member of the Constitution Commission RI 2003-2004 1, and received various awards and acknowledgments. He has become a speaker in the International Human Right Conference (Custom Center for Human Rights Studies, Law School [[Monash University]] of Melbourne on December 2003)2, Delegation for International Conference on Clinical Legal Education in [[Cambodia]], [[Phnom Penh]] on November 2005 and received a Grant to become an Instructor in the International Symposium on Conflict Resolution –ICMCR, [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|Erasmus University]].

Jawahir Thontowi is a professor in legal anthropology and he is an expert on the subject. The in a resource person Indonesia related to indigenous law and even regarding [[terrorism]]. He is a key person in the development of Indonesian Law.

26 January 2010 He was accepted as the title of Professor from the Minister of Education Republic of Indonesia for his dedication in the legal science and his contribution to law in Indonesia.3

In September 2010 undergoing the selection process in the Judicial Commission Indonesia. He is rank No. 1 candidate for the peak position in the Judicial Commission. 4

==Academic Background==
In 1976 Jawahir Thontowi graduated from the one of the first Education for Islamic Judges in Indonesia established in Yogyakarta. This was a school which will become of the pioneers of legal practitioners in Indonesia. As an example the head of the Constitution Court in Indonesia Mahfud MD is an alumnus.

Between 1978 and 1979 became the president of the Student Representative Council in The law faculty UII and at the same time the Vice director of the Human Right Commission which was later turned into the Legal Aid Institute in Yogyakarta.  In 1979-1980 become the Secretary General for Student Government Council UII then became the staff member of the community development in Muslim students association Yogyakarta.  During these years he has become a prominent activist in the campus which builds the foundation of his organization skills in later life.

In 1981 he received an LLB Degree from the Faculty of Law Universitas Islam Indonesia. Then in 1984 became the Head of Community Development Division Institute for Research and Community at the Universitas Islam Indonesia.  Then in 1986 took a course in Center for Research Training of Social Science, Universitas Hasanudin. In August that year he received an Award for an outstanding field research Stunent given by YIIS and PLPIIS in Jakarta. Working in the campus and research would then lead to further development in his academic career and an opportunity to attain higher education in Australia. This was a turning point that would excel in academic career.

In 1990 he started a preliminary Masters of Arts at the Anthology Department of UWA . Then in 1992 receive a research grant for the post graduate students from the University of Western Australia.  In 1998 finally completed his Ph.D Degree in the University of Western Australia.  He was ready to go back to Indonesia to implement his knowledge and skill in an Indonesia context, especially going back to campus to teach again. 
Upon return from Australia and going back to Indonesia holding a Ph.D he was appoint Head of the International Department for 3 years in 1999-2001. During this time he was focusing on building and improving the law faculty and made it more dynamic. He pas the team leader in various initiatives conducted by the campus such Designing University Joint Collaboration and development then Establishing the Doctorate Program in Law Faculty University.  This was a major breakthrough for UII having established a Doctorate program in the field of Law.

September 2000 he became the Director of the Doctorate Program law faculty.  In September the next year in 2001 he made an initiative to make the International Program for Law in the campus which took a one-year process. For the Law faculty he made two important contributions that are the establishment of the Doctorate program and the second the International program. March that year he was elected to become the Dean of the Law Faculty until 2006.

In 2006 the election for the Rector of UII He participated in first direct election for the position being the fourth rank,  Edy Suandi Hamid having 284.5 votes,  Amir Mu’alim 92 votes, Luthfi Hasan, 87.5 votes.  Eddy Suandi Hamid came out as winner to lead the campus.  The next election for the position as the Vice Rector I to be in charge of academics it was between Jawahir Thontowi and Sarwidi which was a very close election and Sarwidi manages to be elected for the position having 309,5 votes compared to only 298,5 votes. Supporters of Jawahir Thontowi in campus still remain strong.

In 2010 election Jawahir Thontowi became in the running for the peak positions in campus again. Still competing versus Edy Suandi Hamid and Sarwidi,  the election process was very tight Edy Suandi Hamid with only 32 votes, Jawahir Thontowi 31 votes and Sarwidi 25 votes.  Interesting that in 2006 elections he lost to Sarwidi for the position but now in the 2010 he has more votes.

After losing from the selection process, he came back to the law faculty to continue to teach, practice what he has learned and implement his understanding about the law in Indonesia. This experience will be the foundations of the position in the future for the next election process in 2014 to become the rector of campus. To have the highest academic career in UII starting as a student activist, then becoming a researcher and lecturer, then become the dean of the law faculty and hope the next position becoming the rector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4259">'''Jonathan Høegh von Leunbach''' ['lɔjnbɑk] (16 December 1884 - 24 September 1955)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/Jonathan-Hoegh-Leunbach/6000000018966190264&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] doctor.  During the [[interwar period]] he made a significant but controversial social effort to help women of limited means with [[sex education]], [[birth control]] and [[abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/L%C3%A6ger/Jonathan_H%C3%B8egh_von_Leunbach  Article in Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Jonathan Leunbach was the son of Jørgen Høegh Leunbach (1842-1903) and Cassandra Wilhelmine Hjardemaal (1845-1925).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geni.com/people/J%C3%B8rgen-H%C3%B8egh-Leunbach/6000000032962371954&lt;/ref&gt; He took a master's degree in medicine in 1912 and worked as a general practitioner in Brønderslev in [[Jylland]] 1915-1917. After some years of hospital employment in [[Copenhagen]], he established himself here in 1922 as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.museion.ku.dk/da/aktuelt/udstillinger/9-laeger-9-liv/de-9/jonathan-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt;

Being a [[socialism|socialist]], Leunbach was in favour of [[Wilhelm Reich|Wilhelm Reich's]] sexual political ideas. In the 1920s he was known to the public through his agitation for better sex education, safe and affordable contraception and better access to abortion, particularly for poor families with many children.  In 1924, together with writer [[Thit Jensen]] he initiated ''Foreningen for seksuel Oplysning'' (Organization for Sexual Awareness), which worked for women's right to use [[birth control]], in particular the [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]].

Thit Jensen broke off her collaboration with Leunbach in 1928, as she did not support his work for induced abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_litteraturs_historie/Dansk_litteraturs_historie_3/Kvinden_i_historien_-_Thit_Jensen/Det_frivillige_hellige_moderskab&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, Leunbach was a respected name, being co-founder of  the ''Verdensligaen for seksuel Reform'' (World League for Sexual Reform) in Copenhagen in 1927, while in Denmark he was met with massive resistance from most political parties, medical and ecclesial communities as well as the women's rights organisation [[Dansk Kvindesamfund]].

In the early 1930s Leunbach performed some 300 abortions,&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;  and he was charged twice with complicity in illegal abortion. He was acquitted in 1935, but the following year was sentenced to three months in prison,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dagensmedicin.dk/opinion/debat/forsvar-for-leunbach/&lt;/ref&gt; lost his civil rights for five years, including being barred from working as a doctor. He and some contemporaries regarded this as a political conviction. Leunbachs work helped launch a debate on abortion, which in 1937 brought the Danish parliament to pass Denmark's first abortion legislation, which reduced the penalty for induced abortion and gave better opportunities to let a woman have an abortion for health reasons.

In 1939, the private organisation ''Mødrehjælpen'' (Mothers' Help), which was created in 1924 to help pregnant women to have their child, regardless of whether they were married or single, was made part of the public Danish social system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/historie/doktor-leunbach&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[sexual liberation]], induced abortion was made legal in Denmark in 1973, and much of what Leunbach originally fought for is now regarded as self-evident rights.

Leunbach died in a drowning accident in Italy and is buried in [[Hellerup Cemetery]].

== Miscellaneous ==
Leunbach is mentioned in episode 10 of the Danish TV series [[Matador (Danish TV series)|Matador]], where in 1935 one of the leading ladies creates a commotion in the town by supporting his thoughts on abortion.&lt;ref&gt;http://tommierieland.dk/film/matado10.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;http://www.dr.dk/skole/Historie/1950erne/sexogmoral/moral1940/20100514154121_1.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://matadoronline.dk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manus-episode10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">In the Americas (defined as [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) [[ITU region|region]] 2), the [[FM broadcast band]] consists of 101 channels, each 200 kHz wide, in the frequency range from 87.8 to 108.0 MHz, with "center frequencies" running from 87.9 Mhz to 107.9 MHz. For most purposes an FM station is associated with its center frequency. However, each FM frequency has also been assigned a channel number, which ranges from 200 to 300.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fcc.gov/media/radio/fm-frequencies-end-odd-decimal"Why Do FM Frequencies End in an Odd Decimal?"] (fcc.gov)&lt;/ref&gt;

FM channel numbers are most commonly used for internal regulatory purposes. The range originally began with channel 201 (88.1 MHz), or a value high enough to avoid confusion with television channel numbers, which over the years have had values ranging from [[Channel 1 (North American TV)|1]] to [[channel 83|83]]. Having a gap between the highest TV channel number and the lowest FM channel number allowed for expansion, which occurred in the 1980s when FM channel 200 (87.9 MHz) was added.

FM channel numbers are commonly used for listing FM Station Allotments, which are the FM station assignments designated for individual communities. In the United States they are also used in the callsigns of low-powered FM [[Broadcast relay station|translators]] relaying AM or FM station signals. For example, the "237" in the callsign for translator [[K237FR]] in Tumwater, Washington indicates that the station is transmitting on channel 237, which corresponds to 95.3 MHz.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3552">The '''Marxist Literary Group''' ('''MLG''') is an affiliate of the [[Modern Language Association]] centered on scholarly discussion of the contributions of Marxism and the Marxist tradition in the humanities and related disciplines. It holds an annual summer institute, holds sessions at the MLA convention, and publishes the journal ''[[Mediations Journal|Mediations]]''. It is also an affiliate of the Midwest Modern Language Association and occasionally sponsors sessions at other regional MLA conferences.

==History==
The MLG was formed in 1969 by [[Fredric Jameson]] and several of his graduate students at the University of California, San Diego.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://mlg.eserver.org/about/a-short-history-of-the-mlg/] A Short History of the MLG&lt;/ref&gt; The group emerged from the 1968 MLA conference in New York City. Whereas groups such as the Radical Caucus focused their energies on pedagogy and social activism, the MLG was concerned with providing a firm theoretical grounding for the New Left as well as cultivating Marxist intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Latimer&gt;Latimer, Dan. "Jameson and Postmodernism." New Left Review, no. 129 (1981), pp. 116-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MLG quickly became the largest affiliate group in the MLA, running 14 sessions at the 1975 conference and organizing Marxist scholars nationwide. The first Institute on Culture and Society took place in St.. Cloud, Minnesota, in 1976, including speakers such as [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Stanley Aronowitz]], [[Terry Eagleton]], [[Gayatri Spivak]], Michael Ryan, Gene Holland, June Howard, and [[John Beverley (Latin Americanist)|John Beverly]]. Subsequent Institutes have dealt with a wide range of topics, including [[cultural studies]], [[postmodernism]], [[post-structuralism]], [[psychoanalysis]], [[post-colonialism|post-colonial discourse]], [[feminism]], and left politics. A newsletter was set up in the early 1970s, which evolved into the journal Mediations by 1991. These activities were instrumental in allowing Marxist theory and criticism to gain a foothold in the academy.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1035">The '''National Council of Labour Colleges''' ('''NCLC''') was an organisation set up in the [[United Kingdom]] to foster [[working class]] self-education.

The organisation was founded in 1921 as a co-ordinating body for the movement of labour colleges,&lt;ref name="jarvis"&gt;Peter Jarvis, ''An International Dictionary of Adult and Continuing Education'', pp.139, 218&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Central Labour College]].

The National Council of Labour Colleges absorbed the [[Plebs League]] the year after the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike]], and continued to publish the ''Plebs' Magazine''.&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations'', Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley (2000) p157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, the NCLC merged with the Workers' Educational Trade Union Committee to form the [[Trades Union Congress]] Education Department.&lt;ref name="jarvis" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5526">'''Osmoconformers''' are marine [[organisms]] that maintain an internal environment that is [[osmotic]] to their external environment.&lt;ref name=Marion&gt;{{cite web|last1=McClary|first1=Dr. Marion|title=Osmoconformer|url=http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155074/|website=Encyclopedia of Earth|accessdate=March 13, 2015|date=August 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that the osmotic pressure, or [[osmolarity]], of the organism’s cells is equal to the [[osmotic]] pressure of their surrounding environment.  By minimizing the osmotic gradient, this subsequently minimizes the net [[inflow (hydrology)|influx]] and [[Flux|efflux]] of water into and out of cells.  Even though osmoconformers have an internal environment that's isosmotic to their external environment the types of [[ions]] in the two environments differ greatly in order to allow critical biological functions to occur.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Neil A.|last2=Lawrence|first2=G. Mitchell|last3=Reece|first3=Jane B.|title=Biology Concepts &amp; Connections|date=2000|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings|pages=506–507|chapter=Control of the Internal Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A benefit to osmoconformation is that organisms don’t need to expend as much energy as [[osmoregulator]]s in order to regulate ion gradients.  However, to ensure the correct types of ions are in their desired location, a small amount of energy is expended on ion transport.  A disadvantage to osmoconformation is that organisms are subject to changes in the osmolarity of their environment.&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradley|first1=Timothy J.|title=Animal Osmoregulation|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University|pages=58–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== Invertebrates ===

Most osmoconformers are [[marine invertebrates]] such as [[echinoderms]] (such as starfish), [[mussels]], marine crabs, [[lobsters]], [[jellyfish]], [[ascidians]] ([[sea squirts]] - primitive chordates), and [[scallops]].  Some [[insects]] are also osmoconformers.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Some osmoconformers, such as echinoderms, are [[stenohaline]], which means they can only survive in a limited range of external osmolarities.  The survival of such organisms is thus contingent on their external osmotic environment remaining relatively constant.  &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt; On the other hand, some osmoconformers are classified as [[euryhaline]], which means they can survive in a broad range of external osmolarities. Mussels are a prime example of a euryhaline osmoconformer.  Mussels have adapted to survive in a broad range of external salinities due to their ability to close their shells which allows them to seclude themselves from unfavorable external environments. &lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

=== Craniates ===

There are a couple of examples of osmoconformers that are [[craniates]] such as [[hagfish]], skates and [[sharks]]. Their body fluid is isoosmotic with seawater, but their high osmolarity is maintained by making the concentration of organic solutes unnaturally high. Sharks concentrate urea in their body, and since urea denatures proteins at high concentrations, they also accumulate [[trimethylamine N-oxide]] (TMAO) to counter the effect. Sharks adjust their internal osmolarity according to the osmolarity of the sea water surrounding them. Rather than ingesting sea water in order to change their internal salinity, sharks are able to absorb sea water directly. This is due to the high concentration of urea kept inside their bodies. This high concentration of urea creates a [[diffusion]] gradient which permits the shark to absorb water in order to equalize the concentration difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gibson|first1=Amelia|title=Sharks|url=http://www.sharksinfo.com/osmoregulation.html|website=Sharks Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crab-eating frog]], or Rana cancrivora, is an example of a vertebrate osmoconformer. The crab-eating frog also regulates its rates of urea retention and excretion, which allows them to survive and maintain their status as osmoconformers in a wide range of external salinities.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;  Hagfish maintain an internal ion composition plasma that differs from that of seawater.  The internal ionic environment of hagfish contains a lower concentration of [[divalent]] ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, SO4 2-) and a slightly higher concentration of [[monovalent ion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vu1uzL0p7xsC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;lpg=PA300&amp;dq=osmoconformer+hagfish#v=onepage&amp;q=osmoconformer%20hagfish&amp;f=true | title = The Biology of Hagfishes | isbn = 9780412785306 | author1 = Jørgensen | first1 = Jørgen Mørup | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagfish therefore have to expend some energy for osmoregulation.

==Biochemistry==

[[Ion gradient]]s are crucial to many major biological functions on a cellular level.  Consequently, the ionic composition of an organism's internal environment is highly regulated with respect to its external environment.  Osmoconformers have adapted so that they utilize the ionic composition of their external environment, which is typically seawater, in order to support important biological functions.  For instance, seawater has a high concentration of [[sodium ion]]s, which helps support [[muscle contraction]] and [[neuronal]] signaling when paired with high internal concentrations of [[potassium ion]]s.&lt;ref name=Bradley /&gt;

__NOTOC__
[[File:Mating Pseudobiceros bedfordi.png|thumb|Two flatworms of the species ''[[Pseudobiceros bedfordi]]'' preparing for penis fencing. ''P. bedfordi'' is exceptional in that it applies sperm onto the partner's skin rather than injecting it.]]
'''Penis fencing''' is a [[mating]] [[ethology|behavior]] engaged in by many species of [[flatworm]], such as ''[[Pseudobiceros hancockanus]]''. Species which engage in the practice are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]]; each individual has both egg-producing [[ovaries]] and sperm-producing [[testes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/shapeoflife/episodes/hunt_explo2.html |title=Fighting to mate: flatworm penis fencing |author=Leslie Newman |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The flatworms "[[fencing|fence]]" using extendable two-headed [[dagger]]-like stylets.  These stylets are pointed (and in some species hooked) in order to pierce their mate's epidermis and inject sperm into the [[Circulatory system|haemocoel]] in an act known as intradermal hypodermic insemination, or [[traumatic insemination]].  Pairs can either compete, with only one individual transferring sperm to the other, or the pair can transfer sperm bilaterally.  Both forms of sperm transfer can occur in the same species, depending on various factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mating behaviour in the sea slug Elysia timida (Opisthobranchia, Sacoglossa): hypodermic injection, sperm transfer and balanced reciprocity|journal = Frontiers in Zoology|date = 2007-07-04|issn = 1742-9994|pmc = 1934903|pmid = 17610714|pages = 17|volume = 4|doi = 10.1186/1742-9994-4-17|first = Valerie|last = Schmitt|first2 = Nils|last2 = Anthes|first3 = Nico K|last3 = Michiels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unilateral sperm transfer ==
One organism will inseminate the other, with the inseminating individual acting as the "father". The sperm is absorbed through pores or sometimes wounds in the skin from the partner's stylet, causing fertilization in the second, who becomes the "mother".&lt;ref name="Michiels"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Michiels | first1 = N.K. | last2 = Newman | first2 = L.J. | year = 1998 | title = Sex and violence in hermaphrodites | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 391 | issue = | page = 647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sn"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/pages/sn_arc98/2_14_98/fob2.htm Hermaphrodites duel for manhood], ''Science News Online''.

Parturition, while necessary for successful offspring production, requires a considerable [[parental investment]] in time and energy, and according to [[Bateman's principle]], almost always burdens the "mother".  Thus, from an [[optimality model]] it is usually preferable for an organism to inseminate than to be inseminated.  However, in many species that engage in this form of copulatory competition, each "father" will continue to fence with other partners until it is inseminated.  In ''[[Alderia modesta]]'', individuals will [[Sperm storage|store sperm]] from several "fencing matches" before laying their eggs, and smaller individuals will more often inseminate a larger partner, with larger individuals spending more energy on laying eggs when paired with a smaller partner on the occasion that they transfer sperm unilaterally.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://rydberg.biology.colostate.edu/angelonilab/Site/Publications_files/Angeloni2003.pdf|title = Sexual selection in a simultaneous hermaphrodite with hypodermic insemination: body size, allocation to sexual roles and paternity|last = Angeloni|first = Lisa|date = 21 October 2002|journal = Animal Behaviour|volume = 66|issue = 3|pages = 417–426|doi = 10.1006/anbe.2003.2255|pmid = |access-date = 1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bilateral sperm transfer ==
Commonly, many hermaphroditic species mutually inseminate, or trade sperm, rather than compete, ''[[Chelidonura sandrana]]'' as an example.&lt;ref name="sn" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Evolutionary Conflict: Sperm Wars, Phantom Inseminations|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982205010882|accessdate = 2015-12-02|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.019|volume=15|issue = 19|journal=Current Biology|pages=R801–R803|pmid=16213811 | last1 = Dall | first1 = SR | last2 = Wedell | first2 = N|date = 2005-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tiger flatworm, [[Maritigrella crozierae|''Maritigrella crozieri'']], also transfers sperm bilaterally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is the geometric probability of mating success in flatworms, Platyhelminthes?|url = http://dspace.nelson.usf.edu/xmlui/handle/10806/11724|website = dspace.nelson.usf.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US|first = Nguyen|last = Danh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In many species that engage in bilateral insemination, sperm trading is conditional.  If one partner "cheats", and does not transfer sperm, the other partner will either prematurely abandon the partner, or will engage in typical mating behavior without transferring sperm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gender trading in a hermaphrodite|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098220501105X|journal = Current Biology|date = 2005-10-11|pages = R792–R793|volume = 15|issue = 19|doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2005.09.035|first = Nils|last = Anthes|first2 = Annika|last2 = Putz|first3 = Nico K.|last3 = Michiels|pmid=16213807}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other species will alternate which partner transfers sperm, engaging in multiple bouts of fencing with the same partner over time.  In ''[[Alderia modesta|A. modesta]],'' bilateral sperm transfer is the most common, especially in similarly-sized mate pairs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Other uses==
The term is also applied, usually informally, to homosexual activity between two males among [[bonobo]]s; same-sex genital-genital rubbing is used in bonobo society to cement bonds, reduce conflict, and express communal excitement over food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=De Waal |first1=Frans B.M. |title=Bonobo Sex and Society |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bonobo-sex-and-society-2006-06/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several [[whale]] species also engage in penis fencing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Bruce Bagemihl, ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity,'' St. Martin's Press, 1999; {{ISBN|978-0312253776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''physics engine''' is [[computer software]] that provides an approximate [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of certain [[physical system]]s, such as [[rigid body dynamics]] (including [[collision detection]]), [[soft body dynamics]], and [[Fluid simulation|fluid dynamics]], of use in the [[wikt:domain|domain]]s of [[computer graphics]], [[video game]]s and [[film]]. Their main uses are in video games (typically as [[game middleware|middleware]]), in which case the [[simulation]]s are in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]]. The term is sometimes used more generally to describe any [[software system]] for simulating physical phenomena, such as [[High-performance computing|high-performance scientific simulation]].

== Description ==
There are generally two classes of physics [[Software engine|engine]]s: [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] and high-precision. High-precision physics engines require more processing power to calculate very [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] physics and are usually used by scientists and computer animated movies. Real-time physics engines—as used in video games and other forms of interactive computing—use simplified calculations and decreased accuracy to compute in time for the game to respond at an appropriate rate for gameplay.

=== Scientific engines ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
One of the first general purpose computers, [[ENIAC]], was used as a very simple type of physics engine. It was used to design ballistics tables to help the United States military estimate where [[artillery]] shells of various mass would land when fired at varying angles and gunpowder charges, also accounting for drift caused by wind. The results were calculated a single time only, and were tabulated into printed tables handed out to the artillery commanders.

Physics engines have been commonly used on supercomputers since the 1980s to perform [[computational fluid dynamics]] modeling, where particles are assigned [[force vector]]s that are combined to show circulation. Due to the requirements of speed and high precision, special computer processors known as [[vector processor]]s were developed to accelerate the calculations. The techniques can be used to model weather patterns in [[weather forecasting]], wind tunnel data for designing air- and watercraft or motor vehicles including racecars, and thermal cooling of computer processors for improving [[heat sink]]s. As with many calculation-laden processes in computing, the accuracy of the simulation is related to the resolution of the simulation and the precision of the calculations; [[butterfly effect|small fluctuations]] not modeled in the simulation can drastically change the predicted results.

Tire manufacturers use physics simulations to examine how new [[tread|tire tread]] types will perform under wet and dry conditions, using new tire materials of varying flexibility and under different levels of weight loading.

=== Game engines ===
{{Main|Game engine|Game physics}}

In most computer games, speed of the processors and [[gameplay]] are more important than accuracy of simulation.  This leads to designs for physics engines that produce results in real-time but that replicate real world physics only for simple cases and typically with some approximation. More often than not, the simulation is geared towards providing a "perceptually correct" approximation rather than a real simulation. However some game engines, such as [[Source_(game_engine)|Source]], use physics in puzzles or in combat situations. This requires more accurate physics so that, for example, the momentum of an object can knock over an obstacle or lift a sinking object.

Physics-based character animation in the past only used [[rigid body dynamics]] because they are faster and easier to calculate, but modern games and movies are starting to use [[soft body dynamics|soft body physics]]. Soft body physics are also used for particle effects, liquids and cloth. Some form of limited [[fluid dynamics]] simulation is sometimes provided to simulate water and other liquids as well as the flow of fire and explosions through the air.

==== Collision detection ====
Objects in games interact with the player, the environment, and each other. Typically, most 3D objects in games are represented by two separate meshes or shapes. One of these meshes is the highly complex and detailed shape visible to the player in the game, such as a vase with elegant curved and looping handles. For purpose of speed, a second, simplified invisible mesh is used to represent the object to the physics engine so that the physics engine treats the example vase as a simple cylinder. It would thus be impossible to insert a rod or fire a projectile through the handle holes on the vase, because the physics engine model is based on the cylinder and is unaware of the handles. The simplified mesh used for physics processing is often referred to as the [[collision geometry]]. This may be a [[bounding box]], sphere, or [[convex hull]]. Engines that use bounding boxes or bounding spheres as the final shape for collision detection are considered extremely simple. Generally a bounding box is used for broad phase [[collision detection]] to narrow down the number of possible collisions before costly mesh on mesh collision detection is done in the narrow phase of collision detection.

Another aspect of precision in [[discrete collision detection]] involves the [[framerate]], or the number of moments in time per second when physics is calculated. Each frame is treated as separate from all other frames, and the space between frames is not calculated. A low framerate and a small fast-moving object causes a situation where the object does not move smoothly through space but instead seems to teleport from one point in space to the next as each frame is calculated. Projectiles moving at sufficiently high speeds will miss targets, if the target is small enough to fit in the gap between the calculated frames of the fast moving projectile. Various techniques are used to overcome this flaw, such as ''[[Second Life]]''{{'}}s representation of projectiles as arrows with invisible trailing tails longer than the gap in frames to collide with any object that might fit between the calculated frames. By contrast, [[continuous collision detection]] such as in [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] or [[Havok (software)|Havok]] does not suffer this problem.

==== Soft-body dynamics ====
An alternative to using bounding box-based rigid body physics systems is to use a [[finite element]]-based system. In such a system, a 3-dimensional, volumetric [[tessellation]] is created of the 3D object. The tessellation results in a number of finite elements which represent aspects of the object's physical properties such as toughness, plasticity, and volume preservation. Once constructed, the finite elements are used by a [[solver]] to model the stress within the 3D object. The stress can be used to drive fracture, deformation and other physical effects with a high degree of realism and uniqueness. As the number of modeled elements is increased, the engine's ability to model physical behavior increases. The visual representation of the 3D object is altered by the finite element system through the use of a [[deformation shader]] run on the CPU or GPU. Finite Element-based systems had been impractical for use in games due to the performance overhead and the lack of tools to create finite element representations out of 3D art objects. With higher performance processors and tools to rapidly create the volumetric tessellations, real-time finite element systems began to be used in games, beginning with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' that used [[Digital Molecular Matter]] for the deformation and destruction effects of wood, steel, flesh and plants using an algorithm developed by Dr. James O'Brien as a part of his PhD thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.eecs.berkeley.edu/site_root/papers/Obrien-GMA-1999-08/ |title=Graphical Modeling and Animation of Brittle Fracture|publisher=Graphics.eecs.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brownian motion ====
In the real world, physics is always active. There is a constant [[Brownian motion]] jitter to all particles in our universe as the forces push back and forth against each other. For a [[game physics]] engine, such constant active precision is unnecessarily wasting the limited CPU power, which can cause problems such as decreased [[framerate]]. Thus, games may put objects to "sleep" by disabling the computation of physics on objects that have not moved a particular distance within a certain amount of time. For example, in the 3D [[virtual world]] [[Second Life]], if an object is resting on the floor and the object does not move beyond a minimal distance in about two seconds, then the physics calculations are disabled for the object and it becomes frozen in place. The object remains frozen until physics processing reactivates for the object after collision occurs with some other active physical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Game_Engine/Logic/Object_type/Rigid_body |title=Doc:Manual/Game Engine/Logic/Object type/Rigid body - BlenderWiki |publisher=Wiki.blender.org |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paradigms ====
Physics engines for video games typically have two core components, a [[collision detection]]/[[collision response]] system, and the [[Dynamical simulation|dynamics simulation]] component responsible for solving the forces affecting the simulated objects. Modern physics engines may also contain [[Computational fluid dynamics|fluid simulations]], animation [[Motion control|control systems]] and [[COLLADA|asset integration]] tools. There are three major paradigms for the physical simulation of solids: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erleben |first1=Kenny |last2=Sporring |first2=Jon |last3=Henriksen |first3=Knud |last4=Dohlmann |first4=Henrik |date=2005 |title=Physics-Based Animation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Penalty methods, where interactions are commonly modelled as [[Soft body dynamics#Spring/mass models|mass-spring]] systems. This type of engine is popular for deformable, or [[Soft body dynamics|soft-body physics]].
* Constraint based methods, where [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint equations]] are solved that estimate physical laws.
* Impulse based methods, where [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s are applied to object interactions.
Finally, hybrid methods are possible that combine aspects of the above paradigms.

== Limitations ==
A primary limit of physics engine [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] is the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of the numbers representing the positions of and forces acting upon objects. When precision is too low, [[rounding error]]s affect results and [[butterfly effect|small fluctuations]] not modeled in the simulation can drastically change the predicted results; simulated objects can behave unexpectedly or arrive at the wrong location. The errors are compounded in situations where two free-moving objects are fit together with a precision that is greater than what the physics engine can calculate. This can lead to an unnatural buildup energy in the object due to the rounding errors that begins to violently shake and eventually blow the objects apart. Any type of free-moving compound physics object can demonstrate this problem, but it is especially prone to affecting chain links under high tension and wheeled objects with actively physical bearing surfaces. Higher precision reduces the positional/force errors, but at the cost of greater CPU power needed for the calculations.

== Physics Processing Unit (PPU) ==
{{Main|Physics processing unit}}
A [[Physics processing unit|Physics Processing Unit (PPU)]] is a dedicated microprocessor designed to handle the calculations of physics, especially in the physics engine of [[video game]]s. Examples of calculations involving a PPU might include [[rigid body dynamics]], [[soft body dynamics]], [[collision detection]], [[fluid dynamics]], hair and clothing simulation, [[finite element analysis]], and fracturing of objects. The idea is that specialized processors offload time consuming tasks from a computer's CPU, much like how a [[GPU]] performs graphics operations in the main CPU's place. The term was coined by [[Ageia]]'s marketing to describe their PhysX chip to consumers. Several other technologies in the CPU-GPU spectrum have some features in common with it, although Ageia's solution was the only complete one designed, marketed, supported, and placed within a system ''exclusively as'' a PPU.

== General Purpose processing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) ==
{{Main|GPGPU}}
Hardware acceleration for physics processing is now usually provided by graphics processing units that support more general computation, a concept known as [[GPGPU|General Purpose processing on Graphics Processing Unit]]. [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]] provide support for rigid body dynamics computations on their latest graphics cards.

[[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce 8 Series]] supports a GPU-based Newtonian physics acceleration technology named ''Quantum Effects Technology''. NVIDIA provides an SDK Toolkit for [[CUDA]] ([[Compute Unified Device Architecture]]) technology that offers both a low and high-level API to the GPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/8800_features.html |title=NVIDIA 8800 features page - Quantum Effects Technology |publisher=Nvidia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their GPUs, [[AMD]] offers a similar SDK, called [[Close to Metal]] (CTM), which provides a thin hardware interface.

[[PhysX]] is an example of a physics engine that can use GPGPU based hardware acceleration when it is available.

'''Political criticism''' (also referred to as '''political commentary''' or '''political discussion''') is [[criticism]] that is specific of or relevant to [[politics]], including [[policies]], [[politicians]], [[political parties]], and types of [[government]].

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over the relevance and importance of political criticism in civilizations, particularly [[democratic societies]].

Advocates argue that political discussion creates and promotes the variety of opinions necessary for a true democracy. The [[American constitution]] is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as [[free speech]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Critics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual  basis, the "Average Joe") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient [[intelligence]] to do the matter justice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Methods==
There are many methods used throughout [[written history|history]] of promoting political opinions and with the development of new  [[technologies]] new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:

===Books===
[[Image:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|[[The Bible]], one of the most influential books of all time]]
Throughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably '''the''' most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as [[the Bible]], [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], the [[Qur'an]], ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of [[writing]]. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from [[common sense]], the drive of [[literature]] and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the [[emotions|emotional impact]] of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] concerning American views about [[slavery]]. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", derives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Television and films===
Since their development in this past century, both [[television]] and [[films]] have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]], [[Citizen Kane]], the works of [[Walt Disney]], and such political [[satire]] as that found in [[The Simpsons]]. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political [[propaganda]] on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.

===Political cartoons===
{{Main|Political satire}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:conscripcartoon.jpg|thumb|150px|Editorial cartoon concerning [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s freedom from his [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription promise]] by [[Johnny Canuck]].]] --&gt;
[[Political cartoons]] (also known as "editorial cartoons") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a [[:wikt:verbal|verbal]] but a [[visual]] one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful  [[symbols]] or [[metaphors]] in order to communicate the artist's messages.

===News===
Since many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by [[news media|the media]], the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of [[newspapers]], news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.

===Internet===
With the recent invention of the [[Internet]], political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the [[World Wide Web]]. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.

The many means of exchanging ideas, including [[blogs]] and [[internet forum]]s, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute.  This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that [[political parties]] stay connected to [[Electoral district|constituents]].

{{Politics sidebar|expanded=Primary topics}}
'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. [[Stephen H. Haber]], David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with [[social history]], and political history came next at 841 (25%) faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue durée'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3842">'''Polymer engineering''' is generally an [[engineering]] field that designs, analyses, or modifies polymer materials. Polymer engineering covers aspects of the [[petrochemical industry]], [[polymerization]], structure and characterization of polymers, properties of polymers, [[compounding]] and processing of polymers and description of major polymers, structure property relations and applications.

==Materials==
The basic division of polymers into [[thermoplastics]], [[elastomers]] and [[thermosets]] helps define their areas of application. The latter group of materials includes [[phenolic resin]]s, [[polyester]]s and [[epoxy resin]]s, all of which are used widely in [[composite material]]s when reinforced with stiff fibres such as [[fibreglass]] and [[aramid]]s. Since [[Cross-link|crosslinking]] stabilises the [[thermoset polymer matrix]] of these materials, they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like [[steel]]. However, their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures. In addition, they suffer less from [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], so are ideal for [[safety-critical]] parts which are stressed regularly in service.

Thermoplastics have relatively low [[Young's modulus|tensile moduli]], but also have lower densities and properties such as [[transparency and translucency|transparency]] which make them ideal for [[consumer product]]s and [[medical product]]s. They include [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], [[nylon]], [[acetal resin]], [[polycarbonate]] and [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]], all of which are widely used materials.

[[Elastomer]]s are polymers which have very low moduli and show reversible extension when strained, a valuable property for vibration absorption and damping. They may either be thermoplastic (in which case they are known as [[Thermoplastic elastomer]]s) or crosslinked, as in most conventional rubber products such as [[tyres]]. Typical rubbers used conventionally include [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]], [[polychloroprene]], [[polybutadiene]], [[styrene-butadiene]] and fluorinated rubbers.

==Applications==

[[File:Cyclist itt cyfac(2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|A time-trial [[carbon fibre]] composite bicycle with aerodynamic wheels and aero bars]]
Typical uses of composites are [[monocoque]] structures for [[aerospace]] and [[automobile]]s, as well as more mundane products like [[fishing rod]]s and [[bicycle]]s. The [[stealth bomber]] was the first all-composite aircraft, but many passenger aircraft like the [[Airbus]] and the [[Boeing 787]] use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages, such as hydrophobic [[melamine foam]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.polytechinc.com/news/08232013-recognized-by-theboeingcompany&lt;/ref&gt; The quite different physical properties of composites gives designers a much greater freedom in shaping parts, which is why composite products often look different to conventional products. On the other hand, some products such as [[drive shaft]]s, [[helicopter]] rotor blades, and [[propeller]]s look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components.

[[File:PressureExchanger 2DSchematics.svg|thumb|300px|Schematics of a rotary pressure exchanger. {{nowrap|''A'': High pressure side,}} {{nowrap|''B'': Low pressure side,}} {{nowrap|''C'': Rotor rotation,}} {{nowrap|''D'': Sealed area,}} ''1'':High pressure reject water inflow, ''2'':Pressurized sea water, ''3'': Low pressure sea water inflow, ''4'': Low pressure reject water drain, {{nowrap|{{legend2|#ff0000}}: Reject water / concentrate,}} {{nowrap|{{legend2|#808080}}: Piston / barrier,}} {{nowrap|{{legend2|#00ffff}}: Sea water}}]]

A '''pressure exchanger''' transfers pressure [[energy]] from a high pressure fluid stream to a low pressure fluid stream. Many industrial processes operate at elevated pressures and have high pressure waste streams. One way of providing a high pressure fluid to such a process is to transfer the waste pressure to a low pressure stream using a pressure exchanger.

One particularly efficient type of pressure exchanger is a rotary pressure exchanger. This device uses a [[cylindrical]] rotor with longitudinal ducts parallel to its rotational axis. The rotor spins inside a sleeve between two end covers. Pressure energy is transferred directly from the [[high pressure]] stream to the low pressure stream in the ducts of the rotor. Some fluid that remains in the ducts serves as a barrier that inhibits mixing between the streams. This rotational action is similar to that of an old fashioned machine gun firing high pressure bullets and it is continuously refilled with new [[fluid]] cartridges. The ducts of the rotor charge and discharge as the pressure transfer process repeats itself.

The performance of a pressure exchanger is measured by the efficiency of the energy transfer process and by the degree of mixing between the streams. The energy of the streams is the product of their flow rates and pressures. Efficiency is a function of the pressure differentials and the volumetric losses (leakage) through the device computed with the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{\Sigma\text{ energy out} }{\Sigma\text{ energy in} }=\frac{(Q_G-L)\times(P_G-HDP)+(Q_B+L)\times(P_B-LDP)}{Q_G\times P_G+Q_B\times P_B}\qquad\qquad(1)&lt;/math&gt;
    
where Q is flow, P is pressure, L is leakage flow, HDP is high pressure differential, LDP is low pressure differential, the subscript B refers to the low pressure feed to the device and the subscript G refers to the high pressure feed to the device. 
Mixing is a function of the concentrations of the species in the inlet streams and the ratio of flow rates to the device.

==Reverse Osmosis with Pressure Exchangers==
[[File:ReverseOsmosis with PressureExchanger.svg|thumb|300px|Schematics of a [[reverse osmosis]] system (desalination) using a pressure exchanger. ''1'':Sea water inflow, ''2'': Fresh water flow (40%), ''3'':Concentrate Flow (60%), ''4'':Sea water flow (60%), ''5'': Concentrate (drain), ''A'': High pressure pump flow (40%), ''B'': Circulation pump, ''C'':Osmosis unit with membrane, ''D'': Pressure exchanger]]
One application in which pressure exchangers are widely used is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, pressure exchangers are used as [[energy recovery]] devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes [C] is directed [3] to the ERD [D]. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream [1] becomes stream [4]), which it then merges (with the aid of a circulation pump [B]) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump [A]. This combined stream feeds the membranes [C]. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure [5], expelled by the incoming feedwater flow [1].
 
Pressure exchangers save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the high pressure [[pump]]. In a seawater [[Reverse osmosis|RO]] system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane feed flow. Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the high pressure pump. Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane feed flow is pressurized with almost no energy input.

==Energy Recovery and Pressure Exchange Systems==
Seawater [[water desalination|desalination]] plants have produced potable water for many years. However, until recently desalination had been used only in special circumstances because of the high energy consumption of the process.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  
 
Early designs for desalination plants made use of various evaporation technologies. The most advanced are the [[multi-stage flash distillation]] seawater evaporation desalinators, which make use of multiple stages and have an energy consumption of over 9 kWh per cubic meter of potable water produced. For this reason large seawater desalinators were initially constructed in locations with low energy costs, such as the Middle East, or next to process plants with available waste heat. 
 
In the 1970s the seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) process was developed which made potable water from seawater by forcing it under high [[pressure]] through a tight membrane thus filtering out salts and impurities. These salts and impurities are discharged from the SWRO device as a concentrated brine solution in a continuous stream, which contains a large amount of high-pressure energy. Most of this energy can be recovered with a suitable device. Many early SWRO plants built in the 1970s and early 1980s had an energy consumption of over 6.0 kWh per cubic meter of potable water produced, due to low membrane performance, pressure drop limitations and the absence of energy recovery devices.

An example where a pressure exchange engine finds application is in the production of potable water using the reverse osmosis membrane process. In this process, a feed saline solution is pumped into a membrane array at high pressure. The input saline solution is then divided by the membrane array into super saline solution (brine) at high pressure and potable water at low pressure. While the high pressure brine is no longer useful in this process as a fluid, the pressure energy that it contains has high value. A pressure exchange engine is employed to recover the pressure energy in the brine and transfer it to feed saline solution. After transfer of the pressure energy in the brine flow, the brine is expelled at low pressure to drain.

Nearly all [[reverse osmosis plant]]s operated for the desalination of sea water in order to produce drinking water in
industrial scale are equipped with an energy recovery system based on turbines. These are activated by the concentrate (brine) leaving the plant and transfer the energy contained in the high pressure of this concentrate usually mechanically to the high-pressure pump. In the pressure exchanger the energy contained in the brine is transferred hydraulically&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent

Therefrom results an economic energy recovery, amortization times for such systems varying between 2 and 4 years depending on the place of operation.

Reduced energy and capital costs mean that for the first time ever it is possible to produce potable water from seawater at a cost below $1 per cubic meter in many locations worldwide. Although the cost may be a bit higher on islands with high power costs, the PE has the potential to rapidly expand the market for seawater desalination.

By means of the application of a pressure exchange system, which is already used in other domains, a considerably higher efficiency of energy recovery of [[reverse osmosis]] systems may be achieved than with the use of reverse running pumps or turbines.
The pressure exchange system is suited, above all, for bigger plants i.e. approx. ≥ 2000 m3/d permeate production.

[[File:PC-Netzteil (redundant).jpg|thumb|Redundant power supply]]
[[File:Reliability block diagram.png|thumb|Redundant subsystem "B"]]

In [[engineering]], '''redundancy''' is the duplication of critical [[wikt:component|component]]s or functions of a system with the intention of increasing reliability of the [[system]], usually in the form of a backup or [[fail-safe]], or to improve actual system performance, such as in the case of [[GNSS]] receivers, or [[multi-threaded]] computer processing.

In many [[safety-critical system]]s, such as [[fly-by-wire]] and [[hydraulic]] systems in [[aircraft]], some parts of the control system may be triplicated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/rd/201/ibmrd2001E.pdf Redundancy Management Technique for Space Shuttle Computers] (PDF), IBM Research&lt;/ref&gt; which is formally termed [[triple modular redundancy]] (TMR). An error in one component may then be out-voted by the other two. In a triply redundant system, the system has three sub components, all three of which must fail before the system fails. Since each one rarely fails, and the sub components are expected to fail independently, the probability of all three failing is calculated to be extraordinarily small; often outweighed by other risk factors, such as [[human error]]. Redundancy may also be known by the terms "majority voting systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303033411/http://www.elecdesign.com/Articles/ArticleID/6886/6886.html |title=Analog Voting Circuit Is More Flexible Than Its Digital Version |author=R. Jayapal |publisher=elecdesign.com |date=2003-12-04 |archivedate=2007-03-03 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "voting logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2003/06.html |title=The Aerospace Corporation &amp;#124; Assuring Space Mission Success |publisher=Aero.org |date=2014-05-20 |accessdate=2014-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bridge-suspension.svg|thumb|A [[suspension bridge|suspension bridge's]] numerous cables are a form of redundancy.]]

Redundancy sometimes produces less, instead of greater reliability{{snd}} it creates a more complex system which is prone to various issues, it may lead to human neglect of duty, and may lead to higher production demands which by overstressing the system may make it less safe.&lt;ref name=perr2004&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iis-db.stanford.edu/pubs/20276/sagan_oe_dec03.pdf |title=Learning from Normal Accidents |author=Scott D.

== Forms of redundancy ==
In computer science, there are four major forms of redundancy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Koren|first1=Israel|last2=Krishna|first2=C. Mani|title=Fault-Tolerant Systems|date=2007|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|location=San Francisco, CA|isbn=0-12-088525-5|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are:
* Hardware redundancy, such as [[dual modular redundancy]] and [[triple modular redundancy]]
* Information redundancy, such as [[error detection and correction]] methods
* Time redundancy, performing the same operation multiple times such as multiple executions of a program or multiple copies of data transmitted
* Software redundancy such as [[N-version programming]]

A modified form of software redundancy, applied to hardware may be:

* Distinct functional redundancy, such as both mechanical and hydraulic braking in a car.  Applied in the case of software, code written independently and distinctly different but producing the same results for the same inputs.
[[Structures]] are usually designed with redundant parts as well, ensuring that if one part fails, the entire structure will not collapse. A structure without redundancy is called [[Fracture critical|fracture-critical]], meaning that a single broken component can cause the collapse of the entire structure. Bridges that failed due to lack of redundancy include the [[Silver Bridge]] and the [[Skagit River Bridge|Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River]].

[[File:Series-Parallel-Systems-Examples.jpg|thumb|Series (A) and parallel (B) systems and their combination (C).&lt;ref&gt;Kokcharov I. Structural Safety http://www.kokch.kts.ru/me/t6/SIA_6_Structural_Safety.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Parallel and combined systems demonstrate different level of redundancy. The models are subject of studies in reliability and safety engineering.

== Function of redundancy ==
The two functions of redundancy are passive redundancy and [[active redundancy]]. Both functions prevent performance decline from exceeding specification limits without human intervention using extra capacity.

Passive redundancy uses excess capacity to reduce the impact of component failures. One common form of passive redundancy is the extra strength of cabling and struts used in bridges. This extra strength allows some structural components to fail without bridge collapse. The extra strength used in the design is called the margin of safety.

Eyes and ears provide working examples of passive redundancy. Vision loss in one eye does not cause blindness but depth perception is impaired. Hearing loss in one ear does not cause deafness but directionality is impaired. Performance decline is commonly associated with passive redundancy when a limited number of failures occur.

Active redundancy eliminates performance declines by monitoring the performance of individual devices, and this monitoring is used in voting logic. The voting logic is linked to switching that automatically reconfigures the components. Error detection and correction and the Global Positioning System (GPS) are two examples of active redundancy.

Electrical power distribution provides an example of active redundancy. Several power lines connect each generation facility with customers. Each power line includes monitors that detect overload. Each power line also includes circuit breakers. The combination of power lines provides excess capacity. Circuit breakers disconnect a power line when monitors detect an overload. Power is redistributed across the remaining lines.

==Disadvantages==
[[Charles Perrow]], author of ''[[Normal Accidents]]'', has said that sometimes redundancies backfire and produce less, not more reliability. This may happen in three ways: First, redundant safety devices result in a more complex system, more prone to errors and accidents. Second, redundancy may lead to shirking of responsibility among workers. Third, redundancy may lead to increased production pressures, resulting in a system that operates at higher speeds, but less safely.&lt;ref name=perr2004/&gt;

== Voting logic ==
Voting logic uses performance monitoring to determine how to reconfigure individual components so that operation continues without violating specification limitations of the overall system. Voting logic often involves computers, but systems composed of items other than computers may be reconfigured using voting logic. Circuit breakers are an example of a form of non-computer voting logic.

Electrical power systems use [[power scheduling]] to reconfigure active redundancy. Computing systems adjust the production output of each generating facility when other generating facilities are suddenly lost. This prevents blackout conditions during major events such as an earthquake.

The simplest voting logic in computing systems involves two components: primary and alternate. They both run similar software, but the output from the alternate remains inactive during normal operation. The primary monitors itself and periodically sends an activity message to the alternate as long as everything is OK. All outputs from the primary stop, including the activity message, when the primary detects a fault. The alternate activates its output and takes over from the primary after a brief delay when the activity message ceases. Errors in voting logic can cause both outputs to be active or inactive at the same time, or cause outputs to flutter on and off.

A more reliable form of voting logic involves an odd number of three devices or more. All perform identical functions and the outputs are compared by the voting logic. The voting logic establishes a majority when there is a disagreement, and the majority will act to deactivate the output from other device(s) that disagree. A single fault will not interrupt normal operation. This technique is used with [[avionics]] systems, such as those responsible for operation of the [[Space Shuttle]].

== Calculating the probability of system failure ==
Each duplicate component added to the system decreases the probability of system failure according to the formula:-

:&lt;math&gt;{p}=  \prod_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} &lt;/math&gt;
where:
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; – number of components
* &lt;math&gt; p_{i} &lt;/math&gt; – probability of component i failing
* &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; – the probability of all components failing (system failure)

This formula assumes independence of failure events. That means that the probability of a component B failing given that a component A has already failed is the same as that of B failing when A has not failed. There are situations where this is unreasonable, such as using two power supplies connected to the same socket in such a way that if one power supply failed, the other would too.

It also assumes that at only one component is needed to keep the system running.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Roland Barthes was born on 12 November in the town of [[Cherbourg]] in [[Normandy]]. His father, naval officer Louis Barthes, was killed in a battle during [[World War I]] in the [[North Sea]] before Barthes' first birthday. His mother, Henriette Barthes, and his aunt and grandmother raised him in the village of Urt and the city of [[Bayonne]]. When Barthes was eleven, his family moved to [[Paris]], though his attachment to his provincial roots would remain strong throughout his life.

=== Student years ===
Barthes showed great promise as a student and spent the period from 1935 to 1939 at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], where he earned a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in classical literature. He was plagued by ill health throughout this period, suffering from [[tuberculosis]], which often had to be treated in the isolation of [[sanatorium|sanatoria]].&lt;ref name=indep&gt;{{cite news|title=ROLAND BARTHES: A Biography by Louis-Jean Calvet|newspaper=The Independent|author=Ben Rogers|date=8 January 1995|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/death-of-the-author-roland-barthes-a-biography-by-louisjean-calvet-trs-sarah-wykes-polity-press-16325-1567120.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His repeated physical breakdowns disrupted his academic career, affecting his studies and his ability to take qualifying examinations. They also exempted him from military service during [[World War II]].

His life from 1939 to 1948 was largely spent obtaining a ''[[Licentiate (degree)#France|licence]]'' in grammar and [[philology]], publishing his first papers, taking part in a medical study, and continuing to struggle with his health. He received a ''{{Interlanguage link multi|diplôme d'études supérieures|fr}}'' (roughly equivalent to an [[Master of Arts|MA]] by thesis) from the [[University of Paris]] in 1941 for his work in [[Greek tragedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift, ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes and Thinkers'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, Feb 4, 2009, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early academic career ===
In 1948, he returned to purely academic work, gaining numerous short-term positions at institutes in [[France]], [[Romania]], and [[Egypt]]. During this time, he contributed to the leftist Parisian paper ''Combat'', out of which grew his first full-length work, ''[[Writing Degree Zero]]'' (1953).

In 1952, Barthes settled at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]], where he studied [[lexicology]] and [[sociology]]. During his seven-year period there, he began to write a popular series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles'', in which he dismantled myths of [[popular culture]] (gathered in the ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' collection that was published in 1957). Consisting of fifty-four short essays, mostly written between 1954–1956, ''Mythologies'' were acute reflections of French popular culture ranging from an analysis on soap detergents to a dissection of popular wrestling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huppatz|first=D.J.|year=2011|title=Roland Barthes, Mythologies|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=3|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing little English, Barthes taught at [[Middlebury College]] in 1957 and befriended the future English translator of much of his work, [[Richard Howard]], that summer in New York City.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Richard Howard. "Remembering Roland Barthes," ''[[The Nation]]'' (November 20, 1982): "Mutual friends brought us together in 1957. He came to my door in the summer of that year, disconcerted by his classes at Middlebury (teaching students unaccustomed to a visitor with no English to speak of) and bearing, by way of introduction, a fresh-printed copy of ''Mythologies''. (''Michelet'' and ''Writing Degree Zero'' had already been published in France, but he was not yet known in America&amp;mdash;not even in most French departments. Middlebury was enterprising.)" Reprinted in ''Signs in Culture: Roland Barthes Today'', edited by Steven Ungar and Betty R. McGraw, University of Iowa Press, 1989, p. 32 ({{ISBN|0-877-45245-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rise to prominence ===
Barthes spent the early 1960s exploring the fields of [[semiology]] and [[structuralism]], chairing various faculty positions around France, and continuing to produce more full-length studies. Many of his works challenged traditional academic views of [[literary criticism]] and of renowned figures of literature. His unorthodox thinking led to a conflict with a well-known Sorbonne professor of literature, [[Raymond Picard]], who attacked the French [[New Criticism]] (a label that he inaccurately applied to Barthes) for its obscurity and lack of respect towards France's literary roots. Barthes' rebuttal in ''Criticism and Truth'' (1966) accused the old, [[bourgeois]] criticism of a lack of concern with the finer points of language and of selective ignorance towards challenging theories, such as [[Marxism]].

By the late 1960s, Barthes had established a reputation for himself. He traveled to the [[United States|US]] and [[Japan]], delivering a presentation at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. During this time, he wrote his best-known work{{According to whom|date=August 2018}}, the 1967 essay "[[Death of the author|The Death of the Author]]," which, in light of the growing influence of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]], would prove to be a transitional piece in its investigation of the logical ends of [[Structuralism|structuralist]] thought.

=== Mature critical work ===
Barthes continued to contribute with [[Philippe Sollers]] to the [[avant-garde]] literary magazine ''[[Tel Quel]]'', which was developing similar kinds of theoretical inquiry to that pursued in Barthes' writings. In 1970, Barthes produced what many consider to be his most prodigious work,{{Who|date=September 2010}} the dense, critical reading of [[Balzac]]'s ''[[Sarrasine]]'' entitled ''[[S/Z]]''. Throughout the 1970s, Barthes continued to develop his literary criticism; he developed new ideals of [[textualism|textuality]] and novelistic neutrality. In 1971, he served as visiting professor at the [[University of Geneva]].

In 1975 he wrote an autobiography titled ''Roland Barthes'' and in 1977 he was elected to the chair of Sémiologie Littéraire at the [[Collège de France]]. In the same year, his mother, Henriette Barthes, to whom he had been devoted, died, aged 85. They had lived together for 60 years. The loss of the woman who had raised and cared for him was a serious blow to Barthes. His last major work, ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'', is partly an essay about the nature of [[photography]] and partly a meditation on photographs of his mother. The book contains many reproductions of photographs, though none of them are of Henriette.

=== Death ===
On 25 February 1980, Roland Barthes was knocked down by a laundry van while walking home through the streets of Paris. One month later, on March 26,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abonnes.lemonde.fr/archives/article/1980/03/28/le-plaisir-des-sens_2814902_1819218.html?xtmc=roland_barthes&amp;xtcr=436|title=Le plaisir des sens|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|language=fr-FR|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; he died from the chest injuries he sustained in that accident.&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Roland Barthes, French Writer, dies at 64|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=27 March 1980|author=J. Y. Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings and ideas==

===Early thought===
Barthes' earliest ideas reacted to the trend of [[existentialist]] philosophy that was prominent in France during the 1940s, specifically to the figurehead of existentialism, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre's ''[[What Is Literature?]]'' (1947) expresses a disenchantment both with established forms of writing and more experimental, [[avant-garde]] forms, which he feels alienate readers. Barthes’ response was to try to discover that which may be considered unique and original in writing. In ''Writing Degree Zero'' (1953), Barthes argues that conventions inform both language and style, rendering neither purely creative. Instead, form, or what Barthes calls "writing" (the specific way an individual chooses to manipulate conventions of style for a desired effect), is the unique and creative act. A writer's form is vulnerable to becoming a convention, however, once it has been made available to the public. This means that creativity is an ongoing process of continual change and reaction.

In ''Michelet'', a critical analysis of the French historian [[Jules Michelet]], Barthes developed these notions, applying them to a broader range of fields. He argued that Michelet's views of history and society are obviously flawed. In studying his writings, he continued, one should not seek to learn from Michelet's claims; rather, one should maintain a critical distance and learn from his errors, since understanding how and why his thinking is flawed will show more about his period of history than his own observations. Similarly, Barthes felt that [[avant-garde]] writing should be praised for its maintenance of just such a distance between its audience and itself. In presenting an obvious artificiality rather than making claims to great subjective truths, Barthes argued, avant-garde writers ensure that their audiences maintain an objective perspective. In this sense, Barthes believed that art should be critical and should interrogate the world, rather than seek to explain it, as Michelet had done.

===Semiotics and myth===
Barthes' many monthly contributions, collected in his ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' (1957), frequently interrogated specific cultural materials in order to expose how [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] society asserted its values through them. For example, the portrayal of wine in French society as a robust and healthy habit is a bourgeois ideal that is contradicted by certain realities (i.e., that wine can be unhealthy and inebriating). He found [[semiotics]], the study of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], useful in these interrogations. Barthes explained that these bourgeois cultural myths were "second-order signs," or "[[connotation (semiotics)|connotation]]s." A picture of a full, dark bottle is a [[Sign (semiotics)|signifier]] that relates to a specific signified: a fermented, alcoholic beverage. However, the bourgeoisie relate it to a new signified: the idea of healthy, robust, relaxing experience. Motivations for such manipulations vary, from a desire to sell products to a simple desire to maintain the [[status quo]]. These insights brought Barthes in line with similar Marxist theory. Barthes used the term "myth" while analyzing the popular, consumer culture of post-war France in order to reveal that "objects were organized into meaningful relationships via narratives that expressed collective cultural values."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In ''The Fashion System'' Barthes showed how this adulteration of signs could easily be translated into words. In this work he explained how in the fashion world any word could be loaded with idealistic bourgeois emphasis. Thus, if popular fashion says that a ‘blouse’ is ideal for a certain situation or ensemble, this idea is immediately naturalized and accepted as truth, even though the actual sign could just as easily be interchangeable with ‘skirt’, ‘vest’ or any number of combinations. In the end Barthes' ''Mythologies'' became absorbed into bourgeois culture, as he found many third parties asking him to comment on a certain cultural phenomenon, being interested in his control over his readership. This turn of events caused him to question the overall utility of demystifying culture for the masses, thinking it might be a fruitless attempt, and drove him deeper in his search for individualistic meaning in art.

===Structuralism and its limits===
As Barthes' work with [[structuralism]] began to flourish around the time of his debates with Picard, his investigation of structure focused on revealing the importance of language in writing, which he felt was overlooked by old criticism. Barthes' "Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.uv.es/fores/Barthes_Structural_Narrative.pdf|title= An Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative|website=uv.es}}&lt;/ref&gt; is concerned with examining the correspondence between the structure of a sentence and that of a larger narrative, thus allowing narrative to be viewed along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] lines. Barthes split this work into three hierarchical levels: ‘functions’, ‘actions’ and ‘narrative’. ‘Functions’ are the elementary pieces of a work, such as a single descriptive word that can be used to identify a character. That character would be an ‘action’, and consequently one of the elements that make up the narrative. Barthes was able to use these distinctions to evaluate how certain key ‘functions’ work in forming characters. For example, key words like ‘dark’, ‘mysterious’ and ‘odd’, when integrated together, formulate a specific kind of character or ‘action’. By breaking down the work into such fundamental distinctions Barthes was able to judge the degree of realism given functions have in forming their actions and consequently with what authenticity a narrative can be said to reflect on reality. Thus, his structuralist theorizing became another exercise in his ongoing attempts to dissect and expose the misleading mechanisms of [[bourgeois]] culture.

While Barthes found [[structuralism]] to be a useful tool and believed that discourse of literature could be formalized, he did not believe it could become a strict scientific endeavour. In the late 1960s, radical movements were taking place in literary criticism. The [[post-structuralist]] movement and the [[deconstruction]]ism of [[Jacques Derrida]] were testing the bounds of the structuralist theory that Barthes' work exemplified. [[Derrida]] identified the flaw of structuralism as its reliance on a transcendental signifier; a symbol of constant, universal meaning would be essential as an orienting point in such a closed off system. This is to say that without some regular standard of measurement, a system of criticism that references nothing outside of the actual work itself could never prove useful. But since there are no symbols of constant and universal significance, the entire premise of structuralism as a means of evaluating writing (or anything) is hollow.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Transition===
Such thought led Barthes to consider the limitations not just of signs and symbols, but also of Western culture's dependency on beliefs of constancy and ultimate standards. He travelled to [[Japan]] in 1966 where he wrote ''Empire of Signs'' (published in 1970), a meditation on Japanese culture's contentment in the absence of a search for a transcendental signifier. He notes that in Japan there is no emphasis on a great focus point by which to judge all other standards, describing the centre of [[Tokyo]], the Emperor's Palace, as not a great overbearing entity, but a silent and nondescript presence, avoided and unconsidered. As such, Barthes reflects on the ability of signs in Japan to exist for their own merit, retaining only the [[Meaning (semiotics)|significance]] naturally imbued by their signifiers. Such a society contrasts greatly to the one he dissected in ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', which was revealed to be always asserting a greater, more complex significance on top of the natural one.

In the wake of this trip Barthes wrote what is largely considered to be his best-known work, the essay "[[The Death of the Author]]" (1968). Barthes saw the notion of the author, or authorial authority, in the criticism of literary text as the forced projection of an ultimate meaning of the text. By imagining an ultimate intended meaning of a piece of literature one could infer an ultimate explanation for it. But Barthes points out that the great proliferation of meaning in language and the unknowable state of the author's mind makes any such ultimate realization impossible. As such, the whole notion of the ‘knowable text’ acts as little more than another delusion of Western [[bourgeois]] culture. Indeed, the idea of giving a book or poem an ultimate end coincides with the notion of making it consumable, something that can be used up and replaced in a capitalist market. "The Death of the Author" is considered to be a [[post-structuralist]] work,&lt;ref&gt;Jay Clayton, Eric Rothstein, ''Influence and Intertextuality in Literary History'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1991, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; since it moves past the conventions of trying to quantify literature, but others see it as more of a transitional phase for Barthes in his continuing effort to find significance in culture outside of the [[bourgeois]] norms {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. Indeed, the notion of the author being irrelevant was already a factor of structuralist thinking.

===Textuality and ''S/Z''===
Since Barthes contends that there can be no originating anchor of meaning in the possible intentions of the author, he considers what other sources of meaning or significance can be found in literature. He concludes that since meaning can’t come from the author, it must be actively created by the reader through a process of textual analysis. In his ''[[S/Z]]'' (1970), Barthes applies this notion in an analysis of a short story by Balzac called ''[[Sarrasine]]''. The end result was a reading that established [[five major codes]] for determining various kinds of significance, with numerous lexias throughout the text – a "lexia" here being defined as a unit of the text chosen arbitrarily (to remain methodologically unbiased as possible) for further analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=S/V|last=Barthes|first=Roland|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=1974|isbn=0631176071|location=New York|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes led him to define the story as having a capacity for plurality of meaning, limited by its dependence upon strictly sequential elements (such as a definite timeline that has to be followed by the reader and thus restricts their freedom of analysis). From this project Barthes concludes that an ideal text is one that is reversible, or open to the greatest variety of independent interpretations and not restrictive in meaning. A text can be reversible by avoiding the restrictive devices that ''[[Sarrasine]]'' suffered from such as strict timelines and exact definitions of events. He describes this as the difference between the writerly text, in which the reader is active in a creative process, and a readerly text in which they are restricted to just reading. The project helped Barthes identify what it was he sought in literature: an openness for interpretation.

===Neutral and novelistic writing===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
In the late 1970s Barthes was increasingly concerned with the conflict of two types of language: that of popular culture, which he saw as limiting and pigeonholing in its titles and descriptions, and neutral, which he saw as open and noncommittal. He called these two conflicting modes the [[Doxa]] and the [[paradox|Para-doxa]]. While Barthes had shared sympathies with Marxist thought in the past (or at least parallel criticisms), he felt that, despite its anti-ideological stance, Marxist theory was just as guilty of using violent language with assertive meanings, as was [[bourgeois]] literature. In this way they were both Doxa and both culturally assimilating. As a reaction to this he wrote ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' (1975), a study that focused on a subject matter he felt was equally outside the realm of both conservative society and militant leftist thinking: [[hedonism]]. By writing about a subject that was rejected by both social extremes of thought, Barthes felt he could avoid the dangers of the limiting language of the Doxa. The theory he developed out of this focus claimed that, while reading for pleasure is a kind of social act, through which the reader exposes him/herself to the ideas of the writer, the final [[catharsis|cathartic]] climax of this pleasurable reading, which he termed the bliss in reading or [[jouissance]], is a point in which one becomes lost within the text. This loss of self within the text or immersion in the text, signifies a final impact of reading that is experienced outside the social realm and free from the influence of culturally associative language and is thus neutral with regard to social progress.

Despite this newest theory of reading, Barthes remained concerned with the difficulty of achieving truly neutral writing, which required an avoidance of any labels that might carry an implied meaning or identity towards a given object. Even carefully crafted neutral writing could be taken in an assertive context through the incidental use of a word with a loaded social context. Barthes felt his past works, like ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'', had suffered from this. He became interested in finding the best method for creating neutral writing, and he decided to try to create a novelistic form of rhetoric that would not seek to impose its meaning on the reader. One product of this endeavor was ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' in 1977, in which he presents the fictionalized reflections of a lover seeking to identify and be identified by an anonymous amorous other. The unrequited lover's search for signs by which to show and receive love makes evident illusory myths involved in such a pursuit. The lover's attempts to assert himself into a false, ideal reality is involved in a delusion that exposes the contradictory logic inherent in such a search. Yet at the same time the novelistic character is a sympathetic one, and is thus open not just to criticism but also understanding from the reader. The end result is one that challenges the reader's views of social constructs of love, without trying to assert any definitive theory of meaning.

===Photography and Henriette Barthes===
Throughout his career, Barthes had an interest in photography and its potential to communicate actual events. Many of his monthly myth articles in the 50s had attempted to show how a photographic image could represent implied meanings and thus be used by bourgeois culture to infer 'naturalistic truths'. But he still considered the photograph to have a unique potential for presenting a completely real representation of the world. When his mother, Henriette Barthes, died in 1977 he began writing ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' as an attempt to explain the unique significance a picture of her as a child carried for him. Reflecting on the relationship between the obvious symbolic meaning of a photograph (which he called the studium) and that which is purely personal and dependent on the individual, that which ‘pierces the viewer’ (which he called the punctum), Barthes was troubled by the fact that such distinctions collapse when personal significance is communicated to others and can have its symbolic logic rationalized. Barthes found the solution to this fine line of personal meaning in the form of his mother's picture. Barthes explained that a picture creates a falseness in the illusion of ‘what is’, where ‘what was’ would be a more accurate description. As had been made physical through Henriette Barthes' death, her childhood photograph is evidence of ‘what has ceased to be’. Instead of making reality solid, it reminds us of the world's ever changing nature. Because of this there is something uniquely personal contained in the photograph of Barthes' mother that cannot be removed from his subjective state: the recurrent feeling of loss experienced whenever he looks at it. As one of his final works before his death, ''Camera Lucida'' was both an ongoing reflection on the complicated relations between subjectivity, meaning and cultural society as well as a touching dedication to his mother and description of the depth of his grief.

===Posthumous publications===
A posthumous collection of essays was published in 1987 by [[François Wahl]], ''Incidents''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Culler]], ''Barthes: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford and New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1983, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; It contains fragments from his journals: his ''Soirées de Paris'' (a 1979 extract from his erotic diary of life in Paris); an earlier diary he kept (his erotic encounters with boys in Morocco); and ''Light of the Sud Ouest'' (his childhood memories of rural French life). In November 2007, [[Yale University Press]] published a new translation into English (by Richard Howard) of Barthes' little known work ''What is Sport''. This work bears a considerable resemblance to ''[[Mythologies (book)|Mythologies]]'' and was originally commissioned by the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] as the text for a documentary film directed by [[Hubert Aquin]].

In February 2009, [[Éditions du Seuil]] published ''Journal de deuil'' (Journal of Mourning), based on Barthes' files written from 26 November 1977 (the day following his mother's death) up to 15 September 1979, intimate notes on his terrible loss:
{{quote|The (awesome but not painful) idea that she had not been everything to me. Otherwise I would never have written a work. Since my taking care of her for six months long, she actually had become everything for me, and I totally forgot of ever have written anything at all. I was nothing more than hopelessly hers. Before that she had made herself transparent so that I could write.... Mixing-up of roles. For months long I had been her mother. I felt like I had lost a daughter.}}

He grieved his mother's death for the rest of his life: "Do not say mourning. It's too psychoanalytic. I'm not in mourning. I'm suffering." and "In the corner of my room where she had been bedridden, where she had died and where I now sleep, in the wall where her headboard had stood against I hanged an icon—not out of faith. And I always put some flowers on a table. I do not wish to travel anymore so that I may stay here and prevent the flowers from withering away."

In 2012 the book ''Travels in China'' was published. It consists of his notes from a three-week trip to China he undertook with a group from the literary journal [[Tel Quel]] in 1974. The experience left him somewhat disappointed, as he found China "not at all exotic, not at all disorienting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Sideways Gaze: Roland Barthes' Travels in China|author=Dora Zhang|journal=Los Angeles Review of Books|date=23 June 2012|url=http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114183654/http://lareviewofbooks.org/article.php?id=714&amp;fulltext=1|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Roland Barthes' incisive criticism contributed to the development of theoretical schools such as [[structuralism]], [[semiotics]], and [[post-structuralism]]. While his influence is mainly found in these theoretical fields with which his work brought him into contact, it is also felt in every field concerned with the representation of information and models of communication, including computers, photography, music, and literature. One consequence of Barthes' breadth of focus is that his legacy includes no following of thinkers dedicated to modeling themselves after him. The fact that Barthes’ work was ever adapting and refuting notions of stability and constancy means there is no canon of thought within his theory to model one's thoughts upon, and thus no "Barthesism".

==Key terms==
''Readerly'' and ''writerly'' are terms Barthes employs both to delineate one type of literature from another and to implicitly interrogate ways of reading, like positive or negative habits the modern reader brings into one's experience with the text itself. These terms are most explicitly fleshed out in ''[[S/Z]]'', while the essay "From Work to Text", from ''[[Image—Music—Text]]'' (1977), provides an analogous parallel look at the active–passive and postmodern–modern ways of interacting with a text.

===Readerly text===
A text that makes no requirement of the reader to "write" or "produce" their own meanings. The reader may passively locate "ready-made" meaning. Barthes writes that these sorts of texts are "controlled by the principle of non-contradiction" (156), that is, they do not disturb the "common sense," or "Doxa," of the surrounding culture. The "readerly texts," moreover, "are products [that] make up the enormous mass of our literature" (5). Within this category, there is a spectrum of "replete literature," which comprises "any classic (readerly) texts" that work "like a cupboard where meanings are shelved, stacked, [and] safeguarded" (200).&lt;ref name="S/Z"&gt;Barthes, Roland. S/Z: An Essay. Trans. Richard Miller. New York: Hill and Wang, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writerly text===
A text that aspires to the proper goal of literature and criticism: "... to make the reader no longer a consumer but a producer of the text" (4). Writerly texts and ways of reading constitute, in short, an active rather than passive way of interacting with a culture and its texts. A culture and its texts, Barthes writes, should never be accepted in their given forms and traditions. As opposed to the "readerly texts" as "product," the "writerly text is ourselves writing, before the infinite play of the world is traversed, intersected, stopped, plasticized by some singular system (Ideology, Genus, Criticism) which reduces the plurality of entrances, the opening of networks, the infinity of languages" (5). Thus reading becomes for Barthes "not a parasitical act, the reactive complement of a writing", but rather a "form of work" (10).

===The ''Author'' and the ''scriptor''===
''Author'' and ''scriptor'' are terms Barthes uses to describe different ways of thinking about the creators of texts. "The author" is our traditional concept of the lone genius creating a work of literature or other piece of writing by the powers of his/her original imagination. For Barthes, such a figure is no longer viable. The insights offered by an array of modern thought, including the insights of [[Surrealism]], have rendered the term obsolete. In place of the author, the modern world presents us with a figure Barthes calls the "scriptor," whose only power is to combine pre-existing texts in new ways. Barthes believes that all writing draws on previous texts, norms, and conventions, and that these are the things to which we must turn to understand a text. As a way of asserting the relative unimportance of the writer's biography compared to these textual and generic conventions, Barthes says that the scriptor has no past, but is born with the text. He also argues that, in the absence of the idea of an "author-God" to control the meaning of a work, interpretive horizons are opened up considerably for the active reader. As Barthes puts it, "the death of the author is the birth of the reader."&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, Roland. ''Image—Music—Text''. Essays selected and translated by Stephen Heath. New York: Noonday, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1964, Barthes wrote "The Last Happy Writer" ("''Le dernier des écrivains heureux''" in ''Essais critiques''), the title of which refers to [[Voltaire]]. In the essay he commented on the problems of the modern thinker after discovering the relativism in thought and philosophy, discrediting previous philosophers who avoided this difficulty. Disagreeing roundly with Barthes' description of Voltaire, Daniel Gordon, the translator and editor of ''[[Candide]]'' (The Bedford Series in History and Culture), wrote that "never has one brilliant writer so thoroughly misunderstood another."{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The sinologist [[Simon Leys]], in a review of Barthes' diary of a trip to China during the [[Cultural Revolution]], disparages Barthes for his seeming indifference to the situation of the Chinese people, and says that Barthes "has contrived—amazingly—to bestow an entirely new dignity upon the age-old activity, so long unjustly disparaged, of saying nothing at great length."&lt;ref&gt;[[Leys, Simon]] ''The Hall of Uselessness: Collected Essays'', New York, New York Review Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Barthes' ''[[A Lover's Discourse: Fragments]]'' was the inspiration for the name of 1980s [[new wave music|new wave]] duo [[The Lover Speaks]].

[[Jeffrey Eugenides]]' ''[[The Marriage Plot]]'' draws out excerpts from Barthes' ''A Lover's Discourse: Fragments'' as a way to depict the unique intricacies of love that one of the main characters, Madeleine Hanna, experiences throughout the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |title=The Euphoria of Influence: Jeffrey Eugenides's The Marriage Plot |publisher=Publicbooks.org |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2012-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113065904/http://publicbooks.org/fiction/the-euphoria-of-influence-jeffrey-eugenidess-the-marriage-plot |archivedate=13 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]'' (2014) by [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], a journalist quotes to the protagonist Riggan Thompson an extract from [[Mythologies (book)|''Mythologies'']]: "The cultural work done in the past by gods and epic sagas is now done by laundry-detergent commercials and comic-strip characters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2014/10/10/7-secrets-birdman-labyrinth|title=7 Secrets of the 'Birdman' Labyrinth|date=10 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs]]'' (1996) by [[Michael Lehmann]], Brian is reading an extract from ''[[Camera Lucida (book)|Camera Lucida]]'' over the phone to a woman whom he thinks to be beautiful but who is her more intellectual and less physically desirable friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=390|title=CTheory.net|website=www.ctheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film ''[[Elegy (film)|Elegy]]'', based on [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Dying Animal]]'', the character of Consuela (played by [[Penelope Cruz]]) is first depicted in the film carrying a copy of Barthes' ''[[The Pleasure of the Text]]'' on the campus of the university where she is a student.&lt;ref&gt;Manohla Dargis, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/08/movies/08eleg.html Extracurricular Lessons for Student and Teacher]," review of ''Elegy'', New York Times, August 8, 2008, accessed on 12-9-2015: Of the character of Consuela, Dargis writes, "She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes's "Pleasure of the Text" to her lush bosom."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laurent Binet]]'s novel ''The 7th Function of Language'' is based on the premise that Barthes was not merely accidentally hit by a van but that he was instead murdered, as part of a conspiracy to acquire a document known as the "Seventh Function of Language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/956750580|title=The 7th function of language|last=Laurent,|first=Binet,|others=Taylor, Sam, 1970-|isbn=9781910701591|location=London, England|oclc=956750580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''shield-maiden''' ({{lang-non|skjaldmær}}), in [[Scandinavian folklore]] and [[Norse mythology|mythology]] was a female warrior. They are often mentioned in [[saga]]s such as ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'' and in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''. Shield-maidens also appear in stories of other [[Germanic peoples]]: [[Goths]], [[Cimbri]], and [[Marcomanni]].&lt;ref name="nordisk"&gt;[http://runeberg.org/nfce/0728.html The article ''Sköldmö''] in ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' (1917).&lt;/ref&gt; The mythical [[valkyrie]]s may have been based on the shield-maidens.&lt;ref name="nordisk"/&gt;

==Historical existence==
The historical existence of shield-maidens is heavily debated, but scholars including [[Neil Price (archaeologist)|Neil Price]],&lt;ref name="history.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|title=Secrets of the Vikings: Shield Maidens|website=www.history.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125132543/http://www.history.com/shows/vikings/videos/secrets-of-the-vikings-shield-maidens|archivedate=25 January 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that they existed while others, like scholar Judith Jesch disagree, citing a lack of hard evidence for trained or regular women warriors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|title=Viking women, warriors, and valkyries|website=blog.britishmuseum.org|date=19 April 2014|first=Judith|last=Jesch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194313/http://blog.britishmuseum.org/2014/04/19/viking-women-warriors-and-valkyries/|archivedate=3 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/world/europe/sweden-viking-women-warriors-dna.html|title=A Female Viking Warrior?

==Historical accounts==
There are few historic attestations that [[Viking Age]] women took part in warfare, but the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[John Skylitzes]] records that women fought in battle when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev]] attacked the Byzantines in [[Bulgaria]] in 971.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; When the [[Varangians]] (not to be confused with the Byzantine [[Varangian Guard]]) had suffered a devastating defeat in the [[Siege of Dorostolon]], the victors were stunned at discovering armed women among the fallen warriors.&lt;ref name="Harrison"&gt;Harrison, D. &amp; Svensson, K. (2007). ''Vikingaliv''. Fälth &amp; Hässler, Värnamo. {{ISBN|978-91-27-35725-9}}. p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Leif Erikson]]'s pregnant half-sister [[Freydís Eiríksdóttir]] was in [[Vinland]], she is reported to have taken up a sword, and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking [[Skræling]]s.&lt;ref name="Harrison"/&gt; The fight is recounted in the ''[[Greenland saga]]'', though Freydís is not explicitly referred to as a shield-maiden in the text.&lt;ref name=Thorsson&gt;Thorsson, Ö. (Ed.) ''The Sagas of the Icelanders.'' Penguin Books, 1997. Anyway a mention of a single woman picking up a sword once can not be considered evidence of actual trained  female warriors.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxo Grammaticus reported that shield-maidens fought on the side of the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] in the year 750:
{{quote|Now out of the town of Sle, under the captains [[Heiðr|Hetha]] (Heid) and Wisna, with Hakon Cut-cheek came Tummi the Sailmaker. On these captains, who had the bodies of women, nature bestowed the souls of men.

==Legendary accounts==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include [[Brynhildr]] in the ''[[Vǫlsunga saga]]'', [[Hervor]] in ''[[Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks]]'', the Brynhildr of the ''[[Bósa saga ok Herrauðs]]'', the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in ''[[Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar]]'' and Princess Hed, Visna and [[Veborg]] in ''[[Gesta Danorum]]''.

Two shield-maidens appear in certain translations of the ''Hervarar saga''. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword [[Tyrfing]] from her father's burial site and became a seafaring raider.  She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking [[Huns]]. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens theorize that shield-maidens' often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.&lt;ref name=Tolkien&gt;{{cite web|last=Tolkien|first=Christopher|title=The Saga of King Heidrik the Wise|url=http://vsnrweb-publications.org.uk/The%20Saga%20Of%20King%20Heidrek%20The%20Wise.pdf|publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd.|accessdate=April 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir===
{{Main|Brynhildr}}
Brynhildr of the ''Vǫlsunga saga'', along with her rival in love, [[Gudrun|Guðrún Gjúkadóttir]], provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas.  Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honor, much like a male warrior.  When she ends up married to Gudrun's brother [[Gunther|Gunnarr]] instead of [[Sigurd|Sigurðr]], the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;Sigurd fought the dragon
And that afterward will be
Forgotten by no one
While men still live.
Yet your brother
Neither dared
To ride into the fire
Nor to leap across it.&lt;ref name=Byock&gt;Byock, Jesse L. (Trans.) ''Saga of the Volsungs.''University of California Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her.&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð's son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr's family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, "Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires."&lt;ref name=Byock/&gt; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes. While a shield-maiden does not fill a woman's typical role, her strength of character is found in even the more domestic women in these stories.

==In popular culture==
While women warriors are a staple of [[fantasy]], they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include [[Éowyn]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and Thorgil in [[Nancy Farmer]]'s ''[[The Sea of Trolls]]'' trilogy.

In the 2013 TV series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', the legendary Viking shield-maiden [[Lagertha]], played by [[Katheryn Winnick]], is a principal character.

The '''Simatic S5 PLC''' is an [[automation]] system based on [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s. It was manufactured and sold by [[Siemens AG]]. Such automation systems [[systems control|control]] process equipment and machinery used in manufacturing. This [[Product lining|product line]] is considered obsolete, as the manufacturer has since replaced it with their newer [[Simatic S7 PLC]]. However, the S5 PLC still has a huge installation base in factories around the world. Most automation systems integrators still have the ability to provide support for the platform.

==Hardware==
The S5 line comes in the 90U, 95U, 101U, 100U, 105, 110, 115,115U, 135U, and 155U chassis styles. The higher the number (except for the 101U), the more sophisticated and more expensive the system. Within each chassis style, several [[CPU]]s are available, with varying speed, memory, and capabilities. Some systems provide redundant CPU operation for ultra-high-reliability control, as used in [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical]] [[manufacturing]], for example.

Each chassis consists of a [[power supply]], and a backplane with slots for the addition of various option boards. Available options include serial and Ethernet communications, digital input and output cards, [[analog signal processing]] boards, counter cards, and other specialized interface and function modules.

==Software==
The S5 product line is usually programmed with a PC based software programming tool called ''Step 5''. Step 5 is used for programming, testing, and commissioning, and for documentation of programs for S5 PLCs.

The original Step5 versions ran on the [[CP/M|CP/M operating system]]. Later versions ran on [[MS-DOS]], and then versions of Windows through [[Windows XP]]. The final version of Step 5 is version 7.2 (upgradable to version 7.23 Hotfix 1 with patches). No further development of this product line has occurred since that time, due to its announced obsolescence.

In addition to Step5, Siemens offered a proprietary [[State logic]] programming package called Graph5. Graph5 is a sequential [[programming language]] intended for use on machines that normally run through a series of discrete steps. It simulates a [[State machine]] on the S5 platform.

Several third-party programming environments have been released for the S5. Most closely emulate Step5, some adding macros and other minor enhancements, others functioning drastically differently from Step5. One allows Step5 programs to be cross-compiled to and from the [[C (programming language)|C]] programming language and [[BASIC]].

==Structured programming==
STEP 5 allows the creation of structured or unstructured programming, from simple AND/OR operations up to complex subroutines. A STEP 5 program may, therefore, contain thousands of statements.

To maintain maximum transparency, STEP 5 offers a number of structuring facilities:
* Block technique - A linear operation sequence is divided into sections and packed into individual blocks.
* Segments - Within blocks, fine structuring is possible by programming subtasks in individual segments.
* Comments - Both a complete program as well as individual blocks or segments and individual statements can be directly provided with comments.

==Methods of representation==
STEP 5 programs can be represented in three different ways:
* Statement List (STL) - The program consists of a sequence of mnemonic codes of the commands executed one after another by the PLC.
* [[Ladder logic|Ladder Diagram]] (LAD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols of the [[circuit diagram]]
* [[Function block diagram|Function Block Diagram]] (FBD) - Graphical representation of the automation task with symbols to DIN 40700/ DIN 40719.

Absolute or symbolic designations can be used for operands with all three methods of representation.

In LAD and FBD complex functions and function block calls can be entered via [[function key]]s. They are displayed on the screen as graphical symbols.

There are several program editors, from either genuine Siemens, or from other suppliers. Because Siemens no longer support. So, other Supplier start to develop new STEP5 version which can run on Windows XP, or Windows 7.

== Blocks==
Five types of blocks are available:
* Organization blocks (OB) - for managing the control program
* Programming blocks (PB) - contain the control program structured according to functional or process-oriented characteristics
* Sequence blocks (SB) - for programming sequential controls
* Function blocks (FB) - contain frequently occurring and particularly complex program parts
* Data blocks (DB) - for storing data required for processing the control program.

Some S5 PLCs also have block types FX (Extended Function Blocks), and DX(Extended Data Blocks); these are not distinct block types, but rather are another set of available blocks due to the CPU having more memory and addressing space.

==Operations==
STEP 5 differentiates between three types of operations: 
* Basic operations, (e.g. linking, saving, loading &amp; transferring, counting, comparing, arithmetic operations, module operations) - These can be performed in all three representations.
* Supplementary operations and complex functions, (e.g. substitution statements, testing functions, word-by-word logic operations, decrement/increment and jump functions.) - These can only be executed in STL.
* System operations (direct access the [[operating system]]) - These can only be executed in STL.

==Additional functions==
* Saving user-specific project settings
* Symbol editor
* Automatic generation and updating of [[cross-reference]] lists
* Comparison of user programs
* Transferring blocks to [[EPROM]] and [[EEPROM]] memory modules for programmable controllers
* Rewiring inputs, outputs, flags, timers and counters
* Testing and service functions for startup and maintenance

A '''slot''' comprises the operation issue and data paths machinery surrounding a collection of one or more [[functional unit]]s (FUs) which share these resources. The term slot is common for this purpose in the [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] world where the relationship between operation in an [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] and [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] to execute it is explicit. In dynamically scheduled machines the concept is more commonly called an '''execute pipeline'''.

Modern conventional [[Central processing unit|CPU]]s have several compute pipelines (say two [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], one [[Floating point unit|FPU]], one [[Streaming SIMD Extensions|SSE]]/[[MMX (instruction set)|MMX]], one [[Branch (computer science)|branch]]) each of which can issue one instruction per basic [[Instruction cycle|cycle]] but can have several in flight. These are what correspond to slots. The pipelines may have several FUs - an [[Adder (electronics)|adder]] and a [[Binary multiplier|multiplier]], say - but only one FU in a pipeline can be issued to in a particular cycle. The FU population of a pipeline/slot is a design option in a CPU.

'''Social immunity''' is any antiparasite defence mounted for the benefit of individuals other than the actor. For [[Parasitism|parasites]], the frequent contact, high [[population density]] and low [[genetic variability]] makes [[Sociality|social groups]] of organisms a promising target for infection: this has driven the evolution of collective and cooperative anti-parasite mechanisms that both prevent the establishment of and reduce the damage of diseases among group members. Social immune mechanisms range from the [[prophylactic]], such as [[burying beetle]]s smearing their carcasses with [[antimicrobial]]s or [[termite]]s fumigating their nests with [[naphthalene]], to the active defenses seen in the imprisoning of [[Small hive beetle|parasitic beetles]] by [[Cape honey bee|honeybees]] or by the miniature 'hitchhiking' [[leafcutter ant]]s which travel on larger worker's leaves to fight off [[parasitoid]] flies. Whilst many specific social immune mechanisms had been studied in relative isolation (e.g. the "'''collective medication'''" of [[wood ants]]), it was not until Sylvia Cremer et al.'s 2007 paper "Social Immunity" that the topic was seriously considered. Empirical and theoretical work in social immunity continues to reveal not only new mechanisms of protection but also implications for understanding of the evolution of group living and [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]]. 

Social immunity (also termed collective immunity) describes the additional level of disease protection arising in social groups from collective [[disease]] defences, performed either jointly or towards one another. These collective defences complement the individual [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] of all group members and constitute an extra layer of protection at the group level, combining [[Ethology|behavioural]], [[Physiology|physiological]] and organisational adaptations. These defences can be employed either [[Prophylaxis|prophylactically]] or on demand.

== Definition ==
[[File:Lasius_neglectus_grooming.jpg|thumb|Grooming is a key social immune defence. Here, ''[[Lasius neglectus]]'' ants groom a pathogen-exposed (red colour mark) ant to remove infectious stages of the [[fungus]] ''[[Metarhizium]]'' from its body surface, thereby reducing its risk of infection.]] 

Sylvia Cremer defined social immunity in her seminal 2007 ''Current Biology'' paper 'Social Immunity' as the "collective action or [[Altruism |altruistic]] behaviours of infected individuals that benefit the colony". She laid out a conceptual framework for the topic using examples from [[primate]]s and [[eusocial insects]].&lt;ref name="Meunier2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meunier |first1=J. |title=Social immunity and the evolution of group living in insects |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=370 |issue=1669 |year=2015 |pages=20140102–20140102 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2014.0102 |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/370/1669/20140102|pmc=4410369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cremer |first1=Sylvia |last2=Armitage |first2=Sophie A.O. |last3=Schmid-Hempel |first3=Paul |title=Social Immunity |journal=Current Biology |volume=17 |issue=16 |year=2007 |pages=R693–R702 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.06.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cremer's definition focused on the collective benefits of behaviours and was adopted by other [[Behavioral ecology|behavioural ecologists]] (e.g. Wilson-Rich 2009&lt;ref name="Wilson-Rich2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilson-Rich |first=Noah |author2=Marla Spivak |author3=Nina H. Fefferman |author4=Philip T.

M. |date=2010-07-01 |title=Personal immunity versus social immunity |url=http://beheco.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/4/663 |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=663–668 |doi=10.1093/beheco/arq070}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition places importance on the evolutionary origin of behaviours rather than on their functional role at present; Cotter and Kilner explained that their broader definition would include immune behaviours in both animal families and [[social microbes]] as well as situations where [[herd immunity]] exists due to investment in personal immunity, arguing that this allowed for investigations of the evolution of social immunity to have a "greater depth than would otherwise be possible".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They further suggested that the evolution of social immunity be seen as one of the [[The Major Transitions in Evolution |major transitions in evolution]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Joël Meunier proposed a further redefinition in his 2015 paper on the role of social immunity in the evolution of group living, suggesting that Cotter and Kilner's definition could problematically encompass immune defences which arise not due to social life but due to shared location; Meunier defines a social immune system as "any collective and personal mechanism that has emerged and/or is maintained at least partly due to the anti-parasite defence it provides to other group members".&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

== Mechanisms ==
Upon exposure to a parasite, group members must both evaluate the threat it poses and the current level of colony infection in order to respond appropriately. Mechanisms of social immunity are often categorized by the stage of the parasite attack on a group of organisms they target.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; Some mechanisms are [[prophylactic]] (e.g. [[burying beetle]]s smearing their carcasses with antimicrobials or termites fumigating their nests with [[napthalene]]) whilst others are activated in response to a parasite challenge (e.g. imprisoning of parasitic beetles by honeybees or by the miniature 'hitchhiking' leafcutter ants who travel on larger workers' leaves to fight off parasitoid flies).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===In insects===
For a parasite to succeed in infecting multiple members of an insect group, it must complete three key tasks:

# be taken up from the extra-nest environment into the nest
# establish itself within the nest
# multiply and spread to many more insect group members
Mechanisms of social immunity are thus often categorized by which step(s) they hinder and/or block.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;
Levels of sociality across the class [[Insect]]a range from eusocial species (with cooperative brood care, overlapping generations within a colony of adults and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive castes) to solitary living, with many intermediate systems in between which despite lacking full eusociality still may exhibit parental care or nest cohabitation. Different systems of social organization alter both the possibility and cost-benefit ratio of social immune mechanisms (e.g. guarding the entrance to the nest requires both division of labour, whilst [[Social grooming |allogrooming]] merely requires behavioural interactions), though the absence of many behaviours currently only recorded in eusocial [[taxa]] from non-eusocial taxa may simply be due to a lack of study of these group's social immune systems.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; For instance it seems plausible that insects living in common nest sites could evolve to remove [[conspecific]] corpses from the nest or to isolate an infected group member - and yet these behaviours (and many more) have only been recorded in eusocial species.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; Alternatively it may be the case that whilst the three conditions of eusociality themselves are not prerequisites for the emergence of these behaviours, secondary consequences of eusociality are. Perhaps the large number of individuals in eusocial colonies increases the efficiency of collective anti-parasite defences and thus their emergence begins to be selected for; or perhaps the preponderance of non-reproductive individuals is a necessary driver for the evolution of these behaviours, as when in a colony attacked by a parasite they can only increase their indirect fitness via social immunity directed at the queen's brood.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

The lack of collective defences in some eusocial taxa also shows that social immunity may also not always be adaptive (due to [[Life history theory |life history]] costs or ineffectiveness against a particular parasite's infective strategy), and that living in a group does not necessitate the expression of any particular suite of social immunity mechanisms. For example, worker termites (''[[Zootermopsis angusticollis |Zootermopsiss angusticollis]]'') do not discriminate between infected and uninfected conspecifics, pharaoh ant colonies (''[[Monomorium pharaonis]]'') choose to move into infected nests over uninfected ones and queen wood ants (''[[Formica paralugubris]]'') are not repelled but actually attracted to habitats contaminated with [[Entomopathogenic fungus |entamopathogenic fungi]].&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

==== Inhibiting parasite uptake into the nest ====
[[File:Honeybees-27527-2.jpg|thumb|The entrance to a hive of [[Apis mellifera ligustica |Italian honeybees]] (''Apis mellifera ligustica'')—the outward-facing bees are guarding the entrance]]

A parasite may be passively transported into a nest by a group member or may actively search for the nest; once inside, parasite transmission can be vertical (from mother to daughter colony into the next generation) or horizontally (between/within colonies).&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007" /&gt; In eusocial insects, the most frequent defence against parasite uptake into the nest is to prevent infection during and/or after foraging,&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; and a wide range of active and prophylactic mechanisms have evolved to this end.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007" /&gt;

Aversion to consuming or coming into contact with contaminated material also exists in presocial species, e.g., the gregarious-phase migratory grasshoppers ''[[Melanoplus sanguinipes]]'' avoids consuming conspecific corpses infected by entomoparasitic fungi.

It is currently unclear whether these aversive behaviours evolved and/or are maintained due to social interactions - the increase in direct fitness that avoiding contaminated material confers means that more research is required to tease out the [[Kin selection |indirect fitness]] benefits from the direct.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

==== Inhibiting the parasite establishing itself within the nest ====
Once a parasite has entered the nest, colonies must now prevent the establishment of the parasite - this is particularly important for long-lived societies which without would accrue a high parasite load.&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007" /&gt; In eusocial insects the most common mechanisms to stop establishment involve sanitising the nest and integrating substances with antimicrobial activity into nest material - nest hygiene behaviours.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007" /&gt; Examples include:

==== Inhibiting intra-group transmission ====

[[File:H1N1 flu vaccination DVIDS457822.jpg|thumb|According to [[Richard Dawkins]]'s concept of the extended phenotype, human healthcare activities, such as vaccination (''depicted here'') could be seen as social immunity]]

After the broader definition of social immunity by Cotter and Kilner, numerous examples of social immune behaviours within animal families can be given: túngara frogs (''[[Engystomops pustulosus]]'') create 'foam nests' during breeding in which [[embryogenesis]] occurs; these foam nests are imbued with [[ranaspumin]] proteins which provide defence against microbial attack and act as a [[detergent]]. The three-spined stickleback (''[[Gasterosteus aculeatus]]''), grass goby ''([[Zosterisessor ophiocephalus]]''), fringed darter (''[[Etheostoma crossopterum]]'') and two species of [[blenny]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;also use chemical strategies to defend their eggs from microbes.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Intriguingly, microbes themselves have been found to have social immune systems: when a population of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is infected with [[gentamicin]], some individuals (called small colony variants) begin to respire [[Anaerobic respiration |anaerobically]], lowering the [[pH]] of the environment and thus conferring resistance to the antibiotic to all other individuals-including those ''S. aureus'' individuals who did not switch phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Massey |first=Ruth C |last2=Peacock |first2=Sharon J |title=Antibiotic-resistant sub-populations of the pathogenic bacterium ''Staphylococcus aureus'' confer population-wide resistance |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0960-9822(02)01205-8 |journal=Current Biology |volume=12 |issue=20 |pages=R686–R687 |doi=10.1016/s0960-9822(02)01205-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analogy can be drawn here with the social fever in bees described above: a subset of individuals in a population change their behaviour and in doing so provide population-wide resistance.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Using [[Richard Dawkins]]'s concept of the [[extended phenotype]], the healthcare systems developed by humans could be seen as a form of social immunity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Already a [[Model organism |model system]] in [[evolutionary ecology]] due to their extensive [[parental care]], [[burying beetles]] like ''N. vespilloides'' hunt for small [[vertebrate]] carcasses which they then bury before intricately preparing it as a resource for its larvae to breed on-these carcasses are scarce and ephemeral yet are necessary for burying beetles' [[reproductive success]]. Carcasses are highly contested resources with challenges being launched by other burying beetles and other scavenging species, as well as microbial [[decomposer]]s. Older carcasses have a higher microbial load and thus have a lower quality as a breeding resource: larvae raised on these carcasses are smaller and in a worse nutritional state–at adulthood these beetles were also smaller, which in ''N. vespilloides'' reduces fitness.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Daniel Rozen et al. demonstrated in 2008 that ''N. vespilloides'' preferentially chooses newer carcasses (which tend to have a lower microbial load) over old carcasses, and if it is not possible to acquire one of these higher quality carcasses that they use pre and post-hatching parental care to reduce the challenge posed by microbes.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Sheena Cotter and Rebecca Kilner demonstrated that part of this anti-microbial parental care involved both parents smearing the carcass with antibacterial anal exudates: their 2009 work demonstrated that when beetles encounter a carcass they upregulate the antibacterial activity of their anal exudate by actively altering its composition ([[lysozyme]]-like activity increases, [[phenoloxidase]] activity decreases), and that the specifics of this social immune system differed between the sexes: female exudate has greater antibacterial activity than males; widowed males increased the antibacterial activity of their exudate whilst a reduction was seen in widowed females.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Cotter et al. went on to show the costliness of this social immune response-by providing females with microbe-infested carcasses, they found that the upregulation of antibacterial activity that followed led to a 16% decrease in lifetime reproductive output.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cotter |first=S.

== Evolution ==

=== Comparison with personal immunity ===
Many researchers have noticed marked parallels between the more familiar personal immune systems of individual organisms (e.g. [[Lymphocyte |T and B lymphocytes]]) and the social immune systems described above, and it is generally appreciated among [[Ecoimmunology |ecological immunologists]] that rigorous comparative work between these two systems will increase of understanding of the evolution of social immunity.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Whilst the specific physiological mechanisms by which immunity is produced differ sharply between the individual and society, it is thought that at a "phenomenological" level the principles of parasite threat and response are similar: parasites must be detected rapidly, responses should differ depending on the parasite in question, spread of the infection must be limited and different components of the individual/society should be afforded different levels of protection depending on their relative fitness contribution.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Cremer was the first to do this systematically, and partitioned immunological phenomena into three categories: border defence (intake avoidance), [[soma (biology) |soma]] defence (avoid establishment within non-reproductive components of an individual/society) and [[Germline |germ-line]] defence (avoid infection of the reproductive components of an individual/society). Example analogies from Cremer's paper are:  

* Border defence:   
** [[Thrombus |Clotting]] in an individual's wounded blood vessels can be compared to the entrance-plugging behaviour of special ant workers in response to a parasite attack  
** The [[circulatory system]] of an individual can be compared to nutrient distribution in social insect colonies, where a few forage and then distribute it to the rest of the nest  
** Cats and dog self-grooming can be compared to allogrooming  
* Soma defence:  
** [[Granuloma]]s form to contain diseases that individual immune systems are struggling to eliminate; this can be compared to the social encapsulation seen against small hive beetles in honeybees
** [[Apoptosis]] in response to disease can be compared to the killing of infected workers or the enforced suicide seen in ''Temnothorax'' 
* Germ-line defence:
** The special protection afforded to reproductive organs (e.g. blood-ovary/[[Blood–testis barrier |blood-testes barrier]], increased number of immune cells relative to non-reproductive organs) can be compared to the royal chamber found in social insects, where due to cengtrifugal polyethism the queen(s), and sometimes king(s), are cared for by young workers who have remained inside the nest their whole life and thus have a lower probability of parasite infection

Other similarities include the immunological memory of the [[adaptive immune system]] in vertebrates and the observation that a similar collective memory (operating with a yet-to-be-explained mechanism) occurs in some insect societies e.g. individual ''Z. angusticollis'' survive ''M. anisopliae'' infections significantly more when they have been in contact with a previously infected conspecifc, a 'social transfer of immunity' or 'social vaccination'.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Traniello |first=James F.

Cotter and Kilner argue that not only is social immunity a useful concept to use when studying the major transitions in evolution (see below), that the origin of social immune systems might be considered a major transition itself.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Role in the evolution of group living ===

The transition from solitary living to group living (identified by [[John Maynard Smith]] as one of the seven [[Major transitions in evolution |major transitions in evolutionary history]]) brought with it many fitness benefits (increased anti-predator vigilance, foraging benefits etc.) and the opportunity to exploit a vast array of new ecological niches, but group living also has its pitfalls.&lt;ref name="CremerArmitage2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrauseRuxton2002"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HAoUFfVFtMcC |title=Living in Groups |date=10 October 2002 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-850818-2 |author1=Jens Krause |author2=Graeme D. Ruxton |author2link=Graeme Ruxton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous studies have demonstrated an increase in contact-transmitted parasite load with group size increase,&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KrauseRuxton2002" /&gt; and thus research has been done on the role of social immunity in the evolution of early group living. Empirical evidence already exists, from both [[interspecific]] and [[intraspecific]] comparative studies, that an increase in population density drives an increase in personal immune effort (density-dependent prophylaxis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hoggard |first=Stephen J. |last2=Wilson |first2=Peter D. |last3=Beattie |first3=Andrew J. |last4=Stow |first4=Adam J. |date=2011-07-06 |title=Social Complexity and Nesting Habits Are Factors in the Evolution of Antimicrobial Defences in Wasps |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021763 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=6 |issue=7 |pages=e21763 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021763 |pmc=3130748 |pmid=21754998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Turnbull |first=Christine |last2=Hoggard |first2=Stephen |last3=Gillings |first3=Michael |last4=Palmer |first4=Chris |last5=Stow |first5=Adam |last6=Beattie |first6=Doug |last7=Briscoe |first7=David |last8=Smith |first8=Shannon |last9=Wilson |first9=Peter |date=2011-04-23 |title=Antimicrobial strength increases with group size: implications for social evolution |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/7/2/249 |journal=Biology Letters |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=249–252 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2010.0719 |pmc=3061164 |pmid=20880858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stow |first=Adam |last2=Briscoe |first2=David |last3=Gillings |first3=Michael |last4=Holley |first4=Marita |last5=Smith |first5=Shannon |last6=Leys |first6=Remko |last7=Silberbauer |first7=Tish |last8=Turnbull |first8=Christine |last9=Beattie |first9=Andrew |date=2007-08-22 |title=Antimicrobial defences increase with sociality in bees |url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/4/422 |journal=Biology Letters |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=422–424 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0178 |pmc=2390670 |pmid=17504731}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also good evidence that the evolution of social immunity leads to a trade-off between effort into personal immune responses vs. effort in social immune responses - physiological and genomic studies have shown that social conditions can lead to a reduction in personal immune effort.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; Personal immunity in the Australian plague locust (''[[Chortoicetes terminifera]])'' decreases upon an increase in population density and increases when artificially isolated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Miller |first=Gabriel A. |last2=Simpson |first2=Stephen J. |date=2010-04-01 |title=Isolation from a marching band increases haemocyte density in wild locusts (''Chortoicetes terminifera'') |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01180.x/abstract |journal=Ecological Entomology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=236–239 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2010.01180.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genomics |Genomic]] studies reveal that infected solitary ''[[Schistocerca gregaria |S. gregaria]]'' express more genes involved in immunity than infected individuals in the gregarious phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Yundan |last2=Yang |first2=Pengcheng |last3=Cui |first3=Feng |last4=Kang |first4=Le |date=2013-01-10 |title=Altered Immunity in Crowded Locust Reduced Fungal ( ''Metarhizium anisopliae'' ) Pathogenesis |url=http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003102 |journal=PLOS Pathog |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=e1003102 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1003102 |pmc=3542111 |pmid=23326229}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'' workers also upregualte immune-related genes when experimentally isolated and there are three times more immune-related gene families in solitary insects than in the eusocial honeybees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Richter |first=Jeanny |last2=Helbing |first2=Sophie |last3=Erler |first3=Silvio |last4=Lattorff |first4=H.

Joël Meunier argued that the two seemingly contradictory relationships between personal immune effort and population density were a function of two assumptions implicit in the prediction that there should be a negative correlation between personal immune effort and group living:
# "Group living is always associated with the expression of social immunity" – this is false; worker termites (''Z. angusticollis'') do not discriminate between infected and uninfected conspecifics, pharaoh ant colonies (''Monomorium pharaonis'') choose to move into infected nests over uninfected ones and queen wood ant (''Formica paralugubris'') are not repelled but actually attracted to habitats contaminated with entamopathogenic fungi.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;
# "Social immune responses are costly for producers" – only in one species, ''Nicrophorus vespilloides,'' has this assumption been tested&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; - a bacterial challenge to the larval resource led to a social immune response by the mother, and this response did lead to a reduction in lifetime reproductive success (i.e. there was a cost).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;
Whilst advising that further studies in lots of different eusocial and non-eusocial taxa are required to better assess the validity of these assumptions, Meunier notes that the existence of a trade-off between personal and social immunity could be masked or erroneously 'discovered' in a population/species due to individual variation (e.g. low-quality individuals may not be able to afford relatively high investment into both immune systems), and thus recommends that the intrinsic quality of individuals should be controlled for if valid conclusions are to be drawn.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

To assess what current knowledge of social immune systems suggested about whether social immunity was a bypoduct or driver of complex group living, Meunier delineated 30 different mechanisms of social immunity found in eusocial insects and looked for counterparts to these in presocial and solitary insects.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; Supporting the hypothesis that social immunity was a driver and not a by-product of complex group living, 10 mechanisms had counterparts in presocial insects and 4 in solitary species (though this does not imply that some mechanisms may evolve as a byproduct).&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; Evidence that social immunity mechanisms are selected for at least somewhat due to collective benefits is lacking though – possibly due to the difficulty in isolating the immune benefits from the other benefits that social immunity mechanisms often bestow (e.g. allogrooming inhibits the establishment of ectoparasites, but also improves the accuracy of nest mate recognition due to the sharing and thus homogenization of chemical signatures between group members), and the difficulty in experimentally separating direct fitness from indirect fitness, potentiated in eusocial taxa where sterile/non-reproductive individuals predominatee.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt; More studies on presocial taxa would allow for phyletic analyses to recover the actual path of evolution that different mechanisms of social immunity took.&lt;ref name="Meunier2015" /&gt;

=== Role in the evolution of polyandry ===

The origin of [[polyandry in nature]] and its adaptive value is a subject of ongoing controversy in [[evolutionary biology]], partly due to the seemingly numerous costs it places on females - additional energetic and temporal allocation to reproduction, increased risk of predation, increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases and increased risk of physical harm caused by copulation/sexual coercion – for eusocial insects, the effects polyandry has on the colony member's [[coefficient of relatedness]] is also important, as reducing the relatedness of workers limits the power of kin selection to maintain the ultracooperative behaviours which are vital to a colonies' success.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Reber |first=Anabelle |last2=Castella |first2=Grégoire |last3=Christe |first3=Philippe |last4=Chapuisat |first4=Michel |date=2008-07-01 |title=Experimentally increased group diversity improves disease resistance in an ant species |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01177.x/abstract |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=11 |issue=7 |pages=682–689 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2008.01177.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Baer |first=Boris |last2=Schmid-Hempel |first2=Paul |date=2001-01-01 |title=Unexpected Consequences of Polyandry for Parasitism and Fitness in the Bumblebee, ''Bombus terrestris'' |jstor=2680382 |journal=Evolution |volume=55 |issue=8 |pages=1639–1643 |doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2001)055[1639:ucopfp]2.0.co;2 |pmid=11580023}}&lt;/ref&gt; One hypothesis for the evolution of polyandry draws on the disease resistance that increased genetic diversity supposedly brings for a group, and a growing body of evidence from insect taxa supports this hypothesis, some of it discussed above.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sherman |first=Paul W. |last2=Seeley |first2=Thomas D. |last3=Reeve |first3=Hudson K. |date=1988-01-01 |title=Parasites, Pathogens, and Polyandry in Social Hymenoptera |jstor=2461747 |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=131 |issue=4 |pages=602–610 |doi=10.1086/284809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trinity of social immunity 2.pdf|thumb|left|Schematic depicting the overlapping nature of the different components of collective disease defences.]]
Social immunity provides an integrated approach for the study of [[disease]] dynamics in societies, combining both the behaviour and physiology (including molecular-level processes) of all group members and their social interactions. It thereby links the fields of [[social evolution]] and [[ecological immunology]]. Social immunity also affects [[epidemiology]], as it can impact both the course of an infection at the individual level, as well as the spread of disease within the group.

Social immunity differs from similar phenomena that can occur in groups that are not truly social (e.g. herding animals). These include (i) density dependent prophylaxis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=WILSON|first1=KENNETH|last2=REESON|first2=ANDREW F.|title=Density-dependent prophylaxis: evidence from Lepidoptera–baculovirus interactions?|journal=Ecological Entomology|date=February 1998|volume=23|issue=1|pages=100–101|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2311.1998.00107.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is the up regulation of the individual immunity of group members under temporal crowding, and (ii) [[herd immunity]], which is the protection of [[susceptible individual]]s in an otherwise [[immune]] group, where pathogens are unable to spread due to the high ratio of immune to susceptible hosts.&lt;ref name=masri&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masri|first1=Leila|last2=Cremer|first2=Sylvia|title=Individual and social immunisation in insects|journal=Trends in Immunology|date=October 2014|volume=35|issue=10|pages=471–482|doi=10.1016/j.it.2014.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, although social immunity can be achieved through behavioural, physiological or organisational defences, these components are not mutually exclusive and often overlap. For example, organisational defences, such as an altered interaction network that influences disease spread, emerge from chemical and behavioural processes.&lt;ref name=babz&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroeymeyt|first1=Nathalie|last2=Casillas-Pérez|first2=Barbara|last3=Cremer|first3=Sylvia|title=Organisational immunity in social insects|journal=Current Opinion in Insect Science|date=November 2014|volume=5|pages=1–15|doi=10.1016/j.cois.2014.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease risk in social groups==

Disease risk is further affected by the [[ecology]].

All of these factors combined can therefore contribute to rapid disease spread following an outbreak, and, if transmission is not controlled, an [[epizootic]] (an animal [[epidemic]]) may result. Hence, social immunity has evolved to reduce and mitigate this risk.

==Components of social immunity in insect societies==

===Nest hygiene===
Social insects have evolved an array of sanitary behaviours to keep their nests clean, thereby reducing the probability of parasite establishment and spread within the colony.&lt;ref name=cremer /&gt; Such behaviours can be employed either [[prophylactically]], or actively, upon demand. For example, social insects can incorporate materials with antimicrobial properties into their nest, such as conifer [[resin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Christe|first1=Philippe|last2=Oppliger|first2=Anne|last3=Bancalà|first3=Francesco|last4=Castella|first4=Grégoire|last5=Chapuisat|first5=Michel|title=Evidence for collective medication in ants|journal=Ecology Letters|date=13 December 2002|volume=6|issue=1|pages=19–22|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00395.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CASTELLA|first1=GRÉGOIRE|last2=CHAPUISAT|first2=MICHEL|last3=MORET|first3=YANNICK|last4=CHRISTE|first4=PHILIPPE|title=The presence of conifer resin decreases the use of the immune system in wood ants|journal=Ecological Entomology|date=June 2008|volume=33|issue=3|pages=408–412|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2311.2007.00983.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or faecal pellets that contain [[symbiont]] derived [[antimicrobials]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosengaus|first1=Rebeca B.|last2=Guldin|first2=Matthew R.|last3=Traniello|first3=James F.

[[Honeybees]] have evolved the ability to actively maintain a constant temperature within their hives to ensure optimal brood development. Upon exposure to ''Ascoshpaera apis'', a heat sensitive fungal pathogen that causes chalk brood, honeybees increase the temperature of the brood combs, thereby creating conditions that disfavour the growth of the pathogen. This "social fever" is performed before [[symptoms]] of the disease are expressed and can therefore be viewed as a preventative measure to avoid chalk brood outbreaks in the colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starks|first1=P.

Sanitary care reduces the risk of infection for group members and can slow the course of disease. For example, grooming is the first line of defence against externally-infected pathogens such as [[entomopathogenic fungi]], whose infectious [[conidia]] can be mechanically removed through self- and [[allogrooming]] (social grooming) to prevent infection. As conidia of such fungi only loosely attach to the cuticle of the host to begin with,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deacon|first1=J W|title=Fungal Biology|date=2005|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9781405130660|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; grooming can dramatically reduce the number of infective stages.&lt;ref name="Royal Society B 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=W.

===Colony-level immunisation===

[[Immunisation]] is a reduced [[Susceptible individual|susceptibility]] to a parasite upon secondary exposure to the same parasite.  The past decade has revealed that immunisation occurs in [[invertebrates]] and is active against a wide rage of parasites. It occurs in two forms: (i) specific immune priming particular parasite or (ii) a general immune up-regulation that promotes unspecific protection against a broad range of parasites. In any case, the underlying mechanisms of immunisation in invertebrates are still  mostly elusive. In social animals, immunisation is not restricted to the level of the individual, but can also occur at the society level, via 'social immunisation'.&lt;ref name=masri /&gt; Social immunisation occurs when some proportion of the group's members are exposed to a parasite, which then leads to the protection of the whole group, upon secondary contact to the same parasite. Social immunisation has been so far described in a [[dampwood termite]]-fungus system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traniello|first1=J. F. A.|last2=Rosengaus|first2=R.

This contamination resulted in low-level infections of the fungus in the nestmates, which stimulated their immune system, and protected them against subsequent lethal exposures to the same pathogen. This method of immunisation parallels [[variolation]], an early form of human [[vaccination]], which used live pathogens to protect patients against, for example, [[smallpox]] &lt;ref name = "konrad" /&gt;

===Organisational defence===
[[File:Interactions_in_ant_nests.png|thumb|right|The controlled interactions between colony members through spatial, behavioural and temporal segregation, is thought to restrict disease transmission.]]
Organisational disease defence — or organisational immunity — refers to patterns of social interactions which could, hypothetically, mitigate disease transmission in a social group.&lt;ref name=babz /&gt; As disease transmission occurs through social interactions, changes in the type and frequency of these interactions are expected to modulate disease spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmid-Hempel|first=Paul|last2=Schmid-Hempel|first2=Regula|date=1993-01-01|title=Transmission of a Pathogen in Bombus terrestris, with a Note on Division of Labour in Social Insects|jstor=4600887|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=33|issue=5|pages=319–327|doi=10.1007/bf00172930}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisational immunity is predicted to have both a constitutive and an induced component. The innate, organisational substructure of social insect colonies may provide constitutional protection of the most valuable colony members, the queens and brood, as disease will be contained within subgroups. Social insect colonies are segregated into worker groups that experience different disease hazards, where the young and reproductive individuals interact minimally with the workers performing the tasks with higher disease risk (e.g. foragers).&lt;ref name=cremer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmid-Hempel|first1=Paul|last2=Schmid-Hempel|first2=Regula|title=Transmission of a pathogen in Bombus terrestris, with a note on division of labour in social insects|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=November 1993|volume=33|issue=5|doi=10.1007/BF00172930}}&lt;/ref&gt; This segregation can arise as a result of the physical properties of the nest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pie|first1=Marcio R.|last2=Rosengaus|first2=Rebeca B.|last3=Traniello|first3=James F.A.|title=Nest architecture, activity pattern, worker density and the dynamics of disease transmission in social insects|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=January 2004|volume=226|issue=1|pages=45–51|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2003.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the differences in space usage of the individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mersch|first1=D.

However, the organisational immunity hypothesis is currently mainly supported by theoretical models and awaits empirical testing.&lt;ref name="babz" /&gt;

Its members include many of the top [[audio engineer]]s working in the industry today.

SPARS also developed the [[SPARS Code]] which was common on the back of CD covers from the late eighties to the mid nineties. It specified whether [[Analog recording|analogue]] or [[Digital Audio|digital]] recording mediums were used in each process of the recording.

{{Refimprove|date=April 2014}}
'''Spirit of place''' (or soul) refers to the unique, distinctive and cherished aspects of a place; often those celebrated by artists and writers, but also those cherished in [[Folklore|folk tales]], [[festival]]s and celebrations. It is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture ([[folklore|stories]], art, memories, beliefs, histories, etc.) as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place ([[monument]]s, boundaries, [[river]]s, [[woodland|woods]], architectural style, [[rural crafts]] styles, pathways, [[Vista (landscaping)|views]], and so on) or its [[interpersonal]] aspects (the presence of [[Kinship|relatives]], [[friendship|friends]] and kindred spirits, and the like).{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place &amp;mdash; whereas the very similar term [[sense of place]] would tend to be more domestic, [[urbanist|urban]], or [[suburban]] in tone. For instance, one could logically apply 'sense of place' to an urban high street; noting the [[architecture]], the width of the [[road]]s and [[Sidewalk|pavement]]s, the [[plants|plantings]], the style of the [[Retailing#Shops and stores|shop]]-fronts, the [[street furniture]], and so on, but one could not really talk about the 'spirit of place' of such an essentially urban and commercial environment. However, an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in [[children's street culture]].{{or|date=December 2016}}

The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term for spirit of place was [[Genius loci]], by which it is sometimes still referred. This has often been historically envisaged as a guardian [[animal]] or a small supernatural being ([[puck (mythology)|puck]], [[fairy]], [[elf]], and the like) or a [[ghost]]. In the developed world these beliefs have been, for the most part, discarded. A new layer of less-embodied superstition on the subject, however, has arisen around [[ley lines]], [[feng shui]] and similar concepts, on the one hand, and urban leftover spaces, such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some North-American downtown areas, on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;A. Akkerman and A.F. Cornfeld (2010) "Greening as an urban design metaphor: Looking for the city's soul in leftover spaces," The ''[https://www.usask.ca/structurist/ Structurist]'' 49/50: 30-35&lt;/ref&gt;

The western cultural movements of [[Romanticism]] and [[Neo-romanticism]] are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that 're-enchant the land', in order to establish or re-establish a spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;T. Graves and L. Poraj-Wilezynska (2009) "'Spirit of place' as process: Archaeography, dowsing and perceptual mapping at Belas Knap," ''[http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx Time and Mind] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123161318/http://www.bergpublishers.com/BergJournals/TimeMind/tabid/3253/Default.aspx |date=2010-11-23 }}'' 2: 167-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern [[earth art]] (sometimes called environment art) artists such as [[Andy Goldsworthy]] have explored the contribution of natural/ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place.&lt;ref&gt;B. E. Bannon (2011) "Re-envisioning nature: The role of aesthetics in environmental ethics," ''[http://www.cep.unt.edu/enethics.html Environmental Ethics]'' 33(4): 415-436.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, R. (2008) Andy Goldsworthy: Nature's collaborator, art's alchemist," ''[http://www.queensu.ca/quarterly/ Queen's Quarterly]'' 114(4): 597-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their [[landscape]].&lt;ref&gt;Opp, J. (2011) "Public history and the fragments of place: Archaeology, history and heritage site development in southern Alberta," ''[http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rrhi20/current Rethinking History]'' 15: 241-267&lt;/ref&gt; Spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions: [[Shinto]] has its [[Kami]] which may incorporate spirits of place; Christianity has spirits of place in the Angelic Choirs of [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Dominions|Dominions]] and [[Christian angelic hierarchy#Principalities|Principalities]], [[Hinduism]], [[Vajrayana]] and [[Bonpo]] traditions.

==Spirit of Place Symposia==

Between 1988 and 1993, five annual Spirit of Place Symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist James Swan and Roberta Swan, in the United States and Japan. The programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place, and modern science and design. The programs—held in Davis, CA; Grace Cathedral, San Francisco' Mesa Verde National Park; Tenri, Japan; and San Rafael, CA—featured over 350 speakers, including scientists, designers, and representatives of natives cultures. They also included concerts by Paul Horn, Anna Halprin, [[Steven Halpern]], and R. Carlos Nakai. The five programs attracted an audience of 10,000, and featured on national TV in the United States and Japan. The 1992 symposium held in Tenri, Japan, was the largest environmental conference in Japan that year. Representatives of 20 different American Indian tribes, Ainu, Inuit, Aborigine, and African traditional cultures were speakers in the series. Two anthologies edited by James and Roberta Swan, ''The Power of Place'' (Quest, 1991) and ''Dialogues with the Living Earth'' (Quest, 1996) present a selection of presentations at the Spirit of Place Symposiums.

'''The Bonch-Bruevich Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications''' Russian: Санкт-Петербургский государственный университет телекоммуникаций им. проф. М.А.Бонч-Бруевича; Russian: СПбГУТ, SUT) is a very well-known university in the area of communications and telecommunications. The Bonch-Bruevich University offers training programs in communications and telecommunications, information technologies, computer science, economics, management, advertising and public relations. 

SPbSUT is a founding member of the ''Association of European Universities and Companies of Informatics and Computer Electronics'' (EUNICE).

== History ==

The Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications was established in 1930 under the name of the ''Leningrad Institute of Communication Engineers''. Its history is associated closely with the development of Russian and world science in the communications area, and with a great scientific and technical base.

From 1931 to 1940 the outstanding Russian scientist in radio mechanics, and corresponding member of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Professor [[Mikhail Aleksandrovich Bonch-Bruevich|Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich]], was the Head of the Chair of theoretical radio engineering in the Leningrad Electro-Technical Institute. He was a doctor of technical sciences, one of the originators of Spark Discharge Theory, as well as the Theory of Radio wave Transmission in the Upper Atmosphere, and creator of the first electronic tubes, radio-telephone transmitters, radio-telephone tube stations, etc.
In honor of Professor Bonch-Bruevich's scientific contributions, and in accordance with the USSR Council of People's Commissars' Decree of 8 June 1940, the ''Leningrad Institute of Communication Engineers'' was renamed as the ''Leningrad Electro-Technical Institute of Communications (LEIC), named after Bonch-Bruevich''.

In 1993 SUT was reconstituted, and gained its new status as the ''Bonch-Bruevich Saint Petersburg State University of Telecommunications'', by order of the Ministry of Communication of Russian Federation. New chairs were created: digital signal processing, communication networks, information safety of telecommunication systems, biomedical technology, information-managing systems, global information technologies, global info-communication networks and systems.

== Structure ==

As of September 2014, the university has 8 faculties, 1 institute and 6 research centers.

{{Automata theory}}
A '''Turing machine''' is a [[mathematical model of computation]] that defines an [[abstract machine]],&lt;ref&gt;Minsky 1967:107 "In his 1936 paper, A. M. Turing defined the class of abstract machines that now bear his name. A Turing machine is a finite-state machine associated with a special kind of environment -- its tape -- in which it can store (and later recover) sequences of symbols", also Stone 1972:8 where the word "machine" is in quotation marks.&lt;/ref&gt; which manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1972:8 states "This "machine" is an abstract mathematical model", also cf. Sipser 2006:137ff that describes the "Turing machine model". Rogers 1987 (1967):13 refers to "Turing's characterization", Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25 refers to a "specific kind of idealized machine".&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the model's simplicity, given any [[computer algorithm]], a Turing machine capable of simulating that algorithm's logic can be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:137 "A Turing machine can do everything that a real computer can do".&lt;/ref&gt;

The machine operates on an infinite&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Sipser 2002:137. Also Rogers 1987 (1967):13 describes "a paper tape of infinite length in both directions". Minsky 1967:118 states "The tape is regarded as infinite in both directions". Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25 include the possibility of "there is someone stationed at each end to add extra blank squares as needed".&lt;/ref&gt; memory tape divided into [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] ''cells''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Rogers 1987 (1967):13. Other authors use the word "square" e.g. Boolos Burgess Jeffrey 2002:35, Minsky 1967:117, Penrose 1989:37.&lt;/ref&gt; The machine positions its ''head'' over a cell and "reads" (scans)&lt;ref&gt;This word is used by e.g. Davis 2000:151&lt;/ref&gt; the symbol there. Then, as per the symbol and its present place in a ''finite table''&lt;ref&gt;This table represents an [[algorithm]] or "effective computational procedure" which is necessarily finite; see Penrose 1989:30ff, Stone 1972:3ff.&lt;/ref&gt; of user-specified instructions, the machine (i) writes a symbol (e.g., a digit or a letter from a finite alphabet) in the cell (some models allowing symbol erasure or no writing),&lt;ref&gt;Boolos Burgess and Jeffrey 2002:25&lt;/ref&gt; then (ii) either moves the tape one cell left or right (some models allow no motion, some models move the head),&lt;ref&gt;Boolos Burgess Jeffry 2002:25 illustrate the machine as moving along the tape. Penrose 1989:36-37 describes himself as "uncomfortable" with an infinite tape observing that it "might be hard to shift!"; he "prefer[s] to think of the tape as representing some external environment through which our finite device can move" and after observing that the " 'movement' is a convenient way of picturing things" and then suggests that "the device receives all its input from this environment.&lt;/ref&gt; then (iii) (as determined by the observed symbol and the machine's place in the table) either proceeds to a subsequent instruction or halts the computation.&lt;ref&gt;"Also by convention one of the states is distinguished as the stopping state and is given the name HALT" (Stone 1972:9). Turing's original description did not include a HALT instruction but he did allow for a "circular" condition, a "configuration from which there is no possible move" (see Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1967:119); this notion was added in the 1950s; see more at [[Halting problem]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turing machine was invented in 1936 by [[Alan Turing]],&lt;ref name=Hodges-2012&gt;{{cite book| first=Andrew | last=Hodges | authorlink =Andrew Hodges | year = 2012 | title =[[Alan Turing: The Enigma]] (The Centenary Edition) |publisher =[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn=978-0-691-15564-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The idea came to him in mid-1935 (perhaps, see more in the History section) after a question posed by [[M. H. A. Newman]] in his lectures: "Was there a definite method, or as Newman put it, a ''mechanical process'' which could be applied to a mathematical statement, and which would come up with the answer as to whether it was provable" (Hodges 1983:93). Turing submitted his paper on 31 May 1936 to the London Mathematical Society for its ''Proceedings'' (cf. Hodges 1983:112), but it was ''published'' in early 1937 and offprints were available in February 1937 (cf. Hodges 1983:129).&lt;/ref&gt; who called it an ''a-machine'' (automatic machine).&lt;ref&gt;See footnote in Davis 2000:151.&lt;/ref&gt; With this model, Turing was able to answer two questions in the negative: (1) Does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape is "circular" (e.g., freezes, or fails to continue its computational task); similarly, (2) does a machine exist that can determine whether any arbitrary machine on its tape ever prints a given symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1965:132-134; Turing's definition of "circular" is found on page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by providing a mathematical description of a very simple device capable of arbitrary computations, he was able to prove properties of computation in general—and in particular, the [[computability|uncomputability]] of the [[Entscheidungsproblem]] ("decision problem").&lt;ref&gt;Turing 1936 in ''The Undecidable'' 1965:145&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Turing machines prove fundamental limitations on the power of mechanical computation.&lt;ref&gt;Sipser 2006:137 observes that "A Turing machine can do everything that a real computer can do. Nevertheless, even a Turing machine cannot solve certain problems. In a very real sense, these problems are beyond the theoretical limits of computation."&lt;/ref&gt; While they can express arbitrary computations, their minimalistic design makes them unsuitable for computation in practice: real-world [[computer]]s are based on different designs that, unlike Turing machines, use [[random-access memory]].

[[Turing completeness]] is the ability for a system of instructions to simulate a Turing machine. A programming language that is Turing complete is theoretically capable of expressing all tasks accomplishable by computers; nearly all programming languages are Turing complete if the limitations of finite memory are ignored.

==Overview==
A '''Turing machine''' is a general example of a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] that controls all data manipulation done by a computer, with the canonical machine using sequential memory to store data. More specifically, it is a machine ([[automaton]]) capable of [[enumeration|enumerating]] some arbitrary subset of valid strings of an [[Alphabet (formal languages)|alphabet]]; these strings are part of a [[recursively enumerable set]]. A Turing machine has a tape of infinite length that enables read and write operations to be performed.

Assuming a [[black box]], the Turing machine cannot know whether it will eventually enumerate any one specific string of the subset with a given program. This is due to the fact that the [[halting problem]] is unsolvable, which has major implications for the theoretical limits of computing.

The Turing machine is capable of processing an [[unrestricted grammar]], which further implies that it is capable of robustly evaluating first-order logic in an infinite number of ways. This is famously demonstrated through [[lambda calculus]].

A Turing machine that is able to simulate any other Turing machine is called a [[universal Turing machine]] ('''UTM''', or simply a '''universal machine'''). A more mathematically oriented definition with a similar "universal" nature was introduced by [[Alonzo Church]], whose work on lambda calculus intertwined with Turing's in a formal theory of [[computation]] known as the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. The thesis states that Turing machines indeed capture the informal notion of [[effective method]]s in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]], and provide a precise definition of an [[algorithm]] or "mechanical procedure". Studying their  [[abstract machine|abstract properties]] yields many insights into [[computer science]] and [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]].

===Physical description===
In his 1948 essay, "Intelligent Machinery", Turing wrote that his machine consisted of:

: ...an unlimited memory capacity obtained in the form of an infinite tape marked out into squares, on each of which a symbol could be printed. At any moment there is one symbol in the machine; it is called the scanned symbol. The machine can alter the scanned symbol, and its behavior is in part determined by that symbol, but the symbols on the tape elsewhere do not affect the behavior of the machine. However, the tape can be moved back and forth through the machine, this being one of the elementary operations of the machine. Any symbol on the tape may therefore eventually have an innings.&lt;ref&gt;See the definition of "[[wikt:innings|innings]]" on [[Wiktionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Turing 1948, p. 3&lt;ref&gt;

==Informal description==
{{for|visualizations of Turing machines|Turing machine gallery}}

The Turing machine mathematically models a machine that mechanically operates on a tape.  On this tape are symbols, which the machine can read and write, one at a time, using a tape head. Operation is fully determined by a finite set of elementary instructions such as "in state 42, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1; if the symbol seen is 1, change into state 17; in state 17, if the symbol seen is 0, write a 1 and change to state 6;" etc. In the original article ("[[On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem]]", see also [[#The Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem"): Hilbert's tenth question of 1900|references below]]), Turing imagines not a mechanism, but a person whom he calls the "computer", who executes these deterministic mechanical rules slavishly (or as Turing puts it, "in a desultory manner").

[[File:Turing machine 2a.svg|thumb|right|300px|The head is always over a particular square of the tape; only a finite stretch of squares is shown. The instruction to be performed (q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown over the scanned square. (Drawing after Kleene (1952) p. 375.)]]

[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|Here, the internal state (q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is shown inside the head, and the illustration describes the tape as being infinite and pre-filled with "0", the symbol serving as blank. The system's full state (its ''complete configuration'') consists of the internal state, any non-blank symbols on the tape (in this illustration "11B"), and the position of the head relative to those symbols including blanks, i.e. "011B". (Drawing after Minsky (1967) p. 121.)]]

More precisely, a Turing machine consists of:
* A '''tape''' divided into cells, one next to the other. Each cell contains a symbol from some finite alphabet. The alphabet contains a special ''blank'' symbol (here written as '0') and one or more other symbols. The tape is assumed to be arbitrarily extendable to the left and to the right, i.e., the Turing machine is always supplied with as much tape as it needs for its computation. Cells that have not been written before are assumed to be filled with the blank symbol. In some models the tape has a left end marked with a special symbol; the tape extends or is indefinitely extensible to the right.
* A '''head''' that can read and write symbols on the tape and move the tape left and right one (and only one) cell at a time. In some models the head moves and the tape is stationary.
* A '''state register''' that stores the state of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. Among these is the special ''start state'' with which the state register is initialized. These states, writes Turing, replace the "state of mind" a person performing computations would ordinarily be in.
* A finite '''table'''&lt;ref&gt;Occasionally called an '''action table''' or '''transition function'''.&lt;/ref&gt; of instructions&lt;ref&gt;Usually quintuples [5-tuples]: q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;→q&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, but sometimes quadruples [4-tuples].&lt;/ref&gt; that, given the ''state''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) the machine is currently in ''and'' the ''symbol''(a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;) it is reading on the tape (symbol currently under the head), tells the machine to do the following ''in sequence'' (for the 5-tuple models):
# Either erase or write a symbol (replacing a&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; with a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;).
# Move the head (which is described by d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and can have values: 'L' for one step left ''or'' 'R' for one step right ''or'' 'N' for staying in the same place).
# Assume the same or a ''new state'' as prescribed (go to state q&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;).
In the 4-tuple models, erasing or writing a symbol (a&lt;sub&gt;j1&lt;/sub&gt;) and moving the head left or right (d&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) are specified as separate instructions. Specifically, the table tells the machine to (ia) erase or write a symbol ''or'' (ib) move the head left or right, ''and then'' (ii) assume the same or a new state as prescribed, but not both actions (ia) and (ib) in the same instruction. In some models, if there is no entry in the table for the current combination of symbol and state then the machine will halt; other models require all entries to be filled.

Note that every part of the machine (i.e. its state, symbol-collections, and used tape at any given time) and its actions (such as printing, erasing and tape motion) is ''finite'', ''discrete'' and ''distinguishable''; it is the unlimited amount of tape and runtime that gives it an unbounded amount of [[Computer storage|storage space]].

==Formal definition==
Following Hopcroft and Ullman (1979, p.&amp;nbsp;148), a (one-tape) Turing machine can be formally defined as a 7-[[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;M = \langle Q, \Gamma, b, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F \rangle&lt;/math&gt; where
* &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''states'';
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite, non-empty set of ''tape alphabet symbols'';
* &lt;math&gt;b \in \Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the ''blank symbol'' (the only symbol allowed to occur on the tape infinitely often at any step during the computation);
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma\subseteq\Gamma\setminus\{b\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''input symbols'', that is, the set of symbols allowed to appear in the initial tape contents;
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 \in Q&lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial state'';
* &lt;math&gt;F \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''final states'' or ''accepting states''. The initial tape contents is said to be ''accepted'' by &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; if it eventually halts in a state from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\delta: (Q \setminus F) \times \Gamma \rightarrow Q \times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial function]] called the ''[[State transition system|transition function]]'', where L is left shift, R is right shift. (A relatively uncommon variant allows "no shift", say N, as a third element of the latter set.) If &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is not defined on the current state and the current tape symbol, then the machine halts;&lt;ref&gt;p.149; in particular, Hopcroft and Ullman assume that &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; is undefined on all states from &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Anything that operates according to these specifications is a Turing machine.

The 7-tuple for the 3-state [[busy beaver]] looks like this (see more about this busy beaver at [[Turing machine examples]]):
* &lt;math&gt;Q = \{ \mbox{A}, \mbox{B}, \mbox{C}, \mbox{HALT} \}&lt;/math&gt; (states);
* &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \{ 0, 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; (tape alphabet symbols);
* &lt;math&gt;b = 0&lt;/math&gt; (blank symbol);
* &lt;math&gt;\Sigma = \{ 1 \}&lt;/math&gt; (input symbols);
* &lt;math&gt;q_0 = \mbox{A}&lt;/math&gt; (initial state);
* &lt;math&gt;F = \{ \mbox{HALT} \}&lt;/math&gt; (final states);
* &lt;math&gt;\delta = &lt;/math&gt; see state-table below (transition function).

Initially all tape cells are marked with &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Additional details required to visualize or implement Turing machines==
In the words of van Emde Boas (1990), p.&amp;nbsp;6: "The set-theoretical object [his formal seven-tuple description similar to the above] provides only partial information on how the machine will behave and what its computations will look like."

For instance,
* There will need to be many decisions on what the symbols actually look like, and a failproof way of reading and writing symbols indefinitely.
* The shift left and shift right operations may shift the tape head across the tape, but when actually building a Turing machine it is more practical to make the tape slide back and forth under the head instead.
* The tape can be finite, and automatically extended with blanks as needed (which is closest to the mathematical definition), but it is more common to think of it as stretching infinitely at one or both ends and being pre-filled with blanks except on the explicitly given finite fragment the tape head is on.  (This is, of course, not implementable in practice.)  The tape ''cannot'' be fixed in length, since that would not correspond to the given definition and would seriously limit the range of computations the machine can perform to those of a [[linear bounded automaton]].

===Alternative definitions===
Definitions in literature sometimes differ slightly, to make arguments or proofs easier or clearer, but this is always done in such a way that the resulting machine has the same computational power. For example, changing the set &lt;math&gt;\{L,R\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{L,R,N\}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' ("None" or "No-operation") would allow the machine to stay on the same tape cell instead of moving left or right, does not increase the machine's computational power.

The most common convention represents each "Turing instruction" in a "Turing table" by one of nine 5-tuples, per the convention of Turing/Davis (Turing (1936) in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;126-127 and Davis (2000) p.&amp;nbsp;152):

: (definition 1): '''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/E/N, L/R/N, q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;)'''
:: '''(''' current state '''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' symbol scanned '''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' print symbol '''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''/erase '''E'''/none '''N''' ''',''' move_tape_one_square left '''L'''/right '''R'''/none '''N''' ''',''' new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''')'''

Other authors (Minsky (1967) p.&amp;nbsp;119, Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) p.&amp;nbsp;158, Stone (1972) p.&amp;nbsp;9) adopt a different convention, with new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' listed immediately after the scanned symbol S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;:
: (definition 2): '''(q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;/E/N, L/R/N)'''
:: '''(''' current state '''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' symbol scanned '''S&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' new state '''q&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' ''',''' print symbol '''S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'''/erase '''E'''/none '''N''' ''',''' move_tape_one_square left '''L'''/right '''R'''/none '''N''' ''')'''

For the remainder of this article "definition 1" (the Turing/Davis convention) will be used.

In the following table, Turing's original model allowed only the first three lines that he called N1, N2, N3 (cf. Turing in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;126). He allowed for erasure of the "scanned square" by naming a 0th symbol S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = "erase" or "blank", etc. However, he did not allow for non-printing, so every instruction-line includes "print symbol S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;" or "erase" (cf. footnote 12 in Post (1947), ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;300). The abbreviations are Turing's (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;119). Subsequent to Turing's original paper in 1936–1937, machine-models have allowed all nine possible types of five-tuples:

Any Turing table (list of instructions) can be constructed from the above nine 5-tuples. For technical reasons, the three non-printing or "N" instructions (4, 5, 6) can usually be dispensed with. For examples see [[Turing machine examples]].

Less frequently the use of 4-tuples are encountered: these represent a further atomization of the Turing instructions (cf. Post (1947), Boolos &amp; Jeffrey (1974, 1999), Davis-Sigal-Weyuker (1994)); also see more at [[Post–Turing machine]].

===The "state"===
The word "state" used in context of Turing machines can be a source of confusion, as it can mean two things. Most commentators after Turing have used "state" to mean the name/designator of the current instruction to be performed—i.e. the contents of the state register. But Turing (1936) made a strong distinction between a record of what he called the machine's "m-configuration", and the machine's (or person's) "state of progress" through the computation - the current state of the total system. What Turing called "the state formula" includes both the current instruction and ''all'' the symbols on the tape:

{{quote|Thus the state of progress of the computation at any stage is completely determined by the note of instructions and the symbols on the tape. That is, the '''state of the system''' may be described by a single expression (sequence of symbols) consisting of the symbols on the tape followed by Δ (which we suppose not to appear elsewhere) and then by the note of instructions. This expression is called the 'state formula'.|''The Undecidable'', pp. 139–140, emphasis added}}

Earlier in his paper Turing carried this even further: he gives an example where he placed a symbol of the current "m-configuration"—the instruction's label—beneath the scanned square, together with all the symbols on the tape (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;121); this he calls "the ''complete configuration''" (''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;118). To print the "complete configuration" on one line, he places the state-label/m-configuration to the ''left'' of the scanned symbol.

A variant of this is seen in Kleene (1952) where [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]] shows how to write the [[Gödel number]] of a machine's "situation": he places the "m-configuration" symbol q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; over the scanned square in roughly the center of the 6 non-blank squares on the tape (see the Turing-tape figure in this article) and puts it to the ''right'' of the scanned square. But Kleene refers to "q&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;" itself as "the machine state" (Kleene, p.&amp;nbsp;374-375). Hopcroft and Ullman call this composite the "instantaneous description" and follow the Turing convention of putting the "current state" (instruction-label, m-configuration) to the ''left'' of the scanned symbol (p.&amp;nbsp;149).

'''Example: total state of 3-state 2-symbol busy beaver after 3 "moves"''' (taken from example "run" in the figure below):
:: 1'''A'''1
This means: after three moves the tape has ... 000110000 ... on it, the head is scanning the right-most 1, and the state is '''A'''. Blanks (in this case represented by "0"s) can be part of the total state as shown here: '''B'''01; the tape has a single 1 on it, but the head is scanning the 0 ("blank") to its left and the state is '''B'''.

"State" in the context of Turing machines should be clarified as to which is being described: (''i'') the current instruction, or (''ii'') the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction, or (''iii'') the list of symbols on the tape together with the current instruction placed to the left of the scanned symbol or to the right of the scanned symbol.

Turing's biographer Andrew Hodges (1983: 107) has noted and discussed this confusion.

[[File:State diagram 3 state busy beaver 2B.svg|thumb|500px|right|The "3-state busy beaver" Turing machine in a [[Finite State Machine|finite state representation]]. Each circle represents a "state" of the table—an "m-configuration" or "instruction". "Direction" of a state ''transition'' is shown by an arrow. The label (e.g. '''0/P,R''') near the outgoing state (at the "tail" of the arrow) specifies the scanned symbol that causes a particular transition (e.g. '''0''') followed by a slash '''/''', followed by the subsequent "behaviors" of the machine, e.g. "'''P''' '''P'''rint" then move tape "'''R''' '''R'''ight". No general accepted format exists. The convention shown is after McClusky (1965), Booth (1967), Hill, and Peterson (1974).]]

To the right: the above table as expressed as a "state transition" diagram.

Usually large tables are better left as tables (Booth, p.&amp;nbsp;74). They are more readily simulated by computer in tabular form (Booth, p.&amp;nbsp;74). However, certain concepts—e.g. machines with "reset" states and machines with repeating patterns (cf. Hill and Peterson p.&amp;nbsp;244ff)—can be more readily seen when viewed as a drawing.

Whether a drawing represents an improvement on its table must be decided by the reader for the particular context. See [[Finite state machine]] for more.

[[File:Moves of a 3-state Busy Beaver.jpg|thumbnail|500px|right|The evolution of the busy-beaver's computation starts at the top and proceeds to the bottom.]]

The reader should again be cautioned that such diagrams represent a snapshot of their table frozen in time, ''not'' the course ("trajectory") of a computation ''through'' time and space. While every time the busy beaver machine "runs" it will always follow the same state-trajectory, this is not true for the "copy" machine that can be provided with variable input "parameters".

The diagram "Progress of the computation" shows the three-state busy beaver's "state" (instruction) progress through its computation from start to finish. On the far right is the Turing "complete configuration" (Kleene "situation"&lt;!-- Stuation? Not Situation? Is that the right word? Yes, it is, cf. page 375 for example "The Godel number of the stiuation..." and then he shows a tape, etc. This usage runs throughout the chapter. wvbailey~~~~ --&gt;&lt;!--So is it "stuation" or "stiuation"?--&gt;, Hopcroft–Ullman "instantaneous description") at each step. If the machine were to be stopped and cleared to blank both the "state register" and entire tape, these "configurations" could be used to rekindle a computation anywhere in its progress (cf. Turing (1936) ''The Undecidable'', pp.&amp;nbsp;139–140).

==Models equivalent to the Turing machine model==
{{See also|Turing machine equivalents|Register machine|Post–Turing machine}}

Many machines that might be thought to have more computational capability than a simple universal Turing machine can be shown to have no more power (Hopcroft and Ullman p.&amp;nbsp;159, cf. Minsky (1967)). They might compute faster, perhaps, or use less memory, or their instruction set might be smaller, but they cannot compute more powerfully (i.e. more mathematical functions). (Recall that the [[Church–Turing thesis]] ''hypothesizes'' this to be true for any kind of machine: that anything that can be "computed" can be computed by some Turing machine.)

A Turing machine is equivalent to a single-stack [[pushdown automaton]] (PDA) that has been made more flexible and concise by relaxing the [[LIFO (computing)|last-in-first-out]] requirement of its stack. In addition, a Turing machine is also equivalent to a two-stack PDA with standard [[LIFO (computing)|last-in-first-out]] semantics, by using one stack to model the right side and the other stack to model the left side of the Turing machine.

At the other extreme, some very simple models turn out to be [[Turing completeness|Turing-equivalent]], i.e. to have the same computational power as the Turing machine model.

Common equivalent models are the [[multi-tape Turing machine]], [[multi-track Turing machine]], machines with input and output, and the [[Non-deterministic Turing machine|''non-deterministic'' Turing machine]] (NDTM) as opposed to the ''deterministic'' Turing machine (DTM) for which the action table has at most one entry for each combination of symbol and state.

[[Read-only right moving Turing machines|Read-only, right-moving Turing machines]] are equivalent to [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|NDFAs]] (as well as [[Deterministic finite automaton|DFAs]] by conversion using the [[NDFA to DFA conversion algorithm]]).

For practical and didactical intentions the equivalent [[register machine]] can be used as a usual [[Assembly language|assembly]] [[programming language]].

An interesting question is whether the computation model represented by concrete [[programming languages]] is Turing equivalent. While the computation of a real computer is based on finite states and thus not capable to simulate a Turing machine, programming languages themselves do not necessarily have this limitation. Kirner et al., 2009 have shown that among the general-purpose programming languages some are Turing complete while others are not. For example, [[ANSI C]] is not Turing-equivalent, as all instantiations of ANSI C (different instantiations are possible as the standard deliberately leaves certain behaviour undefined for legacy reasons) imply a finite-space memory. This is because the size of memory reference data types is accessible inside the language. However, other programming languages like [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] do not have this feature, which allows them to be Turing complete in principle. 
It is just Turing complete in principle, as [[memory allocation]] in a programming language is allowed to fail, which means the programming language can be Turing complete when ignoring failed memory allocations, but the compiled programs executable on a real computer cannot.

==Choice c-machines, oracle o-machines==
Early in his paper (1936) Turing makes a distinction between an "automatic machine"—its "motion ... completely determined by the configuration" and a "choice machine":

{{quote|...whose motion is only partially determined by the configuration ... When such a machine reaches one of these ambiguous configurations, it cannot go on until some arbitrary choice has been made by an external operator. This would be the case if we were using machines to deal with axiomatic systems.|''The Undecidable'', p. 118}}

Turing (1936) does not elaborate further except in a footnote in which he describes how to use an a-machine to "find all the provable formulae of the [Hilbert] calculus" rather than use a choice machine. He "suppose[s] that the choices are always between two possibilities 0 and 1. Each proof will then be determined by a sequence of choices i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1, i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1, ..., i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 or 1), and hence the number 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; + i&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; + i&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... +i&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; completely determines the proof. The automatic machine carries out successively proof 1, proof 2, proof 3, ..." (Footnote ‡, ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;138)

This is indeed the technique by which a deterministic (i.e. a-) Turing machine can be used to mimic the action of a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]]; Turing solved the matter in a footnote and appears to dismiss it from further consideration.

An [[oracle machine]] or o-machine is a Turing a-machine that pauses its computation at state "'''o'''" while, to complete its calculation, it "awaits the decision" of "the oracle"—an unspecified entity "apart from saying that it cannot be a machine" (Turing (1939), ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;166–168).

==Universal Turing machines==
{{Main|Universal Turing machine}}

[[File:Model of a Turing machine.jpg|thumb|An implementation of a Turing machine]]
As Turing wrote in ''The Undecidable'', p.&amp;nbsp;128 (italics added):
{{quote|It is possible to invent a ''single machine'' which can be used to compute ''any'' computable sequence. If this machine '''U''' is supplied with the tape on the beginning of which is written the string of quintuples separated by semicolons of some computing machine '''M''', then '''U''' will compute the same sequence as '''M'''.}}

This finding is now taken for granted, but at the time (1936) it was considered astonishing. The model of computation that Turing called his "universal machine"—"'''U'''" for short—is considered by some (cf. Davis (2000)) to have been the fundamental theoretical breakthrough that led to the notion of the [[stored-program computer]].

{{quote|Turing's paper ... contains, in essence, the invention of the modern computer and some of the programming techniques that accompanied it.|Minsky (1967), p. 104}}

In terms of [[Computational complexity theory|computational complexity]], a multi-tape universal Turing machine need only be slower by [[logarithm]]ic factor compared to the machines it simulates. This result was obtained in 1966 by F. C. Hennie and [[R. E. Stearns]]. (Arora and Barak, 2009, theorem 1.9)

==Comparison with real machines==
[[File:Lego Turing Machine.jpg|thumb|A Turing machine realisation in [[Lego]]]]
It is often said{{By whom|date=February 2016}} that Turing machines, unlike simpler automata, are as powerful as real machines, and are able to execute any operation that a real program can. What is neglected in this statement is that, because a real machine can only have a finite number of ''configurations'', this "real machine" is really nothing but a [[linear bounded automaton]]. On the other hand, Turing machines are equivalent to machines that have an unlimited amount of storage space for their computations. However, Turing machines are not intended to model computers, but rather they are intended to model computation itself. Historically, computers, which compute only on their (fixed) internal storage, were developed only later.

There are a number of ways to explain why Turing machines are useful models of real computers:

# Anything a real computer can compute, a Turing machine can also compute. For example: "A Turing machine can simulate any type of subroutine found in programming languages, including recursive procedures and any of the known parameter-passing mechanisms" (Hopcroft and Ullman p.&amp;nbsp;157). A large enough FSA can also model any real computer, disregarding IO. Thus, a statement about the limitations of Turing machines will also apply to real computers.
# The difference lies only with the ability of a Turing machine to manipulate an unbounded amount of data. However, given a finite amount of time, a Turing machine (like a real machine) can only manipulate a finite amount of data.
# Like a Turing machine, a real machine can have its storage space enlarged as needed, by acquiring more disks or other storage media.
# Descriptions of real machine programs using simpler abstract models are often much more complex than descriptions using Turing machines. For example, a Turing machine describing an algorithm may have a few hundred states, while the equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) on a given real machine has quadrillions. This makes the DFA representation infeasible to analyze.
# Turing machines describe algorithms independent of how much memory they use. There is a limit to the memory possessed by any current machine, but this limit can rise arbitrarily in time. Turing machines allow us to make statements about algorithms which will (theoretically) hold forever, regardless of advances in ''conventional'' computing machine architecture.
# Turing machines simplify the statement of algorithms. Algorithms running on Turing-equivalent abstract machines are usually more general than their counterparts running on real machines, because they have arbitrary-precision data types available and never have to deal with unexpected conditions (including, but not limited to, running [[out of memory]]).

===Limitations of Turing machines===

====Computational complexity theory====
{{further|Computational complexity theory}}

A limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model the strengths of a particular arrangement well. For instance, modern stored-program computers are actually instances of a more specific form of [[abstract machine]] known as the [[random-access stored-program machine]] or RASP machine model. Like the [[universal Turing machine]] the RASP stores its "program" in "memory" external to its finite-state machine's "instructions". Unlike the universal Turing machine, the RASP has an infinite number of distinguishable, numbered but unbounded "registers"—memory "cells" that can contain any integer (cf. Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), and in particular Cook-Rechow (1973); references at [[random access machine]]). The RASP's finite-state machine is equipped with the capability for indirect addressing (e.g. the contents of one register can be used as an address to specify another register); thus the RASP's "program" can address any register in the register-sequence. The upshot of this distinction is that there are computational optimizations that can be performed based on the memory indices, which are not possible in a general Turing machine; thus when Turing machines are used as the basis for bounding running times, a 'false lower bound' can be proven on certain algorithms' running times (due to the false simplifying assumption of a Turing machine). An example of this is [[binary search]], an algorithm that can be shown to perform more quickly when using the RASP model of computation rather than the Turing machine model.

====Concurrency====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2015}}
Another limitation of Turing machines is that they do not model concurrency well. For example, there is a bound on the size of integer that can be computed by an always-halting nondeterministic Turing machine starting on a blank tape. (See article on [[unbounded nondeterminism]].) By contrast, there are always-halting concurrent systems with no inputs that can compute an integer of unbounded size. (A process can be created with local storage that is initialized with a count of 0 that concurrently sends itself both a stop and a go message. When it receives a go message, it increments its count by 1 and sends itself a go message. When it receives a stop message, it stops with an unbounded number in its local storage.)

====Interaction====
In the early days of computing, computer use was typically limited to [[batch processing]], i.e., non-interactive tasks, each producing output data from given input data. Computability theory, which studies computability of functions from inputs to outputs, and for which Turing machines were invented, reflects this practice.

Since the 1970s, [[interactivity|interactive]] use of computers became much more common.  In principle, it is possible to model this by having an external agent read from the tape and write to it at the same time as a Turing machine, but this rarely matches how interaction actually happens; therefore, when describing interactivity, alternatives such as [[Input/output automaton|I/O automata]] are usually preferred.

==History==
{{See also|Algorithm|Church–Turing thesis}}

They were described in 1936 by [[Alan Turing]].

===Historical background: computational machinery===
[[Robin Gandy]] (1919–1995)—a student of [[Alan Turing]] (1912–1954) and his lifelong friend—traces the lineage of the notion of "calculating machine" back to [[Charles Babbage]] (circa 1834) and actually proposes "Babbage's Thesis":

{{quote|''That the whole of development and operations of analysis are now capable of being executed by machinery''.|(italics in Babbage as cited by Gandy, p. 54)}}

Gandy's analysis of Babbage's [[Analytical Engine]] describes the following five operations (cf. p.&amp;nbsp;52–53):
# The arithmetic functions +, −, ×, where − indicates "proper" subtraction {{nowrap|''x'' − ''y'' {{=}} 0}} if {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ ''x''}}.
# Any sequence of operations is an operation.
# Iteration of an operation (repeating n times an operation P).
# Conditional iteration (repeating n times an operation P conditional on the "success" of test T).
# Conditional transfer (i.e. conditional "[[goto]]").

Gandy states that "the functions which can be calculated by (1), (2), and (4) are precisely those which are [[Turing computable]]." (p.&amp;nbsp;53). He cites other proposals for "universal calculating machines" including those of [[Percy Ludgate]] (1909), [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]] (1914), [[Maurice d'Ocagne]] (1922), [[Louis Couffignal]] (1933), [[Vannevar Bush]] (1936), [[Howard Aiken]] (1937). However:

{{quote|… the emphasis is on programming a fixed iterable sequence of arithmetical operations. The fundamental importance of conditional iteration and conditional transfer for a general theory of calculating machines is not recognized…|Gandy p. 55}}

===The Entscheidungsproblem (the "decision problem"): Hilbert's tenth question of 1900===
With regard to [[Hilbert's problems]] posed by the famous mathematician [[David Hilbert]] in 1900, an aspect of problem #10 had been floating about for almost 30 years before it was framed precisely. Hilbert's original expression for #10 is as follows:

{{quote|'''10. Determination of the solvability of a Diophantine equation'''. Given a [[Diophantine equation]] with any number of unknown quantities and with rational integral coefficients: To devise a process according to which it can be determined in a finite number of operations whether the equation is solvable in rational integers.

The Entscheidungsproblem [decision problem for [[first-order logic]]] is solved when we know a procedure that allows for any given logical expression to decide by finitely many operations its validity or satisfiability ... The Entscheidungsproblem must be considered the main problem of mathematical logic.|quoted, with this translation and the original German, in Dershowitz and Gurevich, 2008}}

By 1922, this notion of "[[Entscheidungsproblem]]" had developed a bit, and [[Heinrich Behmann|H. Behmann]] stated that

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;most general form of the Entscheidungsproblem [is] as follows:
:A quite definite generally applicable prescription is required which will allow one to decide in a finite number of steps the truth or falsity of a given purely logical assertion ...|Gandy p. 57, quoting Behmann}}
{{quote|Behmann remarks that ... the general problem is equivalent to the problem of deciding which mathematical propositions are true.|''ibid.''}}
{{quote|If one were able to solve the Entscheidungsproblem then one would have a "procedure for solving many (or even all) mathematical problems".|''ibid.'', p. 92}}

By the 1928 international congress of mathematicians, Hilbert "made his questions quite precise. First, was mathematics ''[[Completeness (logic)|complete]]'' ... Second, was mathematics ''[[Consistency proof|consistent]]'' ... And thirdly, was mathematics ''[[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]''?" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;91, Hawking p.&amp;nbsp;1121). The first two questions were answered in 1930 by [[Kurt Gödel]] at the very same meeting where Hilbert delivered his retirement speech (much to the chagrin of Hilbert); the third—the Entscheidungsproblem—had to wait until the mid-1930s.

The problem was that an answer first required a precise definition of "''definite general applicable prescription''", which Princeton professor [[Alonzo Church]] would come to call "[[effective calculability]]", and in 1928 no such definition existed. But over the next 6–7 years [[Emil Post]] developed his definition of a worker moving from room to room writing and erasing marks per a list of instructions (Post 1936), as did Church and his two students [[Stephen Kleene]] and [[J. B. Rosser]] by use of Church's [[lambda-calculus]] and Gödel's [[recursion theory]] (1934). Church's paper (published 15 April 1936) showed that the Entscheidungsproblem was indeed "undecidable" and beat Turing to the punch by almost a year (Turing's paper submitted 28 May 1936, published January 1937). In the meantime, Emil Post submitted a brief paper in the fall of 1936, so Turing at least had priority over Post. While Church refereed Turing's paper, Turing had time to study Church's paper and add an Appendix where he sketched a proof that Church's lambda-calculus and his machines would compute the same functions.

{{quote|But what Church had done was something rather different, and in a certain sense weaker. ... the Turing construction was more direct, and provided an argument from first principles, closing the gap in Church's demonstration.|Hodges p. 112}}

And Post had only proposed a definition of [[Church–Turing thesis|calculability]] and criticized Church's "definition", but had proved nothing.

===Alan Turing's a-machine===
In the spring of 1935, Turing as a young Master's student at [[King's College Cambridge]], [[UK]], took on the challenge; he had been stimulated by the lectures of the logician [[M. H. A. Newman]] "and learned from them of Gödel's work and the Entscheidungsproblem ... Newman used the word 'mechanical' ... In his obituary of Turing 1955 Newman writes:

{{quote|To the question 'what is a "mechanical" process?' Turing returned the characteristic answer 'Something that can be done by a machine' and he embarked on the highly congenial task of analysing the general notion of a computing machine.|Gandy, p. 74}}

Gandy states that:

{{quote|I suppose, but do not know, that Turing, right from the start of his work, had as his goal a proof of the undecidability of the Entscheidungsproblem. He told me that the 'main idea' of the paper came to him when he was lying in Grantchester meadows in the summer of 1935. The 'main idea' might have either been his analysis of computation or his realization that there was a universal machine, and so a [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]] to prove unsolvability.|''ibid.'', p. 76}}

While Gandy believed that Newman's statement above is "misleading", this opinion is not shared by all. Turing had a lifelong interest in machines: "Alan had dreamt of inventing typewriters as a boy; [his mother] Mrs. Turing had a typewriter; and he could well have begun by asking himself what was meant by calling a typewriter 'mechanical'" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;96). While at Princeton pursuing his PhD, Turing built a Boolean-logic multiplier (see below). His PhD thesis, titled "Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals", contains the following definition of "a computable function":

{{quote|It was stated above that 'a function is effectively calculable if its values can be found by some purely mechanical process'. We may take this statement literally, understanding by a purely mechanical process one which could be carried out by a machine. It is possible to give a mathematical description, in a certain normal form, of the structures of these machines. The development of these ideas leads to the author's definition of a computable function, and to an identification of computability with effective calculability. It is not difficult, though somewhat laborious, to prove that these three definitions [the 3rd is the λ-calculus] are equivalent.|Turing (1939) in ''The Undecidable'', p. 160}}

When Turing returned to the UK he ultimately became jointly responsible for breaking the German secret codes created by encryption machines called "The Enigma"; he also became involved in the design of the ACE ([[Automatic Computing Engine]]), "[Turing's] ACE proposal was effectively self-contained, and its roots lay not in the [[EDVAC]] [the USA's initiative], but in his own universal machine" (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;318). Arguments still continue concerning the origin and nature of what has been named by Kleene (1952) [[Turing's Thesis]]. But what Turing ''did prove'' with his computational-machine model appears in his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" (1937):

{{quote|[that] the Hilbert Entscheidungsproblem can have no solution ... I propose, therefore to show that there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula U of the functional calculus K is provable, i.e. that there can be no machine which, supplied with any one U of these formulae, will eventually say whether U is provable.|from Turing's paper as reprinted in ''The Undecidable'', p. 145}}

Turing's example (his second proof): If one is to ask for a general procedure to tell us: "Does this machine ever print 0", the question is "undecidable".

===1937–1970: The "digital computer", the birth of "computer science"===
In 1937, while at Princeton working on his PhD thesis, Turing built a digital (Boolean-logic) multiplier from scratch, making his own electromechanical relays (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;138). "Alan's task was to embody the logical design of a Turing machine in a network of relay-operated switches ..." (Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;138). While Turing might have been just initially curious and experimenting, quite-earnest work in the same direction was going in Germany ([[Konrad Zuse]] (1938)), and in the United States ([[Howard Aiken]]) and [[George Stibitz]] (1937); the fruits of their labors were used by both the Axis and Allied militaries in [[World War II]] (cf. Hodges p.&amp;nbsp;298–299). In the early to mid-1950s [[Hao Wang (academic)|Hao Wang]] and [[Marvin Minsky]] reduced the Turing machine to a simpler form (a precursor to the [[Post–Turing machine]] of [[Martin Davis]]); simultaneously European researchers were reducing the new-fangled [[electronic computer]] to a computer-like theoretical object equivalent to what was now being called a "Turing machine". In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the coincidentally parallel developments of Melzak and Lambek (1961), Minsky (1961), and Shepherdson and Sturgis (1961) carried the European work further and reduced the Turing machine to a more friendly, computer-like abstract model called the [[counter machine]]; Elgot and Robinson (1964), Hartmanis (1971), Cook and Reckhow (1973) carried this work even further with the [[register machine]] and [[random-access machine]] models—but basically all are just multi-tape Turing machines with an arithmetic-like instruction set.

===1970–present: the Turing machine as a model of computation===
Today, the counter, register and random-access machines and their sire the Turing machine continue to be the models of choice for theorists investigating questions in the [[theory of computation]]. In particular, [[computational complexity theory]] makes use of the Turing machine:

{{quote|Depending on the objects one likes to manipulate in the computations (numbers like nonnegative integers or alphanumeric strings), two models have obtained a dominant position in machine-based complexity theory:
:''the off-line multitape Turing machine''..., which represents the standard model for string-oriented computation, and
:the ''random access machine (RAM)'' as introduced by Cook and Reckhow ..., which models the idealized Von Neumann style computer.|van Emde Boas 1990:4}}
{{quote|Only in the related area of analysis of algorithms this role is taken over by the RAM model.|van Emde Boas 1990:16}}

A '''typed [[lambda calculus]]''' is a typed [[formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] that uses the lambda-symbol (&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;) to denote anonymous function abstraction. In this context, types are usually objects of a syntactic nature that are assigned to lambda terms; the exact nature of a type depends on the calculus considered (see kinds below). From a certain point of view, typed lambda calculi can be seen as refinements of the [[untyped lambda calculus]] but from another point of view, they can also be considered the more fundamental theory and ''untyped lambda calculus'' a special case with only one type.

Typed lambda calculi are foundational [[programming languages]] and are the base of typed [[functional programming languages]] such as [[ML programming language|ML]] and [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and, more indirectly, typed [[imperative programming|imperative programming languages]]. Typed lambda calculi play an important role in the design of [[type systems]] for programming languages; here typability usually captures desirable properties of the program, e.g. the program will not cause a memory access violation.

Typed lambda calculi are closely related to [[mathematical logic]] and [[proof theory]] via the [[Curry&amp;ndash;Howard isomorphism]] and they can be considered as the [[internal language]] of classes of [[category theory|categories]], e.g. the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] is the language of [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed categories]] (CCCs).

== Kinds of typed lambda calculi ==
Various typed lambda calculi have been studied. The [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has only one [[type constructor]], the arrow &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;, and its only types are [[basic type]]s and [[function type]]s &lt;math&gt;\sigma\to\tau&lt;/math&gt;. [[Dialectica interpretation|System T]] extends the simply typed lambda calculus with a type of natural numbers and higher order primitive recursion; in this system all functions provably recursive in [[Peano arithmetic]] are definable. [[System F]] allows polymorphism by using universal quantification over all types; from a logical perspective it can describe all functions that are provably total in [[second-order logic]]. Lambda calculi with [[dependent types]] are the base of [[intuitionistic type theory]], the [[calculus of constructions]] and the [[LF (logical framework)|logical framework]] (LF), a pure lambda calculus with dependent types. Based on work by Berardi on [[pure type system]]s, [[Henk Barendregt]] proposed the [[Lambda cube]] to systematize the relations of pure typed lambda calculi (including simply typed lambda calculus, System F, LF and the calculus of constructions).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Some typed lambda calculi introduce a notion of ''[[subtype|subtyping]]'', i.e. if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a subtype of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, then all terms of type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; also have type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Typed lambda calculi with subtyping are the simply typed lambda calculus with conjunctive types and [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]].

All the systems mentioned so far, with the exception of the untyped lambda calculus, are ''[[strongly normalizing]]'': all computations terminate. As a consequence they are consistent as a logic, i.e. there are uninhabited types. There exist, however, typed lambda calculi that are not strongly normalizing. For example the dependently typed lambda calculus with a type of all types (Type : Type) is not normalizing due to [[Girard's paradox]]. This system is also the simplest pure type system, a formalism which generalizes the Lambda cube. Systems with explicit recursion combinators, such as [[Gordon Plotkin|Plotkin's]] PCF, are not normalizing, but they are not intended to be interpreted as a logic. Indeed, [[Programming language for Computable Functions|PCF]] (for Programming language for Computable Functions) is a prototypical, typed functional programming language, where types are used to ensure that programs are well-behaved but not necessarily terminating.

== Applications to programming languages ==
In [[computer programming]], the routines (functions, procedures, methods) of [[strongly typed programming language]]s closely correspond to typed lambda expressions.

The '''University for Peace''' ('''UPEACE''') is an [[intergovernmental organization]] with university status, established by [[treaty]] in 1980 and having its main campus in [[Costa Rica]]. Its stated mission is "to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]." The current Rector of UPEACE is Dr. Francisco Rojas Aravena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
[[File:UPEACE-campus.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Costa Rica campus]]

The creation of the University for Peace was set in motion by a treaty and endorsed by resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. By this Resolution, the UN General Assembly established an international commission which, in collaboration with the Government of Costa Rica, was requested to prepare the organization, structure and setting in motion of the University for Peace. Thereafter, by [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf Resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution on Establishment of UPEACE|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/resolution.pdf|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UN General Assembly endorsed the treaty establishing  the University for Peace by adopting the [http://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%201223/volume-1223-I-19735-English.pdf International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace] (UPEACE) along with the [http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf Charter of the University for Peace].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charter of the University for Peace annexed to the International Agreement Establishing the University for Peace|url=http://www.upeace.org/pdf/charter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University has the unique status of not only being a dedicated institution for higher education in Peace and Conflict studies, but also an international treaty body organization mandated by the United Nations General Assembly.

It offers [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm master's degree and doctoral programmes] at its main headquarters in [[San José, Costa Rica]], and carries out various activities related to the international peace and security objectives of the [[United Nations]] (UN) through centres and offices located in Addis Ababa, Geneva, New York, The Hague, and South Korea, and through partnership arrangements with numerous other institutions worldwide.

=== Relationship with United Nations ===

The University for Peace is part of the academic wing of the UN system, and has observer status at the UN General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See 'Other Resources' at http://www.un.org/en/peace/ |url=https://www.un.org/en/peace/|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; while maintaining its [[academic freedom|independence in academic]], financial and management matters. The [[UN Secretary-General]] is the Honorary President of UPEACE. The UN General Assembly maintains a constant interest in the activities of UPEACE, and in periodic resolutions calls on the UN Secretary-General to report to it on its activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/64/83|url=http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N09/466/81/PDF/N0946681.pdf?OpenElement|publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the UN Secretary-General reports to the General Assembly of the UN periodically on the progress of UPEACE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the UN Secretary General on the University for Peace, A/64/281, dated 11 August 2009.|url=http://www.upeace.org/PDF/SG's%20Report%20-%202009%20(English).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Council of the University for Peace is the supreme authority of the University. It is composed of five ''ex-officio'' members viz. the Rector, two representatives designated by the UN Secretary-General and by the Director-General of the [[UNESCO]], the Rector of the United Nations University, two representatives designated by the Government of the host country and the Chancellor of UPEACE. In addition, the Council comprises ten representatives of the academic community or other persons eminent in the field of peace and security appointed by the Secretary-General of the UN in consultation with the Director-General of the UNESCO.

=== Accreditation ===

The University has "unique world-wide authorization to award academic degrees, recognized by all countries which are members of the General Assembly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, its MA programs in the Department of Environment, Peace and Development, received official accreditation from SINAES (the national Costa Rican accreditation body) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about-upeace/accreditation/update-on-upeace-accreditation-process|title=University for Peace|website=www.upeace.org|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the MA programme in International Law and Human Rights, and the MA programme in International Law and the Settlement of Disputes received accreditation from SINAES in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.upeace.org/news/two-programmes-from-the-international-law-department-receive-official-quality-accreditation._2016-09-09|title=Two programmes from the International Law Department receive Official Quality Accreditation.|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the fact that UPEACE offers unique MA programs that cannot be found anywhere else in the world means that it is the best and only choice for those who want to study the specific fields of Peace Education; Gender and Peacebuilding; Media, Peace and Conflict Studies; Responsible Management and Sustainable Development; etc.

== Headquarters and main campus ==

The University for Peace has its headquarters in Costa Rica, a country distinguished by a long tradition of democracy. Costa Rica abolished its army in 1948, the former President, H.E. [[Oscar Arias Sánchez]] was awarded The [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1987 and the country continues to develop strong efforts for natural conservation - not to mention the friendly locals. The main campus of the University - the [[Rodrigo Carazo Odio|Rodrigo Carazo]] Campus - is located 30&amp;nbsp;km Southwest of San Jose, within a natural reserve composed of a secondary forest and the last remnant of primary forest (200 ha) in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. Hence, this protected area is very rich in fauna. It shelters mammals such as monkeys and deer; reptiles; and over 300 species of birds, as well as approximately 100 varieties of trees. The University's installations and protected area make up 303 ha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upeace.org/about/campus/|title=About UPEACE|website=University for Peace|accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The closest town to the mountain on which the University is perched, is [[Ciudad Colon]]. Most of the students, staff and faculty members of the University reside in Ciudad Colon, making it one of the most multi-cultural places in the world for its size.

The Rodrigo Carazo campus of the University for Peace is the principal location for the activities of the University. Most of its [http://www.upeace.org/academic/index.cfm Masters programmes] and its recently announced [http://www.upeace.org/academic/doctorate/ Doctoral programme] are administered from this campus. Students coming from several countries study in a highly [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]] environment on the campus. The University boasts of a highly accomplished [http://www.upeace.org/faculty/index.cfm faculty], that comprises a mix of both resident and visiting faculty members. Because of the structure of the programmes and its unique global status, the University has an [http://www.upeace.org/calendar/index.cfm academic calendar] that enables bringing on board the most highly acclaimed academicians and practitioners from around the world. The University has also started administering [http://www.upeace.org/academic/distance/ distance education courses], including an online Masters Programme from the main campus.

The University also carries out hands-on training beyond its Masters and Doctoral Programmes aimed at practitioners and policy makers rather than graduate students. The University has established two Centres for this purpose that are located on the main campus. The [http://www.centre.upeace.org/ UPEACE Centre for Executive Education] delivers dynamic training courses to leaders from around the world. The Centre reaches out to nonprofit leaders, business executives, educators at all levels, UN staff, students and other professional audiences. According to the Centre's website, the approach to all its courses is innovative, interactive, and participant-centered, using case-studies and field trips when appropriate. The Centre aims to develop key leadership skills by incorporating the crosscutting themes of Intercultural Communication, Negotiation and Conflict Resolution and Teambuilding.

The University has also established the [http://www.hrc.upeace.org/ UPEACE Human Rights Centre] which was created within the contours of the broader mission of the University to provide humanity with an international institution of higher education for peace and with the aim of promoting among all human beings the spirit of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence, to stimulate cooperation among peoples and to help lessen obstacles and threats to world peace and progress, in keeping with the noble aspirations proclaimed in the [[Charter of the United Nations]]. In particular, the work of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre seeks to promote understanding, respect and enjoyment of [[universal human rights]]. The Centre carries out this objective through human rights education, training, research, capacity building and awareness raising activities. The website of the UPEACE Human Rights Centre states that the Centre takes a practice based approach to the respect, protection and fulfillment of human rights and promotes the integration of theory and practice. The Centre also takes a multi-disciplinary approach to human rights and attaches equal importance to all human rights. Over the last few years, the UPEACE Human Rights Centre has conducted several training courses for policy makers, staff members of the UN and other inter-governmental organizations, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics and civil servants.

The Headquarters and main campus of UPEACE also hosts the International Secretariat of the [[Earth Charter Initiative]], whose stated mission is "to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, ecological integrity, [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] human rights, [[respect for diversity]], [[economic justice]], [[democracy]], and a culture of peace." This mission is carried out using '[[The Earth Charter]]' as the principal guiding framework. The Earth Charter is an international declaration of fundamental values and principles considered useful by its supporters for building a just, [[sustainability|sustainable]], and peaceful global society in the 21st century. In 2012, the Earth Charter Initiative and UPEACE were jointly awarded the UNESCO Chair on Education for Sustainable Development and the Earth Charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Chair on ESD and Earth Charter, awarded jointly to EC Initiative and UPEACE|url=http://www.earthcharterinaction.org/content/categories/Education/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work related to this UNESCO Chair will be carried out at the newly constructed 'Earth Charter Center for Education for Sustainable Development' at the UPEACE main campus.

In addition to the activities at the Costa Rica Headquarters Campus, UPEACE works with an increasing number of partners in various parts of the world to ensure that the UPEACE mission is extended to reach as many individuals and institutions as possible.

== Around the world ==

'''Africa'''

As a result of extensive international consultations, which have underlined the importance of according a high priority to activities in Africa, the University for Peace (UPEACE) officially launched its Africa Programme in January 2002.

The University for Peace (UPEACE) established its [https://web.archive.org/web/20060629044240/http://www.africa.upeace.org/ Africa Programme] in 2002 on the basis of extensive consultations in the continent which aimed at developing a programme that responded to the true needs, aspirations and obstacles for education for building peace in Africa. From its inception, the programme focused on the necessity to stimulate and strengthen the capacity in Africa to teach, train and conduct research in areas of peace and conflict studies.

The first five years of the programme focused on the development of curricula and teaching materials and the delivery of a range of short courses, workshops, conferences and seminars in various parts of Africa. Within this period, the programme attracted close to one thousand participants from Academia, Policy makers and civil society organisations.

In a second five-year plan, which came out of a consultative meeting held in March 2007 with partners, the programme will additionally, work with a number of Partner Universities to develop full-fledged master's degree programmes to be based at African Universities. The principal aim of this endeavour is to further strengthen the African capacity and build a wide expertise for a better understanding of conflicts in Africa, their prevention and the creation of the environment favourable to lasting peace and development in the region.

'''Europe'''

In January 2012, UPEACE created a new Centre at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] ([http://www.upeace.nl/ UPEACE The Hague]), which is housed at the Academy Building of the [[Peace Palace]], next to The [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. UPEACE The Hague will focus on education and research at the forefront of peace studies, closely cooperating with academic and policy-oriented institutions in The Hague region. UPEACE The Hague will initially advance three fields where it can be innovative and complementary: Peace &amp; Conflict Studies, Water &amp; Peace, and Urban Peace &amp; Security. In addition, UPEACE The Hague will strengthen peace education in The Hague region by organising professional trainings, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Educational and research programmes will be characterised by the interaction between theory and practice, also contributing to policy innovations, and will therefore be appealing to both academics and professionals.

The Geneva Office of UPEACE, established in 2001, has continued to support the development of the overall activities of the University, in particular its regional programmes in Africa and Central Asia. The key focus of work undertaken by the Geneva office is contributing to the development of programme activities of the University in Africa and the Middle East, engaging with the academic community in Geneva to establish joint teaching and training courses on issues of particular relevance to the expertise available within the international community in Geneva and facilitation of relations within Europe and with the United Nations system, national delegations, donor community and academic institutions.

'''Asia-Pacific'''

In 2010, the [http://upeaceap.org UPEACE Asia Pacific Centre] (UPAPC) was established in Seoul, The Republic of Korea. The Centre carries out important activities as a think tank for development studies and provides post-graduate training programmes(Masters) in The Republic of  Korea. The Republic of Korea acceded to the International Agreement for the establishment of the University for Peace and Charter of the University for Peace on June 11, 2010.

'''Asia'''

The [http://www.upeace.org/academic/spec_masters/alp.cfm Asia Leaders Programme], a Dual Campus Master Programme, is a shared initiative between the [[Nippon Foundation]] and the University for Peace, in collaboration with [[Ateneo de Manila University]], which aims to provide students from Japan and other Asian countries with an opportunity to pursue a peace studies post graduate degree with a content-based language-training module. This offers the support for individuals who do not have a proficient command of English to work in this increasingly common international language and to become comfortable in their professional abilities as they gain academic skills. As part of the programme, students have also the opportunity to apply their academic and practical knowledge through a four-month internship at the end of the Master courses.

'''Affiliated institutions'''

Article 4 of the Charter of the University for Peace reads: "the University may enter into association or conclude agreements with Governments and intergovernmental and other organizations and institutions in the field of education." The University for Peace signed agreements with the governments of Serbia (formerly Yugoslavia), Colombia and Uruguay to open centres in those three countries. These centres have the necessary legal status to enjoy autonomy and academic freedom, while keeping its humanistic purpose within the framework of both the Charter of the University for Peace and the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

The European Centre for Peace and Development (ECPD) in Belgrade, Serbia; the World Centre for Training and Research in Conflict Resolution (WCCR) in Bogotá, Colombia; and the World Centre for Research for Peace (CMIP) in Montevideo, Uruguay, have developed close links with their respective governments while being key UPEACE partners in areas of common interest. UPEACE keeps operational agreements with them and lends its logos when necessary in order to undertake joint activities within the framework of UPEACE's and the Centres’ mission. These activities, as with other partners, involve the cooperating parties working together at all stages of jointly agreed-upon projects.

The principal designer of Village Homes was architect Mike Corbett who began planning in the 1960s, with construction continuing from south to north from the 1970s through the 1980s. Village Homes was completed in 1982, and has attracted international attention from its inception as an early model of an environmentally friendly housing development, including a visit from then-French President [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org About Village Homes]; {{cite web |url=http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609124520/http://arch.ced.berkeley.edu/vitalsigns/workup/siegel_house/vh_bkgd.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df= }}; Smart Communities, [http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml "Village Homes."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817204157/http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/success/village.shtml |date=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
[[File:Grass lined channel NRCS.jpg|thumb|right|Grass lined swale collects rainwater, which then slowly percolates into the soil, where it is protected from runoff and evaporation.]]
The 225 homes and 20 apartment units that now are the Village Homes community use solar panels for heating, and they are oriented around common areas at the rear of the buildings, rather than around the street at the front. All streets are oriented east-west, with all lots positioned north-south. This feature has become standard practice in Davis and elsewhere since it enables homes with passive solar designs to make full use of the sun's energy throughout the year. The development also uses natural drainage, called bioswales, to collect water to irrigate the common areas and support the cultivation of edible foods, such as nut and fruit trees and vegetables for consumption by residents, without incurring the cost of using treated municipal water.&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes, Davis, California]; Bill Browning and Kim Hamilton, [http://www.context.org/iclib/ic35/browning/ "Village Homes: A model solar community proves its worth"]; Smart Communities, Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''World Federation for Medical Education''' (WFME) is a [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] concerned with education and training of medical doctors worldwide. WFME’s main objective is to "enhance the quality of medical education worldwide, with promotion of the highest scientific and ethical standards in medical education". The organisation develops standards for medical education and promotes accreditation of medical schools. It also co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME works in partnership with its six Regional Associations for Medical Education&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/member-associations|title=WFME Member Associations|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other international organisations including the [[World Health Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/register-nonstate-actors/nsa.aspx?id=151|title=WHO Register of non-State actors (Pilot)|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Medical Association]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wma.net/who-we-are/alliance-and-partner/partners/|title=WMA - The World Medical Association-Partners|website=www.wma.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; with WFME’s associate members, and with medical schools worldwide.

== History ==
WFME was founded on the 30 September 1972 in [[Copenhagen]]. The founding organisations included the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[World Medical Association]] (WMA).

In 1988 the Edinburgh declaration was approved at the World Conference on Medical Education, calling for greater co-operation between the health system and the education system, reflecting national needs in medical education and continuing lifelong education of medical staff to achieve quality in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/wfme-publications/99-the-edinburgh-declaration/file|title=The Edinburgh Declaration 1989|last=|first=|date=|website=wfme.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Declaration was adopted by the [[World Health Assembly]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/172229/1/WHA42_R38_eng.pdf|title=Edinburgh Declaration on the reform of medical education|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aspect of medical education responding to the national needs was also stressed at the World Summit on Medical Education 1993.

WFME participated in the Global Consensus Project for Social Accountability of Medical Schools initiated in 2010, which further focused on the co-operation and link between medical education and the society, highlighting the necessity to meet the health care needs of patients and societies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/documents/about-wfme/79-wfme-history-of-the-first-forty-years-1972-2012/file|title=WFME History of the first 40 years|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2008-2014 WFME maintained the [[Avicenna Directories|Avicenna]] directory, a public database of worldwide&amp;nbsp;[[medical schools]],&amp;nbsp;[[Pharmacy school|schools of pharmacy]], schools of&amp;nbsp;[[public health]]&amp;nbsp;and educational institutions of other academic health professions, which was later merged with [[International Medical Education Directory|IMED]] to create the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/about/|title=World Directory of Medical Schools {{!}} About|website=www.wdoms.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME previously had offices in Bethesda, [[Maryland]] (USA) and [[Edinburgh]] (UK), and most recently in [[Copenhagen]] (Denmark) and Ferney-Voltaire (France). The organisation is currently registered in the UK and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100024502|title=World Federation for Medical Education {{!}} Yearbook Profile {{!}} Union of International Associations|website=www.uia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/home/contact|title=WFME Contact page|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The three major projects WFME currently prioritises are the creation of global standards&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/standards|title=WFME Standards|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for quality improvement of medical education, managing the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/directories|title=WFME Directories|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Recognition of Accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation|title=WFME Accreditation|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In developing Global Standards, the WFME appointed three International Task Forces, one for each of the three phases of medical education:
* basic (undergraduate) Medical Education (BME)
* postgraduate medical education (PME)
* continuing medical education (CME)/professional development of medical doctors (CPD)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
Building on the standards, WFME provides guidance on establishing medical schools in the context of global standards but also with respect to the national need.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/guidance|title=WFME Criteria for establishment of a new medical school|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with FAIMER, WFME co-manages the [[World Directory of Medical Schools|World Directory of Medical School]], a public database of medical schools worldwide.&lt;ref name="wdoms.org"/&gt;

WFME Recognition Programme aims to ensure that [[accreditation]] of medical schools in the world, is at an internationally accepted standard. WFME awards Recognition Status to the [[accrediting agencies]] that apply and are assessed to be up to the agreed standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/accreditation/accrediting-accreditors/recognition-process|title=WFME Recognition process|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] published&amp;nbsp;a press release stating that students applying for [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]] Certification&amp;nbsp;after 2023 will be required to have graduated from a medical school that has been "appropriately accredited by an agency that uses criteria comparable to those established for U.S. medical schools by the&amp;nbsp;[[Liaison Committee on Medical Education]] (LCME)&amp;nbsp;or that uses other globally accepted criteria, such as WFME’s".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/forms/9212010.press.release.pdf|title=ECFMG 2023 press release|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WFME also develops a project on the Role of the Doctor in the modern society, reflecting the changing position of the medical professions in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/projects/role-of-the-doctor|title=WFME Role of the Doctor|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
WFME strategy is developed and agreed at the yearly Executive Council meeting. The Executive Council includes &amp;nbsp;the directors of the six regional organisations, representatives of the founding organisations ([[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[World Medical Association|WMA]]) and collaborating organisations ([[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates|ECFMG]], [[International Federation of Medical Students' Associations|IFMSA]]) The [[Junior Doctors Network]] of WMA also attends by invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wfme.org/about/executive-council|title=WFME Executive council|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
