&lt;blockquote&gt;I wanted to give the Canadian aboriginal communities a vision for the future - and a sense of possibility. It is the entrepreneurial spirit and success, which gives the rightful recognition to communities in the mainstream world. It also allows the successful entrepreneurs to become role models for their community,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poafoundation.org/media_coverage/aditya_jha_opens_a_bright_chapter_for_the_indians_of_canada.html A 'Hindustani' opens a bright chapter for the Indians of Canada ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122013353/http://www.poafoundation.org/media_coverage/aditya_jha_opens_a_bright_chapter_for_the_indians_of_canada.html |date=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quotes &amp; philosophy==
* "In Life, you always get more than what you deserve or less than what you deserve - You never quite get just the right amount. If you get less you must work harder &amp; smarter, and if you get more than you must give back"
* "Empathy starts with actions"
* "Before I became active with ‘giving’ to charitable causes, I looked at giving as charity to others. Now, I see giving as charity to myself. You are giving to your expanded self, your passion, your talent to make your desired changes and to your obligation to payback to the favorite social circumstances as only those favourable social circumstances allow people like yourself, your kids and for all, that you care about to prosper"
* "Nobel laureate, Herbert Simon estimated that the "social capital" is responsible for at least 90% of what people earn in wealthy societies. I am trying to make a case here that all of us have obligation to give and pay back to that 'Social Capital' and ALL of us can 'SPARE to Give'." [Keynote speech titled 'Giving - A charity to self or others?' at a charity gala]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/giving_-_a_charity_to_self_or_others.html Keynote speech: Giving - A charity to self or others?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827090445/http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/giving_-_a_charity_to_self_or_others.html |date=August 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I urge you to seriously think of giving back to the mainstream causes that you are passionate about and try to be active with the causes you give for. It will benefit us tremendously, benefit Canada deservingly and feed our soul well. May I urge you to consider giving every year 10% of what you earn after tax? It is highly doable. We never have enough to spare to give but we can always spare to give. Giving is permanent but accumulation is not. Giving is the right thing to do- it is an obligation." --&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/diwali_recognition_speech.html Diwali Recognition Speech] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827092746/http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/diwali_recognition_speech.html |date=August 27, 2009 }}, Friday, 26 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* "I would urge all of you to think of philanthropy in a totally different way. It should be integral and well thought part of your entrepreneurial life. Philanthropy Is Not About Doing Good But rather it is "good for you"; "good for others" is just the byproduct." [Speaking to MBA students of various Canadian institutions at a conference titled 'Starting &amp; Managing Successful Venture: A new Canadian's Perspective' in Toronto]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/starting__managing_successful_venture_a__new_canadians_perspective.html Centre Stage 2009, Toronto Joint seminar with Rotman (University of Toronto), Schulich (York University), Wilfrid Laurier MBA Students and India Abroad] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827092347/http://www.poafoundation.org/speeches/starting__managing_successful_venture_a__new_canadians_perspective.html |date=August 27, 2009 }}, April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Just because you have more or less money, it does not mean you will give more or less. Giving has a state of mind and when you have understood that part, you will give irrespective of how much money you have." [Quoted in the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] April 2010 report titled 'The New World of Wealth-Seven key trends for investing, giving &amp; spending among the very rich' of The [[Economist magazine]] ]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=new_world_of_wealth&amp;page=noads&amp;rf=0], April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* Philanthropy is critical for any civilized society.
* Success is an event, not a state. Therefore, no one can remain successful.
* 'What Got Us Here, Won't Take Us there', highlighted that for Canada to stay on the curve of high quality of life and growth, we must focus on the concept of '[[demographic dividend]]' and how effectively Canada engages immigrants and its aboriginal population.

'''Aleksandr Aleksejevich Khanzhonkov''' ({{lang-rus|Александр Алексеевич Ханжонков|p=ɐlʲɪˈksandr ɐlʲɪˈksʲejɪvʲɪtɕ xənˈʐonkəf}}; {{OldStyleDate|8 August|1877|27 July}} — 26 September 1945) was a pioneering [[Russian Empire|Russian]] cinema entrepreneur, film director and screenwriter. He is known for producing ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]'', Russia's first [[feature film]], as well as [[Ladislas Starevich]]'s ground-breaking [[stop motion]] animation. Khanzhonkov worked as a consultant in the post-revolutionary [[Goskino]] until he was banned from cinema in 1926.&lt;ref name=''rollberg&gt;''Peter Rollberg (2016)''. [https://books.google.ru/books?id=gM6QDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Cinema]. — [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]], p. 3 {{ISBN|978-1-4422-6842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Years==
Khanzhonkov was born in the small village of Khanzhonkova of the Don Host Oblast (modern-day [[Makiivka]], [[Donetsk Oblast]]) into a [[Russian nobility|noble]] family of [[Don Cossacks]]. His father Alexei Petrovich Khanzhonkov was a landlord who went bankrupt. His mother Paraskeva Sergeevna Khanzhonkova (née Dmitrieva) came from a colonel's family who owned a [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] shop in [[Moscow]]. The noble title was first granted to Aleksandr's great-grandfather Vasily Khanzhonkov.&lt;ref name='orlova'&gt;''Irina Orlova (2007)''. Dedicate My Life to Cinema. — Donetsk: Promin, 127 pages (Biography)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.ukr-info.net/smi/view_article.cgi?sid=22&amp;nid=2583&amp;aid=29817 Interview with Aleksandr Khanzhonkov's granddaughter Irina Orlova] from the ''[[:ru:Вечерний Донецк|Evening Donetsk]]'' newspaper № 73, May 18, 2007 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='chastny'&gt;Maxim Medvedev. ''[http://www.chaskor.ru/article/aleksandr_hanzhonkov_rab_kinematografa_v_sadu_rashodyashchihsya_tropok_19002 A slave of cinema in the garden of the parting paths]'' article at [[Chastny Korrespondent]], August 8, 2014 (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksandr studied in the [[Novocherkassk]] Cossack School and was sent to serve in the Moscow host after his graduation in 1986. He took part in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] which undermined his health.&lt;ref name='orlova' /&gt;&lt;ref name='chastny' /&gt; In 1905, upon a discharge from military training due to health issues, Khanzhonkov sat in on a screening of [[Train Pulling into a Station]] by the [[Lumiere Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://russiapedia.rt.com/prominent-russians/cinema-and-theater/aleksansdr-khanzhonkov/ Prominent Russians: Aleksansdr Khanzhonkov in ''Russiapedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the onset of his interest and subsequent investment in film, primarily as a producer but also as a director.

==Career==
In 1906 Khanzhonkov founded Russia's first cinema factory, A. Khanzhonkov and Co., whose main financial backer was [[Ivan Ozerov]], an influential banker and member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|Russian State Council]]. Initial productions were shot on stage in the vein of [[Melies]] and were overshadowed by the work of [[Alexander Drankov]]. Known for his unabashed commercialism, Drankov would remain a competitor up to the revolution of 1917.&lt;ref name=''rollberg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leyda|first1=Jay|title=Prologue to the Russian Film (Part Two)|journal=Hollywood Quarterly|date=January 1947|volume=2|issue=2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until 1911 that Khanzhonkov's factory would receive widespread acclaim with the release of ''[[Defence of Sevastopol]]''. One of the earliest full length Russian feature films, it was equally notable for its technical aspects. By the end of 1912, Khanzhonkov had established a permanent studio in Moscow and went on to produce over a hundred films over the course of the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=F. Jahn|first1=Hubertus|title=Cultures in Flux|date=1944|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=141|chapter=For Tsar and Fatherland?

During the [[Russian Revolution]], Khanzhonkov fled Russia to [[Constantinople]] and [[Vienna]], and, despite previous affiliation with the royal family, returned upon invitation to the [[USSR]] in 1923 and was appointed director of the new Soviet studio [[Proletkino]] and later as a production consultant for [[Goskino]]. His career in the [[Soviet Union]] ended in 1926: he was forced to abdicate after a corruption scandal struck Proletkino, and never worked in cinema again. Khanzhonkov spent the rest of his life in [[Yalta]], living on a personal pension from the state. There he survived the [[Crimea#In the Soviet Union|Nazi occupation of Crimea]] in 1941–1944, and died in Yalta after many years of declining health on September 26, 1945.

[[File:Aurea 1925.JPG|thumb|1925 Aurea]]
'''Aurea''', '''Societa Italiana Ferrotaie''' (Turin 1920-1922), '''Fabbrica Anonima Torinese Automobili''' (Turin 1922-1933). Aurea was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[automobile]] manufactured in [[Turin]] from 1921 to 1930.

==History==
Aurea built [[sidevalve]] and [[overhead valve]] [[four-cylinder]] cars with engines that started at 1460 [[Cubic centimetre|cc]] in the S.V. version engine, but later were increased to 1479 cc in both S.V. and O.H.V. engine configurations. Only the "S" type MONZA factory racing version contained the [[OHV]] type engine.  The cars were well-made, but fairly heavy.  Regular production of Aureas stopped around 1926, but the company produced a few more cars from existing parts and maintained parts supply under for the vehicles under [[List of automobile companies founded by the Ceirano brothers|Ceirano]]'s new ownership and management from late 1926 onwards.Post last Aurea vehicle assembly, the same factory was used to manufacture Ceirano commercial vehicles, particularly trucks.

==Cars==
Three model series of the Aurea were produced:
# Series 400 model - 1920 to 1922 production; No "S" versions, 5 passenger body styles; 1460cc engine, rear wheel brakes only, wooden artillery type wheels.
# Series 500 model - 1923 to mid-1925, "S" type OHV introduced as top line model - 4 wheel brakes and wire wheels; all other passenger models have 2 wheel brakes and wooden artillery wheels and are rear wheel brake only.
# Series 600 model &amp;ndash; mid-1925 to late 1926 &amp;ndash; Body style changes to increase width of passenger compartment; radiator badge contains abbreviation "FATA" re: Fascist era of production (early Aurea's do not contain this). "S" OHV version still in production. FATA is "Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili".

Wire wheels on Aurea are "clinker" or "B.E." type rims of French [[Michelin]] origin at 18&amp;nbsp;inches diameter and are identical to that of the FIAT 509 model (some FIAT's have "Dunlop" brand as similar).

Brake front end type is very similar to that of the "Amilcar". All Aurea front I beam axles contain a casting of the Aurea radiator badge insignia at front centre (between I beam top and bottom web).

Aurea radiators are German Silver construction and contain a rare French "Gallay" core identical to that of the Silver Ghost Rolls Royce; The radiator cap is bakelite and brass and identical to that of early 20s vintage FIAT cars (501,503,505,509 &amp; 510 models).

Aurea Factory site is located in Turin close to FIAT.

The factory survived from 1926 to [[World War II]] under Ceirano management producing Aurea spares and Ceirano Commercial vehicles (not cars). The factory was bombed and destroyed around 1941 according to Italian Historians.{{who|date=October 2011}}

Of those examples surviving:

Series 400 - 1 remnant vehicle in Australia, NSW; One ex Australian vehicle now being driven in UK.
Series 500 - 1 only low mileage original vehicle located in Northern Italy.
Series 600 - 1 only example, running and complete with Australian (Wagga based) body, in Melbourne Australia.

It is believed a second and original British bodied Aurea survives in England, but has not been seen or heard of for at 25 years (per this year 2008 comment).

6 vehicles are confirmed as arriving in [[Australia]] at Parammatta Agency (confirmed by son of ex Aurea garage mechanic from that establishment, located in Parramatta Road) - At least two OHV versions; 1 off discarded car burnt out in bushfire blaze in the early 1970s S.W. of Sydney; remanats of second OHV car found at Dandenong, Melbourne in the late 1950s, same vehicle's engine found at Ballarat Victoria in the early 1980s; 1 only Series 600 arrived, bodied at coachbuilder Wagga Wagga N.S.W in 1926, moved to Harrietville VIC. in 1929 and survived there until the late 1950s and known as the "Roarer Farter" after radiator badge wording "Aurea FATA"; This vehicle resided at Bright VIC. until the early 1990s; At least 2 series 400 arrived, one residing at Hawthorn Melbourne for many years before residing in Ballarat VIC during the late 1970s through 1980s; At least one Series 500 (standard car)arrived in Australia, it was raced by the Parammatta Aurea Mechanic (in standard form) in the first, and several successive Warrick Farm (Sydney)raceway events.

Only two Australian new-sales agencies were known - 1 at Parramatta Rd. Parramatta Sydney and 1 in Wagga Wagga, N.S.W. No known agencies existed in Melbourne or any other Australian State.

Aureas were only exported ex Italy to [[England]], [[Austria]] and [[Australia]]. Italian vehicles received Italian made bodies; Australian bound vehicles were exported via England and contain either a British made body or Australian made body. All Aurea have a typical "gable" type bonnet and scuttle arrangement similar to the late 1920s FIAT and all Ceirano, Lancia and other Italian makes of that period.

The Aurea 1460 and 1490 cc S.V. engine is similar to that of a FIAT 501 design, but is unique. Aurea engine and drivetrain components can only be identified by a cast oval containing the word "Aurea" at top centre of gearbox bellhousing, as per Ceirano vehicle arrangement. Aurea use American 6 Volt Westinghouse starting and generating systems. generator is mounted in gearbox and similar to the Metallurgique car arrangement.

Aurea vehicles contain Veglia instruments from the Veglia family of Bolongna Italy; later versions contain O.S. instruments as a variation of the Veglia standard type. Amp gauge is American Westinghouse and oil gauge is "Aurea" insignia marked.

All Aurea vehicles are right hand drive formation, as this was law in Italy before that countries road laws changed; hence they were suitable for British and Colonial use.

Series 400 Aureas contain a 3 speed gearbox; Series 500 and 600 vehicles contain a 4 speed gearbox with a central mounted gear change gate and a reverse "block - out" button located in centre of gear knob.

Top speed of the later 500 and 600 series models in standard production form is @ 40 miles per hour. The OHV "S" versions typically have two-seater aluminium bodies and an extra 15 to 20 mile per hour top speed and much better stopping capability.

The steering box of Aurea are virtually identical to the FIAT 501 model but do not contain the characteristic FIAT throttle arrangement. Aurea vehicles have a throttle knob located longitudinally parallel to the steering column rod and protrude through toe board plate.

Aurea contain a "carden-shaft" rear end similar to FIAT design.

Cooling systems are of the thermosyphon type with no water pump. The carburettor is of the sidedraft type SOLEX design and are a rarer 28&amp;nbsp;mm SOLEX throat diameter. Four cold-start priming caps reside in-head for winter starting.

Battery location is underfloor for non-Italian vehicles and running board mounted (in-box) otherwise.

Magneto is the Marelli brand, located on vehicles passenger side and reverse rotation to that of FIAT 501.

Interior body trim on all vehicles is of a very high standard for the vehicles market segment; In-general the vehicles were aimed at the middle-car market and appealed aesthetically with "higher than average" upholstery quality and internal fitting appointments.

The steering wheel of an Aurea is exactly that of the Lancia Lambda and is moulded in "Shellanite" (Shell brand bakelite).

English and Australian passenger compartment body styling resembles that of the English "Clyno" car, but is approximately the same dimensions as the larger FIAT 501 vehicle.

Series 400 and 600 Aurea vehicles contain single bulb headlight arrangements similar in style to that of German "Bosch" brand shape, and contain the cast word "Aurea" at the top front of the headlights cast aluminium bezel. Series 600 vehicles contain a rarer twin bulb headlight, similar to Bosch Lancia Lambda style, but are of the Italian "Carello" brand and are all-brass with a unique Carello headlight glass. The taillight assembly is a cylindrical type and similar, but not the same as FIAT vehicles. British taillights are rectangular and "jeweled", being similar to that of the English "Clyno" Car.

==Competition==
An original OHV Aurea factory team racing car survives located in Sicily - This vehicle has MONZA factory racing origin. These vehicles raced at MONZA competitively for 1 or 2 years reliably but unsuccessfully in their vehicle class.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">A '''breakup fee''' (sometimes called a '''termination fee''') is a penalty set in [[takeover]] agreements, to be paid if the target backs out of a deal (usually because it has decided instead to accept a more attractive offer). The breakup fee is ostensibly to compensate the original acquirer for the cost of the time and resources expended in negotiating the original agreement. A breakup fee also serves to inhibit competing bids, since such bids would have to cover the cost of the breakup fee as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dictionary of finance and investment terms. (9th ed.). [Online]. Hauppauge: Barron's Educational Series.|last=Goodman|first=|publisher=Hauppauge: Barron's Educational Series.|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reverse breakup fee ==

A reverse breakup fee is a [[Penalty (contract)|penalty]] to be paid to the target company if the acquirer backs out of the deal, usually because it can’t obtain financing. Reasons for such fees include the possibility of lawsuits, disruption of business operations, and the loss of key personnel during the period when the company is "in play."

== Notable Examples ==

* As a result of the failed 2011 merger of AT&amp;T and T-Mobile, AT&amp;T will have to pay a reverse breakup fee of $3 billion in cash and $1–3 billion in wireless spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/12/20/att-and-t-mobile-whats-2-billion-among-friends/&lt;/ref&gt;
* If Japanese corporation [[SoftBank]]'s $20 billion bid to buy 70% of [[Sprint Nextel]] fell through, SoftBank would have had to pay a $600 million breakup fee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/sprint-nextel-takeover-by-softbank-could-save-unlimited-data-plans-from-extinction/2012/10/15/4b153d04-16e1-11e2-8792-cf5305eddf60_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; SoftBank completed the deal with Sprint and is no longer subject to the reverse termination fee.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsroom.sprint.com/news-releases/sprint-and-softbank-announce-completion-of-merger.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bridge life-cycle cost analysis''' (BLCCA), is [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle cost analysis]] for individual [[bridge]]s assuming a planning or [[time horizon]] as the period of time over which all costs are to be estimated.

Transportation officials consider BLCCA important for assisting with investment decisions.

The calculation of life-cycle costs depends on the choice of a distinct time period (planning time horizon) over which operations and maintenance costs are accrued, discounted ([[Net present value|NPV]]), and compared with cost of [[Financial capital|capital]].

A '''business necessity''' is a legitimate [[business]] purpose that justifies an employment decision as effective and needed to optimally achieve the organization’s goals and ensure that operations run safely and efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Cascio, W. F., &amp; Aguinis, H. (2010). Applied Psychology in Human Resource Management,  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often presented as a defense of an employment decision that is questioned because it was found to cause [[disparate impact]].

'''Business rates''' is the commonly used name '''in England''' of '''non-domestic rates''', a tax on the occupation of non-domestic property ('''National Non-Domestic Rates – NNDR'''). [[Rates (tax)|Rates]] are a [[property tax]] with ancient roots&lt;ref&gt;Court of Appeal in R F Williams (VO) v Scottish &amp; Newcastle Retail Ltd and Allied Domecq Retailing Ltd – Rose &amp; Castle and City Duck/City Fayre, Milton Keynes RA 2005 (119–193)&lt;/ref&gt; that was formerly used to fund local services that was formalised with the [[Poor Law 1572]] and superseded by the [[Poor Law of 1601]]. The [[Local Government Finance Act 1988]] introduced business rates in England and Wales from 1990, repealing its immediate predecessor, the [[General Rate Act 1967]]. The act also introduced [[business rates in Scotland]], but as an amendment to the existing system which had evolved separately to that in the rest of Great Britain.  Since the establishment, in 1997, of a [[Welsh Assembly Government]] able to pass [[secondary legislation]], the English and Welsh systems have been able to diverge. In 2015 business rates for Wales were devolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-32144503 |title=Wales assumes full control of £1bn of business rates |accessdate=2017-01-31 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Local Government Finance Act 1988, with follow-up legislation, provided a fresh administrative framework for assessing and billing, but did not redefine the legal unit of property, the [[hereditament]], that had been developed through rating [[case law]]. Properties are assessed in a rating list with a rateable value, a [[property valuation|valuation]] of their annual [[rental]] value on a fixed valuation date using assumptions fixed by [[statute]].  Rating lists are created and maintained by the [[Valuation Office Agency]], a [[UK Government]] [[Executive Agency]]. Rating lists can be altered either to reflect changes in properties, or as valuations are appealed against. New rating lists are normally created every five years, however, the 2015 revaluation has been postponed until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/News/2012/newsRelease_November_2012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213141600/http://www.voa.gov.uk/corporate/News/2012/newsRelease_November_2012.html |archivedate=13 February 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014-15 authorities collected a total of £22.9 billion in business rates, representing 3.53% of the total UK tax income and achieving an average in-year collection rate of 98.1%.&lt;ref name=collectiondata&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/440177/Collection_Rate_Statistics_Release_July_2015.pdf |title=Collection rates and receipts of council tax and non-domestic rates in England 2014-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2013 a new system of business rates retention began in England. Before April 2013 all business rate income collected by councils formed a single, national pot, which was then distributed by government in the form of formula grant. Through the Local Government Finance Act 2012, and regulations that followed, the Government gave local authorities the power to keep up to half of business rate income and transfer half of it centrally, to central government. The central share is then distributed to councils in the form of Revenue Support Grant. The other half kept by local authorities are then subjected to tariff, levy, top up and safety payments depending on the financial position of the council. According to the government the change gives financial incentives to councils to grow their local economies and increase their income from business rates. At the same time the new scheme has resulted in more risk and uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/8474/2053505.pdf |title=Local Government Resource Review: Proposals for Business Rates Retention Consultation - Government Response |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=ww.gov.uk |publisher= |access-date=10 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Workhouse Nantwich.jpg|thumb|right|280 px|Former workhouse at [[Nantwich]], dating from 1780. Workhouses developed as part of the [[English Poor Laws|poor law]], which was funded by rates]]
Business rates are the latest incarnation of a series of taxes for funding local services known as rates, based on property values. The first rate was part of the Elizabethan Poor Law Act 1572, which established relief for the poor at the local parish level, paid for by inhabitants of the parish. A system of rates to fund local government and services evolved over the next three centuries, including a separate system for London from 1869&lt;ref&gt;[[Valuation (Metropolis) Act 1869]]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[London Government Act 1963]]&lt;/ref&gt; Changes included a stricter definition of how to value for a rate;&lt;ref&gt;[[Parochial Assessments Act 1836]]&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of a valuation list containing the assessed values;&lt;ref&gt;[[Union Assessment Committee Act 1862]]&lt;/ref&gt; the ability to object to the assessed value;&lt;ref&gt;[[Union Assessment Committee Amendment Act 1864]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of the valuation officer, appointed by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue (now [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]]), as the assessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type = act |year = Geo6/11-12 |chapter = 26 |act = Local Government Act 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate predecessor to business rates was the general rate, established by the [[General Rate Act 1967]]. This was a local tax in England and Wales on both domestic and non-domestic property and was based on rental values. It retained the core concept of how to identify a rateable property from the older rating systems, which, along with other features, can still be seen in the modern system. The Local Government Finance Act 1988&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Local Government Finance Act 1988 (c. 41) | publisher = [[HMSO]] | year = 1988 | url = http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/41| isbn = 0-10-544188-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; repealed the General Rate Act and replaced it with two new taxes from 1 April 1990. The [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|Community Charge]], better known as the "poll tax", replaced the rating of domestic property. It was itself later replaced by [[Council Tax]]. The remaining non-domestic properties were to be covered by a modernised version of the general rate.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 465-467"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.465–467&lt;/ref&gt;

The new non-domestic rating system became known as business rates, or sometimes the universal business rate. It retained from its predecessors the concept of a series of local rating lists, with each property being assessed for a rateable value based on rental values. Rating lists were prepared and maintained by the Valuation Office (reconstituted in 1991 as a [[UK Government]] [[executive agency]], the [[Valuation Office Agency]]), while billing and collection was the responsibility of local authorities. Previously, local authorities had decided what proportion of rateable values to charge; the new system featured a centrally set multiplier, often referred to as the Uniform Business Rate, by which the basic bill was calculated. The bill could be further modified by various reliefs, including the newly introduced transitional relief, which was designed to smooth large changes in liability due to revaluations. The multiplier was calculated to ensure that, on average, bills rose by no more than the rate of inflation.

A system of rating had also evolved in [[Scotland]], through separate legislation. While in many ways similar, key underlying concepts in the [[Business rates in Scotland|Scottish system]] differed, as did the administrative scheme. The [[Local Government Finance Act 1988]] renamed the Scottish rates, and imposed the centrally set multiplier, but did not otherwise disturb the Scottish rating legislation.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Pt X"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/41/part/X Local Government Finance Act 1988] (c. 41) Part X&lt;/ref&gt;

During the introduction of business rates, criticism focused on the level of the multiplier to be chosen, and on the transitional relief scheme, with organisations such as the [[Confederation of British Industry]] calling for a lower multiplier and a relief scheme more to the benefit of its members.&lt;ref name="CBI"&gt;{{cite news | title = Business rates | publisher = [[Estates Gazette]] | date = 15 April 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the [[Lyons Inquiry]] into Local Government said there was no significant opposition to the principles of the tax, but that the level was a concern to property-intensive businesses. Due to the overall yield being linked to the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] as a measure of inflation, the contribution of business rates to local government finance has decreased compared to Council Tax and government grants. Many local authorities have called for the rate to be increased, and for the power to set the multiplier to be returned to local control;&lt;ref name="Lyons Inquiry"&gt;{{cite book| last = Lyons | first = Michael | author-link = Sir Michael Lyons | title = Lyons Inquiry into Local Government – Final Report | publisher = [[The Stationery Office]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-11-989854-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; both suggestions have been opposed by business organisations such as the [[British Retail Consortium]].&lt;ref name="BRC response"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cooke | first = Edward | title = The Lyons Inquiry into Local Government: A British Retail Consortium (BRC) response | publisher = [[British Retail Consortium]] | date = 8 March 2006 | url = https://www.webarchive.org.uk/pan/15454/20070428/www.lyonsinquiry.org.uk/submissions/20060308%20British%20Retail%20Consortium%20Response%20to%20Interim%20report.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lyons Inquiry rejected the return to local control, and instead proposed giving local authorities the power to levy a local supplement, in consultation with affected businesses; responses from the business sector have ranged from caution to opposition.&lt;ref name="CBI Supplement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbi.org.uk/ndbs/cbi_bss.nsf/8dee44d616d5b99280256c5b004f042a/1bdf000a00e788e380257330003b1f98?OpenDocument |title=CBI Business Summary – Supplementary Business Rates |accessdate=30 August 2007 |date=14 August 2007 |publisher=[[Confederation of British Industry]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827202048/http://www.cbi.org.uk/ndbs/cbi_bss.nsf/8dee44d616d5b99280256c5b004f042a/1bdf000a00e788e380257330003b1f98?OpenDocument |archivedate=27 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FT"&gt;{{cite news | first=Bryant | last=Chris |author2=James Wilson | title=Call to allow councils extra business levy | date=21 March 2007 | publisher=FT.com | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/ddd59eb6-d751-11db-b9d7-000b5df10621.html | work =[[Financial Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 30 August 2007 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the creation of the [[National Assembly for Wales]] in 1999, some of the powers previously exercised by the UK government were devolved to the Welsh Assembly government. The English and Welsh systems were able to diverge slightly, with Wales setting a different Uniform Business rate multiplier,&lt;ref name="mbr multiplier (wales)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/wales/rates/ubr/index.html |title=www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk – The rates bill – The multiplier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928235933/http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/wales/rates/ubr/index.html |archive-date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and different reliefs.

== Billing and reliefs ==

For each property in the rating list for their area, the local authority calculates and issues a bill, which it is responsible for collecting, with powers to pursue payment. The rateable value is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate, referred to in legislation as the non-domestic rating multiplier, to arrive at an annual bill. For example, a rateable value of £10,000 and a multiplier of 40p would produce an annual bill of £4,000.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 510"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.510&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/how_calculated/index.html |title=The rates bill – How is it calculated? |accessdate=2 June 2007 |publisher=mybusinessrates.gov.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510152741/http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/how_calculated/index.html |archivedate=10 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill usually requires payment in instalments over the financial year.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 615"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.615&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business rates multipliers ===

The multiplier is set by central government, and is uniform. Power to set the multiplier in Wales has been [[devolution|devolved]] to the [[National Assembly for Wales]]. A special case exists where a defined special authority can set its own multiplier within centrally defined limits.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch 7 and s144(6)"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 section 144(6), and Schedule 7&lt;/ref&gt; The only currently qualifying authority is the [[City of London]].&lt;ref name="london ubr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/about_us/finance/business_rates/how_your_bill.htm |title=How your bill is calculated |accessdate=2 June 2007 |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625210141/http://cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/about_us/finance/business_rates/how_your_bill.htm |archivedate=25 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The multiplier is increased annually, in April. The increase is capped at the same proportion as the increase in the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]] for the month of September the preceding year. When re-valuations take place, the multiplier is adjusted so that the overall change across the country is the same as the Retail Prices Index change.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 528"&gt;Hamilton et al. p528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch 7"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Schedule 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of Small Business Rate Relief in 2005 added a supplement to the UBR to fund the relief.&lt;ref name="LGA 2003"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/26 Local Government Act 2003], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-542603-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The income from business rates currently does not go directly to the local authority (unlike [[Council Tax]]); rather, it is pooled centrally and redistributed to the authorities.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 460"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.460&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch 8"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Schedule 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014-15 authorities in England collected a total of £22.9 billion in business rates, representing 3.53% of the total UK tax income and achieving an average in-year collection rate of 98.1%.&lt;ref name=collectiondata/&gt;

For 2016/17 the multiplier is 49.7 pence and the small business rate multiplier is 48.4 pence.&amp;nbsp;The multiplier for 2017/18 is 47.9 pence,&lt;ref name="NNDR2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.uk/calculate-your-business-rates|title=Estimate your business rates|website=gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that this tax has increased in real terms by 37.6% since its inception in 1990.  The rateable values are updated to current market values, but the multiplier has increased from 34.8p (or 34.8%) to 47.9p (47.9%).

=== Reliefs ===
The bill may also be reduced by having one or more reliefs applied to it, such as reliefs for empty properties, or for charities. Reliefs are administered by the local authority and they do not affect the rateable value of a property. While some are mandatory, others are at the discretion of the local authority, who also have to bear, in whole or in part, the costs of some reliefs. In addition to specific reliefs, a hardship relief is available at the discretion of the local authority.&lt;ref name="Charitable reliefs annexe b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/busrats/nndr/annexb.htm |title=Non-domestic rates: Guidance on rate reliefs for charities and other non-profit making organisations |accessdate=2 June 2007 |date=5 December 2002 |publisher=[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607003628/http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/busrats/nndr/annexb.htm |archivedate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A relief on non-agricultural business on agricultural land or former agricultural buildings has been removed with effect from 14 August 2006.&lt;ref name="mbr reliefs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/other_reliefs/index.html |title=Business Rates – Reliefs |accessdate=2 June 2007 |publisher=mybusinessrates.gov.uk |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516074928/http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/other_reliefs/index.html |archivedate=16 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Charitable and non-profit making organisation relief ====

There are three types of relief to which a charity may be entitled: mandatory relief on occupied property, discretionary relief on occupied property and mandatory zero rating for unoccupied property. The relevant legislation is the Local Government Finance Act 1988.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988"/&gt; The reliefs are not straightforward, and, in particular, the granting of the discretionary relief (which is by the local authority, or "billing authority") may vary from place to place.

In brief, the reliefs are a mandatory 80% relief on occupied properties, for which the charity must actively apply. An additional discretionary relief, of up to 20%, can also be applied for. The zero rating relief for unoccupied properties will apply where a property is unoccupied but will, when next occupied, be used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes (or those of a community amateur sports club).

Being a [[registered charity]] is conclusive proof of charitable status, but is not the only method to establish it. Simply being owned by a charity will not, however, be sufficient to qualify for the reliefs. The property must also be used wholly or mainly for charitable purposes, and the criteria set out in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 must also be met. The criteria for eligibility are not straightforward and there is some case law, especially in relation to charity shops, which provides guidance.&lt;ref&gt;This case law is discussed in full in [http://www.taxationofcharities.co.uk/ Taxation of Charities and Non-Profit Organisations], James Kessler QC, 10th edition (2015), Chapter 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain non-profit making bodies may also apply for a similar, but discretionary, relief.&lt;ref name="Charitable reliefs1"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.520–527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charitable reliefs2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/busrats/nndr/04.htm |title=Non-domestic rates: Guidance on rate reliefs for charities and other non-profit making organisations Chapter 4 |accessdate=2 June 2007 |date=5 December 2002 |publisher=[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607003509/http://www.local.odpm.gov.uk/finance/busrats/nndr/04.htm |archivedate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria are given as follows:

{{quote|To be eligible for consideration, the ratepayer must be a non-profit making body and the hereditament used for charitable, philanthropic or religious purposes, or concerned with education, social welfare, science, literature or the fine arts, or used wholly or mainly for recreation by a not-for-profit club or society.&lt;ref name="Charitable reliefs1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Charitable reliefs2"/&gt;}}

==== Empty and partly occupied relief ====

As of 1 April 2008, empty relief was altered, removing the previous total relief for industrial properties, and removing the 50% relief for other properties. The three-month period of total relief for non-industrial properties was retained, and a six-month period instituted for industrial properties.&lt;cite&gt; As before, some properties retained 100% empty relief; these included all properties below a certain rateable value (£2,200 from 2005), and [[listed building]]s.&lt;ref name="mbr reliefs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 513-515"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.513–515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1989/2261/contents/made |title=The Non-Domestic Rating (Unoccupied Property) Regulations 1989 |publisher=HMSO |isbn=0-11-098261-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Pre Budget Report 2008, the Chancellor increased the rateable value for full relief to £15,000 for the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010.&lt;cite&gt;

Where part of a property is to be empty for a short time, a discretionary form of empty relief exists for that empty part. The local authority can request an apportionment of the rateable value between empty and occupied parts from the Valuation Office Agency; the empty part can then receive relief in the normal way. This apportionment does not affect the rating list entry.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 475"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.475&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S44A"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 44A, introduced in an amendment by [http://www.legislaion.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/14 Local Government Finance Act 1992 (c.14)]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-541492-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rural property relief ====

To give relief to properties considered vital to rural communities, a combination of compulsory and discretionary reliefs exist in England.&lt;ref name="R (FAPRS) A 2001"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2006/3345/contents/made Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-541401-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh scheme was incorporated into small business rates relief from 1 April 2007.&lt;ref name="NDR (SBR) (W)  2006"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2006/3345/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Small Business Relief) (Wales) Order 2006], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-091477-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properties of a given rateable value (£7,000 in England from 2005) can receive the relief if they are in a rural settlement (defined as a population of 3,000 or less, within designated rural areas), and are the only general store or post office, or food store in the settlement. The only [[public house]] or petrol station (with rateable values of up £10,500, as of 2005) in a settlement may also receive the relief, which is a mandatory 50%.

Discretionary relief of up to 100% is available for the previous properties, and for any others up to a current limit of £12000 rateable value, provided they are judged to be of benefit to the local community.&lt;ref name="mbr reliefs"/&gt;

==== Small Business Rate Relief ====

Officially known as "Non-Domestic Rating (Small Business Rate Relief)" (SBRR) the latest order came into force on 2 March 2015 and extends the relief until the end of March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/106/contents/made|title=The Non-Domestic Rating (Small Business Rate Relief) (England) (Amendment) Order 2015|author=|date=|work=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the rating list that came into force on 1 April 2005 featured a new relief designed to benefit small businesses. The [[Local Government Act 2003]] introduced a small business relief,&lt;ref name="LGA 2003"/&gt; initially set at 50% for properties with a rateable value of below £6,000, which is reduced by 1% for each £120 over £6,000 (effectively a sliding scale from 50% at £6,000 to 0% at £12,000), where the ratepayer has:
* one property, or

Where there are additional properties, only the main property will have the relief applied. The relief must be actively applied for by completion of a form available from each local council. A bill to make the application of the relief mandatory was not passed into legislation although it would have led to a greater take-up of this assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaptree.co.uk/ADR/small-business-rates-relief/|title=Small Business Rates Relief|author=|date=16 March 2015|work=chaptree.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsb.org.uk/policy/assets/ratebill.pdf|title=Small Business Rate Relief (Automatic Payment) Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090306/debtext/90306-0001.htm#090306102000005|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 06 Mar 2009  (pt 0001)|author=|date=|work=parliament.uk|accessdate=10 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To fund the relief in England, a supplement is added to the Uniform Business Rate multiplier.&lt;ref name="LGA 2003"/&gt; However, this supplement is only applied to properties with rateable values of £15,000 or higher (£21,500 in London), so properties between £12,000 and £18,000 receive neither the relief, nor the supplement&lt;ref name="mbr reliefs"/&gt;

In Wales, small business rates relief was not introduced until 2007.&lt;ref name="NDR (SBR) (W)  2006"/&gt; It replaced rural property relief,&lt;ref name="NDR (DNRD)(A) 2006"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2006/3392/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Demand Notices and Discretionary Relief) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2006], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-091478-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but included similar provisions, with 50% relief for most properties with a rateable value below £2,000, and 25% relief for rateable values between £2,000 and £5,000. Post offices with rateable values of up to £9,000 are eligible for 100% relief; while those over £9,000 and up to £12,000 receive 50%.&lt;ref name="Wales Dec Rep)"&gt;[http://www.information.wales.gov.uk/content/decisionreports/business/non-residential/small%20business%20rates%20relief%20scheme.rtf Small Business rates Relief scheme Decision report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195456/http://www.information.wales.gov.uk/content/decisionreports/business/non-residential/small%20business%20rates%20relief%20scheme.rtf |date=27 September 2007 }}, Welsh Assembly Government – Access to Information, retrieved 29 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It also authorises local authorities to set up local schemes of relief for properties up to a limit of £12,000 rateable value.

==== Transitional relief ====

On revaluation, the multiplier is adjusted so that the overall increase in liability across the country is in line with the [[Retail Prices Index (United Kingdom)|Retail Prices Index]], a measure of inflation. A property whose rateable value changes exactly in line with the national average would see an inflation-only rise in liability. Conversely, properties with unusually large changes in rateable value would have a significant change in liability. To smooth these jumps in liability, schemes of transitional relief have been applied to each rating list. These operate by restricting the proportion by which liability may change per year, both upwards and downwards.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 529-531"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.529–531&lt;/ref&gt; The 1990 and 1995 transitional relief schemes required funding from the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]], while the 2000 list scheme was designed to be revenue-neutral over the lifetime of the list, albeit with Treasury funding at the beginning.&lt;ref name="Review of  Reval"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/busrats/revalcon.pdf |title=Review of Revaluation: Issues to be Considered |accessdate=30 August 2007 |last=DETR/LGT |date=February 2007 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Communities and Local Government]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017103512/http://www.local.communities.gov.uk/finance/busrats/revalcon.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Local Government Act 2003]] required that all revaluations in England feature a revenue-neutral scheme, beginning with the 2005 rating list.&lt;ref name="ODPM PR"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Final Business Rates Revaluation Package Announced|publisher=[[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] |date=1 December 2004 |url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=137526&amp;NewsAreaID=2%20&amp;print=true&amp;fromDate=&amp;toDate=&amp;Department=159&amp;Region=2&amp;selSearchType=&amp;SearchCategoryID= |format= |language= |accessdate=30 August 2007 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170919/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/Content/Detail.asp?ReleaseID=137526&amp;NewsAreaID=2%20&amp;print=true&amp;fromDate=&amp;toDate=&amp;Department=159&amp;Region=2&amp;selSearchType=&amp;SearchCategoryID= |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional relief applies only to changes in liability between rating lists, not changes within lists. For example, under the 2005 transitional relief scheme in England, if a rateable value had risen by 20%, the rise in liability would be restricted to 12.5% in the first year, 17.5% in the second year, and the full 20% in the third year (different restrictions would apply for a small business).&lt;ref name="transition"&gt;[http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/transitional_adjustment/index.html www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk – Transitional arrangements] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317044749/http://www.mybusinessrates.gov.uk/rates/transitional_adjustment/index.html |date=17 March 2007 }}, Official government website, retrieved 1 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Transitional relief schemes have been applied to the 1990,&lt;ref name="NDR (TP) R 1990"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1990/608/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Transitional Period) Regulations 1990], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-003608-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1995,&lt;ref name="NDR (TP) R 1994"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/3279 The Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) Regulations 1994], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-043783-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2000&lt;ref name="2000 list trasition"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1999/3379/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (England) Regulations 1999], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-085702-X}}, [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/936.htm The Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2000]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-099057-9}}, and [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/1999/3454/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (Wales) Regulations 1999], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-090029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; rating lists in England and Wales, and to the 2005 rating list in England.&lt;ref name="NDR (CA) (E) 2004"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2004/3387/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Chargeable Amounts) (England) Regulations 2004], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-051415-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rating list ==

[[File:City.hall.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|280 px|[[City Hall (London)|City Hall]], London. Entered in the 2005 rating list on 1 April 2005 as 110, The Queens Walk, London, SE1 2AA; offices and premises, rateable value £3,740,000.]]
Starting on 1 April 1990, a rating list for each local authority was compiled. Although there is technically a separate list for each authority, it is common to refer to the aggregate of the lists as, for example, the 1990 Rating List. Rating lists are maintained during their lifetime to reflect changes in properties, and new lists are compiled every five years.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 559"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.559&lt;/ref&gt; The current list came into force on 1 April 2017.
As well as local lists, there are a small number of central rating lists, used to assess properties that would otherwise span multiple lists, such as railway or telephone networks.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 473"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.473&lt;/ref&gt;
A rating list is required to identify each relevant non-domestic property in the area, and assign a rateable value, based on a rental [[Real estate appraisal|valuation]] of the property. Some types of property, such as public utilities, are valued using a statutory formula instead.
The task of compiling and maintaining the list is given to the valuation officer for each authority, who in practice is a civil servant of the [[Valuation Office Agency]], an [[Executive Agency]] of [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]].

== Rateable value ==
Rateable value is an estimate of the annual rent that would be paid for the property at a fixed date two years prior to the beginning of the list (known as the antecedent valuation date), incorporating certain assumptions laid down in the legislation.
To [[Real estate appraisal|value]] a property, a valuer would look at the physical properties of the property (such as size and location), and consider the economic conditions (the [[market price]] for similar local properties), along with the nature of the transaction (such as a [[Freehold (English law)|freehold]] sale, or agreement of a [[lease]]).

Assessing a rateable value requires a valuation that follows the above process, but the matters to be considered are constrained by legislation. So the physical properties are considered not at the present day, but at the Material Day, and are constrained by the valuation assumptions. The economic conditions are considered at the Antecedent Valuation Date. The valuation is based on a hypothetical lease laid down in the valuation assumptions.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch6"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Schedule 6&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] may make regulations for certain classes of property that give a statutory formulae for the rateable value, instead of the rental value. These classes include large ports and [[public utilities]].&lt;ref name="Hamilton 541-542"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.541–542&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Valuation assumptions ===
The valuation assumes that a year-to-year (that is, ongoing) lease is being agreed, where the tenant pays all repairs and insurance, and that the property "is in a state of reasonable repair".&lt;ref name="repair assumption1"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.533&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="repair assumption2"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988, as amended by Rating Valuation Act 1999&lt;/ref&gt; It was intention of the drafters of the Local Government Finance Act 1988&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988"/&gt; that the assumption of reasonable repair that existed in the [[general rate]] would continue in the new system. However, a successful legal challenge at the [[Lands Tribunal (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|Lands Tribunal]] (''Benjamin (VO) v Anston Properties Ltd'' [1998]&lt;ref name="B v A"&gt;''Benjamin (VO) v Anston Properties Limited'' [1998] R.A. 53, [1998] 19 E.G. 163&lt;/ref&gt;) showed that they had in fact failed to include it in the legislation. This was rectified by the Rating (Valuation) Act 1999,&lt;ref name="R (V) A 1988"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/6 Rating Valuation Act 1999], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-10-540699-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amended the 1988 Act to explicitly include the assumption. The repair assumption includes the proviso of "excluding from this assumption any repairs which a reasonable landlord would consider uneconomic." The property is assumed to be vacant and to let; that is, an empty property available to rent.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 538"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.538&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Material day and antecedent valuation date ===

The material day is the day on which matters affecting the physical state of the property are taken into account. The matters are those affecting the physical state or physical enjoyment, and the mode or category of occupation of the property. This can include the physical state of the locality, or matters which have a physical manifestation in the locality, and the use of other properties in the locality. For certain properties, including mines, quarries and [[landfill]] sites, the quantity of minerals, wastes, or other substances deposited on or remaining in the land are taken into account.&lt;ref name="material matters"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.539&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch6"/&gt;

When the list is compiled, the material day is the day the list is compiled (1 April 2005 for the 2005 valuation list).&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch6"/&gt; If the list is further altered, the material day may be different for that alteration. For example, in the 2005 rating list the material day for an alteration to reflect an extension to a property will be the day the extension is completed.&lt;ref name="NDR (MDLA)(A)"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/658 The Non-Domestic Rating (Material Day for List Alterations) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2005], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-072627-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the material day for an extension had been the day on which the list was altered.&lt;ref name="NDR (MDLA)1992"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1992/556 The Non-Domestic Rating (Material Day for List Alterations) Regulations 1992], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-023556-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of different categories of events which cause the list to be altered (such as a new entry to the list, or the merger of properties), each of which has a specified material day. Most commonly the material day is the day the event occurred.&lt;ref name="NDR (MDLA)1992"/&gt;

The antecedent valuation date is the day from which all other matters (effectively those to do with economic conditions) are determined.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch6"/&gt; In the legislation it may be either the day of compilation, or a prior date set by the government. In practice, it has always been set at two years prior to the start of the list, so that for the 2005 rating list it is 1 April 2003.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 538"/&gt;
== Hereditament ==

Hereditament is a legal term for a unit of property, which often appears to be synonymous with simply "property", in the bricks and mortar sense of the word. The concept of hereditament in rating law has developed along with that of [[Business rates#Rateable occupation|rateable occupation]] through case law, as no single statute has defined it adequately. The Local Government Finance Act 1988 specifically retained&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S64"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 489"&gt;Hamilton et al. p489&lt;/ref&gt; the definition of hereditament from the [[General Rate Act 1967]]:

{{quote|"hereditament" means property which is or may become liable to a rate, being a unit of such property which is, or would fall to be, shown as a separate item in the valuation list.&lt;ref name="GRA 1967"&gt;General Rate Act 1967&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This itself does not directly provide a definition, but depends on the case law already established by prior forms of rating; no statutory definition of the hereditament exists. In case law, the concept of the hereditament is inextricably linked to that of rateable occupation.&lt;ref name="Ryde 2B"&gt;Ryde on Rating Division C: Rateable Property Chapter 2: The Hereditament B: Introduction to the Concept of the 'Hereditament'&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rateable occupation ===

Rateable occupation is occupying a hereditament so as to be liable to pay a rate. In the case of ''LCC v Wilkins (VO)'' [1957],&lt;ref name="L v W"&gt;''LCC v Wilkins'' [1957] AC 362 (1956) IRRC 88&lt;/ref&gt; the court brought together various prior cases to establish four essentials for rateable occupation:

* Actual occupation — requires physical occupation of the property, in the sense that some use is made of it or control exercised over it. It is treated as a matter of fact, so the [[title (property)|legal title]] may not always be relevant.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 615-616"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.615–616&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exclusive occupation – Also a matter of fact, although legal title will often play a part. The courts have laid down that where there are competing occupations, the facts must be considered to establish where paramount control lies.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 477-481"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.477–481&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''Westminster City Council v Southern Railway Co &amp; Others'' [1936], the court had to consider the level of control exercised by operators of various stalls and shops on a railway station, compared to that of the railway company.&lt;ref name="WCC v SRC"&gt;''Westminster City Council v Southern Railway Co &amp; Others'' [1936] AC 511&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beneficial occupation – of some benefit to the occupier. It is not necessary to consider financial profit, as the test here is whether someone will pay rent for the property.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 481-485"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.481–485&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in ''R v School Board for London'' (1886), the board operating a school could take no profit; the court held that this did not prevent beneficial occupation.&lt;ref name="R V S B"&gt;''R v School Board for London'' (1886) 17 QBD 728&lt;/ref&gt;
* Not too transient – the occupation must not be for too short and fleeting a time. The courts have held back from giving a precise length of time, preferring to judge cases on their facts, including the intentions of the parties involved.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 485"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.485&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between rateable occupation and the hereditament can be a complex one – taking rateable occupation of part of a hereditament creates a new hereditament out of the larger one, for example. In practice, determination of rateable occupation and hereditament is often interlinked.&lt;ref name="Ryde B2A5"&gt;Roots B:2:A:5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concept of hereditament ===

[[File:Three Brindleyplace Birmingham.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|Three [[Brindleyplace]], an office block in [[Birmingham]]. Although a single building, it has multiple occupiers. It therefore contains multiple hereditaments, each with a separate entry in the 2005 rating list.]]
In the leading case of ''Gilbert (Valuation Officer) v Hickinbottom &amp; Sons Ltd'' [1956],&lt;ref name="G v H"&gt;''Gilbert (VO) v Hickinbottom &amp; Sons Ltd'' [1956] R &amp; IT 1956 Volume 49 P251&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Denning]] said:

{{quote|The case therefore raises the important question: What is a separate hereditament for rating purposes? The statutes contain no definition, but the practice, which has prevailed for many years past, warrants the following general rules

Where two or more properties are within the same [[curtilage]] or contiguous to one another, and are in the same occupation, they are as a general rule to be treated for rating purposes as if they formed parts of a single hereditament. There are exceptional cases, however, where for some special reason they may be treated as two or more hereditaments.

Where the two properties are in the same occupation but are not within the same curtilage nor contiguous to one another, each of them must as a general rule be treated as a separate hereditament for rating purposes: and this is the case even though they are used by the occupier for the purposes of his one whole business.&lt;ref name="G v H"/&gt;}}

The principle Denning stated shows that if a business occupies a single property, that is the hereditament. If it occupies only the ground floor, that is the hereditament (and the first floor is a separate hereditament). If it occupies the neighbouring property as well, the two together are the hereditament.

''Gilbert v Hickinbottom'' featured an exception to the general rule, where there were two properties in the same occupation, separated by a public highway. It was held that the functional connection between the two properties was so great that they were to be treated as a single hereditament. Functional connection is judged by the strength of the connection and the degree and nature of the separation. In ''Edwards (VO) v. BP Refinery'' [1974],&lt;ref name="E v BP"&gt;''Edwards (VO) v BP Refinery'' [1974] RA 1&lt;/ref&gt; the analogy of a spark plug was used to illustrate the principle.&lt;ref name="Ryde C2 C-J"&gt;Ryde on Rating Division C: Rateable Property Chapter 2: The Hereditament parts C—J&lt;/ref&gt;

A hereditament can include the right to exhibit advertisements on another's property (such as a commercial [[Billboard (advertising)|advertising hoarding]]), mines, and certain sporting rights.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S64 #2"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 section 64&lt;/ref&gt; Some items of plant and machinery within a hereditament&lt;ref name="P&amp;M (E) Regs 2000"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/540 The Valuation for Rating (Plant and Machinery) (England) Regulations 2000], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-098771-3}}, ''for 2000 and 2005 rating lists in England''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P&amp;M (W) Regs 2000"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2000/1097/contents/made The Valuation for Rating (Plant and Machinery) (Wales) Regulations 2000], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-090090-1}}, ''for 2000 and 2005 rating lists in Wales''&lt;/ref&gt; are assumed to be included in the hereditament.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch6"/&gt;

=== Exemption ===

Certain properties which would otherwise be rateable are in fact exempt from rating (that is, are not entered in any rating list). These properties are specified by the Local Government Finance Act 1988,&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch 5"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Schedule 5&lt;/ref&gt; and include the following:

* Agricultural land and buildings
[[File:Portland Bill Lighthouse 2.jpg|thumb|right|280 px|[[Portland Bill]] [[Lighthouse]], owned by [[Trinity House]] and therefore exempt from non-domestic rates]]
* Fish farms
* Places of public religious worship
* Lighthouses, buoys and beacons occupied by or belonging to Trinity House
* Sewers and accessories belonging to a sewer
* Certain property of drainage authorities
* Parks
* Property used for the disabled
* Air raid protection works, provided the hereditament is not used or occupied for any other purpose
* Swinging moorings
* Roads crossing over or under watercourses
* Hereditaments in [[enterprise zone]]s
* Visiting forces premises

It is possible for only part of a property to be exempt, and the rest of it rated accordingly.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 495"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.495&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic and non-domestic ===

Domestic property is defined in the Local Government Finance Act 1988 as "used wholly for the purposes of living accommodation", with provisos to exclude hotels and short stay accommodation and include moorings and caravans where appropriate. It states that unused domestic property is to be considered domestic if it appears that will be the next use.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S66"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 559-560"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.559–560&lt;/ref&gt; Any hereditament that does not meet the criteria for domestic will be non-domestic&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S64(8)"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 64 (8)&lt;/ref&gt; (although it may then be exempt).&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 Sch 5"/&gt; It is possible for a hereditament to be both non-domestic and domestic in different parts, for example a shop with living accommodation. This is known as a composite hereditament, and the whole property is entered in the rating list, but the non-domestic valuation is based on the non-domestic part only.&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S42 4(b)"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 42 4(b)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton 533"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.533&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alterations and proposals ==

Each rating list runs for five years, and may change within that time. The value from the very start of the list can be altered, or events within the life of the list (such as an extension) can be reflected by changes within the list, leading to different values at different times. For example, a property is entered in a rating list at 1 April 2005 with a rateable value of £10,000, and a year later the property is extended causing an increase to £12,000 from 1 April 2006; the original entry of £10,000 remains unchanged for the first year. A successful proposal could alter this original value of £10,000 to £9,000 from 1 April 2005 to 31 March 2006, but the second entry from 1 April 2006 would remain unchanged at £12,000.

The Local Government Finance Act 1988 gives broad authorisation for regulations to be made about alterations,&lt;ref name="LGFA 1988 S55"&gt;Local Government Finance Act 1988 Section 55&lt;/ref&gt; which can include alterations by the [[Valuation Office Agency]] to maintain the list accurately, or proposals by interested parties to change the list.&lt;ref name="Hamilton 570"&gt;Hamilton et al. p.570&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations have differed widely, changing the time-frame of when alterations are effective. For example, proposals to alter the 2000 rating list by an occupier were restricted to take effect in the financial year in which they were made,&lt;ref name="NDR (ALA) (A) (E) Regs 2000"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/598/contents/made The Non-Domestic Rating (Alteration of Lists and Appeals) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2000], HMSO&lt;/ref&gt; but the 2005 rating list removed this restriction, so that a successful proposal can have effect as far back as 1 April 2005.&lt;ref name="NDR (ALA) (A) (E) Regs 2005"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/659 The Non-Domestic Rating (Alteration of Lists and Appeals) (England) Regulations 2005], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-072629-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is commonly known as an appeal is more correctly known as a proposal to alter the rating list. Proposals can be made on a number of grounds, including challenging the basic rateable value, an alteration to the property, or proposing a reduction from a specific date due to a particular event (such as changes to a street affecting traffic).&lt;ref name="Hamilton 573-574"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.573–574&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="appeal regs"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1993/291 The Non-Domestic Rating (Alteration of Lists and Appeals) Regulations 1993], HMSO, {{ISBN|0-11-033291-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an appeal is made, it will first be discussed with the Valuation Office Agency, who will attempt to come to an agreement. If no agreement is reached, and the proposal is not withdrawn, it will be heard by an independent [[valuation tribunal]].&lt;ref name="Appeal proc"&gt;Hamilton et al. pp.577–581&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''corner office''' is an [[office]] that is located in the corner of a building. Corner offices are considered desirable because they have windows on two exterior walls, as opposed to a typical office with only one window or none at all (windowless offices occupying a corner of a building are therefore not typically considered “corner offices”). 

As corner offices are often given to the most senior executives, the term primarily refers to [[Corporate_title#Senior_management|top management positions or the "C-Suite"]], such as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office setup and construction|url=http://www.officefitoutquote.com.au/about-office-fitout-quotes/|publisher=Office Quotes|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chief operating officer]] (COO), or [[chief financial officer]] (CFO). In organizations which do not use this corporate hierarchy, such as law firms and political parties, the corner office generally refers to the most senior partners or officials who are involved with [[corporate governance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8100">'''Customer delight''' is surprising a [[customer]] by exceeding his or her expectations and thus creating a positive emotional reaction. This emotional reaction leads to [[word of mouth]]. Customer delight directly affects [[sales]] and [[profitability]] of a company as it helps to distinguish the company and its products and services from the [[competition (economics)|competition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Scott|title=Positively Outrageous Service. How to delight and astound your customers and win them for life|year=2004|publisher=Dear Born Trade Publishing|location=USA|isbn=978-0-7931-8823-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seth|first=Rakesh Seth, Kirti|title=Creating customer delight : the how and why of CRM|year=2005|publisher=Response Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=9780761932963|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the past [[customer satisfaction]] has been seen as a [[key performance indicator]]. Customer satisfaction measures the extent to which the expectations of a customer are met (compared to expectations being exceeded). However, it has been discovered that mere customer satisfaction does not create [[brand loyalty]] nor does it encourage positive word of mouth.

Customer delight can be created by the product itself, by accompanied standard services and by interaction with people at the front line. The interaction is the greatest source of opportunities to create delight as it can be personalized and tailored to the specific needs and wishes of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlzon|first=Jan; [foreword by Tom Peters]|title=Moments of truth|year=1989|publisher=Perennial Library|location=New York|isbn=0060915803|page=2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During contacts with [[touch point]]s in the company, more than just [[customer service]] can be delivered. The person at the front line can surprise by showing a sincere personal interest in the customer, offer small attentions that might please or find a solution specific to particular needs. Those front-line employees are able to develop a relationship between the customer and the brand. Elements in creating [[work motivation|motivated]] staff are: recruiting the right people, motivating them continuously and leading them in a clear way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hsieh|first=Tony|title=Delivering happiness : a path to profits, passion, and purpose|year=2010|publisher=Business Plus|location=New York|isbn=9780446563048|pages=144, 145|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelli|first=Joseph|title=The Zappos experience : 5 principles to inspire, engage, and wow|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071749589|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose of customer delight==
There are three objectives when implementing Customer Delight:
# make [[customer loyalty|customers loyal]]. As described by Sewell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Customers-Life-One-Time-Lifetime-Customer/dp/0385504454 |title=Customers for Life: How to Turn That One-Time Buyer Into a Lifetime Customer: Carl Sewell, Paul B. Brown: 9780385504454: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2002-11-19 |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that finding new customers costs 4 to 9 times more time and money than reselling to an existing client. It is thus commercially intelligent to retain as many clients as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sewell|first=Carl|title=Customers for life : how to turn that onetime buyer into a lifetime customer|year=2002|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York|isbn=9780385504454|page=13|edition=Rev.|author2=Brown, Paul B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# have customers that are more profitable. Average delighted customers spend more with less hassle. As can be seen with the list of Van Setten,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementboek.nl/boek/9789047004004/de-klantenfluisteraar-jan-van-setten |title=De klantenfluisteraar door J. (Jan) van Setten (Boek) |publisher=Managementboek.nl |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; when all other elements are correct, clients accord less importance to price (as long as their perception of price remains reasonable).  
# have clients talk positively about your product, brand or shop, the so-called word of mouth. In a world of informed customers, 92% of customers consider word of mouth as the most reliable source of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/press-room/2012/nielsen-global-consumers-trust-in-earned-advertising-grows.html |title=Global Consumers' Trust in 'Earned' Advertising Grows in Importance |publisher=Nielsen |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delighted clients can be a valuable source of [[advertisement]] for a company.  
The effect of achieving those objectives, according to Reichheld&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netpromotersystem.com/speaking-engagements/fred-reichheld.aspx |title=Bain &amp; Company: Net Promoter System℠ - Fred Reichheld |publisher=Netpromotersystem.com |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as described in The Ultimate Question 2.0,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netpromotersystem.com/book/index.aspx |title=Bain &amp; Company: NET PROMOTER SYSTEM℠ - About The Ultimate Question 2.0 |publisher=Netpromotersystem.com |accessdate=2013-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; only 9% of the world’s major firms achieve real sustainable profit and [[sustainable growth|growth]] over 10- year period from 1999 to 2009. Customer Delight is the only kind of growth that can be sustained over the long term according to Reichheld and Markey. The authors mention that their company [[Bain &amp; Company]] have researched and concluded that a 5% increase in [[customer retention]] could yield anywhere between 25% to 100% increase in profits. The book explains the [[net promoter score|Net Promoter Score]]; a system which measures what customers are feeling and thus creating accountability for the customer experience.

In order to consistently deliver Customer Delight at all customer touch points throughout the company, a [[customer-centric]] [[corporate culture]] is key. With this corporate culture all processes, systems, people and leadership are aligned: everyone in the organization shares the same set of values, attitudes and practices. Developing the culture is a continuous exercise of innovation and improvement, involving every employee of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|title=The Apple experience : the secrets of delivering insanely great customer service|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0071793209|page=25|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Kaufman {{cite book |title=Uplifting service : the proven path to delighting your customers, colleagues, and everyone else you meet|year=2012|publisher=Evolve Publishing|location=[New York, NY]|isbn=978-0984762507|pages=22, 23, 24, 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; An absolutely necessary step is linking Customer Delight behaviour to the core values of the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Michelli|first=Joseph|title=The Zappos experience : 5 principles to inspire, engage, and wow|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071749589|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Core values are operating principles that guide an organization’s internal conduct as well as its relationship with customers, partners and shareholders. Once core values are clearly outlined it is critical to incorporate them into every process, from [[Recruitment|hiring]], to [[employee appraisal]]s and [[decision making]].

==Background==
Banatao was born on May 26, 1946 in Malabbac, [[Iguig, Cagayan]], [[Philippines]]. His father, Salvador Banatao, was a rice farmer. His mother, Rosita Banatao, was a housekeeper.&lt;ref name="Millionaire"/&gt;

Banatao is known for his [[rags to riches]] story. During his childhood, he walked barefoot on a dirt road just to reach Malabbac Elementary School. He pursued his secondary education at the Jesuit-run [[Ateneo de Tuguegarao]]. After high school, he pursued his [[Bachelor of Engineering|Bachelor of Science in Electric Engineering]] from the [[Mapúa Institute of Technology]] and graduated cum laude.&lt;ref name="PhilStar 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=813310&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=86 | title=Where in the world is Dado Banatao? | publisher=''[[The Philippine Star]]'' | work=10 Things You Should Know About... | date=June 3, 2012 | accessdate=September 14, 2012 | author=Gonzalez, Bianca | author-link=Bianca Gonzalez}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asia Journal 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asianjournal.com/dateline-usa/15-dateline-usa/3066-diosdado-dado-banatao-the-filipino-bill-gates-comes-to-la-for-ayala-foundation-usas-business-seminar.html?showall=1 | title=DIOSDADO ‘DADO’ BANATAO: ‘The Filipino Bill Gates’ comes to LA for Ayala Foundation USA’s business seminar | publisher=''Asian Journal'' | date=September 27, 2009 | accessdate=September 14, 2012 | author=de Castro, Cynthia | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After college, he turned down several job offers, including one from [[Meralco]]. He joined [[Philippine Airlines]] as a trainee pilot, and was later pirated by [[Boeing]]. At Boeing, he worked as a [[design engineer]] for the company's new commercial [[airliner]] and cargo transport aircraft, [[Boeing 747]], in the [[United States]]. With the opportunity to stay in the United States, he then took his [[Master of Engineering|Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science]] at [[Stanford University]] and finished in 1972.&lt;ref name="Millionaire"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABS 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/04/30/12/banatao-culture-science-filipinos-can-compete-globally | title=Banatao: With culture of science, Filipinos can compete globally | publisher=''[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News]]'' | date=April 30, 2012 | accessdate=September 14, 2012 | author=Howard, Caroline J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banatao also joined the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], where he met [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianjournal.com/lifestyle/diosdado-dado-banataos-odyssey-from-cagayan-valley-to-silicon-valley/|title=Diosdado ‘Dado’ Banatao’s odyssey from Cagayan Valley to Silicon Valley — Asian Journal News|author=|date=|website=asianjournal.com|accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing his master's degree, Banatao worked with different technology companies such as the [[National Semiconductor]], [[Intersil]], and [[Commodore International]] where he designed the first single chip, 16-bit microprocessor-based calculator.&lt;ref name="Millionaire"/&gt; In 1981, he developed the first 10-Mbit [[Ethernet]] CMOS with silicon coupler data-link control and transreceiver chip while working in [[Seeq Technology]]. He was also credited for the first [[Microprocessor Report|system logic chip set]] for [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC-XT]] and the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC-AT]]; the local bus concept and the first [[Microsoft Direct3D|Windows Graphics]] [[Graphics processing unit|accelerator chip]] for [[personal computers]].&lt;ref name="INQ Global 1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/35239/investing-in-ph-engineering-talent | title=Investing in PH engineering talent | publisher=''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]'' | date=April 29, 2012 | accessdate=October 14, 2012 | author=Villacorta, Carissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Business===
In 1984, Banatao and his business partner Francis Siu, founded a high-technology company, Mostron, starting with a capital of half a million US dollars. Mostron was launched as a manufacturer of motherboards. They also hired Ron Yara of [[Intel]] as a company executive. After he developed a five-chip set, he co-founded [[Chips and Technologies]] in 1985. The company developed [[Microprocessor Report|system logic chip set]] for [[IBM]]'s [[IBM Personal Computer XT|PC-XT]] and the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|PC-AT]].  The company earned $12 million in its first four months. After 22 months, the company went public. In 1989, Banatao launched his third start-up company, [[S3 Graphics]], with Yara in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]], [[California]]. S3 focused on enhancing the graphic capabilities in personal computers by using a graphic accelerator chip. The key to this was, Banatao's invention of a local bus. The company had an initial public offering of $30 million. In 1996, the company became the leader of the graphic-chips market, beating a strong competitor, [[Cirrus Logic|Cirrus Logic, Inc.]]. In the same year, Chips &amp; Technologies was sold to [[Intel]] for about $300 million.&lt;ref name="Outstanding"/&gt; In 2000, he decided to start-up his own venture capital firm named ''Tallwood Venture Capital'' with a capital of US$300 million, all of which came from his own pocket. He later sold another company for more than $1 billion, where it had less than 20 employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phildev.org/wp/2012/05/17/phildev-chairman-dado-banatao-talks-to-rappler-com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324014921/http://phildev.org/wp/2012/05/17/phildev-chairman-dado-banatao-talks-to-rappler-com/ |archivedate=2014-03-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dado was also part of [[SiRF]], where it started the consumerization of GPS after it had been declassified by the US Government.

'''Daedeok Innopolis''', formerly known as '''Daedeok Science Town''', is the research and development district in the [[Yuseong-gu]] district in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]]. Daedeok Innopolis grew out of the research cluster established by President [[Park Chunghee]] in 1973 with the opening of the [[KAIST]]. Over 20 major research institutes and over 40 corporate research centers make up this science cluster. Over the last few years, a number of IT venture companies have sprung up in this region, which has a high concentration of Ph.Ds in the applied sciences. There are 232 research and educational institutions to be found in Daejeon, many in the Daedeok region, among them the [[Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute]] and the [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |title=Daedeok Science Town  |accessdate=2007-02-21  |publisher=Daejeon Metropolitan City  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118140735/http://www.metro.daejeon.kr/english/investdaejeon/daedeokvalley/daedeoksciencetown.jsp  |archivedate=2006-11-18  |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "town" will provide a core for the [[International Science and Business Belt]].

The Daedeok Innopolis logo was created by the industrial design company INNO Design in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], USA.

A '''delivery order''' (abbreviated '''D/O'''&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;"小提單[http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861605663/D_O.html D/O Definition]," MSN Encarta World English Dictionary [North American Edition]. 2007. Microsoft Corporation. Accessed 5 July 2007. [https://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257023347978550 Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a document from a [[Shipment|consignee]], or an owner or his agent of [[freight carrier]] which orders the release of the transportation of cargo to another party.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, Mark. "Definition of Delivery Order." Teachmefinance.Com. 2005. markmccracken.com. Accessed 5 July 2007 (http://www.teachmefinance.com/Financial_Terms/delivery_order.html).&lt;/ref&gt;
Usually the written order permits the direct delivery of goods to a [[warehouseman]], [[Common carrier|carrier]] or other person who in the course of their ordinary business issues [[warehouse receipt]]s or [[Bill of lading|bills of lading]].&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;Dalton, Clark. "Uniform Law Conference of Canada - Proceedings of Annual Meetings." Uniform Law Conference of Canada. Aug. 1995. Uniform Law Conference of Canada. Accessed 5 July 2007 (http://www.ulcc.ca/en/poam2/index.cfm?sec=1995⊂=1995af).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC)&lt;ref&gt;"U.C.C. Article 7 - Warehouse Receipts, Bills of Lading and Other Documents of Title." Cornell University Law School. 2005. The American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. Accessed 5 July 2007 (https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/7/7-102.html#Bailee_7-102).&lt;/ref&gt; a delivery order refers to an "order given by an owner of goods to a person in possession of them (the carrier or warehouseman) directing that person to deliver the goods to a person named in the order."&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt; 

A delivery order which is used for the import of cargo should not to be confused with [[delivery instruction]]s. Delivery Instructions provides "specific information to the inland carrier concerning the arrangement made by the forwarder to deliver the merchandise to the particular pier or steamship line."&lt;ref name="USDOC"&gt;"Comprehensive Guide to International Trade Terms (Complete Text)." National Trade Data Bank's Guide to International Trade Terms. 1 September 1995. USDOC, OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION - International Government. Accessed 6 July 2007 (http://www.ntia.doc.gov/lexcon.txt).&lt;/ref&gt; 

:"A delivery order was not regarded as a document of title at common law with the result that the transfer of the delivery order did not effect transfer of constructive possession of the goods. Attornment on the part of the bailee was required (i.e., an acknowledgement that the bailee held the goods on behalf of the transferee). The Uniform Documents of Title Act permits the use of negotiable delivery orders (if the order directs delivery to a named person or order). However, it is still necessary to single out delivery orders for special treatment. Until the delivery order is accepted by the bailee, there is no basi for imposing obligations on the bailee. See discussion under sections 18 and 19 . See also the definition of "issuer"."&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt;

It is administered by the Overseas Investment Commission and the Ministry of Fisheries. The Act mostly deals with the minimum size requirements and maximum quantity limit for each species of fish and seafood before they can be caught for selling or consumption.

There are regular prosecutions under the act for the taking of [[Paua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10846198 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10827660 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10766827 ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism''' 

Many critics note that Brain Bar, not unlike Design Terminal is mostly using public money ([https://444.hu/2015/08/19/alig-volt-ember-aki-jegyet-vett-az-allami-inspiracios-fesztivalra 100 million HUF in 2015] ) for a festival that attracts very few people outside of the organizers' circles (in the same year, 2015 only 143 tickets were actually sold). The money is mostly spent on star performers who, even unwittingly legitimate officials of the Hungarian right-wing government like the unorthodox president of the Hungarian national Bank, Gyorgy Matolcsy. 

==Awards==
In 2014, the Hungarian edition of [[Forbes]] named Böszörményi-Nagy in its '30 under 30' list of successful young leaders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forbes.hu/esemenyek/forbes-flow/30-30-csucstalalkozo |title=Forbes Flow - 30/30 csúcstalálkozó - Forbes Magyarország |website=Forbes.hu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google]], the ''[[Financial Times]]'' and the [[International Visegrad Fund]] named Böszörményi-Nagy among the 'New Europe 100', a list of Central Europe's key figures in the digital economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=hvg.hu |url=http://hvg.hu/kkv/20141002_Ok_a_magyar_innovacio_moguljai |title=Vállalkozás: Ők a magyar innováció moguljai |website=HVG.hu |date= |accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinrich Theodor Höch''' was a German businessman.

Höch grew up in [[Ludwigshafen]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], where his father [[Gottfried Höch]] was the [[Éminence grise]] in the founding of the community of Ludwigshafen. In 1864, at the age of 19, he began his first venture, which was to export "Palatine tobacco" to the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States of America]]  during the [[American Civil War]]. The end of the war led to his first bankruptcy, but he continued in trading with goods and acted as a broker. 

He entered the rail industry in the 1860s, participating as a co-accordant in the construction of the [[Munich–Rosenheim railway]] line. The fast-growing railway network had doubled in size in Bavaria, and led to an expansion of the local networks. Höch's businesses were successful in this era. In 1866, he moved to [[Munich]], where he dedicated himself to general trade and finance, from [[suspenders]] and walking sticks to investments in the real estate business.
== Realising the grid plan in Maxvorstadt==
*Höch's projects show an integral understanding of the needs of urban housing and that he partly managed to maintain the projects till their [[Break-even (economics)]].
*[[Hippodamus of Miletus]] recommended the [[Grid plan]].
*During a study trip through the Netherlands, [[Frederick IV, Elector Palatine]] got to know the progress of Dutch fortification architecture; he decided on the plans of an engineer celebrity, Johann von Rijswijk for Friedrichsburg ([[Mannheim]])
*From {{dts|1606|06|18}} to 1610 the Dutch hydraulic engineer, Bartholomäus Janson realized the Grid plan in Mannheim.
*With [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria]], the Bavarian line of Wittelsbacher died in 1777. It followed with [[Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria]] the line Pfalz-Sulzbach, which already ruled over the Electoral Palatinate. After the death of Karl Theodor in 1799, the Dukes of Zweibrücken obtained the title of Elector.
*In 1810 an architect, also born in Mannheim, [[Karl von Fischer]] designed a [[Grid plan]] as structure for the [[Maxvorstadt]].
*After the {{Ill|Erste Allgemeine Deutsche Industrieausstellung|de}} and the [[Cholera]] of 1854 this new part of Munich was built with [[storm drains]] in every street.
*As a land owner, Heinrich Theodor Höch could not compete with the Breweries and the [[Catholic Church]] in Munich in this [[Monopoly (game)]]. To convince investors in his projects he gave attention to [[Public relations]]. 
*In 1886 [[Schwabing]] got city rights and on 20 November 1890 it was incorporated to Munich. In the meantime it was a [[Boomtown]] compared with [[Munich]]. On {{dts|1889|02|26}} Schwabing got electric street lighting, while in Munich gas lanterns still glowed, since then its common [[Marketing]] to sell residences in [[Maxvorstadt]] as Quasi-Schwabing.
*Over the years, Höch had built entire streets. He was particularly involved in the emergence of the artists' quarter in the [[Maxvorstadt|new Schwabing]], which could not be wrongly called a Schwabing Höchs, and large sections of the extensive, west of it located between Schwabingerlandstraße (today's [[Leopoldstraße]]) and [[Schleißheimer Straße (Munich)]].
*As the center of the artistic condominium he donated the space for the construction of the new {{Ill|St. Ursula (München)|de}}, built by {{Ill|August Thiersch|de}} between 1894 and 1897.
*After the [[Panic of 1873]], at the end of the seventies Höch started his first big venture. He built the entire Heßstraße, where he lived at this time in No. 46. Without his fault, he came here in great distress. A neighboring house collapsed, causing the entire area to be discredited for five to six years as a neighborhood of dodgy buildings. At the foreclosure sale of about 40 properties, Höch's debts amounted to more than one million. He went bankrupt.&lt;ref&gt;On {{dts|1938|01|18}} [[Hans Beilhack]] dedicated an article to Höch in the ''Münchner Zeitung'' with the [[Headline]]: The man who changed the face of Munich. On 22 May 1938 [[Adolf Hitler]] did the first cut of the spade for a tunnel that forty years later became the [[Goetheplatz (Munich U-Bahn)]] as the first step of the [[Bombing of Munich in World War II|Gesamtbauplan für die Hauptstadt der Bewegung]]. Beilhack, already banned from writing, showed the narrow degree between visionary investor and impostor.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Dairy farm==
In 1875, Höch had the idea of opening a dairy farm in the Heßstraße, which was still undeveloped at the time. For that dairy farm, he bought the first four of twenty cows. There was also produced [[Pasteurization|child milk]], a novelty found by [[Franz von Soxhlet]]. In 1877, Höch acquired the right of home and [[Citizenship]] in Munich for 171 marks, the German currency used in that time, which equals around $2000 nowadays.

==Volksgarten Nymphenburg==
In 1890, he founded and financed the {{Ill|Volksgarten Nymphenburg|de}} with {{Ill|Hugo Oertel|de}}.

==Project Tuberculosis spa cure==
Already in 1891, a side from playing [[Hide-and-seek]] with his [[Creditor]]s he dedicated to the theme of [[Tuberculosis]], Höch pursued a new plan with the acquisition of Palais Gumpenberg on Ottostraße 6. Here, according to his will, a spa cure for pulmonary patients should arise, which should be helped by using the healing serum developed by [[Robert Koch]]. However, since the idea failed because of the resistance of the residents, in 1892 it became the "Hotel Continental", where [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] later descended during his stays in Munich.

==Project Septic drain fields in Großlappen== 
With an astonishing foresight, in the north of Munich at Großlappen, Höch planned the planting of [[Septic drain field]]s, for which he had already secured reasons.

==Investments==
Höch acquired extensive land in parts of Munich like [[Nymphenburg]], Obersendling and Menzing. He had a copper mine in the Rhön arise and even acquired plantations overseas. He also funded balloon projects, founded magazines and a shoe factory.

== Project Industrial district Freimann==
Höch tried to establish an industrial district in Freimann. Following the pattern of [[Heilmann &amp; Littmann]]'s Industrieviertel on the [[Sendling]]er Oberfeld, he planned the construction of an industrial district, which was to develop in northern Schwabing in the direction of {{ill|Freimann, Munich|lt=Freimann|de|Freimann}}. For this he had already acquired 1000 {{Ill|Tagewerk|de}} reason. But again, the tide should turn. Opposed authorities but also practices of bad business colleagues and his own plans, which did not keep pace with reality, ruined him again. At this point in time, half pages with the [[Court auction]] announcements often appeared in announcements of {{Ill|Münchner Neueste Nachrichten|de}}.

==Third and last bankruptcy==
Finally, in 1904, Höch's empire broke, which greatly boosted the city's economy. It was Höch's third and last bankruptcy, and at the same time the largest bankruptcy in Munich, when it came to 428 appointments in front of the Chamber of Commerce.

Höch was summoned by a creditor consortium for declaring the state of being bankrupt. He had to confess that he was in need of a spinal cord condition and that he had been unable to give exhaustive information about his entire estate, which was also accepted as credible.

The last photographic portrait shows a man already affected by the illness, whose eyes look tired and inward.Heinrich Theodor Höch, at that time Munich's most daring entrepreneur in terms of construction and land speculation, died as a bachelor a year after the third economic collapse on April 8, 1905 in his last apartment on Franz Josef Straße 27. &lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard J.

'''Hot melt coating''' is the application of a layer to a substrate by pre-melting the desired material and then allowing or forcing the material to cool, solidifying the layer.  The process is widely used in industry, particularly for [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s on thin substrates- self-adhesive [[label]]s.

==Introduction==
[[Coating]] is the application of a layer to a substrate.  In general, in order for a thin uniform layer to be applied, the application must be done at low or moderate viscosities.  In many cases this low viscosity is achieved by dissolving or dispersing the desired coating in a liquid such as water or a solvent, but this then necessitates the subsequent removal of the liquid by, for instance, a drying process. 
Hot-melt coating achieves this low to moderate viscosity by melting the desired material before applying it to the substrate.    The substrate and coated layer are then cooled, generally by passing over a chilled roller.   There is no liquid to remove, so the process is, in principle, much faster than water- or solvent-based equivalents.

==Terminology &amp; use==
The process has been used so extensively for the application of adhesive layers by slot-die coating that the use of the term ‘hot melt’ often implies slot-die coating, but hot melt methods have also been used for other coating processes, such as metering rod or roller coating.

==Transfer coating==
If the desired substrate is too temperature-sensitive to allow direct hot-melt coating, the product may be made by coating a transfer belt which is then brought into contact with the substrate after cooling: if the relative adhesion is correct then the coating will transfer to the new substrate from the transfer belt.

'''International Business Wales''' (IBW) is a development agency of the [[Welsh Government]] set up with the remit of delivering support to help companies establish themselves in [[Wales]]. Once established in the country, companies are allocated a Relationship Manager with the skills to help grow the business and are offered a relocation service that helps their executives settle there.

==IBW Structure==
IBW provide the trade and investment arm of the Welsh Government. Established in 2006, it brought together the responsibilities of the former [[Welsh Development Agency]] and Wales Trade International.

Sitting under the [https://web.archive.org/web/20060514103255/http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/departments/dein/?lang=en Department for the Economy and Transport (DE&amp;T)] IBW is tasked with developing international trade, and attracting [[inward investment]], relocation and international collaboration.

==Track record==
IBW claims it has an impressive track record with Wales being one of Europe’s most successful investment locations.  With a population of 2.9 million and a workforce of 1.3 million, Wales has attracted over £16.8 billion of capital investment and over 282,000 jobs have been created or safeguarded through inward investment (between 1983 and  March 2008).

Over 500 international companies are located in the country including many of the world’s largest multinationals such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] and [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]].

==Area covered==
IBW offer support to companies looking at Wales as a business destination for expansion/relocation as well as supporting the companies located in the country with their international trade requirements.
*Inward Investment - project management support to advise companies on all aspects of relocation from grants and skilled workforce availability through to property searches and a relocation service for business people under the “Welcome to Wales” programme.
*International Trade - services for both native Welsh companies and international business looking for a trade partner in Wales, with support from advisors. IBW provide support tailored to company import and export needs.

==Criticism==
In July 2009, using information obtained from a Freedom of Information request to the Welsh government, the [[Welsh Liberal Democrats]] criticised International Business Wales officials for running up a bill of £750,000, on 35 different corporate credit card accounts for the year June 2008 to end of May 2009, at the tax-payers expense. Liberal Democrat leader [[Kirsty Williams]] AM said: 
:"In the middle of a recession it's disgusting to know that public officials are flying first class, staying in the most expensive hotels, eating in the best restaurants - all at the swipe of the Welsh credit card."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/wales_politics/8148458.stm BBC Wales News: "Civil servants' £750k cards bill" 13.07.09]&lt;/ref&gt;

First Minister [[Rhodri Morgan]] at first refuted the allegation. He later publicly apologised in a letter to Kirsty Williams and said that he had been misled by IBW officials, whom he had believed at the time: 
:"I stated, on the clear and explicit advice from the relevant senior officials that no officials from IBW (International Business Wales) had flown first class. Today I have learned that this is not the case. I apologise for having misled you and the wider public."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;BBC Wales: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/betsanpowys/2009/07/im_sorry.html Letter from First Minister Rhodri Morgan to Kirsty Williams AM], 15 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He added that he was setting up an investigation and independent review:
:"I need hardly say how disturbed I am by this latest information now to hand. I am instructing the Permanent Secretary to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation and audit of IBW's expenditure and audit systems. This review will be led from outside the Assembly Government."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt;

==Support==
Following the July 2009 press coverage a group of Welsh exporters have shown their support for International Business Wales, calling on politicians to "stop playing politics" with the organisation.
Malcolm Duncan, Managing Director of Blaenavon-based Super Rod, who heads up the support group said: 
:"I understand the need for the public to be kept informed about the activities of any Government department. But what does worry me is when politicians start to play politics with these departments, that could ultimately have a detrimental effect on both business and our economy as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business-in-wales/business-news/2009/08/15/exporters-reject-attack-on-ibw-91466-24446015/  Wales Online: "Exporters reject attack on IBW" 15.08.09]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Economic Renewal: a new direction"==
On Monday 5 July 2010 the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] announced plans to transform the way it supports businesses and the Welsh economy. "Economic Renewal: a new direction" is a vision to make Wales "one of the best places in the world to live, to work and to thrive". 

As part of the transformation, functions previously supported by International Business Wales, Trade and Inward investment, can be accessed directly through the Welsh Government; or by [http://www.ibwales.com visiting the Trade and Inward investment website] or calling (+44) 1443 845500.

'''John D. Chandris''' (1890 – 1942) was a [[Greece|Greek]] shipowner.

Chandris was born in [[Chios]], then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1915, after years of experience in the shipping industry, he bought his first ship, the S/S ''Dimitrios''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Cruise Industry Pioneers|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/features/6-cruise-industry-pioneers.html|website=Travel Pulse|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By [[World War I]], Chandris' fleet was made up of four ships, including [[steamship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=6 Cruise Industry Pioneers|url=http://www.travelpulse.com/news/features/6-cruise-industry-pioneers.html|website=Travel Pulse|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he expanded into the passenger shipping market.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], Chandris followed the exodus of shipowners from Greece. He moved to England. Chandris ran the cruise lines until he retired in 1939. He died in 1942  at the age 52 from natural causes.

His two sons, [[Anthony J. Chandris|Anthony]] and [[Dimitri Chandris|Dimitri]], later rebuilt the company, named [[Chandris Line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Shipping Hall of Fame: ANTHONY J. CHANDRIS (1924-1984)|url=http://greekshippinghalloffame.org/chandris.html|website=greekshippinghalloffame.org|accessdate=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership called Chandris-Fantasy Cruises started in the early 1980s and later was divided into two separate arms, Fantasy-Cruises and Celebrity cruises.

'''Sir Leonard "Len" Blavatnik''' ({{lang-ua|Леонід Валентинович Блаватнік}}, {{lang-ru|Леонид Валентинович Блаватник}}, ''Leonid Valentinovich Blavatnik''; born June 14, 1957) is a Soviet-born British-American businessman, investor, and philanthropist. He made his fortune through business via diversified investments in myriad companies through his conglomerate company, [[Access Industries]].

As of January 2018, Blavatnik was the wealthiest man in the [[United Kingdom]], and the 50th wealthiest in the world, with a net worth of US$21.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Music boss Len Blavatnik named as Britain's richest man|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-32464402|publisher=BBC News | date=April 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Blavatnik received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] for services to philanthropy.

==Early life and education==
Blavatnik was born in [[Odessa]], [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]], to a [[Jewish]] family.&lt;ref name=HaaretzMaariv&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/russian-born-u-s-billionaire-offers-to-buy-ma-ariv-1.249288 "Russian-born U.S. billionaire offers to buy Ma'ariv"], haaretz.com; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishFeatures/Article.aspx?id=187418 "The world's 50 Richest Jews: 11-20: Len Blavatnik"], jpost.com, September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Moscow State University of Railway Engineering]], but did not complete his coursework due to the family's request for emigration visas. His family emigrated from the [[Soviet Union]] to the United States in 1978, and he received a masters in computer science from [[Columbia University]] and an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Harvard Business School]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/05/05/warner-music-suitors-record-of-deal-making/?nl=business&amp;emc=dlbkpma1 "Warner Music Suitor’s Record of Deal-Making"]. Ben Protess. ''DealBook''. May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HaaretzMaariv/&gt;

==Career==
In 1986, Blavatnik founded Access Industries, an international conglomerate company located in New York, of which he is chairman and president.  Access has long-term holdings in Europe and North and South America. Initially, he moved into Russian investments, just after the fall of communism. He and a friend from university, [[Viktor Vekselberg]], formed the Renova investment vehicle, and then the two joined with [[Mikhail Fridman]]'s [[Alfa Group]] to form the AAR venture.&lt;ref name="Yenikeyeff"&gt;Yenikeyeff, Shamil, [http://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/BP-Russian-billionaires-and-the-Kremlin.pdf "BP, Russian billionaires, and the Kremlin: a Power Triangle that never was"], ''Oxford Energy Comment'', November 23, 2011; retrieved March 3, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Access has since diversified its portfolio to include investments in industries such as oil, entertainment, coal, aluminum, petrochemicals and plastics, telecommunications, media, and real estate. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Petrochemicals and oil===
In August 2005, [[Access Industries]] bought petrochemicals and plastics manufacturer [[Basell Polyolefins]] from [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[BASF]] for $5.7 billion. On December 20, 2007, Basell completed its acquisition of the [[Lyondell Chemical Company]] for an enterprise value of approximately $19 billion. The resulting company, [[LyondellBasell]] Industries then became the world's eighth largest chemical company based on net sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i30/CENs-Global-Top-50-Chemical.html|title=C&amp;EN’s Global Top 50 Chemical Firms For 2014|publisher=[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]]|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, 2009, the U.S. operations of LyondellBasell Industries filed for bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/02/business/02chemical.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=blavatnik&amp;st=cse LyondellBasell May Seek Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection], nytimes.com; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 30, 2010, LyondellBasell emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a significantly improved financial position. As part of its exit financing, LyondellBasell raised $3.25 billion of first priority debt as well as $2.8 billion through the rights offering jointly underwritten by Access Industries, [[Apollo Management]], and [[Ares Management]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3018504120100430 LyondellBasell profile]; accessed February 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; LyondellBasell stock has increased 103% in value since April 2010. Access currently owns approximately 14% of LyondellBasell.

AAR gained a controlling stake in Russian oil company TNK through [[privatization]] auctions, then in 2003 sold a 50% stake to [[British Petroleum]] to form [[TNK-BP]], one of Russia's largest oil companies, where Blavatnik served on the board of directors. On March 21, 2013, Rosneft completed its $55 billion acquisition of TNK-BP. Blavatnik also has interests in [[UC Rusal]], the world's largest aluminum producer, where he sits on the board. On May 6, 2011, Warner Music Group announced its sale to Access for US$3.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, David B., [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/warner-music-to-be-sold-in-33-billion-cash-deal-2011-05-06 "Warner Music to be sold in $3.3 billion cash deal"], ''[[MarketWatch]]'', May 6, 2011; retrieved 2011-05-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lorenzo Sanz Mancebo''' (born 9 August 1943 in [[Madrid]]) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[businessman]], former president of [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid Club de Fútbol]] and former owner of [[Málaga CF|Málaga Club de Fútbol]], where his son [[Fernando Sanz|Fernando]] (a former player with Real Madrid and Málaga) served as the club's president.

== Early life ==
In his youth, Sanz played as a goalkeeper for several minor league Madrilenian teams, including [[Puerta Bonita]]. An astute businessman, he made his fortune in real estate and construction.

== Real Madrid President ==
Sanz was director of Real Madrid from 1985 to 1995. He became chairman of Real Madrid on 26 November 1995 after [[Ramón Mendoza]] was forced to resign due to the economic, social, and sporting problems of the club. Sanz tried to turn the club around by bringing in star players like [[Davor Šuker]] and [[Predrag Mijatović]] with his own money. This led to a long-awaited [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory, which Real Madrid had not won since 1966, as the club clinched both the 1998 and 2000 tournaments, now named the UEFA Champions League.

However, the two UEFA Champions League triumphs were not enough to hide the financial problems that still plagued the club and in elections a few weeks after the 2000 final, he lost the presidency to [[Florentino Pérez]].

== Negotiations with Parma ==
Between June 2005 and January 2006, Sanz was negotiating with [[Parma F.C.|Parma Football Club]] in ''Amministrazione Straordinaria'' to become the club's new owner. Guido Angiolini and Enrico Bondi, the two officers appointed by the Italian government to restore Parma, and its main sponsor [[Parmalat]], were the two persons involved in the operations with Sanz. The first time Parma announced negotiations with Sanz was in August 2005. Both President Guido Angiolini and government-appointed administrator Enrico Bondi asked for €27.5 million, but the negotiations were not as smooth as some predicted.  

Until January 2006, the Sanz family was still transacting business with Bondi and Angiolini, but to no avail. In an interview with ''[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' in January 2006, President Angiolini stated that, "If, by the 16th, the deal with the Sanz family has not been closed, we will set about finding a new buyer." Sanz has seemed the most likely buyer of the club since last August when he made an initial payment of €7.5 million ($9.07 million) on the full price of €27.5 million. However, he has not yet paid the outstanding €20 million. Parma administrators stated that after 16 January 2006, the club is free to find other interested buyers as the contract with Sanz expired on 15 January 2006. Other interested buyers include the owner of Spain's Alamak Espana Trade, [[Russian oligarch]] Abram Reznikov. The uncertainty over the club's future has become a source of increasing frustration for Parma supporters. The deal with Sanz was a big dilemma for Parma supporters. In some papers, this deal was referred to as "The never ending story." Parma supporters were longing for a positive ending. Sanz visited Parma a couple of times, and he even turned up at the [[Stadio Ennio Tardini]] to follow some of Parma's matches in [[Serie A]].  Because of his withdrawal from the deal and failure to pay the rest of the sum of €20.5 million, Lorenzo Sanz Senior and Lorenzo Sanz Junior lost much of their credibility.

== Later years ==
Sanz has recently announced that he will put himself up for election once again for the vacant President's position at Real Madrid, losing it to [[Ramón Calderón]].

On July 2006, Sanz purchased [[Málaga CF|Málaga Club de Fútbol]]. He sold the club in 2010 to a [[Qatar]]i investor.

In May 2008, it has been reported that he is looking to buy Italian club [[A.S. Bari|Associazione Sportiva Bari]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&amp;id=102108 TUTTO MERCATO WEB - Bari, Sanz interessato all'acquisto&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and that the Bari owners have given him 10 days to close the deal, which is rumored to be around €15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/index.php?action=read&amp;id=105398 TUTTO MERCATO WEB - Bari, ultimatum a Sanz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 2008, he was briefly jailed charged of fraud by a bank after trying to get paid a fake cheque. The complaint was withdrawn on December 2008.

On 11 November 2009, it was reported by Spanish newspaper ''El Pais'' that Sanz was arrested trying to smuggle [[work of art|artwork]] out of Spain.

== Family ==
Sanz is the father-in-law of former Real Madrid and Spanish defender [[Míchel Salgado]], who married his daughter Malula.

The '''Makati Central Business District''', also known as the '''Makati CBD''', is the leading financial and central business district in the [[Philippines]] located at the heart of [[Makati]] in [[Metro Manila]]. It is politically known as "Central Cluster" in the [[Legislative districts of Makati City|West District]] of Makati. It is different from the civic center of Makati known as "[[Makati Poblacion]]" which is situated at the north-east portion of the district. It is bounded by [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]], [[Gil Puyat Avenue]], [[Arnaiz Avenue]], and [[Chino Roces Avenue]]. The whole district occupies barangays of San Antonio, San Lorenzo, [[Bel-Air Village|Bel-Air]], and Urdaneta.&lt;ref name="Map of Downtown Makati"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/12726976/Makati-Central-Business-District-Downtown-Makati|title=Map of Downtown Makati|accessdate=April 1, 2014|publisher=Wikimapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the skyscrapers in Metro Manila are in this area. [[PBCom Tower]] along [[Ayala Avenue]], 259 meters high, is the [[List of tallest buildings in the Philippines|Country's tallest office building]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Philippine Bank of Communications]], or PBCom. The business district is also considered as one of the most vibrant commеrcial districts in [[Southeast Asia]]. It contains the [[Ayala Center]], one of the region's major shopping centers.

The financial district is managed by two groups - the Makati Commercial Estates Association (MaCEA)&lt;ref name="MaCEA Information"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foursquare.com/v/makati-commercial-estate-association-macea/4f13c2f1e4b067f671f5d0e5|title=Makati Commercial Estates Association|accessdate=April 1, 2014|publisher=Foursquare.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the Ayala Property Management Corporation (APMC).&lt;ref name="APMC Information"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayalaproperty.com.ph/profile.asp|title=Ayala Property Management Corporation|accessdate=April 1, 2014|publisher=APMC Website|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512215817/http://www.ayalaproperty.com.ph/profile.asp|archivedate=2014-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Pre-war period ===
Downtown [[Makati]] started out as part of the wide municipality of [[Santa Ana, Manila|Santa Ana de Sapa]] (part of the [[City of Manila]] today)&lt;ref name="History of Makati City"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |accessdate=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a town of its own in 1670, then as San Pedro de Macati in honor of its patron, [[Saint Peter]].

In 1851, Don José Bonifacio Roxas (a member of the [[Zobel de Ayala family|Ayala-Roxas family]]) purchased the farm estate of "[[Hacienda]] San Pedro de Macati" from the [[Jesuits]] for 52,800 pesos. The western portion of the estate is now what is called the downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=This week in Ayala history|url=http://www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph/news/55?start=5|work=Filipinas Library|publisher=www.filipinaslibrary.org.ph|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, Makati and its development remain close to the [[Zobel de Ayala family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Pioneers|url=http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|publisher=Ayala Group Official Website|accessdate=6 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060056/http://www.ayala.com.ph/ayalaat175mag/pioneers.html|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NielsonPlaque.JPG|thumb|right|Plaque on the Nielson Tower, Ayala Triangle]]

In 1901, the Americans declared the whole area south of the Pasig River, including the whole Hacienda San Pedro de Macati (Downtown), down to [[Barangay Ayala Alabang]], a US military reservation; thus establishing [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]], which is now known as [[Fort Bonifacio]]. That same year, the whole town, with a population of 25,000, was incorporated from the then Province of [[Manila (province)|Manila]] to the new province of [[Rizal]] with Marcelino Magsaysay serving as the town president.

In the 1930s, the first airport in [[Luzon]] island, [[Nielson Field]], opened in what is now the [[Ayala Triangle]] within the hacienda. The airport was officially inaugurated in 1938, and [[Philippine Airlines]] began its operations there in 1941.

The tracks of what is now the [[Philippine National Railways]] reached the town very early in the decade, which is located at the western portion of the downtown at present, with three stations serving commuters and residents.

=== Postwar period ===
After the destruction of [[World War II]] that brought upon Makati, the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. As Nieslon Field closed down in 1948 the plan was set for the building of the central business district. The first centrally planned communities from the Ayalas' farm estate were established in the 1950s. And some of the [[gated communities]] (Urdaneta, San Lorenzo San Antonio and Bel-Air Villages) that were developed grew into commercial areas and office parks.

The multiple-lane [[Ayala Avenue]] was completed in 1958, which once part of the runway of the first commercial airport in the country, the Nielson Airport. The downtown was developed into high density residential and commercial areas according to specific zoning regulations.&lt;ref name="Benedict R. O'G. Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |title=Southeast Asia Over Three Generations: Essays Presented to Benedict R. O'G. Anderson |last=O'Gorman Anderson |first=Benedict Richard |pages=291–294 |year=2003 |publisher=SEAP Publications |isbn=0877277354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, [[Ayala Corporation]] commissioned some of the first high-rise buildings to rise along Ayala Avenue from one of the country's best known architects, [[Leandro V. Locsin]].&lt;ref name="Benedict R. O'G. Anderson" /&gt;

The Makati Stock Exchange (MkSE) was established on May 27, 1963 with its trading area located along Ayala Avenue in downtown.&lt;ref name="Antoine W. van Agtmael"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emerging Securities Markets: Investment Banking Opportunities in the Developing World |last=van Agtmael |first=Antoine W. |page=99 |year=1984 |publisher=Euromoney Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both the MSE (Manila Stock Exchange) and the MkSE traded the same stocks of the same companies, the bourses were separate stock exchanges for nearly 30 years until December 23, 1992, when both exchanges were unified to become the present-day [[Philippine Stock Exchange]].

Downtown Makati has been the financial capital of the Philippines since the late 1960s, owing to congestion, relative lack of expansion area / downtown Manila being almost fully built up, higher land prices &amp; taxes and [[urban decay]] in the [[City of Manila]].&lt;ref name="History of Makati City"/&gt; The downtown district rapidly developed during the terms of town mayors Maximo Estrella, Rafael Bañola and Jose Luciano, who encouraged the massive development of the town and welcomed foreign and local investors to what was tagged as the nation's number one municipality at that time. Bañola's mayorship saw the building of the [[Ayala Center]] complex in the mid 1960s.

=== Martial Law era ===
[[File:May 14, 2005 - Rufino Tower!.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rufino Pacific Tower]], tallest steel-framed building in the country, built in 1994]]

In 1972, [[Ferdinand Marcos]] imposed [[Martial law in the Philippines]]. The formal announcement of the proclamation was made in the evening of September 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gov.ph/martial-law-40th-anniversary/#Timeline | title=Martial Law 40th Anniversary | publisher=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines | date=November 30, 2012 | accessdate=February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the economic activity in the downtown was still ongoing, with Nemesio Yabut as the then town mayor, preparing the district for Makati's full integration as a part of the new region of Metro Manila (the National Capital Region officially) and as a founding member of the Metropolitan Manila Commission, which it achieved with the commission's formal establishment on November 7, 1975, ending Makati's many years as a town under Rizal Province.

===1980s===
Following the assassination of [[Ninoy Aquino]] in 1983, the downtown area was one of the many places of rallies and mass demonstrations that were the basis of the [[People Power Revolution]] against the dictatorship of then-President Marcos in 1986.&lt;ref name="Benedict R. O'G. Anderson" /&gt; It was that decade that witnessed the emergence of a so-called moderate opposition, with the Makati Business Club, against Marcos' ailing authoritarian regime.&lt;ref name="Benedict R. O'G. Anderson" /&gt; Established in 1980, the MBC, a union of executives from business entities operating in the district, was then a voice of opposition to the dictatorship, and it was one of the leading organizers of what was then dubbed the ''Confetti Revolution'', so-named due to the yellow [[confetti]] from torn phone directories thrown along Ayala Avenue from the buildings in the wide road, whenever the rallies would happen.

After the death of Mayor Nemesio Yabut during the People Power Revolution, [[Corazon Aquino]], Ninoy's widow and the country's first female president, appointed [[Jejomar Binay]] as the acting mayor of the town of Makati and was [[Philippine legislative election, 1987|elected as mayor]] in 1988. Having spent his childhood in the municipality and himself a veteran of the ''Confetti Revolution'' and of the opposition activities during the Marcos administration, his first term bore witness to the events of the coup d'état attempt in December 1989, which hit the district directly.

===1990s ===
In the 1990s, the country's first skyscrapers started to rise here in the business district. The country's first skyscrapers that rose in the downtown are the [[Pacific Star Building]], The Peak Tower, Pacific Plaza, and the [[Rufino Pacific Tower]].

By virtue of Republic Act 7854, passed by Congress in late December 1994 and signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on January 2, 1995, became the City of Makati. On February 4, 1995, the character of the new city was ratified in a plebiscite with 91% of voters in favor of cityhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Vision of Makati: The City|last=Duldulao |first=Manuel |page=75 |year=1996 |publisher=Japuzinni Pub. Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole people of Makati especially the businessmen in downtown celebrated the remarkable event.

[[File:Ayala Triangle Gardens.JPG|thumb|right|Ayala Triangle with the city's new slogan - "Make it Happen, Make it Makati."]]

===21st century===
In the early 2000s, the downtown was a primary target of political rallies and terrorist attacks.

On May 17, 2000 at 5:02&amp;nbsp;p.m., [[Glorietta]] inside [[Ayala Center]] was bombed injuring 12 persons, mostly teenagers. According to local authorities, the homemade bomb was placed in front of a toilet beside a video arcade. It was said to be the precursor of the May 21, 2000 [[SM Megamall]] bombing and the December 30, 2000 [[Rizal Day bombings]].

From August 2000 to January 2001, a wave of protests against the former president [[Joseph Estrada]] happened in the district. The [[EDSA Revolution of 2001|anti-Estrada protests]] in Makati focused on Ayala Avenue, which cuts from [[EDSA (road)|EDSA]] to Buendia (now [[Gil Puyat Avenue]]).&lt;ref name="Benedict R. O'G. Anderson" /&gt;

In 2003, The [[Oakwood mutiny]] took place in the Oakwood Premier (now Ascott Makati), within the [[Glorietta]] complex, and on 2007, the [[Manila Peninsula siege]] took place at [[The Peninsula Manila]]. Bith happened at the Makati CBD to call for former president [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] to step down.

The [[2007 Glorietta explosion]] ripped through the [[Glorietta|Glorietta 2]] on October 19, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Blast kills four in Philippine capital | work =World | publisher =The Washington Post | date =2007-10-19 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101900212.html?nav=hcmodule | accessdate =2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The death toll in the explosion was 11, while 120 were injured.&lt;ref name="WPost1019B"&gt;{{cite news | title =Blast kills eight and wounds 70 at Philippine mall | work =World | publisher =The Washington Post | date =2007-10-19 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/19/AR2007101900229.html?tid=informbox | accessdate =2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yahoo20071019"&gt;{{cite news | last =Teves | first =Oliver | title =Blast at Manila shopping Mall kills 4 | work =Yahoo!

In 2011, the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement protesting [[economic inequality]] and the power of [[United States]] financial institutions, spread from [[New York City]] [[Occupy movement|to other parts of the world]], including the Philippines. The movement's supporters' first action was held on October 14, when protesters marched in Makati City from the Ninoy Aquino monument on [[Ayala Avenue]] to the American Chamber of Commerce. The movement here in the country is called "Occupy Philippines", which has other protests held in the US Embassy and [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]] after the protest in Makati.&lt;ref name="Occupy Philippines"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/235638/nation/filipinos-echo-occupy-wall-street-movement |title=Filipinos echo 'Occupy Wall Street' movement |publisher=Carmela Lapena, GMA News |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2014, the Makati Tourism Foundation and Makati City Government started a tourism campaign called "Make it Happen, Make it Makati", which promotes tourism mainly in the business district&lt;ref name="Make it Makati"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makeitmakati.com/about-the-city/makati-city-philippines|title=Make it Makati|accessdate=March 1, 2014|publisher=Makati Tourism Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926001856/http://www.makeitmakati.com/about-the-city/makati-city-philippines|archivedate=2014-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GSMA '''Mobile World Congress''' (MWC) is the world's largest [[Trade fair|exhibition]] for the [[Mobile phone|mobile]] industry, incorporating a thought-leadership conference that features prominent executives representing mobile operators, device manufacturers, technology providers, vendors and content owners from across the world.&lt;ref name=mwc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/|title=GSMA Mobile World Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, the GSMA announced&lt;ref&gt;GSMA launched Mobile World Congress Shanghai 2015 "[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/gsma-launches-mobile-world-congress-shanghai-2015/]"&lt;/ref&gt; that their annual summer event in China would be rebranded under the Mobile World Congress banner as "Mobile World Congress Shanghai".

In 2016, the GSMA announced the creation of Mobile World Congress Americas,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/press-release/gsma-ctia-partner-create-new-mobile-industry-event-americas/]"&lt;/ref&gt; an event created in partnership with CTIA to bring an extension of the event to North America in 2017.

For 2019, addressing the expansion of the event's focus beyond just mobile technology, Mobile World Congress evolved the event's name to simply, '''MWC Barcelona'''. The new event brand retains the familiar acronym while placing less emphasis on ‘mobile’ to reflect the broadening scope of communications today. Building off of the recognition and success of the MWC name, the events in Shanghai and the Americas will also now be referred to as '''MWC Shanghai''' and '''MWC Los Angeles''', as the Americas regional event will remain in Los Angeles for a second year.

'''''Nalini by Day, Nancy by Night''''' is a 2005 [[documentary film]] by filmmaker [[Sonali Gulati]].

This film explores [[business process outsourcing in India]]. Told from the perspective of an Indian living in the United States, the film provides us with a glimpse into India’s call centers, 
where telemarketers acquire American names and accents to service the telephone-support industry of the U.S. The film incorporates animation as a way to build in personal narrative in a doodle-like manner. It also includes live action footage which takes the form of cinema verité and innovatively edited interviews, and archival footage that provides contextual analysis to the socio-political history of globalization and capitalism. The film is a commentary on identity in the new millennium that intersects diaspora with global outsourcing. It was first shown at the 2005 [[Margaret Mead Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/programs/mead/films/nalini.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Namihei Odaira'''|小平 浪平|Odaira Namihei|January 15, 1874 – October 5, 1951}} was a Japanese [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]] who founded [[Hitachi]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Tochigi Prefecture]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]].

In 1900, he graduated from the [[electrical engineering]] department of [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. Following his graduation, he joined a mining company as an engineer in its power plant. From there, he went on to several electric power companies. In 1906, he joined the Kuhara Mining Company at its Hitachi copper mine as an engineering section chief. Although his main duties at the mine were to ensure a stable supply of electricity and to maintain the mine's electrical equipment, he and his colleagues began working on the manufacture of a five-horsepower electric motor. This marked the beginning of the development that would become Hitachi, which was founded by Odaira in 1910. However, because it was started as an in-house venture of the Kuhara Mining Company, the owner of Hitachi was [[Fusanosuke Kuhara]], the president of the mining company, not Odaira. Hitachi Ltd. was incorporated as an independent company in 1920. Odaira acted as the managing director of Hitachi from 1910 to 1929 and the president from 1929 to 1947. In 1947, Odaira was [[Purge (occupied Japan)|ordered out]] of this position by the U.S. occupation authorities. In 1951, this order was lifted, and he returned to the company as chairman emeritus. Almost immediately after his return, he died on October 5, 1951, aged 77.

The '''National Defense Industrial Association''' ('''NDIA''') is an [[voluntary association|association]] for the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and the [[defense industry]].&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dao|first=James|title=Dogfight for Dollars On Capitol Hill|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher= The New York Times Company|date=2001-09-02|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/02/business/dogfight-for-dollars-on-capitol-hill.html?pagewanted=3|accessdate=2009-07-07|quote=a trade group that represents 900 military contractors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Appelbaum|first=Richard P|authorlink=|author2=William I.

It connects government officials, military and industry professionals, and organizations that represent the branches of the [[Military of the United States|armed forces]], homeland security, and first responders. The NDIA publishes a magazine, the ''[[National Defense (magazine)|National Defense]]'', and holds over 80 symposia a year.

==Organization==
The group  has approximately 1,600 corporate members and over 65,000 individual and government members. Affiliated members include the [[Association for Enterprise Information]] (AFEI), the [[National Training and Simulation Association]] (NTSA), the [[Precision Strike Association]] (PSA), and [[Women in Defense (organisation)|Women in Defense]] (WID). It connects government officials, military and industry professionals, and organizations that represent the branches of the [[US military|armed forces]], homeland security, and first responders. It has divisions and working groups covering several niche areas. Its members often use the organization to forge business contacts through networking and participating in national   and local events.

Logistics, policy, combat, and acquisition form the base for most symposia, over 80 are held annually. Defense professionals from the private industry, government, military and first responders from the public and private sectors attend these programs for information from subject matter experts and to make contacts in industry and government. About 25 exhibitions each year include defense-related industry and government exhibits. These events and exhibitions are designed to facilitate information sharing and networking opportunities.

The association publishes a magazine, the ''[[National Defense (magazine)|National Defense]]''. Recently, they created a STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) Division,  promoting educational opportunities for   youth to ensure a skilled technical work force, and   developing cutting-edge manufacturing techniques to support the military industry.&lt;ref name="TID"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradeandindustrydev.com/issues/ID-385-article.aspx|title=NDIA Expands Opportunities for Defense Professionals |last=Farrell Jr.|first=Lawrence P. |publisher=Trade and Industry Development|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Technical Information Division has responsibility for the NDIA configuration and data management (CDM) professional certification program. This   includes preparation training for certification, the administration of examinations, and the award of certifications. NDIA has established two CDM certification levels: Certified Configuration and Data Manager (CCDM) and Certified Configuration and Data Specialist (CCDS).

==Chapters==
{{As of|2009}}, NDIA has 28 chapters across the United States.&lt;ref name="chapter_presidents"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndia.org/MembershipAndChapters/NDIAChapters/Pages/NDIA_Chapter_Presidents.aspx|title=NDIA Chapter Presidents|publisher=National Defense Industrial Association|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Divisions ==
NDIA consists of 28 Divisions and seven Industrial Working Groups that aims to promote defense through access, influence and education.&lt;ref name="divisions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndia.org/DIVISIONS/Pages/default.aspx|title=Divisions|publisher=National Defense Industrial Association|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Office of Financial Research''' ('''OFR''') is an independent bureau within the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] that was established by the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], whose passage in 2010 was a legislative response to the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] and the subsequent [[Great Recession]].&lt;ref name="WSOFP"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703507804576130370862263258?mod=googlenews_wsj|title=Warning Shot On Financial Protection |accessdate=2011-02-10|date=2011-02-09|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|author=Eaglesham, Jean}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established as a department reporting to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], the Office is tasked with (1) collecting and standardizing data, (2) performing applied research and essential long-term research; and (3) developing risk measurement and monitoring tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 152(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  The OFR is also responsible for providing support work to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).

== Director ==
The Director of the Office of Financial Research is appointed for a 6-year term. Under President Trump, the agency has become less independent and the Director of the OFR is now directly subordinate to the Secretary of the US Treasury.  The Director, in consultation with the Chairman of the Council (who is the Secretary of the Treasury) proposes the OFR annual budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 152(b)&lt;/ref&gt; The Director may set salaries of the Office’s employees “without regard to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_III_20_D_30_51.html chapter 51] or [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/usc_sup_01_5_10_III_20_D_30_53_40_III.html subchapter III of chapter 53] of [[Title 5 of the United States Code]], relating to classification of positions and General Schedule pay rates”.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 153(d)(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Authority ===
The Director has [[Administrative subpoena|Subpoena]] power and may require from any financial institution (bank or non-bank) any data needed to carry out the functions of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 152(f)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this power has not been used or tested.

==Responsibilities==

Section &lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 153(a)&lt;/ref&gt; of the Dodd-Frank Act charged the Office of Financial Research with supporting the [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] and member agencies by:

# Collecting data on behalf of the Council, and providing such data to the Council and member agencies;
# Standardizing the types and formats of data reported and collected; 
# Performing applied research and essential long-term research; 
# Developing tools for risk measurement and monitoring;
# Performing other related services;
# Making the results of the activities of the Office available to financial regulatory agencies; and
# Assisting Council member agencies in determining the types and formats of data authorized by the Act to be collected by the member agencies.

== Resources ==
Like the Council, the Office of Financial Research may request, from department or agency of the United States, "such services, funds, facilities, staff, and other support services as the Office may determine advisable. Any Federal Government employee may be detailed to the Office without reimbursement, and such detail shall be without interruption or loss of civil service status or privilege."&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 152(e)&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Treasury Department, there is a revolving fund, the "Financial Research Fund" into which all appropriations, fees, and assessments that the Office receives are deposited. Surplus funds may be invested. It is contemplated that within 2 years of establishment that the Office will be self-funding.&lt;ref name="§ 155"&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 155&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financial Research Fund ===
The Financial Research Fund is a quasi-revolving fund that the Office uses to fund its operations. All appropriations and assessments are deposited into the Fund; surpluses may be invested. Funds are not subject to apportionment for any other purposes. Within 2 years of enactment, the Office should become self-funding. During the 2-year time following date of enactment, the Federal Reserve shall fund the Office.&lt;ref name="§ 155" /&gt;

In fiscal 2016, the bureau had 225 employees and a budget of $99 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2016/the-most-important-agency-youve-never-heard-of/|title=The Most Important Agency You’ve Never Heard Of|last=Victoria|first=Finkle|date=June 12, 2016|website=Washington Monthly|language=en-US|access-date=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 the OFR went through substantial Reduction In Force and employees leaving.  Trump claimed he was saving tax payers money even though the funding is not from tax payers.  At year end, 2018, the OFR had slightly over 100 employees.

== Workforce development ==
The Office has broad latitude in performing support services for both the Council and other Member Agencies, including data collection, applied research and essential long-term research, and developing tools for monitoring risk. The Office can also issue guidelines to standardizing the way data is reported, constituent agencies have three years to implement data standardization guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 153&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the Office of Financial Research is to be operated without the constraints of the [[Civil service#United States|Civil Service]] system. For example, it does not need to follow federal pay scale guidelines (see above), and it is mandated that the office have:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 156&lt;/ref&gt;
* Training and Workforce Development Plan that includes training, leadership development and succession planning
* Workplace Flexibility Plan that includes telework, flexible work schedules, job sharing, parental leave benefits and childcare assistance, domestic partner benefits
* Recruitment and Retention Plan

=== Temporary management reporting ===
For a period of five years after enactment, the Office shall submit an annual report to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and the House Committee on Financial Services, what amounts to a management report, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 156(b)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Training And Workforce Development Plan – that includes:
** Identification of skill and technical expertise needs and action taken to meet the requirements
** Steps taken to foster innovation and creativity
** Leadership development and succession Planning
** Effective use of technology by employees
* Workplace Flexibility Plan – that includes:
** Telework 
** Flexible work schedules
** Phased retirement
** Reemployment annuitants
** Parental leave benefits and childcare assistance
** Domestic partner benefits
** Other workplace flexibilities
* Recruitment and Retention Plan – that includes:
** The steps necessary to target highly qualified applicant pools with diverse backgrounds
** Streamlined employment application process
** Timely notification of employment applications
** Measures of hiring effectiveness

== Sections ==

=== Data and Research &amp; Analysis Centers ===

The Office is supported by two entities:
* The ''Data Center'',&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}} § 154(b)&lt;/ref&gt; which collects, validates and maintains (and publishes some of) the data required to support the Council; which may be obtained from commercial data providers, publicly available data sources and the financial entities supervised by state and federal agencies; and
* The ''Research and Analysis Center'', which conducts independent analysis of available information to identify financially destabilizing effects, and develops and maintains independent analytical capabilities and computing resources to:&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 154(c)&lt;/ref&gt;
** Develop and maintain metrics and reporting systems for risks to the financial stability of the United States
** Monitor, investigate, and report on changes in systemwide risk levels and patterns to the Council and Congress
** Conduct, coordinate, and sponsor research to support and improve regulation of financial entities and markets
** Evaluate and report on stress tests or other stability-related evaluations of financial entities overseen by the member agencies
** Maintain expertise in such areas as may be necessary to support specific requests for advice and assistance from financial regulators
** Investigate disruptions and failures in the financial markets, report findings, and make recommendations to the Council based on those findings;
** Conduct studies and provide advice on the impact of policies related to systemic risk; and
** Promote best practices for financial risk management.

== Reporting ==
The Director reports to and testifies before only the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives. Testimony shall be annual on the activities of the Office, including the work of the Data Center and the Research and Analysis Center and the assessment of significant financial and market developments and potential emerging threats to the financial stability of the Country. These reports to Congress are independent of any political influence in that "No officer or agency of the United States shall have any authority to require the Director to submit the testimony ... for approval, comment, or review prior to the submission of such testimony."&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|111|HR|4173}}, § 153(d)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phillip Andrew Hedley Adams''' [[Order of Australia|AO]] [[Australian Academy of the Humanities|FAHA]] [[Royal Society of Arts|FRSA]] (born 12 July 1939) is an Australian [[Humanism|humanist]],&lt;ref name=NatTrust/&gt; social commentator, broadcaster, public intellectual and farmer. He hosts ''[[Late Night Live]]'', an [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) program on [[ABC Radio National|Radio National]] four nights a week. He also writes a weekly column for ''[[The Weekend Australian]]''.

Adams has had careers in advertising and film production and has served on many non-profit boards including [[Greenpeace Australia]], [[Ausflag]], [[Care Australia]], [[Film Victoria]], [[National Museum of Australia]], both the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas|Adelaide]] and [[Ideas Festival|Brisbane]] festivals of ideas, the Montsalvat Arts Society and the [[Don Dunstan#Legacy|Don Dunstan Foundation]].

Adams has been appointed both a member and subsequently an officer of the [[Order of Australia]]; and he has received numerous awards including five honorary doctorates from Australian universities; Republican of the Year 2005; the Senior ANZAC Fellowship; the Australian Humanist of the Year, the [[Golden Lion]] at Cannes; the Longford Award; a [[Walkley Award]]; and the Henry Lawson Australian Arts Award. In 1997 the [[International Astronomical Union]] named a minor planet orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter after him.&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; A [[National Trust of Australia|National Trust]] poll elected him one of Australia's 100 [[Australian Living Treasures|national living treasures]].&lt;ref name=NatTrust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/nsw/NationalLivingTreasures|title=National Living Treasures|publisher=[[National Trust of Australia]]|date=2012|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129093613/http://www.nationaltrust.org.au/nsw/NationalLivingTreasures|archivedate=29 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Adams was born in [[Maryborough, Victoria|Maryborough]], Victoria, the only child of [[Congregational Church]] minister, the Reverend Charles Adams. His childhood was anything but idyllic and his parents separated when he was young. Interviewed in 2006, Adams said that:&lt;ref name="backyard" &gt;{{cite interview|last=Adams|first=Phillip|interviewer=[[Richard Fidler]]|title=Broadcaster Phillip Adams in conversation with Richard Fidler|type=Radio interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/conversations/stories/s1690728.htm|format=transcript and streaming audio|work=The Backyard|publisher=[[ABC Radio National]]|location=Australia|date=19 July 2006|page= |pages= |access-date=23 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101095832/http://www.abc.net.au/queensland/conversations/stories/s1690728.htm|archive-date=2007-11-01|dead-url=yes|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;My first memories were my mother... absolutely dependent on the begging bowl – that little round dish with a piece of cloth at the bottom where parishioners would put a couple of bob. When dad went off to the war, I was taken up by my grandparents... and lived on a dirt-poor farm... I lived in penury for the first 10, 15 years of my life. ... Mother dumped [my father] in favour of a rather sleazy businessman ... a sociopath who tried to murder me ... I spent my latter part of my childhood trying to protect my mother from this psycho.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Of his education he has said: "I was forced to leave school before completing my secondary education and the only job I could get was working in advertising."&lt;ref name="atheist" /&gt;

Adams joined the [[Australian Communist Party]]&lt;ref name="conversations" &gt;{{cite interview|last=Adams|first=Phillip|interviewer=[[Richard Fidler]]|title=Phillip Adams|type=Radio interview|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2006/09/14/1740844.htm|format=transcript and streaming audio|work=Conversations with Richard Fidler|publisher=[[ABC Local Radio]]|location=Australia|date=14 September 2006|page= |pages= |access-date=23 December 2014|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 16, whilst employed in advertising, but left at age 19. He has often compared dogmatic belief in communism to dogmatic belief in [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Career==
Adams began his advertising career with [[Foote Cone &amp; Belding]] and, later, with Brian Monahan and Lyle Dayman, became a partner in the agency Monahan Dayman Adams. They took that company to a successful public listing and Adams became a millionaire in the process.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He developed successful campaigns such as ''[[Life. Be in it.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animation cel of 'Norm' from the 'Life. Be in it' campaign, 1993 – 1994|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=12209&amp;search=alexander&amp;images=&amp;c=1&amp;s=|work=Powerhouse Museum Collection Search 2.53|format=Acetate, paper, cardboard|author1=Stitt, Alexander|author2=Adams, Phillip|location=South Yarra, Victoria, Australia|date=1993–1994|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]], Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slip-Slop-Slap|Slip, Slop, Slap]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunsmart.com.au/browse.asp?ContainerID=1808|title=Page Not Found|first=SunSmart|last=Victoria|website=SunSmart}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Break down the Barriers'', ''Guess whose mum's got a Whirlpool'' and ''Watch the big men fly for a Herbert Adams Pie'', working with talent such as [[Fred Schepisi]], Alex Stitt, [[Peter Best (composer)|Peter Best]], [[Robyn Archer]] and Mimmo Cozzolino. Adams left the advertising industry in the 1980s. Monahan Dayman Adams purchased the successful Sydney agency [[Mojo (advertising)|MoJo]] in 1987 and carried on as MojoMDA. Its lineage can today be traced to Publicis Mojo, an Australian subsidiary of the French [[multinational corporation|multinational]] advertising and communications company holding [[Publicis Groupe]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

He wrote regular columns for ''[[The Age]]'' and ''[[The Bulletin]]''. He currently writes a weekly column for ''The Australian''.

===Film work===
Adams played a key role in the revival of the [[Cinema of Australia|Australian film industry]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=godfather&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/06/1046826480126.html?oneclick=true|location=Melbourne|work=[[The Age]]|date=7 March 2003|accessdate=23 December 2014|title=Bazza turns 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of a 1969 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabula-rasa.info/AusHorror/OzHorrorFilms4.html|title=A Brief History of the Film Industry in Australia and New Zealand|work=Killer Koalas: Australian (and New Zealand) Horror Films|format=Appendix|author=Hood, Robert|date=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to legislation by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] in 1970 for an Australian Film and Television Development Corporation (later the [[Australian Film Commission]]) and the Experimental Film Fund.

Together with [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], Adams was a motivating force behind the [[Australian Film Television and Radio School]] which was established under the [[Whitlam|Whitlam government]].&lt;ref name=spa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenforever.org.au/program/phillip-adams-ao/|title=Phillip Adams AO|work=Screen Forever|publisher=Screen Producers Australia|date=November 2014|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223132555/http://screenforever.org.au/program/phillip-adams-ao/|archivedate=23 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams played a key role in the development of the [[South Australian Film Corporation]],&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; which was created in 1972 and became a model for similar bodies in other Australian states; and in the establishment of the [[Australia Council]] and the [[Australian Film Development Corporation]],&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; later known as the Australian Film Commission, the [[Film Finance Corporation Australia]], and [[Screen Australia]]. As head of delegation to the [[Cannes Film Festival]], Adams signed Australia's first co-production agreements with France and the UK. He was Chairman of the [[Australian Film Institute]], the Film and Television Board of the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission, and Film Australia. He helped establish the Australian Caption Service, which provides services for hearing-impaired television viewers – and the Travelling Film Festival to take quality films into rural areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In the 1960s Adams co-wrote, co-produced and co-directed (as well as serving as cinematographer for) his first feature film ''[[Jack and Jill: A Postscript]]'' (1969); the first feature to win the [[Australian Film Institute Award|AFI Award]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/23/carlton-australian-revival.html|author=Hodson, Bruce|title=The Carlton Ripple and the Australian Film Revival|work=Screening the Past|date=|accessdate=15 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218063047/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/screeningthepast/23/carlton-australian-revival.html|archivedate=18 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first Australian film to win the Grand Prix at an international festival.

Adams produced or co-produced other features including the critically panned but hugely popular film adaptation of Barry Humphries' ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'', directed by [[Bruce Beresford]], which became the most successful Australian film ever made up to that time. Other films include ''[[The Naked Bunyip]]'', ''[[Don's Party]]'', ''[[The Getting of Wisdom (film)|The Getting of Wisdom]]'', ''Lonely Hearts'', ''[[We of the Never Never]]'', ''[[Grendel Grendel Grendel]]'', ''Fighting Back'', ''Hearts and Minds'' and ''[[Abra Cadabra (1983 film)|Abra Cadabra]]''.

===Broadcasting===
Adams initially presented a late-night program on Sydney commercial radio station [[2UE]] during the late 1980s and early 1990s before succeeding [[Virginia Bell]] in 1991 at ABC Radio National's ''Late Night Live'', a magazine{{endash}}style program that broadcasts analysis of current events to Australian and international politics, science, philosophy and culture. ''Late Night Live'' is broadcast across Australia on ABC Radio National, as well as on [[Radio Australia]] and the Internet. The program is broadcast live from 22:00 [[Australian Time|AEST]]/[[Australian Daylight Saving Time|ADST]] and is repeated the following day at 16:00 AEST/ADST.&lt;ref name="LNLprofile"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/latenightlive/|work=ABC Radio National|title=About us: Late Night Live|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A serious discussion of world issues, the program is tempered with Adams' gentle and ironic humour.&lt;ref name="Luker2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Luker, Philip|title=Phillip Adams: The Ideas Man – A Life Revealed|page=206|date=20 April 2011|publisher=JoJo Publishing|isbn=978-0-9870734-6-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regular contributors include [[Bruce Shapiro]]&lt;ref name="LNLprofile" /&gt; and [[Beatrix Campbell]].

At times, Adams refers [[tongue-in-cheek]] to his listeners as "the listener" or "Gladys", as though he had only one listener; he also refers to listeners collectively as "Gladdies". In more recent years, Adams has begun introducing the show saying "Good evening Gladdies and Poddies", in reference to the show's growing [[podcast]] listener base.

The current theme music is a short extract from [[Elena Kats-Chernin]]'s ''[[Wild Swans (ballet)|Wild Swans Concert Suite]]'', performed by the [[Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra]] with [[soprano]] [[Jane Sheldon]], chosen in 2010. From 2007 to 2010, the theme music was Kats-Chernin's "Russian Rag", which Adams humorously refers to as "The Waltz of the Wombat". The previous music was [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]'s [[Keyboard concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach#Concerto in C minor, BWV 1060|Concerto for oboe, violin and orchestra in C minor, BWV 1060]]: III. ''Allegro''.

===Other work===
Adams was the foundation chairman of the Commission for the Future,&lt;ref name=LNLprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; established by the [[Hawke government]] to build bridges between science and the community. In 1988 the Commission won a major United Nations award for educating Australia on the issue of greenhouse and [[climate change]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} He chaired the [[National Australia Day Council]];&lt;ref name=LNLprofile/&gt;&lt;ref name=spa/&gt; whose principal task was to choose the Australian of the Year.

He also chaired the Advisory Board for the Centre of the Mind at the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[Australia National University]] and has been a board member of Greenpeace Australia, CARE Australia, the National Museum of Australia, The Australian Centre for Social Innovation, the [[Adelaide Festival of Ideas]] and Brisbane's [[Ideas Festival]]. He was co-founder of the [[Australian Skeptics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityspeakers.com.au/media-speakers/phillip-adams/|title=Phillip Adams AO|work=Speaker Profile|publisher=The Celebrity Speakers Bureau|date=2014|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams is the author or editor of more than 20 books, including ''The Unspeakable Adams'', ''Adams Versus God'', ''The Penguin Book of Australian Jokes'', ''Retreat from Tolerance'', ''Talkback and A Billion Voices'', ''Adams Ark'', and, with Lee Burton, ''Emperors of the Air''.

[[Robert Manne]] has described Adams as "the emblematic figurehead of the pro-[[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] left [[intelligentsia]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Manne, Robert|authorlink=Robert Manne |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/robert-manne/labor-must-confront-its-identity-crisis/2004/10/17/1097951554223.html|location=Melbourne|work=[[The Age]]|title=Labor must confront its identity crisis|date=18 October 2004|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams had a close relationship with every Labor leader from Gough Whitlam to [[Kevin Rudd]], advising on public relations, advertising and policy issues. However, on 19 July 2006, he was reported as saying of the Labor Party:&lt;ref name=backyard /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They hate me. I think Kim Beazley is a serious error. I think the party's been going downhill federally ever since Keating left ... The Labor Party's hardly worth feeding federally.&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2010, Adams resigned from the Labor Party after Rudd was defeated as the [[Leader of the Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]] at the [[Australian Labor Party leadership election, 2010|2010 Labor leadership spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why I quit the Labor Party|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/why-i-quit-the-labor-party/story-e6frg8h6-1225886243738|author=Adams, Phillip|work=[[The Australian]]|date=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 Adams argued against [[Section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975]], saying that a better response to expressions of racial hatred was "public debate, not legal censure".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Role of the Media|last=Adams|first=Phillip|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams' life and extracurricular activities have made him a source of interest to fans and foes of all persuasions for many years. Australia's [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation|security intelligence organisation]] kept an extensive [[ASIO File]] on Adams. The file began at about the time he turned 16 years of age.&lt;ref name="Adams file 2"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Australian|The Weekend Australian Magazine]]|author=Adams, Phillip|date=16 July 2005|title=Adams file|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:(1) Stoneleigh (Darley Street)-1.jpg|right|thumb|"Stoneleigh", Adams's former home]]
Adams is married to [[Patrice Newell]]. He has four daughters: three with his first wife, Rosemary Fawcett, and one with Newell. He lives on "Elmswood", a large property near [[Gundy]] in the [[Hunter Region]] in mid-northern New South Wales. He and his wife grow garlic, olives and farm organically fed cattle. He has a home in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], an inner suburb of Sydney. Prior to this, Adams lived for some time in "Stoneleigh", a heritage-listed house&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/heritageapp/ViewHeritageItemDetails.aspx?ID=2420152|title=House "Stoneleigh" Including Interior, Front Fence and Grounds – NSW Environment &amp; Heritage|website=www.environment.nsw.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]]. Adams is a collector of rare antiques, including Egyptian, Roman and Greek sculptures and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s.

He has written "I'd been an atheist since I was five."&lt;ref name=atheist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/4678.htm|title=I Am Proud That|author1=Adams, Phillip|author2=Croucher, Rowland|publisher=John Mark Ministries|date=October 1998|archive-url=http://www.melbournesynagogue.org.au/news/haatid/q4_1998/q4_98_02.html|archive-date=5 January 2003|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">A '''qualified institutional buyer''' ('''QIB'''), in United States law and finance, is a purchaser of [[securities]] that is deemed financially sophisticated and is legally recognized by securities market regulators to need less protection from issuers than most public investors.  Typically, the qualifications for this designation are based on an investor's total [[assets under management]] and specific legal conditions in the country where the fund is located. [[Rule 144A]] requires an institution to manage at least $100 million in securities from issuers not affiliated with the institution to be considered a QIB. If the institution is a bank or savings and loans thrift they must have a net worth of at least $25 million. If the institution is a registered dealer acting for its own account it must in the aggregate own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities of issuers not affiliated with the dealer.

Certain [[private placements]] of [[stock|stocks]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] are made available only to qualified institutional buyers to limit regulatory restrictions and public filing requirements.

== Requirements ==
The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) requires that an entity meet one of the following requirements to qualify as a QIB:
* Any of the following entities, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the entity:
:* An insurance company
:* An investment company registered under the [[Investment Company Act of 1940]]
:* A Small Business Investment Company licensed by the US Small Business Administration under the [[Small Business Investment Act of 1958]]
:* A plan established and maintained by a state, its political subdivisions, or state agency, for the benefit of its employees
:* An employee benefit plan falling under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]]
:* A trust fund whose trustee is a bank or trust company and whose participants are exclusively plans established for the benefit of state employees or employee benefit plans, except trust funds that include as participants individual retirement accounts or H.R. 10 plans
:*     A business development company as defined in section 202(a)(22) of the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]].
:*     A 501(c)(3) charitable organization, corporation (other than a bank or a savings and loan association), partnership, or Massachusetts or similar business trust; and
:*     An investment adviser registered under the [[Investment Advisers Act of 1940]].
* Any registered dealer, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the dealer.
* Any registered dealer acting in a [[riskless principal]] transaction on behalf of a ''qualified institutional buyer''.
* Any investment company registered under the Investment Company Act, acting for its own account or for the accounts of other QIBs, that is part of a family of investment companies which own in the aggregate at least $100 million in securities of issuers, other than issuers that are affiliated with the investment company or are part of such family of investment companies.
* Any entity, all of the equity owners of which are QIBs, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs.
* Any bank or any savings and loan association or other institution, acting for its own account or the accounts of other QIBs, that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with it and that has an audited net worth of at least $25 million as demonstrated in its latest annual financial statements, as of a date not more than 16 months preceding the date of sale under [[Rule 144A]] in the case of a US bank or savings and loan association, and not more than 18 months preceding the date of sale for a foreign bank or savings and loan association or equivalent institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.practicallaw.com/1-382-3730 PLC - Qualified Institutional Buyer (QIB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Beale Blaize''' (November 22, 1845 – September 21, 1904) was a [[West African]] businessman, newspaper publisher, financier, and black nationalist of [[Sierra Leonean]] and [[Nigerian]] heritage.

==Early life==
Richard Olamilege Blaize was born in [[Freetown]], Sierra Leone, to the family of [[emancipated]] [[slaves]] of Yoruba origin. His parents were Ojelabi Olapajuokun (who later took the name John Blaize) and Maria Blaize.&lt;ref name="Adeniran"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adeniran|first1=Adedapo|title=Nigeria The Case for Peaceful and Friendly Dissolution|publisher=Arymson Publicity|page=44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hDJvxt_O-MC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;dq=richard+Beale+Blaize+olamilege&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q=olamilege&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tarikh|title=R.B. Blaize: Merchant Prince of West Africa|publisher=Longman, 1966|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an early age, he attended a mission school and was nurtured in the Christian way. He started work as an [[apprentice]] for a printer in Freetown but soon left the country for the [[Lagos Colony]] in 1862.

==Career in business and political activism==

===Business===
After arriving Lagos in 1862, Blaize worked as a printer for Robert Campbell, editor of Anglo-American.&lt;ref name="Teniola"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teniola|first1=Eric|title=Sierra Leon: The Creoles in Nigeria|url=http://www.thisissierraleone.com/sierra-leone-the-creoles-in-nigeria/|website=This Is Sierra Leone|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then left printing for [[merchandise]] trading and importation. In trading, the participants were numerous, especially those from Lagos; most of the traders mainly dealt with exchanging goods with exporters and a few delved into [[exportation]].&lt;ref name="Olukoju"&gt;Ayodeji Olukoju. "Anatomy of Business-Government Relations: Fiscal Policy and Mercantile Pressure Group Activity in Nigeria, 1916-1933", ''African Studies Review'', Vol. 38, No. 1, April 1995, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of traders owned steamers, which were used to navigate the [[Niger River]] to buy goods from groups across river, and some even boasted they showed the imperialists how to move across the river. Blaize was among a few of the Lagos merchants to be very successful in trading; he was an importer and was also involved with trade across the Niger. Though the ruinous approach of competitors led to many indigenous enterprises foundling not the least helped with the dominance of [[sole proprietorships]], Blaize thrived in the midst of strong competition and became one of the wealthiest West Africans of his time.&lt;ref name="Lipschitz"&gt;Mark R. Lipschutz, R. Kent Rasmussen. ''Dictionary of African Historical Biography'', Aldine Pub. Co., 1978, p. 32. {{ISBN|0-520-05179-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was included in the European Lagos Chamber of Commerce constituted in 1888 and was on the 1898 Commission on Trade in Lagos.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt;

===Political activism===
He was a prominent member of the [[Royal African Society]] during the second half of the nineteenth century. He was also at various times, a [[newspaper publisher]]. He entered the [[newsprint]] business in 1880, with the launch of ''[[The Lagos Times and Gold Coast Colony Advertiser]]''.&lt;ref name="JHK" /&gt; The paper brought on Mr [[Mojola Agbebi]], who later became prominent and known for his views on [[cultural]] [[Nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Obichere"&gt;Boniface I. Obichere. ''Studies in Southern Nigerian History'', Routledge, 1982, p. 106, {{ISBN|0-7146-3106-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the life of the newspaper was short, it folded in 1884. He was thereafter approached by [[John Payne Jackson]], a [[Liberia]]n emigrant who wanted to re-invent the Times. After much prodding, Blaize agreed to publish a new rag: the ''Lagos Weekly Times''. Through his newspapers, he took an active part in demanding more education, better representation for Africans in Lagos, self-government, and pushed for a separation of Lagos Colony from the Gold Coast Colony.

Blaize's political clout in [[Lagos Colony]] was demonstrated in 1901 during the contest for the [[Oba of Lagos|Lagos Throne]].  After Governor [[William MacGregor]] refused to accept any of the rival candidates (Oduntan and Ajose Dawudu) for the Obaship, one of the king-makers (Yesufu Omo-Oba) introduced [[Eshugbayi Eleko]] to Blaize, and Blaize in turn introduced Eshugbayi Eleko to Governor  MacGregor, who recognized Eleko as Oba of Lagos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cole|first1=Patrick|title=Modern and Traditional Elites in the Politics of Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Apr 17, 1975|isbn=9780521204392|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
Blaize married Emily Cole in 1871 and the couple had 6 children&lt;ref name="Mann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mann|first1=Kristin|title=Marrying Well: Marriage, Status and Social Change among the Educated Elite in Colonial Lagos|publisher=Cambridge University Press, Dec 5, 1985|isbn=9780521307017|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Charlotte Olajumoke, who in 1902,  married Dr [[Orisadipe Obasa]]. Emily Cole died in 1895.&lt;ref name="Mann" /&gt;

==Death, legacy and philanthropy==

'''Rideau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|iː|d|oʊ}} {{respell|REE|doh}}; {{IPA-fr|ʁido}}) Recognition is a private, North American based company that provides corporate and governmental recognition programs and products. Founded in 1912 as the Stephenson Company, the company has undergone several buyouts and ventures in different geographical markets. Rideau was the first [[Canada|Canadian]] company to produce the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]], as well as the first Canadian company to be granted its own [[Coat of Arms]] by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority|The Heraldic Authority]].

==History==
[[Image:Rideau Hall04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rideau Hall]], the company's [[namesake]]]]

===Growth and Transition===
In 1912 the Stephenson Company, situated on Saint-Maurice Street in [[old Montreal]], began as a producer of emblematic jewelry for associations such as the [[Freemasonry|Masons]], the [[Knights of Columbus]], and other organizations. During [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], the company produced military insignia for the armed forces.&lt;ref name="Rideau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rideau.com/en/about_history.asp |title=Rideau History |accessdate=2009-01-16 |publisher= Rideau}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the mid 50’s the company's shares were sold to a U.S.-based company that moved Stephenson Company's headquarters to [[Montreal north|Montreal North]]. The company was later sold back to two Montrealers who had numerous business interests but nevertheless, Stephenson went into a steady state of decline.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

By 1968, The Stephenson Company was almost bankrupt and was reduced to a staff of five. In that same year, Stephenson was purchased by Ed and Phyllis Hart.&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; Its largest customer was [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon Cosmetics]], which used the company's awards to help incentivize its sales force.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In the 1970s Avon began selling Stephenson's jewelry door-to-door along with its traditional [[cosmetics]], which proved successful and helped both Avon and Stephenson flourish.&lt;ref name="Fix"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/profit100/2008/success-stories/article.aspx?id=20080601_198708_198708 |title=Mr. Fix It |accessdate=2009-02-26 |publisher= Canadian Business Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Harts partnered with Maurice Bradden of D’Orlan Jeweler’s, helping to launch its manufacturing capabilities on the European continent in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The facility produced [[Nina Ricci (brand)|Nina Ricci]] fashion jewelry in the European Common Market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1978, the Harts sold the operation to their four children and family friend&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; and continued to expand in Europe.  In 1979, The Stephenson company opened a subsidiary, The Jeweller's Guild, in the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Jeweler's Guild sold fashion jewelry exclusively by mail order.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} In 1980 other subsidiaries were set up in France, Holland and Germany and they too sold fashion jewelry by mail order.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Stephenson and its subsidiary companies did well until [[Modern economic history of UK#1979–1990: the Thatcher era|1982]], when the company's over-expansion coupled with the economic recession forced the company to change and reinvent itself.&lt;ref name="Fix"/&gt;
[[File:OrderofCanadaFemale.jpg|thumb|right|Rideau was the first [[Canadian]] company to produce the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]].]]
In 1983, the newly restructured Stephenson Company started producing the [[Order of Canada]], the country's highest civilian [[order (decoration)|decoration]].&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt; Up until The Stephenson company was granted permission to produce the award, it had been produced solely in [[England]] by [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom|crown jeweler]] [[Garrard &amp; Co|Garrards of London]].&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, Christopher (2006). ''The Order of Canada'', p.196. [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto. {{ISBN|0-8020-3940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the suggestion of [[Bruce W. Beatty|Bruce Beatty]], the chief designer of the [[Canadian Honours System]], the owners renamed the company ''Rideau'' to reflect their service the [[Governor General of Canada]], who resides in [[Rideau Hall]] in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref&gt;McCreery, Christopher (2006). ''The Order of Canada'', p.336. [[University of Toronto Press]], Toronto. {{ISBN|0-8020-3940-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Rideau shifted its focus from government decorations and medals to their current focus of corporate recognition and point-based recognition solutions. In 2006, Rideau acquired Recognition Management Institute (RMI) a company whose focus was helping businesses grow by building relationships with their employees and customers. Rideau made an investment in analytic data (big data) research in 2008 and proved the link between employee recognition and company's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). In that same year, RMI became "Vistance Learning". By 2012, the implementation of Vistance Analytics made Rideau the first data-driven recognition company. In 2015, Vistance was fully deployed within a major global financial services company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rideau.comj&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business under the Rideau name===
Towards the end of the 80’s promotional products and fashion jewelry were increasingly being off-shored to the Far East, so the company began focusing on corporate recognition programs. It began providing fully outsourced recognition programs to [[Royal Bank of Canada|RBC]], [[Scotiabank]], [[Bank of Montreal|BMO]], [[Molson]], [[Alcan]], [[Canadian Pacific]], and the [[Government of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://list.canadianbusiness.com/rankings/profit100/2008/success-stories/article.aspx?id=20080601_198708_198708 |title= Canada's Fastest Growing Companies |accessdate=2009-01-16 |format= |publisher= ''[[Canadian Business]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Rideau Recognition became the first Canadian company to be granted its own [[Coat of Arms]] by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority|The Heraldic Authority]], bearing the [[Latin]] motto ''Opus excellentiae'' ("Impressions of excellence").&lt;ref name="Rideau"/&gt;

Rideau Recognition is also a sponsor of [[Recognition Professionals International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recognition.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=147 |title=Sponsorship |accessdate=2009-01-23 |publisher=[[Recognition Professionals International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisitions and Alliances===
In April 2006, Rideau Recognition announced their acquisition of Recognition Management Institute (RMI), a London, Ontario-based consulting organization specializing in training managers how to recognize and retain top employers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com|title=Online Press Release Distribution Service - PRWeb|website=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2015, Rideau Recognition executed a definitive asset purchase agreement with Birks Group, Inc. whereby Birks Group sold its corporate sales division, also known as "Birks Business" to Rideau for CAD $5.625 million (approximately USD $4.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;newswire.ca "Birks Group and Rideau announce strategic alliance: Rideau acquires Birks Corporate Sales Division and the two enter into supply and licensing agreements for Birks Business products"&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 2017, Rideau acquired Pressed Metal Products, a Vancouver-based company that manufactures emblematic insignia jewelry, awards and medals.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rideau.com|title=Rideau Recognition Solutions|website=Rideau Recognition Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebranding===
In March 2017, Rideau Recognition underwent a rebranding which included a new logo, website, corporate signature and colors and a new Vistance platform and proprietary score called Recognition Quotient (RQ).&lt;ref&gt;newswire.ca "Rideau rallies behind 'Return on Recogniton' with newrobust Vistance platform and proprietary Recognition Quotient"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vistance===
Vistance Analytics &amp; Prescriptive Learning is a division of Rideau. Vistance Analytics analyzes the impact of recognition programs and employee perceptions on an organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Vistance Learning is a prescriptive online assessment and learning management system to help leaders improve their organization's Key Performance Indicators (KPI) through critical development, employee recognition and engagement skills.

The initial concept for Vistance was created in 2007 from a think tank of organizational psychologists and recognition experts hired by Rideau Recognition Solutions to determine whether employee recognition has a measurable impact on business outcomes.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"/&gt;

===Environmental Awareness===
Rideau Recognition is the first recognition firm to be certified as Carbon Neutral. The firm has been a participant and stakeholder to the United Nations Global Compact (UNCG) since 2005. Rideau has helped plant over 100,000 native trees and was the recipient of the Eterne Award in 2015.&lt;ref name="rideau.com"/&gt; This award is given to companies who support Tree Canada and exemplify the best in environmental stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;treecanada.ca&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rodolfo Cuenca''', sometimes known by his nickname, '''Rudy Cuenca''', is a Filipino businessman best known as the former chairman of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP), which is known today as the [[Philippine National Construction Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Muego1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Muego |first=Benjamin N. |date=1983-11-01 |title=The Executive Committee in the Philippines: Successors, Power Brokers, and Dark Horses |url=http://as.ucpress.edu/content/23/11/1159 |journal=Asian Survey |language=en |volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=1159–1170 |doi=10.2307/2644365 |issn=0004-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a close associate of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], and is noted not to be embarrassed by "''his much-criticized close association with Marcos and his being tagged as a crony.''"&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100927-294524/Crony-tells-of-rivalry-in-Marcos-inner-circle |title=Crony Tells of Rivalry in Marcos Inner Circle |last=Doronila |first=Armando |date=2010-09-27 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928103753/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20100927-294524/Crony-tells-of-rivalry-in-Marcos-inner-circle |archive-date=2010-09-28 |dead-url=Yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Rodolfo Cuenca was born on May 1, 1928, at the Philippine General Hospital, to Nicolas and Cristina Cuenca. He is the eldest among four children. Cuenca spent his early years in Vigan, as his father was assigned district engineer in Ilocos Sur. In 1937, the family transferred to Bulacan, where Cuenca finished his fourth and fifth grade. He continued sixth grade in Ateneo de Manila on Padre Faura, then transferred to the Intramuros campus for his seventh grade.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/693684262 |title=Builder of bridges : the Rudy Cuenca story |last=Dalisay |first=Jose Y. |isbn=9789712724619 |location=Manila |oclc=693684262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, Cuenca withdrew from high school and worked some jobs, one of which was at the General Engineering Depot for the US Army in Malolos. In 1946, he returned to Ateneo to finish high school. He then enrolled in Far Eastern University to study commerce,&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010"/&gt; but soon dropped out to work as a road contractor.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; On 2 January 1948, he married Yasmin Santos, whom Cuenca met in Angat, Bulacan.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

== Association with Ferdinand Marcos ==
Cuenca financially donated to Ferdinand Marcos' first presidential campaign in 1965.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt; In his second year of presidency, Marcos awarded large-scale projects to Cuenca's company, Cuenca Construction Company, which later became part of the Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP).&lt;ref name=phreader&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schirmer |first1=Daniel |title=The Philippines Reader: A History of Colonialism, Neocolonialism, Dictatorship, and Resistance |date=1987 |publisher=South End Press |isbn=9780896082755 |page=171 |edition=illustrated |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;lpg=PA171&amp;ots=9944UvjkvI&amp;dq=Rodolfo%20Cuenca%20san%20juanico%20bridge&amp;pg=PA171#v=onepage&amp;q=Rodolfo%20Cuenca%20san%20juanico%20bridge&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Republic Act (RA) 3741, private contractors were allowed to bid for government infrastructure projects. In 1967, CDCP won government contracts to build the Manila North and South Expressways, valued in just over $16 million.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; The company maintained its favored treatment until the early 80s, for the benefit Cuenca and Marcos, both of whom divided and funneled commissions and kickbacks into their own pockets.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

According to Cuenca, it was in also in 1967 when he started joining Marcos to play golf, along with Robert "Bobby" Benedicto, the latter's classmate in UP Law School, and the former's close friend since the 1950s.&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/the-philippines-during-the-martial-law/|title=It Takes a Village to Loot a Nation: Cronyism and Corruption|last=|first=|date=|website=Martial Law Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100929"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Doronila |first1=Amando |title=The power brokers during martial law |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer/20100929/283051230787608 |accessdate=12 June 2018 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These frequent golf sessions would continue well into the Martial Law era. For Marcos' re-election campaign in 1969, Cuenca again played the role of fundraiser.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

== Tenure as Construction and Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) Chairman ==
Cuenca's chairmanship of Construction &amp; Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) began in 1967, and lasted until 1983.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; It was during this period that Cuenca acquired much of his wealth, properties, and companies.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Between these years, CDCP experienced a rapid rise of profits, mainly through what critics called "bloated" government contracts.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; These profits then suddenly plummeted, due to accumulation of government debts and unnecessary expenses.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{Explain|date=July 2018}}

=== CDCP Projects ===
Cuenca's company was involved with many projects, which were constructed at the behest of Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, [[Imelda Marcos]].&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;  These included the Manila North and South Luzon Expressways, the [[San Juanico Bridge]], Imelda Marcos' Manila Bay Reclamation Project, and the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail Transit (LRT)]].

====Manila North and South Luzon Expressways====
The first major government contract CDCP was awarded were for the construction of Manila North and South Luzon Expressways.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; By the end of 1968, the first phase of the Manila North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) was open to the public, the road measuring 28 kilometers towards Guiginto Bulacan from Balintawak. In the same year of 1968, construction for the Manila South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) began. The initial 16-kilometer stretch from Nichols to Alabang was finished by 1970.&lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;

These contracts also allowed CDCP to gain back their expenditures and/or capital &lt;ref name="Dalisay2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; by collecting toll fees for a decade, "starting from 1968 or until it accumulated $6.1 million, whichever came first."&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; CDCP, however, requested that the duration be extended, as well the amount increased, justifying that their cost of operations had also inflated, and that they were held responsible "not only to maintain the highways but also to improve and 'expand' them."&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; Although a TRB report showed evidence that CDCP has amassed $25.6 million already in one year alone from 1976–77, TRB approved their request and extended the duration to thirty years. Presidential Decrees (PD) 1112 and 1113 in 1977 also imposed an increase in toll rates, forcing the public to pay steep fees that would primarily benefit CDCP and Cuenca's pocket.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; During a 1975 toll hike, buses boycotted the NLEX and SLEX roads. The Marcos administration retaliated by releasing a PD that closed service roads for buses, which then had no choice to pass through the expressways.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumCronyism" /&gt;

==== San Juanico Bridge ====
{{main|San Juanico Bridge}}
In 1974, the Marcos administration and the CDCP tapped Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA) loans&lt;ref name="IBON2005"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/68191461 |title=Fifty years of Japan ODA : a critical review for ODA reform : Reality of Aid Asia-Pacific 2005 report. |date=2005 |publisher=IBON Books |isbn=9710325523 |location=Manila |oclc=68191461}}&lt;/ref&gt; to build the [[San Juanico Bridge]], which crossed the [[San Juanico Strait]] and connected the two then-underdeveloped islands of Leyte and Samar.&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://pcij.org/stories/7-in-10-oda-projects-fail-to-deliver-touted-benefits |title=7 in 10 ODA projects fail to deliver touted benefits |last=Landingin |first=Roel R. |date=2008-02-13 |website=[[Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism]] Website |language=en-US |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012170044/http://pcij.org/stories/7-in-10-oda-projects-fail-to-deliver-touted-benefits |archive-date=2009-10-12 |dead-url=No |access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a total length of {{convert|2.16|km|mi|sp=us}}, it remains the longest bridge spanning a body of seawater in the Philippines.

It was touted as President [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' "birthday gift" to his wife [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]],and &lt;ref name="LyzaSabornido20140917"/&gt; it was one of the high-visibility foreign-loan projects initiated by Marcos during the run-up to the 1969 Presidential election campaign.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Some are smarter than others : the history of Marcos' crony capitalism |last=Ricardo. |first=Manapat, |date=1991 |publisher=Aletheia Publications |isbn=9719128704 |location=New York |oclc=28428684}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Completed four years later, it was inaugurated on July 2, 1973 - Imelda Marcos' birthday.&lt;ref name="LyzaSabornido20140917"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faq.ph/10-facts-you-should-know-about-san-juanico-bridge-in-samar-and-leyte/|title=10 Facts You Should Know about San Juanico Bridge in Samar and Leyte|last=Sabornido|first=Lyza|date=17 September 2014|website=|publisher=FAQ.ph|access-date=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its completion, economists and public works engineers tagged it as a white elephant which was "''constructed several decades too soon''",&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"/&gt; because its average daily traffic (ADT) was too low to justify the cost of its construction.&lt;ref name="RoelLandingin20080213"/&gt; As a result, its construction has been associated with what has been called the Marcoses' "''[[edifice complex]]''".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newslab.philstar.com/31-years-of-amnesia/building-spree|title=Edifice complex {{!}} 31 years of amnesia|last=Afinidad-Bernardo|first=Deni Rose M.|date=|website=Philstar|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumEdificeComplex"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://martiallawmuseum.ph/magaral/edifice-complex-building-on-the-backs-of-the-filipino-people/ |title=Edifice Complex: Building on the Backs of the Filipino People |work=Martial Law Museum |access-date=2018-05-01 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the decades after the Marcoses administration, economic activity in Samar and Leyte has finally caught up with the bridge's intended function, and it has become an iconic tourist attraction acknowledged as "''part of the identity of people in Samar and Leyte.''"&lt;ref name="MartialLawMuseumEdificeComplex" /&gt;

==== Manila Bay Reclamation ====
CDCP, again at Imelda's behest sought out a land reclamation project in Manila Bay. They were to construct an artificial 240-hectare white beach behind the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]]. The rationale of the project was to create a 'Cannes' vibe for the  international visitors of the Manila Film Festival. The white sand was quarried from the cities of Mariveles and Cavite. This area is now known to be the [[Bay City, Metro Manila|Manila Bay Freeport Zone]]. Also at Imelda's command, CDCP and other companies worked to create a "huge complex of native-style pavilions"&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; for representatives of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in their 1979 conference in Manila.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt; The complex became a ghost town throughout the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Has it been repurposed since the source cited was published in 1991?|?=yes|date=July 2018}}

==== Light Rail Transit ====
Another project of the CDCP was the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System|Light Rail Transit (LRT)]], this time partly financed by a $40 million loan from the Belgian government.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; A study of the World Bank in 1977 challenged the intentions of the project, stating that Manila needed a street-level transport system, not a 'high-flyer'.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;{{elucidate|date=July 2018}} A street-level transport system would also cost much cheaper, with only a $8.1 million estimate, compared to the $278 million over-all cost for the LRT.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt; Despite these skepticisms, Marcos permitted Cuenca to begin construction in October 1981.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991"/&gt;

==== Other projects ====
Other projects the CDCP under Cuenca handled were the [[Pantabangan Dam]], and the [[Candaba Viaduct]].&lt;ref name=phreader/&gt;

==== Turnover of Chairmanship to Roberto Ongpin ====
Cuenca eventually{{when|date=July 2018}} invited Roberto Ongpin to take his place as CDCP chairman,&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100929" /&gt; although Cuenca kept his position as president, and "7% ownership" of the firm.&lt;ref name="Manapat1991" /&gt;

== 1987 PCGG Case ==
On July 24, 1987, the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG) filed a case whose respondents included Cuenca and his son Roberto,  Imelda Marcos, Roberto Ongpin, former Philippine National Bank president Panfilo O. Domingo, Development Bank of the Philippines officer Don Ferry, and eleven others,&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/06/19/Supreme-Court-ill-gotten-wealth-PCGG-Ferdinand-Marcos-cronies.html) |title=SC junks PCGG's ill-gotten wealth claims vs. Marcos, cronies |last=DeGuzman |first=Chad |date=2018-06-19 |work=CNN Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that the respondents had engaged in “schemes, devices or stratagems” to acquire ill-gotten wealth.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.abs-cbn.com/nation/08/09/10/gov%E2%80%99t-loses-p51-billion-claim-against-marcos-cronies |title=Gov’t loses P51 billion claim against Marcos cronies |date=2010-10-09 |work=ABS CBN News |access-date=2018-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 5, 2010, the Sandiganbayan dismissed the case after throwing out 60 of the 100 documentary exhibits presented by the PCGG at the trial because they were photocopies, rather than original copies of the documents.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;   The 27-page decision penned by Sandiganbayan Associate Justice Alex L. Quiroz,&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;  asserted that “since the due execution and authenticity of said photocopied documents had not been proved, the same were inadmissible in evidence. Further, the documents in question were rendered inadmissible as they were only photocopies.&lt;ref name="”ABSCBN20100809”" /&gt;”

In June 2018, the Philippine Supreme Court’s First Division&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;  dismissed the complaint of the PCGG against the 2010 Sandiganbayan ruling, stating that the Supreme Court was not able to review the evidence in order to rule on the PCGG’s complaint.&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;   The 28-page decision penned by Supreme Court Associate Justice [[Noel Tijam]] &lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;  said that:&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt; "In order to determine the veracity of the Republic's main contention that it has established a prima facie case against respondents through its documentary and testimonial evidence, a reassessment and reexamination of the evidence is necessary&lt;nowiki&gt;[….]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Unfortunately, the limited and discretionary judicial review allowed under Rule 45 does not envision a re-evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence upon which respondent court's action was predicated.&lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt; "

The PCGG released a press statement reacting to the decision, saying "Although the complaint was filed by the PCGG more than 31 years ago, and the Supreme Court decision was a mere affirmation of the Sandiganbayan ruling 8 years ago, the present officials of PCGG will still exhaust all possible legal remedies to pursue the case and to protect government interest.” &lt;ref name="ChadDeGuzman20180619" /&gt;

== 2010 biography ==
In the 2000s, Cuenca sought out authors Jose Dalisay Jr. and Antonette Reyes to write his biography, which was eventually published in September 2010 under the title "''Builder of Bridges: the Rudy Cuenca Story''".&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927" /&gt;

Journalist [[Amando Doronila]], who had himself been one of the first critics arrested when Marcos proclaimed martial law in 1972, noted that "''the book is the first time a Marcos crony or a senior functionary has written about his role in the Marcos hierarchy,''" adding that in the book, "''Rodolfo Cuenca who admits to being a Marcos crony, reveals for the first time an insider’s view of the heightening rivalry among power blocs within the Marcos inner circle as the dictator’s health started to deteriorate in 1983... The book reveals the corruption and the corrosive tensions among the Marcos’ Palace elite that contributed to its downfall during the last three years of the dictatorship.''&lt;ref name="AmandoDoronila20100927" /&gt;"

== Early life ==
Romeo Horton was born to Reverend Daniel Horton and Ora Milner Horton on August 20, 1923 in [[Monrovia, Liberia]].  Horton began his education at the [[Ricks Institute]] in [[Virginia]] under the tutelage of his father who was principal.  Hortons's father transferred to the [[Booker Washington Institute]] (specifically to the Agriculture Department) and Horton also enrolled there and graduated his eighth grade class in 1937. Horton graduated from [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=9kIDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22Romeo+A.+Horton%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hTjPJGwwzj&amp;sig=BmaXZ005Kxsz_cXr9OckYvb1gNE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwifk4KehPLdAhWn7YMKHYUhCicQ6AEwC3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Romeo%20A.%20Horton%22&amp;f=false|title=Jet|last=Company|first=Johnson Publishing|date=1976-11-11|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Rosslyn Analytics was founded in 2007 by Charles Clark and Hugh Cox. The company was named after [[Rosslyn Chapel]] in Midlothian, Scotland, which is famous for its mysterious carvings, believed to contain a message or even music that has never been verifiably decoded. In 2009, the company launched its first cloud-based business intelligence product - a self-service spend analytics app for its RAPid data platform. The offering won awards for innovation and excellence, including the Technology Excellence Award for “Best New Product”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcs.org/content/conWebDoc/35191|title=2009 Technology Excellence Awards winners and medallists - 2009 winners and medallists - 2009 Awards - IT Industry Awards Archive - UK IT Industry Awards - Awards and competitions - Events - BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT|publisher=Bcs.org|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICT Excellence Award for “Best Innovative Service of the Year”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midlandsbusinessnews.co.uk/West-Midlands-ICT-Excellence-Awards-2009-finalists-announced/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150118133621/http://www.midlandsbusinessnews.co.uk/West-Midlands-ICT-Excellence-Awards-2009-finalists-announced/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 January 2015|title=Midlands Business News  West Midlands ICT Excellence Awards 2009 finalists announced - Midlands Business News|work=Midlands Business News|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=Invites user submissions. Contact us notes "Press releases and news items submitted are reviewed as to their news value and suitability for our audience", but PR is not labeled and source is not disclosed.|date=March 2016}}

In April 2011, as a public service to help the UK Government reduce the deficit by getting better control of its purchasing, Rosslyn Analytics offered to provide free spend analytics to the government in just 30 days. The government refused the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spendmatters.com/uk/rosslyn-analytics-govenrment/|title=Rosslyn Analytics p*** off the Government with procurement data analysis offer|work=Spend Matters|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was founded in 1986 as Sabra-Blue &amp; White Foods. The company was bought in 2005 by [[Israel]]i food manufacturer [[Strauss (company)|Strauss]]. In March 2008, Strauss entered a joint-venture partnership with [[Frito-Lay]], a division of the multinational [[PepsiCo]] corporation. Strauss owns 50% and PepsiCo 50% of the company.&lt;ref name=wasserman/&gt;&lt;ref name=sabra/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strauss-group.com/brand/sabra/|title=Strauss Group brands: Sabra|publisher=Strauss Group|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, the company announced the construction of a new $61 million plant in [[Chesterfield County, Virginia]], expected to employ 260 people and come on line in mid-2010.&lt;ref name=kaine&gt;{{cite press release|format=PDF|title=Governor Kaine Announces Sabra Dipping Company Will Open a New Food Manufacturing Plant in Chesterfield County|publisher=Virginia's Gateway Region Economic Development Organization|date=November 19, 2008|url=http://www.gatewayregion.com/uploads/documents/11.19.08_Sabra_Dipping_Company.pdf|accessdate=September 5, 2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pr&gt;{{cite web|title=Sabra Dipping Company, a Joint Venture Between Strauss Group and PepsiCo, Announced Plans to Open a State-of-the-art Plant in Richmond, Virginia|publisher=PRNewswire.uk|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/sabra-dipping-company-a-joint-venture-between-strauss-group-and-pepsico-announced-plans-to-open-a-state-of-the-art-plant-in-richmond-virginia-152873985.html|date=November 24, 2008|accessdate=November 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company grew over 50% between August 2008 and August 2009.&lt;ref name=nyblue/&gt;

By 2016, Sabra had gained a 60% market share of hummus in the United States,&lt;ref name=scott/&gt; and, through its co-ownership and sales channels with [[PepsiCo]], was close to $1 billion in annual sales.&lt;ref name=watson/&gt; To parallel the rising consumer demand for hummus, American farmers have increased their production of chickpeas four-fold since 2009, harvesting more than {{Convert|100000000|lb|kg}} in 2015, up from about {{Convert|25000000|lb|kg}} in 2009.&lt;ref name="justin"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Justin R.

==Marketing==
During the run-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Sabra commissioned sculptor Kirk Rademaker to create [[bust (sculpture)|bust]]s of candidates John McCain, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton out of 100 pounds of hummus.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite news|author=Theresa Howard|title=Ad Track: Winning ads really work for consumers|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2008-06-29-cannes-lion-winners-consumers_N.htm|date=June 30, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025082731/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2008-06-29-cannes-lion-winners-consumers_N.htm|archive-date=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boycott campaigns==
Until 2010, the [[Strauss (company)|Strauss Group]] stated on their English-language website that the company donates food packages to the [[Golani Brigade]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ron Friedman|author2=Stephanie Hodes|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Strauss-reposts-IDF-support-commitment-on-website|title=Strauss reposts IDF-support commitment on website|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michal Toiba|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Strauss-Group-removes-support-for-IDF-from-website|title=Strauss Group removes support for IDF from website|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=November 18, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists in the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] campaign have called for boycotts of Sabra products over the donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qconline.com/news/illinois/depaul-students-reject-ouster-hummus-brand/article_8de4c500-c138-5f4d-9c95-f8edf89bcc0c.html|title=DePaul students reject ouster hummus brand|work=Quad-Cities Online|date=May 25, 2011|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student groups at [[DePaul University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Ottawa]] campaigned unsuccessfully to have their schools switch to alternate brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/1.578824|title=Canadian university students launch Sabra hummus boycott|work=Haaretz.com|date=March 9, 2014|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tamar Lewin|title=New Subject of Debate on Mideast: Hummus|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/education/04hummus.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=December 3, 2010|accessdate=September 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 April 2015, Sabra recalled 30,000 cases of its classic hummus after a tub in Michigan tested positive for ''[[Listeria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rachel Abrams|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/10/business/listeria-in-sabra-hummus-prompts-new-wave-of-recalls.html|title=Listeria in Sabra Hummus Prompts New Wave of Recalls|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 9, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspectors with the [[Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development]] (MDARD) learned of the possible contamination by ''[[Listeria monocytogenes|L. monocytogenes]]'' after routine inspections on March 30th at a [[Kroger]] in [[Port Huron, Michigan|Port Huron]], according to MDARD spokeswoman Jennifer Holton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Erb|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/04/08/listeria-detected-hummus/25491479/|title=Listeria detection prompts national recall by Sabra|publisher=Detroit Free Press|date=April 16, 2015|accessdate=October 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2016, Sabra voluntarily recalled multiple hummus varieties across the U.S. after ''[[Listeria]]'' was discovered at one of its manufacturing plants, though the company stated the bacteria had not been found in any of its actual products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ralph Ellis|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/19/health/hummus-sabra-recalled|title=Sabra hummus products recalled over Listeria concerns|publisher=CNN|date=November 19, 2016|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' (SMCCI) is a non-profit organization, established in 1956 to support the Malay/Muslim business community in Singapore.

==History==
The Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SMCCI) was first established in 1956 as the Singapore Malay Chamber of Commerce (SMCC) by a group of Malay/Muslim businessmen, including the first President of Singapore, [[Yusof Ishak]].&lt;ref name="Majulah"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rasheed |first1=Zainul Abidin |last2=Saat |first2=Norshahril |title=Majulah!: 50 Years of Malay/Muslim Community in Singapore |date=2016 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9814759880 |page=385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uixDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Yusof+Ishak+SMCCI&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JScfDgAiKk&amp;sig=fW9uXWy4jLUmjy2img-r8iRrZto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwif_9W3wYDeAhWMvo8KHdUyDM0Q6AEwD3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Yusof%20Ishak%20SMCCI&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Scientific Series on Singapore's 50 Years of Nation-Building |url=https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/9980 |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment was initially intended to look after the trading interests of  the Malay/Muslim business community, however, its name was later changed to its current name in 1995 to reflect its wider scope.&lt;ref name="Majulah"/&gt;

In 2006, SME Centre @ SMCCI was established as a one-stop centre for local small and medium enterprises (SMEs).&lt;ref name="Majulah2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rasheed |first1=Zainul Abidin |last2=Saat |first2=Norshahril |title=Majulah!: 50 Years of Malay/Muslim Community in Singapore |date=2016 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=9814759880 |page=388 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eHzQDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA388&amp;lpg=PA388&amp;dq=SME+Centre+SMCCI+2006&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fNjawZLqxO&amp;sig=h-wmAIitCI2sFa-v5Q3EAaX09_o&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiE6LyP24PeAhUBXLwKHXgsCB4Q6AEwDXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=SME%20Centre%20SMCCI%202006&amp;f=false |accessdate=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=HomeLocal startup launches app targeting gig economy |url=https://www.theedgesingapore.com/article/local-start-releases-new-mobile-app-targeting-singapore%E2%80%99s-gig-economy |accessdate=13 October 2018 |work=The Edge Singapore |date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the founder and executive chairman of Svani Group, an automotive conglomerate, as well as a founder and Chairman of the Advisory Board of Fidelity Bank, a growing international financial institution.

Svanikier has been at the forefront of Ghana’s economic modernization over the past 25 years, most notably in the automobile and financial sectors.

==Business story==
Thomas Svanikier’s first venture was an automotive import business. Svani Limited, established in 1990, supplied Russian-made Lada cars to Ghanaian industry, NGOs and government agencies, and consumers throughout West Africa. In response to the notable absence of North American automobiles, Svani Limited reintroduced Ford and Lincoln Mercury cars to the Ghanaian market in 1994.

Svanikier quickly expanded his company and renamed it Svani Group. The company imports vehicles, leases, rents and sells cars, and is a distributor of generators and other heavy-duty equipment throughout West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.svanigroup.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=4&amp;Itemid=54|title = About Svani Limited|date = |accessdate = 24 August 2015|website = Svani Limited|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Svani has sold armored vehicles to the Office of the President of Ghana, the U.S. Secret Service in Nigeria, the Governor of Lagos State, and the governments of Liberia and Togo. The group also provides automotive maintenance and specialized equipment to the U.S. Department of State in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://government-contractors.insidegov.com/l/555873/Svani-Ltd-in-Accra|title = Svani Ltd. in Accra - Contracting Profile|date = |accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = InsideGov.com|publisher = Graphiq, Inc.|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svani currently controls about 20% of the global vehicles market in Ghana and has service centers in Accra, Takoradi, Koforidua and Kumasi. Svani is also the sole importer and distributor of Mahindra vehicles, as well as the largest distributor of Toyota Land Cruisers and Ford vehicles in Ghana. In partnership with Svanikier’s company, Mahindra built a motorcycle and pickup truck assembly plant in Accra, Ghana.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artismc.com/index.php/news/article/view/54/988/|title = Mahindra to open auto assembly plant in Ghana|date = 12 August 2013|accessdate = 20 August 2015|website = Artis.com|publisher = Artis Management Consultants Private Limited|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two companies are currently working on the development of a 9.6 acre car assembly and servicing center along the Accra-Tema motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Obour|first1=Samuel K.|title=Svani Motors to establish vehicle assembly plant|url=http://graphic.com.gh/business/business-news/9878-svani-motors-to-establish-vehicle-assembly-plant.html|website=Graphic Online|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=8 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Svani-distributed vehicles have received nominations in Ghana’s Auto Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nominees|url=http://www.ghanaautoawards.com/nominees|website=Ghana Auto Awards|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Svanikier ventured into private equity with the creation of Africa Capital LLC, which invests in transportation, energy, finance, and real estate projects.  As a result, Svanikier is well known in Ghana as a job creator and investor responsible for a significant portion of the economic expansion and modernization between the 1980s and late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Key events in African history : a reference guide|last = Falola|first = Toyin|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9780313361227|location = Westport, Conn.|pages = 321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Africa Capital’s energy subsidiary, Atholl Energy, was lauded by then President John Evans Atta Mills for its joint project with the Siemens group to construct a 180-megawatt power generation plant that greatly augmented Ghana’s power supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President lauds Siemens, Atholl power project|url=http://edmingle.blogspot.com/2010/12/president-lauds-siemens-atholl-power.html|website=Mingle's base|accessdate=28 August 2015|date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa Capital is the largest shareholder of Fidelity Bank in both Ghana and Malaysia. Fidelity is currently the fourth largest bank in Ghana, and is growing rapidly. Fidelity Bank has 98 branches in Ghana and plans to increase that number significantly in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dzawu|first1=Moses|title=Rothschild-Backed Fidelity of Ghana to Double Branches|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-09-01/rothschild-backed-fidelity-of-ghana-to-double-branches|accessdate=28 August 2015|work=BloombergBusiness|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, the bank’s total assets also stood at GHC 3.135 billion.

In July 2015, Svanikier and his wife were invited to be part of U.S. President Barack Obama’s delegation during his official visit to Kenya. Svanikier was also asked to take part in the Global Entrepreneurship Summit organized in Nairobi, Kenya by the U.S. Department of Commerce, at which the president met with leading figures in African business circles.

'''Willem Grasso''' (20 April 1833 – 20 March 1903) was the founder of [[Grasso's industrial refrigeration equipment|Grasso’s Royal Machine Factories Ltd.]]

==Biography==

Grasso was born at [[Tilburg]], the son of a smith. He moved with his family in 1845 to [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. In 1858, he started his own little forge in ’s-Hertogenbosch. In 1868, he built a new factory / living house. Thanks to his good contacts with Jurgens, who had received the rights for producing [[margarine]] in 1871, Willem Grasso was the first to have the chance to produce machines for this fast growing industry. The name Grasso soon would be well known.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In 1894, his son [[Henri Grasso]] would take over the company. In 1896, he started a refrigeration department in [[Vught]]. In 1913, he returned to ’s-Hertogenbosch, when the opportunity came up to build a brand new factory there. In the same year, he was the first in the Netherlands to start producing refrigeration machines, using the name Grasso. He{{who|date=November 2010}} died in [[Boekel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

a few generations later(on the 13th or August in 2003) Willem Patrick Gijsbercht Grasso was born. A young very muscular and intelligent man capable of many things. he started off his life in a Dutch school but later moved on to the English system. Due to many mathematical contests, he made over 6.3 million euros before his sixteenth birthday. Half of his money was sent to charity and the other half he had invested in his own company. Which is now valued over 2.5 billion euros.

The '''Williamson trade-off model''' is a theoretical model in the [[economics]] of [[industrial organization]] which emphasizes the trade-off associated with [[horizontal merger]]s between gains resulting from lower [[marginal cost|costs of production]] and the losses associated with higher [[price]]s due to greater degree of [[monopoly power]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beynon, [https://books.google.com/books?id=26m3RXKUuQIC&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2EzE7a9bfw&amp;sig=B1AVpfWqnzC70fm35GJso3iNedQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=TGJNS--gM5X2NYWx2O4M&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "The Routledge critical dictionary of global economics"], Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was first presented by [[Oliver Williamson]] in his 1968 paper "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs" in the ''[[American Economic Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Oliver, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831653 "Economies as an Antitrust Defense: The welfare tradeoffs"], The ''American Economic Review'', Vol. 58, No. 1 (March 1968), pp. 18–36&lt;/ref&gt; Williamson argued that ignoring efficiencies that may result from proposed mergers in antitrust law "fail[ed] to meet the basic test of economic rationality".&lt;ref&gt;Katalin Judit Cseres, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ov6Vr9ev57MC&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e3EjP3DuHN&amp;sig=2pKrldsGbpaPlwTodsQoWzSlpjo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mmVNS9ehCJT4NY2wgOoM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20&amp;f=false "Competition law and consumer protection"], Kluwer Law International, 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WilliamsonTOmodel.JPG|thumb|300px|Graphical illustration of the Williamson trade-off model]]

==Basic idea of the model==

Suppose that a given industry is initially characterized by [[perfect competition]] and has a constant unit cost of production equal to ''c1'' (assumed the same across all firms in the industry). Because of competition, the market price of the good produced will be equal to this unit cost, which means that firms in the industry earn [[normal profit]]s, as captured by the [[producer surplus]] (the area below the market price, but above the supply/unit cost curve).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

Suppose further that after a merger between firms in the industry takes place, unit costs fall to ''c2&lt;c1'' as a result of [[economies of scale]] or other forms of [[synergy]]. However, the industry is now less competitive, with a [[monopoly]] being the most extreme example. Since the firm is no longer a [[price-taking|price taker]], the price it charges will be above the (now lower) unit cost. For a monopoly, for example, the price will be set where the unit/marginal cost intersects [[marginal revenue]]. This means that the amount of [[consumer surplus]], the area below the demand curve and above the price, will be lower.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

The change in overall [[social surplus]] of the market depends on whether the increase in producer surplus due to lower production costs is larger or smaller than the fall in consumer surplus due to higher prices. Note that it is theoretically possible that the fall in unit costs due to the merger could be sufficiently large that the post merger monopoly price ends up being lower than the pre merger competitive price in which case both producer and consumer surplus would increase. In that situation no trade-off exists and the merger is unambiguously beneficial to all market participants. More generally however, a horizontal merger can involve both costs and benefits.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

==Applications in antitrust policy==

One implication of the Williamson model is that the gains from cost reduction do not have to be "large" in order to outweigh the losses that result from higher prices.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
This is because the welfare losses associated with the latter tend to be "second-order" (graphically, they are triangles), while the gains tend to be "first-order" (rectangles). What this means is that the gains from the merger would have to be very small, or alternatively, the demand for the good in question would have to be relatively quite [[Price elasticity of demand|inelastic]] for social surplus to decrease.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;

A broader conclusion of the model is that [[Competition law|antitrust]], or competition, policy should be "discretionary".&lt;ref name=CLP&gt;C. L. Pass, Bryan Lowes, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ffoNAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QlHt5pe8fZ&amp;sig=mPH4gLVvdECPF4N0agXsdwZ5sZE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Business and microeconomics: an introduction to the market economy"], Routledge, 1994, p. 175-178&lt;/ref&gt; That is, government regulators who are faced with a proposed merger need to examine each proposal on a case by case basis. In some instances, the cost savings might make it worth the loss of competition, while in others they will not. This is in contrast to a "non-discretionary" policy where regulators set certain standards that any industry must meet - for example, that no firm has more than 20% market share. Then, they do not actually examine the potential gains or losses to consumer or producer surplus from a proposed merger, but only its impact on meeting the set standard - for example, whether or not the merger will increase a single firm's market share above 20%.&lt;ref name=CLP/&gt;

The model has been applied to the study of mergers in the US rail freight industry and the US food industry, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Ivaldi, Marc
and McCullough, Gerard, [http://www.cepr.org/pubs/new-dps/dplist.asp?dpno=5000 "Welfare Trade-Offs in US Rail Mergers"], Centre for Economic Policy Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanjib Bhuyan, [http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/20469/1/sp01bh01.pdf "Impact of Vertical Mergers on Food Industry Profitability: An Empirical Evaluation"]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used in evaluation of actual antitrust laws by American legal scholar and judge [[Robert Bork]].&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;Richard Fink, [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119536139/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 "General and partial equilibruim theory in Bork's antitrust analysis"], paper delivered at the Annual Western Economic Association International Conference, Las Vegas, Nevada, June 24–28, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; A regulatory approach based on the model was popular in the United States in the 1980s and influenced much antitrust legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick A McNutt, "Signalling, Strategy and Management Type" [http://www.patrickmcnutt.com/docs/Chapter%207%20Antitrust%20And%20Public%20Policy.pdf Chapter 7, Antitrust &amp; Public Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and limitations==

#The "trade-off" in the Williamson model involves a gain in producers' (firms') surplus and a loss in consumers' surplus. Thus, in focusing the analysis on total surplus, it neglects distributional issues and treats changes in both consumers' and producers' welfare symmetrically. However, anti-trust policy as actually practiced in many countries ([[Europe]], [[Canada]] and [[United States|US]]) appears to have the goal of maximizing consumer surplus (or this goal is stated explicitly).&lt;ref name=Zulfi&gt;S. Zulfi Sadeque, Competition Bureau, Industry Canada, Government of Canada, [http://www.apeccp.org.tw/doc/Workshop/w1996/doc8.htm "Some Aspects of Competition Policy: the View from Canada"], APEC Workshop on Competition Policy and Deregulation, August 17–18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, as long as the post-merger market price is higher than pre-merger, the fact that producer surplus and firm profits rise is immaterial from the point of view of the regulators. In that case, only those mergers in which the fall in unit cost is sufficiently large to ensure a lower price after the merger should be permitted.&lt;ref name=AnP&gt;Michael Whinston in Mark Armstrong, Robert Porter, eds. [https://books.google.com/books?id=bvrn72h8dDwC&amp;pg=PT449&amp;lpg=PT449&amp;dq=Williamson+trade-off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=suaMKWbVit&amp;sig=7NbiL-LKBviWCutjwAFTGPGD88U&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3G9KS63OOoe0tgf1l9nkDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade-off%20model&amp;f=false "Handbook of industrial organization, Volume 3"], Elsevier, 2007, p. 2373-2375&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the Williamson model is not applicable in [[European Community competition law]] and is controversial in Canada.&lt;ref name=Monti&gt;Giorgio Monti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hHe2PklOqPUC&amp;pg=PT292&amp;lpg=PT292&amp;dq=Williamson+trade+off+model&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hJXOk9GH_P&amp;sig=P5OnAH62CPCxHSLGDN97qysclZY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FmNNS7e4KInUM-W-9fcM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Williamson%20trade%20off%20model&amp;f=false "EC competition law"], Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;
#The simplest version of the model compares a situation where initially the market is competitive to a situation where the post-merger market is not. However, if initially price exceeds marginal cost (i.e. the market is not competitive), further increases in price have a "first order" effect on consumer surplus (graphically, they are trapezoids).&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model is limited in that it only considers the effect of the merger on price charged by the firm(s). However, in most real life situations, firms compete on many other aspects other than price, for example product quality, capacity, research and development, and product differentiation. These variables are also likely to be affected by a merger and the basic model does not capture these effects. However, the model can and has been extended in these directions by more recent work.&lt;ref name=AnP/&gt;
#The model ignores the possibilities that the same cost reductions and efficiency gains (once technologically feasible) may arise on their own due without any need for a merger,&lt;ref name=Paddy&gt;Paddy McNutt, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qZTdn1JtFV4C&amp;cd=1e "Law, economics and antitrust: towards a new perspective"], Edward Elgar Publishing, 2005, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; for example via own-firm investment.
