"'''Art for art's sake'''" is the usual [[English language|English]] rendering of a [[French language|French]] [[slogan]] from the early 19th century, "'''''l'art pour l'art'''''", and expresses a philosophy that the intrinsic value of art, and the only "true" art, is divorced from any [[didactic]], moral, or utilitarian function. Such works are sometimes described as "[[autotelic]]", from the Greek ''autoteles'', "complete in itself", a concept that has been expanded to embrace "inner-directed" or "self-motivated" human beings.

The term is sometimes used commercially. A Latin version of this phrase ("'''''ARS GRATIA ARTIS'''''") is used as a motto by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and appears in the circle around the roaring head of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] in its [[motion picture]] logo. &lt;!--Also, Delta House from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House use it as their motto, as can be seen on their fraternity flag.--&gt;

==History==
"''L'art pour l'art''" (translated as "art for art's sake") is credited to [[Théophile Gautier]] (1811–1872), who was the first to adopt the phrase as a slogan in the preface to his 1835 book, ''Mademoiselle de Maupin''. Gautier was not, however, the first to write those words: they appear in the works of [[Victor Cousin]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake retrieved 23 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Constant]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. For example, Poe argues in his essay "[[The Poetic Principle]]" (1850):

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake [...] and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force: – but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, '''this poem written solely for the poem's sake'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"Art for art's sake" was a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[creed]] in the nineteenth century, a slogan raised in defiance of those who – from [[John Ruskin]] to the much later [[Communism|Communist]] advocates of [[socialist realism]] – thought that the value of art was to serve some [[moral]] or [[Didacticism|didactic]] purpose. "Art for art's sake" affirmed that art was valuable ''as'' art, that artistic pursuits were their own justification and that art did not need moral justification – and indeed, was allowed to be morally neutral or subversive.

In fact, [[James McNeill Whistler]] wrote the following in which he discarded the accustomed role of art in the service of the state or official religion, which had adhered to its practice since the [[Counter-Reformation]] of the sixteenth century: "Art should be independent of all claptrap – should stand alone [...] and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Such a brusque dismissal also expressed the artist's distancing himself from [[Sentimentality|sentimentalism]]. All that remains of [[Romanticism]] in this statement is the reliance on the artist's own eye and sensibility as the arbiter.

The explicit slogan is associated in the history of English art and letters with [[Walter Pater]] and his followers in the [[aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]], which was self-consciously in rebellion against [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] moralism. It first appeared in English in two works published simultaneously in 1868: Pater's review of [[William Morris]]'s poetry in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' and in ''[[William Blake]]'' by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. A modified form of Pater's review appeared in his ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873), one of the most influential texts of the Aesthetic Movement.

In Germany, the poet [[Stefan George]] was one of the first artists to translate the phrase ("''Kunst für die Kunst''") and adopt it for his own literary programme which he presented in the first volume of his literary magazine ''Blätter für die Kunst'' (1892). He was inspired mainly by [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] whom he had met in Paris, where he was friends with Albert Saint-Paul and consorted with the circle around [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].

==Criticism==

[[George Sand]] wrote in 1872 that ''L'art pour l'art'' was an empty phrase, an idle sentence. She asserted that artists had a "duty to find an adequate expression to convey it to as many souls as possible," ensuring that their works were accessible enough to be appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of George Sand, Vol 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] claimed that there is no art for art’s sake:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the purpose of moral preaching and of improving man has been excluded from art, it still does not follow by any means that art is altogether purposeless, aimless, senseless — in short, ''l'art pour l'art'', a worm chewing its own tail. "Rather no purpose at all than a moral purpose!" — that is the talk of mere passion. A psychologist, on the other hand, asks: what does all art do? does it not praise? glorify? choose? prefer? With all this it strengthens or weakens certain valuations. Is this merely a "moreover"? an accident? something in which the artist's instinct had no share? Or is it not the very presupposition of the artist's ability? Does his basic instinct aim at art, or rather at the sense of art, at life? at a desirability of life? Art is the great stimulus to life: how could one understand it as purposeless, as aimless, as ''l'art pour l'art''?&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an Untimely Man,” §24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary [[postcolonial]] African writers such as [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Chinua Achebe]] have criticised the slogan as being a limited and Eurocentric view on art and creation. In "Black African Aesthetics," Senghor argues that "art is functional" and that "in black Africa, 'art for art's sake' does not exist." Achebe is more scathing in his collection of essays and criticism entitled ''Morning Yet on Creation Day'', where he asserts that "art for art's sake is just another piece of deodorised dog shit" (sic).&lt;ref&gt;Achebe, Chinua. ''Morning Yet on Creation Day''. Michigan: Heinemann Educational, 1975. Page 19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Benjamin]] discusses the slogan in his seminal 1936 essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]." He first mentions it in regard to the reaction within the realm of traditional art to innovations in reproduction, in particular [[photography]]. He even terms the "L'art pour l'art" slogan as part of a "[[theology]] of art" in bracketing off social aspects. In the Epilogue to the essay Benjamin discusses the links between [[fascism]] and art. His main example is that of [[Futurism]] and the thinking of its mentor [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. One of the slogans of the Futurists was "Fiat ars - pereat mundus" ("Let art be created, though the world perish"). Provocatively, Benjamin concludes that as long as fascism expects war "to supply the artistic gratification of a sense of perception that has been changed by technology," then this is the "consummation," the realization, of "L'art pour l'art."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," in ''Illuminations'', Fontana Press, London, 1973, 23. {{ISBN|0-00-686248-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Rivera]] claims that the "art for art's sake" theory would further divide the rich from the poor. Rivera goes on to say that since one of the characteristics of so called "pure art" was that it could only be appreciated by a few superior people, the art movement would strip art from its value as a social tool and ultimately make art into a currency-like item that would only be available to the rich. &lt;ref&gt;http://photo-soup.org/wp2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rivera-Diego-The-revolutionary-spirit-in-modern-art.pdf; pg.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] said: "There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. [[Proletarian]] literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as [[Lenin]] said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine."&lt;ref&gt;"Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art" (May 1942), ''Selected Works'', Vol. III, p. 86. Via ''[[Quotations of Chairman Mao Zedong]]'', accessed via the [[Marxists Internet Archive]] [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch32.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blind men and elephant.jpg|thumb|Blind men and elephant]]
The [[parable]] of the '''blind men and an elephant''' originated in the ancient [[Indian subcontinent]], from where it has been widely diffused. However the meaning of the popular [[proverb]] differs in other countries. It is a story of a group of blind men, who have never come across an [[elephant]] before and who learn and conceptualize what the elephant is like by touching it. Each blind man feels a different part of the elephant's body, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then describe the elephant based on their limited experience and their descriptions of the elephant are different from each other. In some versions, they come to suspect that the other person is dishonest and they come to blows. The moral of the parable is that humans have a tendency to claim absolute truth based on their limited, subjective experience as they ignore other people's limited, subjective experiences which may be equally true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}, '''Quote:''' The ancient Hindu parable of the six blind men and the elephant...."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="snyder12"/&gt;

The first version of the story itself is traceable to the Buddhist text ''Udana 6.4'', dated to about mid 1st millennium BCE. According to John Ireland, the parable is likely older than the Buddhist text.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"&gt;{{cite book|author=John D. Ireland|title=Udana and the Itivuttaka: Two Classics from the Pali Canon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kIllG8k-OmIC |year=2007|publisher=Buddhist Publication Society|isbn=978-955-24-0164-0|pages=9, 81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternate version of the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or feeling a large object while being blindfolded. They then describe what it is they have experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] texts of 1st millennium CE or before.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul J. Griffiths|title=An Apology for Apologetics: A Study in the Logic of Interreligious Dialogue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7jRKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|year=2007|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-55635-731-2|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt; The story also appears in 2nd millennium [[Sufi]] and [[Baha'i Faith|Bahá’í]] lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet [[John Godfrey Saxe]] creating [[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|his own version]] as a poem, with a final verse that explains that the elephant is a metaphor for God, and the various blind men represent religions that disagree on something no one has fully experienced.&lt;ref name="Gardner1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Gardner|title=Famous Poems from Bygone Days|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lTRorcYPLH0C&amp;pg=PA124|accessdate=2012-08-25|date=1 September 1995|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-28623-5|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted in a variety of ways.

==The parable==
{{anchor|The story}}
The earliest versions of the parable of blind men and elephant is found in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts, as they discuss the limits of perception and the importance of complete context. The parable has several Indian variations, but broadly goes as follows:&lt;ref name=goldstein492&gt;{{cite book|author=E. Bruce Goldstein|title=Encyclopedia of Perception|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6M3NSNm6MlkC&amp;pg=PA492|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-4081-8|page=492}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12&gt;{{cite book|author1=C.R. Snyder|author2=Carol E. Ford|title=Coping with Negative Life Events: Clinical and Social Psychological Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Bo7gBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12|year= 2013|publisher=Springer Science |isbn=978-1-4757-9865-4|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said: "We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they groped about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said "This being is like a thick snake". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, the elephant is a pillar like a tree-trunk. The blind man who placed his hand upon its side said, "elephant is a wall". Another who felt its tail, described it as a rope. The last felt its tusk, stating the elephant is that which is hard, smooth and like a spear.}}

[[File:Illustrated proverb- Blind men and an elephant.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The blind men and the elephant &lt;br /&gt; (wall relief in Northeast Thailand)]]
In some versions, the blind men then discover their disagreements, suspect the others to be not telling the truth and come to blows. The stories also differ primarily in how the elephant's body parts are described, how violent the conflict becomes and how (or if) the conflict among the men and their perspectives is resolved. In some versions, they stop talking, start listening and collaborate to "see" the full elephant. In another, a sighted man enters the parable and describes the entire elephant from various perspectives, the blind men then learn that they were all partially correct and partially wrong. While one's subjective experience is true, it may not be the totality of truth.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;

The parable has been used to illustrate a range of truths and [[fallacies]]; broadly, the parable implies that one's subjective experience can be true, but that such experience is inherently limited by its failure to account for other truths or a totality of truth. At various times the parable has provided insight into the relativism, opaqueness or inexpressible nature of truth, the behavior of experts in fields of contradicting theories, the need for deeper understanding, and respect for different perspectives on the same object of observation.

==Hinduism==
The ''Rigveda'', dated to have been composed between 1500 and 1200 BCE, states "Reality is one, though wise men speak of it variously." According to Paul J. Griffiths, this premise is the foundation of universalist perspective behind the parable of the blind men and an elephant. The hymn asserts that the same reality is subject to interpretations and described in various ways by the wise.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; In the oldest version, four blind men walk into a forest where they meet an elephant. In this version, they do not fight with each other, but conclude that they each must have perceived a different beast although they experienced the same elephant.&lt;ref name="Griffiths2007p46"/&gt; The expanded version of the parable occurs in various ancient and Hindu texts. Many scholars refer to it as a Hindu parable.&lt;ref name=goldstein492/&gt;&lt;ref name=snyder12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite book|author=Chad Meister|title=Philosophy of Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1egYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |year=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-137-31475-8|pages=11–12}};&lt;br&gt;[b] {{cite book|author1=Jeremy P.

The parable or references appear in ''[[bhasya]]'' (commentaries, secondary literature) in the Hindu traditions. For example, [[Adi Shankara]] mentions it in his ''bhasya'' on verse 5.18.1 of the ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|
''etaddhasti darshana iva jatyandhah''

Translation: That is like people blind by birth in/when viewing an elephant.

==Jainism==
[[File:Medieval Jain temple Anekantavada doctrine artwork.jpg|thumb|left|Seven blind men and an elephant parable at a Jain temple]]
The medieval era Jain texts explain the concepts of ''[[anekāntavāda]]'' (or "many-sidedness") and ''[[Anekantavada#Sy.C4.81dv.C4.81da|syādvāda]]'' ("conditioned viewpoints") with the [[parable]] of the blind men and an elephant (''Andhgajanyāyah''), which addresses the manifold nature of truth. For example, this parable are found in ''Tattvarthaslokavatika'' of [[Vidyananda (8th-century Jain monk)|Vidyanandi]] (9th century) and ''Syādvādamanjari'' of Ācārya Mallisena (13th century). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they ''do'' understand, they deny the aspects they ''don't'' understand. "Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'', 14:103–104. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full  picture of reality. "It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere sprouts (i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition), on the maxim of the blind (men) and the elephant."&lt;ref&gt;Mallisena, ''Syādvādamanjari'',  19:75–77. Dhruva, A.B. (1933) pp. 23–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
[[File:Blind monks examining an elephant.jpg|right|thumb|380px|''Blind monks examining an elephant'', an [[ukiyo-e]] print by [[Hanabusa Itchō]] (1652–1724).]]
[[Gautama Buddha|The Buddha]] twice uses the simile of blind men led astray. The earliest known version occurs in the text ''[[Udana]] 6.4''.&lt;ref name="Ireland2007p9"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gomez | first=Luis O. | title=Proto-Madhyamika in the Pali Canon | journal=Philosophy East and West | publisher=Univ of Hawaii Press | volume=26 | issue=2 | year=1976 | doi=10.2307/1398186 | page=164 note 73; 137–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Canki Sutta'' he describes a row of blind men holding on to each other as an example of those who follow an old text that has passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html Accesstoinsight.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628152156/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.095x.than.html |date=2006-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Udana]] (68–69)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.katinkahesselink.net/tibet/blind-men-elephant.html Katinkahesselink.net]&lt;/ref&gt; he uses the elephant parable to describe sectarian quarrels. A king has the blind men of the capital brought to the palace, where an elephant is brought in and they are asked to describe it.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the blind men had each felt a part of the elephant, the king went to each of them and said to each: 'Well, blind man, have you seen the elephant? Tell me, what sort of thing is an elephant?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The men assert the elephant is either like a pot (the blind man who felt the elephant's head), a [[winnowing|winnowing basket]] (ear), a [[plowshare]] (tusk), a [[plow]] (trunk), a [[granary]] (body), a [[Column|pillar]] (foot), a [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] (back), a [[pestle]] (tail) or a brush (tip of the tail).

The men cannot agree with one another and come to blows over the question of what it is like and their dispute delights the king. The Buddha ends the story by comparing the blind men to preachers and scholars who are blind and ignorant and hold to their own views: "Just so are these preachers and scholars holding various views blind and unseeing.... In their ignorance they are by nature quarrelsome, wrangling, and disputatious, each maintaining reality is thus and thus." The Buddha then speaks the following verse:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O how they cling and wrangle, some who claim
For preacher and monk the honored name!
For, quarreling, each to his view they cling.
Such folk see only one side of a thing.&lt;ref name=Buddhist&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rywang/berkeley/258/parable.html |title=The Blind Men and the Elephant |first =Randy |last=Wang |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Sufism==
[[File:Blind men and elephant4.jpg|thumb|Blind men and the elephant.]]
The [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Sufi]] [[poet]] [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazni]] (currently, [[Afghanistan]]) presented this [[teaching story]] in his ''The Walled Garden of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Included in [[Idries Shah]], ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'' {{ISBN|0-900860-47-2}} [[Octagon Press]] 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rumi]], the 13th Century Persian poet and teacher of Sufism, included it in his [[Masnavi]]. In his retelling, "The Elephant in the Dark", some Hindus bring an elephant to be exhibited in a dark room. A number of men touch and feel the elephant in the dark and, depending upon where they touch it, they believe the elephant to be like a water spout (trunk), a fan (ear), a pillar (leg) and a throne (back). Rumi uses this story as an example of the limits of individual perception:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The sensual eye is just like the palm of the hand. The palm has not the means of covering the whole of the beast.&lt;ref name="Rumi"&gt;{{cite web |title=71 – The Elephant in the dark, on the reconciliation of contrarieties |url=http://www.khamush.com/tales_from_masnavi.htm#The%20Elephant |work=Rumi – Tales from Masnavi |date=2004-05-09 |first=A.J. |last= Arberry |accessdate=2006-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi does not present a resolution to the conflict in his version, but states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The eye of the Sea is one thing and the foam another. Let the foam go, and gaze with the eye of the Sea. Day and night foam-flecks are flung from the sea: oh amazing! You behold the foam but not the Sea. We are like boats dashing together; our eyes are darkened, yet we are in clear water.&lt;ref name="Rumi" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi ends his poem by stating "If each had a candle and they went in together the differences would disappear." &lt;ref&gt;For an adaptation of Rumi's poem, see this song version by David Wilcox [http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009233459/http://davidwilcox.com/index.php?page=songs&amp;display=1998&amp;category=Out_Beyond_Ideas |date=October 9, 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Godfrey Saxe==
One of the most famous versions of the 19th century was the poem "[[s:The Blind Men and the Elephant|The Blind Men and the Elephant]]" by [[John Godfrey Saxe]] (1816–1887).
[[File:Blind men and elephant3.jpg|right|thumb|350px|
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;And so these men of Indostan&lt;ul&gt;Disputed loud and long,&lt;/ul&gt;Each in his own opinion&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ul&gt;Exceeding stiff and strong,&lt;/ul&gt;Though each was partly in the right&lt;ul&gt;And all were in the wrong!&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}]]
The poem begins:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;It was six men of Indostan
    To learning much inclined,
Who went to see the Elephant
    (Though all of them were blind),
That each by observation
    Might satisfy his mind&lt;ref name=Saxe&gt;{{cite wikisource|plaintitle=The poems of John Godfrey Saxe|chapter=The Blind Men and the Elephant|last=Saxe|first=John Godfrey|authorlink=John Godfrey Saxe|wspage=260|scan=Page:The poems of John Godfrey Saxe.djvu/279}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Each in his own opinion concludes that the elephant is like a wall, snake, spear, tree, fan or rope, depending upon where they had touched. Their heated debate comes short of physical violence, but the conflict is never resolved.
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
    '''Moral:'''
So oft in theologic wars,
    The disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance
    Of what each other mean,
And prate about an Elephant
    Not one of them has seen!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[Natalie Merchant]] sang this poem in full on her [[Leave Your Sleep]] album (Disc 1, track 13).

== The meaning as proverb by country or domain ==
=== Japan ===
In Japan, the proverb is used as a simile of circumstance that ordinary men often fail to understand a great man or his great work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=日本国語大辞典|last=|first=|work=小学館国語辞典編集部|publisher=小学館|year=2001-04-20|isbn=4-09-521004-4|edition=2|volume=4 きかく～けんう|location=Tokyo|pages=1188|language=ja|chapter=群盲象を評す}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern treatments==
The story is seen as a [[metaphor]] in many disciplines, being pressed into service as an [[analogy]] in fields well beyond the traditional. In [[physics]], it has been seen as an analogy for the [[wave–particle duality]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9DWim3RhymsC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=wave+particle+duality+elephant+blind+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6G_1s_oA6v&amp;sig=UaEauX5CaISP-azpgp0NXQCRwU0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YYaOS7WbOKf20gSH8-zmDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=wave%20particle%20duality%20elephant%20blind%20men&amp;f=false ''Quantum theory''] by David Bohm, p. 26. Retrieved 2010-03-03.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[biology]], the way the blind men hold onto different parts of the elephant has been seen as a good analogy for the [[Polyclonal B cell response]].&lt;ref&gt;See for instance ''The lymph node in HIV pathogenesis'' by Michael M. Lederman and Leonid Margolis, ''Seminars in Immunology'', Volume 20, Issue 3, June 2008, pp. 187–195.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Blind men and elephant.png|thumb|"Blind men and elephant", &lt;small&gt;from Martha Adelaide Holton &amp; Charles Madison Curry, ''Holton-Curry readers''&lt;/small&gt;, 1914.]]The fable is one of a number of tales that cast light on the response of hearers or readers to the story itself. [[Idries Shah]] has commented on this element of [[self-reference]] in the many interpretations of the story, and its function as a [[teaching stories|teaching story]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...people address themselves to this story in one or more [...] interpretations. They then accept or reject them. Now they can feel happy; they have arrived at an opinion about the matter. According to their conditioning they produce the answer. Now look at their answers. Some will say that this is a fascinating and touching allegory of the presence of God. Others will say that it is showing people how stupid mankind can be. Some say it is anti-scholastic. Others that it is just a tale copied by Rumi from Sanai – and so on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idriesshah.info/Shah/ShahTeaStor.htm |title=The Teaching Story: Observations on the Folklore of Our "Modern" Thought |first=Idries |last=Shah |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shah adapted the tale in his book ''[[The Dermis Probe]]''. This version begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their conflicting conclusions on the material upon which a camera is focused. As the camera slowly zooms out it gradually becomes clear that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen. This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]]. The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the London and New York film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm Octagon Press page for The Dermis Probe] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726115510/http://www.octagonpress.com/titles/books/depr.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, with preview of story&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockethouse.co.uk/Elephant/|title=touching the elephant|publisher=The Rockethouse|accessdate=21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story enjoys a continuing appeal, as shown by the number of illustrated children's books of the fable; there is one for instance by [[Paul Galdone]] and another, ''Seven Blind Mice'', by [[Ed Young (illustrator)|Ed Young]] (1992).

In the title cartoon of one of his books, cartoonist [[Sam Gross]] postulated that one of the blind men, encountering a pile of the elephant feces, concluded that "An elephant is soft and mushy."

An [[elephant joke]] inverts the story in the following way:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Six blind elephants were discussing what men were like. After arguing they decided to find one and determine what it was like by direct experience. The first blind elephant felt the man and declared, 'Men are flat.' After the other blind elephants felt the man, they agreed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''bystander effect''', or '''bystander apathy''', is a [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychological]] phenomenon in which individuals are less likely to offer help to a victim when other people are present. The greater the number of bystanders, the less likely it is that one of them will help. Several factors contribute to the bystander effect, including [[ambiguity]], [[group cohesiveness]], and [[diffusion of responsibility]] that reinforces mutual denial of a situation's severity.

==Social psychology research==
The bystander effect was first demonstrated and popularized in the laboratory by social psychologists [[John M. Darley]] and [[Bibb Latané]] in 1968 after they became interested in the topic following the [[murder of Kitty Genovese]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darley |first=J. M. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Latané |first2=B. |year=1968 |title=Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=8 |issue= |pages=377–383 |doi= 10.1037/h0025589|url=http://www.wadsworth.com/psychology_d/templates/student_resources/0155060678_rathus/ps/ps19.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers launched a series of experiments that resulted in one of the strongest and most [[Replication (statistics)|replicable]] effects in [[social psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Peter|last2=Krueger|first2=Joachim I.|last3=Greitemeyer|first3=Tobias|last4=Vogrincic|first4=Claudia|last5=Kastenmüller|first5=Andreas|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|last7=Heene|first7=Moritz|last8=Wicher|first8=Magdalena|last9=Kainbacher|first9=Martina|title=The bystander-effect: A meta-analytic review on bystander intervention in dangerous and non-dangerous emergencies.|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0023304|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=137|issue=4|pages=517–537|doi=10.1037/a0023304|pmid=21534650}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical experiment, the participant is either alone or among a group of other participants or confederates. An emergency situation is [[deception (in psychological research)|staged]] and researchers [[dependent variable|measure]] how long it takes the participants to intervene, if they intervene. These experiments have found that the presence of others inhibits helping, often by a large margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hudson |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Amy S. |last2=Bruckman |title=The Bystander Effect: A Lens for Understanding Patterns of Participation |journal=[[Journal of the Learning Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=2 |year=2004 |pages=165–195 |doi=10.1207/s15327809jls1302_2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Bibb Latané and Judith Rodin (1969) staged an experiment around a woman in distress. 70 percent of the people alone called out or went to help the woman after they believed she had fallen and was hurt, but when there were other people in the room only 40 percent offered help.&lt;ref name=Meyers&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyers|first=D. G.|title=Social Psychology (10th Ed)|year=2010|publisher=McGraw- Hill|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-337066-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variables affecting bystanders===

====Emergency versus non-emergency situations====
Latané and Darley performed three experiments to test bystander behavior in non-[[emergency]] situations&lt;ref name="Darley"&gt;Darley, J. M., &amp; Latane, B. (1970). ''The unresponsive bystander: why doesn't he help?'' New York, NY: Appleton Century Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt; Their results indicated that the way in which the subjects were asked for help mattered. In one condition, subjects asked a bystander for his or her name. More people provided an answer when the students gave their name first. In another condition, the students asked bystanders for a dime. When the student gave an explanation, such as saying that their wallet had been stolen, the percentage of people giving assistance was higher (72%) than when the student just asked for a dime (34%). Additional research by Faul, Mark, et al., using data collected by EMS officials when responding to an emergency, indicated that the response of bystanders was correlated with the health severity of the situation.&lt;ref&gt;Faul, M., Aikman, S. N., &amp; Sasser, S. M. (2016). Bystander Intervention Prior to The Arrival of Emergency Medical Services: Comparing Assistance across Types of Medical Emergencies. Prehospital Emergency Care, 1-7. {{DOI|10.3109/10903127.2015.1088605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Latané and Darley, there are five characteristics of emergencies that affect bystanders:&lt;ref name="Darley" /&gt;
#Emergencies involve threat of harm or actual harm
#Emergencies are unusual and rare
#The type of action required in an emergency differs from situation to situation
#Emergencies cannot be predicted or expected
#Emergencies require immediate action

Due to these five characteristics, bystanders go through cognitive and behavioural processes:
#''Notice'' that something is going on
#''Interpret'' the situation as being an emergency
#''Degree of responsibility'' felt
#''Form of assistance''
#''Implement the action choice''

''Notice'':
To test the concept of "noticing," Latane and Darley (1968) staged an emergency using Columbia University students. The students were placed in a room—either alone, with two strangers or with three strangers to complete a questionnaire while they waited for the experimenter to return. While they were completing the questionnaire, smoke was pumped into the room through a wall vent to simulate an emergency. When students were working alone they noticed the smoke almost immediately (within 5 seconds). However, students that were working in groups took longer (up to 20 seconds) to notice the smoke. Latané and Darley claimed this phenomenon could be explained by the social norm of what is considered polite etiquette in public. In most western cultures, politeness dictates that it is inappropriate to idly look around. This may indicate that a person is nosy or rude. As a result, passers-by are more likely to be keeping their attention to themselves when around large groups than when alone. People who are alone are more likely to be conscious of their surroundings and therefore more likely to notice a person in need of assistance.

''Interpret'':
Once a situation has been noticed, a bystander may be encouraged to intervene if they interpret the incident as an emergency. According to the principle of [[Conformity#Informational influence|social influence]], bystanders monitor the reactions of other people in an emergency situation to see if others think that it is necessary to intervene. If it is determined that others are not reacting to the situation, bystanders will interpret the situation as not an emergency and will not intervene. This is an example of [[pluralistic ignorance]] or [[social proof]]. Referring to the smoke experiment, even though students in the groups had clearly noticed the smoke which had become so thick that it was obscuring their vision, irritating their eyes or causing them to cough, they were still unlikely to report it. Only one participant in the group condition reported the smoke within the first four minutes, and by the end of the experiment, no-one from five of eight groups had reported the smoke at all. In the groups that did not report the smoke, the interpretations of its cause, and the likelihood that it was genuinely threatening was also less serious, with no-one suggesting fire as a possible cause, but some preferring less serious explanations, such as the air-conditioner was leaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latané | first1 = B | last2 = Darley | first2 = J.M. | year = 1968 | title = Group inhibition of bystander intervention in emergencies | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 308–324 | doi=10.1037/h0026570}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, interpretations of the context played an important role in people's reactions to a man and woman fighting in the street. When the woman yelled, "Get away from me; I don't know you," bystanders intervened 65 percent of the time, but only 19 percent of the time when the woman yelled, "Get away from me; I don't know why I ever married you."&lt;ref name=Meyers /&gt;

General bystander effect research was mainly conducted in the context of non-dangerous, non-violent emergencies. A study (2006) tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if they would get the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies. In situations with low potential danger, significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person. However, in situations with high potential danger, participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = P. | last2 = Greitemeyer | first2 = T. | last3 = Pollozek | first3 = F. | last4 = Frey | first4 = D. | year = 2006 | title = The unresponsive bystander: Are bystanders more responsive in dangerous emergencies? | url = | journal = European Journal of Social Psychology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 267–278 | doi = 10.1002/ejsp.297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness, it is more likely that people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene.

''Degree of Responsibility'':
Darley and Latané determined that the degree of responsibility a bystander feels is dependent on three things:
#Whether or not they feel the person is deserving of help
#The competence of the bystander
#The relationship between the bystander and the victim

''Forms of Assistance'':
There are two categories of assistance as defined by Latané and Darley:
#Direct intervention: directly assisting the victim
#''Detour'' intervention. Detour intervention refers to reporting an emergency to the authorities (i.e. the police, fire department)

''Implementation'':
After going through steps 1-4, the bystander must implement the action of choice.

In one study done by Abraham S. Ross, the effects of increased responsibility on bystander intervention were studied by increasing the presence of children. This study was based on the reaction of 36 male undergraduates presented with emergency situations. The prediction was that the intervention would be at its peak due to presence of children around those 36 male undergraduate participants. This was experimented and showed that the prediction was not supported, and was concluded as "the type of study did not result in significant differences in intervention."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Abraham |title=Effect of increase responsibility on bystander intervention: presence of children |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |year=1971 |pages=306–310 |doi=10.1037/h0031459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A meta-analysis (2011) of the bystander effect&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 21534650 | doi=10.1037/a0023304 | volume=137 | title=The bystander-effect: a meta-analytic review on bystander intervention in dangerous and non-dangerous emergencies | journal=Psychol Bull | pages=517–37 | last1 = Fischer | first1 = P | last2 = Krueger | first2 = JI | last3 = Greitemeyer | first3 = T | last4 = Vogrincic | first4 = C | last5 = Kastenmüller | first5 = A | last6 = Frey | first6 = D | last7 = Heene | first7 = M | last8 = Wicher | first8 = M | last9 = Kainbacher | first9 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that "The bystander effect was attenuated when situations were perceived as dangerous (compared with non-dangerous), perpetrators were present (compared with non-present), and the costs of intervention were physical (compared with non-physical). This pattern of findings is consistent with the arousal-cost-reward model, which proposes that dangerous emergencies are recognized faster and more clearly as real emergencies, thereby inducing higher levels of arousal and hence more helping." They also "identified situations where bystanders provide welcome physical support for the potentially intervening individual and thus reduce the bystander effect, such as when the bystanders were exclusively male, when they were naive rather than passive confederates or only virtually present persons, and when the bystanders were not strangers."

An alternative explanation has been proposed by [[Stanley Milgram]], who hypothesized that the bystanders′ callous behavior was caused by the strategies they had adopted in daily life to cope with [[information overload]]. This idea has been supported to varying degrees by empirical research.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, K. &amp; Levinson, D. (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=t1geOjQ6R0MC&amp;pg=PA662 Encyclopedia of community: From the village to the virtual world, Band 1], p. 662.&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy Hart and Ternace Miethe used data from the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and found that a bystander was present in 65 percent of the violent [[victimization]]s in the data. Their presence was most common in cases of physical assaults (68%), which accounted for the majority of these violent victimizations and less likely in [[robberies]] (49%) and [[sexual assaults]] (28%). The actions of bystanders were most frequently judged by victims as "neither helping nor hurting" (48%), followed by "helping" (37%), "hurting" (10%), and "both helping and hurting" (3%). Half of the attacks in which a bystander was present occurred in the evening, where the victim and bystander were strangers.&lt;ref name="Hart &amp; Miethe (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=T.|author2=Miethe, T.|title=Exploring Bystander Presence and Intervention in Nonfatal Violent Victimization: When Does Helping Really Help?.|journal=Violence and Victims|year=2008|volume=23|issue=5|pages=637–651|doi=10.1891/0886-6708.23.5.637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ambiguity and consequences====
Ambiguity is one factor that affects whether or not a person assists another in need. In some cases of high ambiguity, it can take a person or group up to 5 times as long before taking action than in cases of low ambiguity. In these cases, bystanders determine their own safety before proceeding. Bystanders are more likely to intervene in low ambiguity, insignificant consequence situations than in high ambiguity, significant consequence situations.

====Understanding of environment====
Whether or not a bystander intervenes may have to do with their familiarity of the environment where the emergency occurs. If the bystander is familiar with the environment, they are more likely to know where to get help, where the exits are, etc.&lt;ref name="Darley" /&gt; Bystanders who are in an environment in which they are not familiar with the surroundings are less likely to give help in an emergency situation.

====Priming the bystander effect====
Research done by Garcia et al. (2002) indicate that priming a social context may inhibit helping behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garcia | first1 = S.M. | last2 = Weaver | first2 = K. | last3 = Darley | first3 = J.M. | last4 = Moskowitz | first4 = G.B. | year = 2002 | title = Crowded minds: the implicit bystander effect | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 843–853 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.83.4.843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagining being around one other person or being around a group of people can affect a person's willingness to help.

====Cohesiveness and group membership====
{{Main|Group cohesiveness}}
Group cohesiveness is another variable that can affect the helping behaviour of a bystander. As defined by Rutkowski et al., cohesiveness refers to an established relationship (friends, acquaintances) between two or more people.&lt;ref name="Cohesive"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rutkowski | first1 = G. K. | last2 = Gruder | first2 = C. L. | last3 = Romer | first3 = D. | year = 1983 | title = Group cohesiveness, social norms, and bystander intervention | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 3| pages = 545–552 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.44.3.545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have been done to test the performance of bystanders when they are in groups with people they have been acquainted with. According to Rutkowski et al., the social responsibility norm affects helping behavior. The norm of social responsibility states that "people should help others who are in need of help and who are dependent on them for it." As suggested by the research, the more cohesive a group, the more likely the group will act in accordance to the social responsibility norm. To test this hypothesis, researchers used undergraduate students and divided them into four groups: a low cohesive group with two people, a low cohesive group with four people, a high cohesive group with two people, and a high cohesive group with four people. Students in the high cohesive group were then acquainted with each other by introducing themselves and discussing what they liked/disliked about school and other similar topics. The point of the experiment was to determine whether or not high cohesive groups were more willing to help a hurt "victim" than the low cohesive groups. The four member high cohesive groups were the quickest and most likely groups to respond to the victim who they believed to be hurt. The four member low cohesive groups were the slowest and least likely to respond to the victim.

[[Altruism]] research suggests that helping behaviour is more likely when there are similarities between the helper and the person being helped. Recent research has considered the role of similarity, and more specifically, shared group membership, in encouraging bystander intervention. In one experiment (2005), researchers found that bystanders were more likely to help an injured person if that person was wearing a football jersey of a team the bystander liked as opposed to a team the bystander did not like. However, when their shared identity as football fans was made salient, supporters of both teams were likely to be helped, significantly more so than a person wearing a plain shirt.&lt;ref name="Levine et al (2005)"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Levine|first=Mark |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Prosser|first2=A |last3=Evans|first3=D |last4=Reicher|first4=S |year=1968 |title=Identity and Emergency Intervention: How social group membership and inclusiveness of group boundaries shape helping behaviours |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] |volume=31 |pages=443–453 |doi=10.1177/0146167204271651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The findings of Mark Levine and Simon Crowther (2008) illustrated that increasing group size inhibited intervention in a street violence scenario when bystanders were strangers, but encouraged intervention when bystanders were friends. They also found that when gender identity is salient, group size encouraged intervention when bystanders and victims shared social category membership. In addition, group size interacted with context-specific norms that both inhibit and encourage helping. The bystander effect is not a generic consequence of increasing group size. When bystanders share group-level psychological relationships, group size can encourage as well as inhibit helping.&lt;ref name="Levine &amp; Crowther (2008)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levine|first=Mark|author2=Crowther, Simon|title=The Responsive Bystander: How Social Group Membership and Group Size Can Encourage as Well as Inhibit Bystander Intervention.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=95|issue=6|pages=1429–1439|doi=10.1037/a0012634|pmid=19025293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These findings can be explained in terms of self-categorization and [[empathy]]. From the perspective of [[self-categorization theory]], a person's own social identity, well-being is tied to their group membership so that when a group based identity is salient, the suffering of one group member can be considered to directly affect the group. Because of this shared identity, referred to as ''self-other merging,'' bystanders are able to empathize, which has been found to predict helping behaviour. For example, in a study relating to helping after eviction both social identification and empathy were found to predict helping. However, when social identification was controlled for, empathy no longer predicted helping behaviour.&lt;ref name="Batson etal (1997)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C Daniel|author2=Karen Sager |author3=Eric Garst |author4=Misook Kang |author5=Kostia Rubchinsky |author6=Karen Dawson |title=Is empathy-induced helping due to self-other merging?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=September 1997|volume=73|issue=3|pages=495–509|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cultural differences====
In discussing the [[Death of Wang Yue|case of Wang Yue]] and a later incident in [[China]], in which [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV footage]] from a [[Shanghai]] [[Rapid transit|subway]] showed passengers fleeing from a foreigner who fainted, [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] anthropologist Yunxiang Yan asserted that the reactions can be explained by deeply seated historical cultural differences in Chinese [[agrarian society]], in which there was a stark contrast between how individuals associated with [[Ingroups and outgroups|ingroup and outgroup]] members, saying, "How to treat strangers nicely is one of the biggest challenges in contemporary Chinese society...The prevailing ethical system in traditional China is based on close-knit community ties, kinship ties."  He continued, "A person might treat other people in the person's social group very, very nicely...But turn around, when facing to a stranger, and (a person might) tend to be very suspicious. And whenever possible, might take advantage of that stranger."&lt;ref name=Langfitt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langfitt|first1=Frank|title=Why Did Crowd Flee Shanghai Subway After Foreigner Fainted?|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2014/09/01/344033379/why-did-crowd-flee-shanghai-subway-after-foreigner-fainted|website=[[NPR]]|accessdate=2 September 2014|date=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;. To amend what happened in this situation for the future, discussions were started by many government departments and officials about punishing bystanders who refuse to help people that clearly need help. On August 1, 2013, the "Good Samaritan" Law was put into effect where people would be penalized for refusing to help in similar situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203752604576645033136435572|title=Toddler's Death Stirs Ire in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Diffusion of responsibility====
{{Main|Diffusion of responsibility}}
Darley and Latané (1968) conducted research on diffusion of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darley | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Latané | first2 = B. | year = 1968 | title = Bystander intervention in emergencies: diffusion of responsibility | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 377–383 | doi=10.1037/h0025589}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings suggest that in the case of an emergency, when people believe that there are other people around, they are less likely or slower to help a victim because they believe someone else will take responsibility. People may also fail to take responsibility for a situation depending on the context. They may assume that other bystanders are more qualified to help, such as [[Physician|doctors]] or [[police officers]], and that their intervention would be unneeded. They may also be afraid of being superseded by a superior helper, offering unwanted assistance, or facing the legal consequences of offering inferior and possibly dangerous assistance. For this reason, some legislations, such as "[[Good Samaritan Law]]s" limit [[Public liability|liability]] for those attempting to provide medical services and non-medical services in an emergency.

===Organizational ombuds practitioners' research===
A 2009 study published by [[International Ombudsman Association]] in the Journal of the International Ombudsman Association suggests that—in reality—there are dozens of reasons why people do not act on the spot or come forward in the workplace when they see behavior they consider unacceptable.&lt;ref name="ioa2009"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Dealing with—or Reporting—'Unacceptable' Behavior—with additional thoughts about the 'Bystander Effect' |year=2009 |first=Mary |last=Rowe |first2=Linda |last2=Wilcox |first3=Howard |last3=Gadlin |journal=Journal of the International Ombudsman Association |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=52–64 |url=http://web.mit.edu/ombud/publications/coming-forward.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important reasons cited for not acting were: the fear of loss of important relationships in and out of the workplace, and a fear of "bad consequences." There also were many reasons given by people who did act on the spot or come forward to authorities.

This practitioners' study suggests that the "bystander effect" can be studied and analyzed in a much broader fashion. The broader view includes not just a) what bystanders do in singular emergencies, b) helping strangers in need, when c) there are (or are not) other people around. The reactions of bystanders can also be analyzed a) when the bystanders perceive any of a wide variety of unacceptable behavior over time, b) they are within an organizational context, and c) with people whom they know. The practitioners' study reported many reasons why some bystanders within organizations do not act or report unacceptable behavior. The study also suggests that bystander behavior is, in fact, often helpful, in terms of ''acting on the spot to help,''and ''reporting'' unacceptable behavior (and emergencies and people in need.) The ombuds practitioners' study suggests that what bystanders will do in real situations is actually very complex, reflecting views of the context and their managers (and relevant organizational structures if any) and also many personal reasons.

In support of the idea that some bystanders do indeed act responsibly, [[Gerald Koocher]] and Patricia Keith Spiegel wrote a 2010 article related to an NIH-funded study which showed that informal intervention by peers and bystanders can interrupt or remedy unacceptable scientific behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Koocher, G. and Spiegel, K. S. "Peers Nip Misconduct in the Bud". (July 22, 2010) Nature 466, 438-440.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''What Would You Do?''===
John Quiñones' primetime show, ''[[Primetime: What Would You Do?|What Would You Do?]]'' on ABC, tests the bystander effect. Actors are used to act out (typically non-emergency) situations while the cameras capture the reactions and actions of innocent bystanders. Topics include cheating on a millionaire test, an elderly person [[shoplifting]], [[racism]] and [[homophobia]].

===Non-computer versus computers: computer mediated intervention===
Research suggests that the bystander effect may be present in [[computer-mediated communication]] situations.&lt;ref name="Markey"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markey | first1 = P.M. | year = 2000 | title = Bystander intervention in computer-mediated communication | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 16 | issue = 2| pages = 183–188 | doi = 10.1016/S0747-5632(99)00056-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence demonstrates that people can be bystanders even when they cannot see the person in distress. In the experiment, 400 online chat groups were observed. One of two confederates were used as victims in each chat room: either a male victim whose screen name was Jake Harmen or a female victim whose screen name was Suzy Harmen. The purpose of the experiment was to determine whether or not the gender of the victim mattered, if the size of each chat group had any effect and if asking for a person's help by directly using their screen name would have any effect.

Results indicated that the gender of the victim had no effect on whether or not a bystander assisted the victim. Consistent with findings of Latané and Darley, the number of people present in the chat room did have an effect. The response time for smaller chat groups was quicker than in the larger chat groups. However, this effect was nonexistent when the victim (Suzy or Jake) asked for help from a specific person in the chat group. The mean response time for groups in which a specific person was called out was 36.38 seconds. The mean response time for groups in which no screen name was pointed out was 51.53 seconds. A significant finding of the research is that intervention depends on whether or not a victim asked for help by specifying a screen name. The group size effect was inhibited when the victim specifically asked a specific person for help. The group size effect was not inhibited if the victim did not ask a specific person for help.

===Children as bystanders===
Although most research has been conducted on adults, children can be bystanders too. A study conducted by Robert Thornberg in 2007 came up with seven reasons why children do not help when another classmate is in distress. These include: [[trivialisation]], [[dissociation (psychology)|dissociation]], embarrassment association, busy working priority, compliance with a competitive norm, audience modelling, and responsibility transfer.{{technical statement|date=September 2014}}&lt;ref name="Thornberg (2007)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thornberg|first=R|title=A classmate in distress: schoolchildren as bystanders and their reasons for how they act.|journal=Social Psychology of Education|year=2007|volume=10|pages=5–28|doi=10.1007/s11218-006-9009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further study, Thornberg concluded that there are seven stages of moral deliberation as a bystander in bystander situations among the Swedish schoolchildren he observed and interviewed: (a) ''noticing that something is wrong'', i.e., children pay selective attention to their environment, and sometimes they don't tune in on a distressed peer if they're in a hurry or their view is obstructed, (b) ''interpreting a need for help''—sometimes children think others are just playing rather than actually in distress or they display pluralistic ignorance, (c) ''feeling empathy'', i.e., having tuned in on a situation and concluded that help is needed, children might feel sorry for an injured peer, or angry about unwarranted aggression (empathic anger), (d) ''processing the school's moral frames''—Thornberg identified five contextual ingredients influencing children's behavior in bystander situations (the definition of a good student, tribe caring, gender stereotypes, and social-hierarchy-dependent morality), (e) ''scanning for social status and relations'', i.e., students were less likely to intervene if they didn't define themselves as friends of the victim or belonging to the same significant social category as the victim, or if there were high-status students present or involved as aggressors—conversely, lower-status children were more likely to intervene if only a few other low-status children were around, (f) ''condensing motives for action'', such as considering a number of factors such as possible benefits and costs, and (g) ''acting'', i.e., all of the above coalesced into a decision to intervene or not. It is striking how this was less an individual decision than the product of a set of interpersonal and institutional processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thornberg|first=Robert|title=A student in distress: Moral frames and bystander behavior in school|journal=Elementary School Journal|year=2010|volume=110|issue=4|pages=585–608|doi=10.1086/651197|url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:320048/FULLTEXT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications of research==

===South African murder trials===
In an effort to make [[South Africa]]n courts more just in their convictions, the concept of ''[[extenuating circumstances]]'' came into being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colman | first1 = A.M. | year = 1991 | title = Crowd psychology in South African murder trials | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 46 | issue = 10| pages = 1071–1079 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.46.10.1071}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no concrete definition of extenuating circumstances was ever made. The South African courts began using the testimony of expert social psychologists to define what extenuating circumstances would mean in the [[justice]] system. Examples include: [[deindividuation]], bystander apathy, and [[conformity]]. In the case of ''S. vs. Sibisi and Others (1989)'' eight members of the [[South African Railways and Harbours Union]] were involved in the murder of four workers who chose not to join in the SARHWU strike. Psychologists Scott Fraser and Andrew Colman presented evidence for the defense using research from [[social psychology]].

[[Social anthropologist]] Boet Kotzé provided evidence for the defense as well. He testified that [[African cultures]] are characterized by a [[collective consciousness]]. Kotzé testified that the collective conscious contributed to the defendants' willingness to act with the group rather than act as individuals. Fraser and Colman stated that ''bystander apathy,'' [[deindividuation]], [[conformity]] and [[group polarization]] were extenuating factors in the killing of the four strike breakers. They explained that deindividuation may affect group members' ability to realize that they are still accountable for their individual actions even when with a group. They also used research on bystander apathy by Latané and Darley to illustrate why four of the eight defendants watched as the other four defendants killed four men. The testimonies of Fraser and Colman helped four of the defendants escape the death penalty.

===Laws===
Some parts of the world have included laws that hold bystanders responsible when they witness an emergency.

#The [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms|Charter of human rights and freedoms]] of [[Quebec]] states that "[e]very person must come to the aid of anyone whose life is in peril, either personally or calling for aid, unless it involves danger to himself or a third person, or he has another valid reason".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canlii.org/en/qc/laws/stat/rsq-c-c-12/latest/rsq-c-c-12.html Charter of human rights and freedoms] Section 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore a legal obligation to assist people in danger in Quebec if it is safe to do so.
#Likewise, the Brazilian Penal Code states that it is a crime not to rescue (or call emergency services when appropriate) injured or disabled people including those found under grave and imminent danger as long as it safe to do so. This also includes abandoned children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848.htm |title=DEL2848 |publisher=Planalto.gov.br |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The German penal code makes it a crime for a person to fail to render aid in cases of accidents or other common dangers, unless such person would thereby endanger themselves or it would be contrary to some other important obligation.&lt;ref&gt;§323c StGB (the German criminal code)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, [[Good Samaritan law]]s have been implemented to protect bystanders who acted in good faith. Many organizations are including bystander training. For example, the United States Department of the Army is doing bystander training with respect to sexual assault. Some organizations routinely do bystander training with respect to safety issues. Others have been doing bystander training with respect to diversity issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scully | first1 = M. | last2 = Rowe | first2 = M. | year = 2009 | title = Bystander training within organizations | url = | journal = Journal of the International Ombudsman Association | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also http://www.clemson.edu/olweus/ for an overview of a use of the Olweus Bullying Prevention Program.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as American universities are also using bystander research to improve bystander attitudes in cases of rape. Examples include the InterAct Sexual Assault Prevention program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ahrens | first1 = C. E. | last2 = Rich | first2 = M. D. | last3 = Ullman | first3 = J.

Many institutions have worked to provide options for bystanders who see behavior they find unacceptable. These options are usually provided through [[complaint systems]]—so bystanders have choices about where to go. One option that is particularly helpful is that of an [[organizational ombudsman]], who keeps no records for the employer and is near-absolutely confidential.

==Notable examples==
===Kitty Genovese===
{{main|Murder of Kitty Genovese}}

The [[murder of Kitty Genovese]] is the case that originally stimulated social psychological research into the "bystander effect". On March 13, 1964 Genovese was stabbed, sexually assaulted, and murdered while walking home from work at 3 am in Queens, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Kitty Genovese murder and the social psychology of helping: The parable of the 38 witnesses.|url = http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.6.555|journal = American Psychologist|pages = 555–562|volume = 62|issue = 6|doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.62.6.555|first = Rachel|last = Manning|first2 = Mark|last2 = Levine|first3 = Alan|last3 = Collins|pmid=17874896|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a sensationalized article in ''The New York Times'', 38 witnesses watched the stabbings but did not intervene or even call the police until after the attacker fled and Genovese had died.&lt;ref name="nytimesarticle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gansberg|first=Martin|title=37 Who Saw Murder Didn't Call the Police|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/27/37-who-saw-murder-didnt-call-the-police.html|access-date= December 30, 2017|work=The New York Times|date=March 27, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shocking account drew widespread public attention and many newspaper editorials. Psychology researchers Latané and Darley attributed the lack of help by witnesses to [[diffusion of responsibility]]: because each witness saw others witnessing the same event, they assumed that the others would be taking responsibility and calling the police, and therefore did nothing to stop the situation themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bystander intervention in emergencies: Diffusion of responsibility|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/h0025589|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 377–383|volume = 8|issue = 4, Pt.1|doi = 10.1037/h0025589|first1 = John M.|last1 = Darley|first2 = Bibb|last2 = Latane}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in ''[[American Psychologist]]'' in 2007 found that the story of Genovese's murder had been exaggerated by the media. There were much fewer than 38 eyewitnesses, the police were called at least once during the attack, and many of the bystanders who overheard the attack could not actually see the event. The story continues to be misrepresented in social psychology textbooks because it functions as a [[parable]] and serves as a dramatic example for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manning |first=R. |last2=Levine |first2=M. |last3=Collins |first3=A. |year=2007 |url=http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/MarkLevine20070604T095238.pdf |title=The Kitty Genovese murder and the social psychology of helping: The parable of the 38 witnesses |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=62 |issue=6 |pages=555–562 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.62.6.555 |pmid=17874896 |access-date=2008-11-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928071553/http://www.psych.lancs.ac.uk/people/uploads/MarkLevine20070604T095238.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''The New York Times'' called its own reporting "flawed", stating that the original story "grossly exaggerated the number of witnesses and what they had perceived".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/nyregion/winston-moseley-81-killer-of-kitty-genovese-dies-in-prison.html | title=Winston Moseley, 81, Killer of Kitty Genovese, Dies in Prison | first=Robert D. | last=McFadden | newspaper=The New York Times | date=April 4, 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Larry Froistad ===
In 1998, Larry Froistad posted a [[Confession (legal)|confession]] that he murdered his five-year-old daughter on an official [[email list]] for [[Moderation Management]].&lt;ref name="HARMON1998"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harmon |first=Amy |date=April 1998 |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |title=On-Line Trail to an Off-Line Killing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/on-line-trail-to-an-off-line-killing.html
|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the approximately 200 members of the [[email list]] reported the confession to legal authorities.&lt;ref name="DECARLO1998"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Decarlo |first=Lisa |date=May 1998 |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |title=Murder, She Read |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/crimelaw/features/2668/
|accessdate=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been studied as an online version of the bystander effect.&lt;ref name="MARKEY2003"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Markey |first1=Patrick M. |last2=Markey |first2=Charlotte N. |last3=Wells |first3=Shannon M. |title=Trends in Social Psychology |chapter=Applications of Social and Personality Psychology to Computer Mediated Communications |editor=Arlsdale, John Z. |pages=91–109 |isbn=1590337263 |oclc=52552028 |publisher=Nova Science Publishers |location=[[Hauppauge, NY]] |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were many different responses to his email. Some reported him to authorities, some said it was a long time ago, and some said he was fantasizing this as a result of feeling guilt over his divorce. From this example, it can be seen that through online communication, a physical and psychological barrier is created which causes people to forget their responsibilities. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/30/us/on-line-trail-to-an-off-line-killing.html|title=On-Line Trail to an Off-Line Killing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raymond Zack===
{{main|Death of Raymond Zack}}
On [[Memorial Day]], 2011, 53-year-old Raymond Zack, of [[Alameda, California]], walked into the waters off Robert Crown Memorial Beach and stood neck deep in water roughly 150 yards offshore for almost an hour. His foster mother, Dolores Berry, called 9-1-1 and said that he was trying to drown himself. (There are conflicting reports about Zack's intentions.&lt;ref&gt;Many issues about this incident are disputed. Roughly one year after the incident, Raymond Zack's family filed a "Failure of Duty" lawsuit against the City of Alameda and the County of Alameda.&lt;/ref&gt;) Firefighters and police responded but did not enter the water. The firefighters called for a United States Coast Guard boat to respond to the scene. According to police reports, Alameda police expected the firefighters to enter the water.&lt;ref&gt;Alameda police released redacted police reports to the media after the event that confirm this.&lt;/ref&gt; Firefighters later said that they did not have current training and certifications to perform land-based water rescue. Dozens of civilians on the beach, and watching from their homes across from the beach, did not enter the water, apparently expecting public safety officers to conduct a rescue. Eventually, Zack collapsed in the water, apparently from hypothermia. Even then, nobody entered the water for several minutes. Finally, a [[good samaritan law|good samaritan]] entered the water and pulled Zack to shore. Zack died afterwards at a local hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2011/06/08/alameda-police-release-memorial-day-drowning-911-calls/ |title=Alameda Police Release Memorial Day Drowning 911 Calls |date= 2011-06-08 |location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ethicsalarms.com/2011/06/01/the-death-of-raymond-zack-no-heroes-only-bystanders-in-san-francisco/ |title=The Death of Raymond Zack: No Heroes, Only Bystanders |date= 2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://letters.ocregister.com/2011/06/10/america-must-take-care-of-its-own/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611021801/http://letters.ocregister.com/2011/06/10/america-must-take-care-of-its-own/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-11 |title=Such callous disregard for life |date=2011-06-10 |location=Orange County }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wang Yue===
{{main|Death of Wang Yue}}
In October 2011, a 2-year-old girl, Wang Yue, was hit by a small, white van in the city of [[Foshan]], China, then run over by a large truck when she was not moved by bystanders. A total of 18 people ignored her, some going so far as to walk around the blood. The girl was left for seven minutes before a recycler, Chen Xianmei, picked up the toddler and called for help. The child died eight days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8830790/Chinese-toddler-run-over-twice-after-being-left-on-street.html |title=Chinese toddler run over twice after being left on street |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2011-10-17|accessdate=2011-10-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oct 22, 2011 5:03 PM ET |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2011/10/22/f-bystander-effect.html |title=The bystander effect—Canada—CBC News |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=2011-10-22 |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Holocaust ===
This genocide that occurred during World War II is one of the biggest examples of bystander effect on a mass scale. We sometimes think of bystander effect as applying to only one individual where one individual needs assistance and bystanders expect another bystander to help; however, this can apply on a bigger scale too with multiple victims. When Nazi officers were on trial they pleaded that if the Holocaust was as terrible as everyone said, then someone else must have known about it. Near the concentration camps, villages such as Dachau, Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Sachsenhausen, Mauthausen, and Ravensbruck, knew about what was going on inside the camp. When the Allies got to the camps they accused the villages nearby of making no attempt to save those in the camps. The Allies were angered that these nearby villages were waiting for someone else to come in and save the people in these camps. As a result, they forced these populations to clean up the corpses from the camps and bury them in mass graves as punishment for falling victim to this bystander effect. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2009/11/02/10-notorious-cases-of-the-bystander-effect|title=10 Notorious Cases of the Bystander Effect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reversal of bystander effect==
===Role of public self-awareness===
In many cases, we believe that individuals like to view themselves as noble by offering help. This concept is related to the notion of self-awareness. If it is true that people focus on the impression they make on others, then public-awareness through the use of accountability cues can stimulate people to give help to each other. However, being surrounded by a lot of bystanders does not automatically create public self-awareness. In fact, in some cases being surrounded by bystanders allows an individual to hide within the crowd and feel anonymous. According to Dr. van Bommel, by introducing an accountability cue, the aim is to eliminate feelings of anonymity and increase the likelihood of them offering help.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bommel|first=M.V. et al.|date=2012|title=Be aware to care: Public self-awareness leads to a reversal of the bystander effect|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=926–930|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2012.02.011|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
To investigate if people would help others in the presence of bystanders alone or when introducing an accountability cue, van Bommel&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; set out to perform two experiments. For the first experiment, participants were invited to join an online forum. A sample of 86 students was used and in the forum participants saw their own name and the names of the other people that were online in the left upper half of the screen. To operationalize the accountability cue, participants' names were displayed in either red or black. Red (salient condition), utilized to attract attention and stand out, was used to raise public self-awareness while black (non-salient) was used for participants to have the same color as other bystanders. In random order, five different messages were presented to the participants. Each of these messages was a personal story of a person in distress. The number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants and as expected, the results showed that names in black (non-salient condition) were linked to the bystander effect with the amount of help being 2. However, when names were in the red (salient condition), the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help being 3. This exemplifies the role of self-awareness in the reversal of bystander effect.

In order to further investigate the reversal of the bystander effect, van Bommel performed a second experiment, also reported in the article, with a sample size of 111 students. Unlike the first study, they wanted all participants in the forum to be indistinguishable from other bystanders on the forum. Therefore, the manipulation of public self-awareness was induced independently from the Internet forum. The procedure was identical to the first study, with a few variations. To induce public awareness in this study, webcams were mounted on participant's computers. Participants could not see the video feed, but to make this more salient, they asked participants before they started to check whether the camera was on by looking at a LED-indicator underneath the webcam. To make the conditions resemble each other as close as possible, they asked participants in the camera absent condition to check if the LED-indicator for Num-Lock was on. Similar to the first experiment, five different messages were presented to the participants and the number of responses a participant typed measured the helping behavior from participants.  Once again, the results were as expected. When the camera was not present, the bystander effect existed with the average amount of help being 1.5. However, when a camera was present, the bystander effect was reversed with the amount of help doubling to 3. That said, the findings revealed the importance of public self-awareness in the bystander effect.

[[File:Composition of 38th Parliament.png|thumb|A [[pie chart]] showing the composition of the 38th Parliament of Canada.]]

A '''chart''' is a graphical representation of [[data]], in which "the data is represented by [[symbol]]s, such as bars in a [[bar chart]], lines in a [[line chart]], or slices in a [[pie chart]]".&lt;ref&gt;Cary Jensen, Loy Anderson (1992). ''Harvard graphics 3: the complete reference''. Osborne McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-881749-8}} p.413&lt;/ref&gt; A chart can represent [[Table (information)|tabular]] [[number|numeric]] data, [[Graph of a function|functions]] or some kinds of qualitative structure and provides different info.

The term "chart" as a graphical representation of [[data]] has multiple meanings:
* A data chart is a type of [[diagram]] or [[Graph of a function|graph]], that organizes and represents a set of numerical or qualitative data.
* [[Map]]s that are adorned with extra information ([[map surround]]) for a specific purpose are often known as charts, such as a [[nautical chart]] or [[aeronautical chart]], typically spread over several [[map sheet]]s.
* Other domain specific constructs are sometimes called charts, such as the [[chord chart]] in music notation or a [[record chart]] for album popularity.

Charts are often used to ease understanding of large quantities of data and the relationships between parts of the data. Charts can usually be read more quickly than the raw data. They are used in a wide variety of fields, and can be created by hand (often on [[graph paper]]) or by computer using a [[charting application]]. Certain types of charts are more useful for presenting a given data set than others. For example, data that presents [[percentage]]s in different groups (such as "satisfied, not satisfied, unsure") are often displayed in a [[pie chart]], but may be more easily understood when presented in a horizontal [[bar chart]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Howard Wainer]] (1997) 'Visual revelations: graphical tales of fate and deception from Napoleon Bonaparte to Ross Perot'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. {{ISBN|0-8058-3878-3}} p.87-90&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, data that represents numbers that change over a period of time (such as "annual revenue from 1990 to 2000") might be best shown as a [[line chart]].

== Features of a chart ==
A chart can take a large variety of forms, however there are common features that provide the chart with its ability to extract meaning from data.

Typically the data in a chart is represented graphically, since humans are generally able to infer meaning from pictures quicker than from text. Text is generally used only to annotate the data.

One of the most important uses of text in a graph is the '''title'''. A graph's title usually appears above the main graphic and provides a succinct description of what the data in the graph refers to.

Dimensions in the data are often displayed on '''[[X axis|axes]]'''. If a horizontal and a vertical axis are used, they are usually referred to as the x-axis and y-axis respectively. Each axis will have a '''scale''', denoted by periodic graduations and usually accompanied by numerical or categorical indications. Each axis will typically also have a label displayed outside or beside it, briefly describing the dimension represented. If the scale is numerical, the label will often be suffixed with the unit of that scale in parentheses. For example, "Distance traveled (m)" is a typical x-axis label and would mean that the distance traveled, in units of meters, is related to the horizontal position of the data within the chart.

Within the graph a '''grid''' of lines may appear to aid in the visual alignment of data. The grid can be enhanced by visually emphasizing the lines at regular or significant graduations. The emphasized lines are then called major grid lines and the remainder are minor grid lines.

The data of a chart can appear in all manner of formats, and may include individual textual '''labels''' describing the datum associated with the indicated position in the chart. The data may appear as dots or shapes, connected or unconnected, and in any combination of colors and patterns. Inferences or points of interest can be overlaid directly on the graph to further aid information extraction.

When the data appearing in a chart contains multiple variables, the chart may include a '''legend''' (also known as a '''key'''). A legend contains a list of the variables appearing in the chart and an example of their appearance. This information allows the data from each variable to be identified in the chart.

== Types of charts ==

=== Common charts ===
Four of the most common charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Black cherry tree histogram.svg|[[Histogram]]
File:Försäljningsstatistik för blanddrycker.png|[[Bar chart]]
File:ActionnariatLibe2007-fr.svg|[[Pie chart]]
File:USTrade1991-2005.png|[[Line chart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:

* A [[histogram]] consists of tabular frequencies, shown as adjacent rectangles, erected over discrete intervals (bins), with an area equal to the frequency of the observations in the interval; first introduced by Karl Pearson.&lt;ref name="pearson"&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Pearson | first1 = K. |authorlink=Karl Pearson| title = Contributions to the Mathematical Theory of Evolution. II. Skew Variation in Homogeneous Material| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 186| pages = 343–414| year = 1895| doi = 10.1098/rsta.1895.0010|bibcode = 1895RSPTA.186..343P }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[bar chart]] is a chart with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values that they represent. The bars can be plotted vertically or horizontally. The first known bar charts are usually attributed to Nicole Oresme, Joseph Priestley, and William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Ever Bar Charts Created in 14th Century|url=http://www.anychart.com/blog/2015/06/02/first-bar-chart-in-history/|publisher=AnyChart|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[pie chart]] shows percentage values as a slice of a pie; first introduced by William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpowered.com/graphs-and-charts/pie-chart-history.htm|title=History of Pie Charts|publisher=JPowered|accessdate=9 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[line chart]] is a two-dimensional scatterplot of ordered observations where the observations are connected following their order. The first known line charts are usually credited to Francis Hauksbee, Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius, Johann Heinrich Lambert and William Playfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Michael Friendly]]|year=2008|url=http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf|title=Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Other common charts are:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:
* A [[bubble chart]] is a two-dimensional scatterplot where a third variable is represented by the size of the points.
* A [[Pie chart#Polar area diagram|polar area diagram]], sometimes called a Coxcomb chart, is an enhanced form of pie chart developed by [[Florence Nightingale]].
* A [[radar chart]] or "spider chart" or "doi" is a two-dimensional chart of three or more quantitative variables represented on axes starting from the same point.
* A [[waterfall chart]] also known as a "Walk" chart, is a special type of floating-column chart.
* A [[Treemapping|tree map]] where the areas of the rectangles correspond to values.  Other dimensions can be represented with colour or hue.
* A [[streamgraph]], a stacked, curvilinear area graph displaced around a central axis
* A [[GapChart]], a time series chart showing evolving gaps and equalities between series. Other dimensions can be represented with colour or hue.

=== Field-specific charts ===
Some types of charts have specific uses in a certain field

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bollinger bands example, 2 stddevs.png|[[Open-high-low-close chart]]
File:Candlestick-chart.png|[[Candlestick chart]]
File:KagiSample2Chart echarts.gif|[[Kagi chart]]
File:Sparkline dowjones.svg|[[Sparkline]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This gallery shows:
* Stock market prices are often depicted with an [[open-high-low-close chart]] with a traditional bar chart of volume at the bottom.
* [[Candlestick chart]]s are another type of bar chart used to describe price movements of an equity over time.
* A [[Kagi chart]] is a time-independent stock tracking chart that attempts to minimise noise.
* Alternatively, where less detail is required, and chart size is paramount, a [[Sparkline]] may be used.

Other examples:
* Interest rates, temperatures, etc., at the close of the period are plotted with a line chart.
* Project planners use a [[Gantt chart]] to show the timing of tasks as they occur over time.

=== Well-known named charts ===
Some of the better-known named charts are:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Gantt przyklad 2.PNG|[[Gantt chart]]
File:Nolan-chart.svg|[[Nolan chart]]
File:5n PERT graph with critical path.svg|[[PERT]] chart
File:Smith chart bmd.gif|[[Smith chart]]
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Some specific charts have become well known by effectively explaining a phenomenon or idea.
* An [[Allele chart]] is a chart originating from the study of [[genetics]] to show the interaction of two data points in a grid.
* A [[Gantt chart]] helps in scheduling complex projects.
* The [[Nolan chart]] and the [[Pournelle chart]] classify political philosophies according to two axes of variation.
* A [[Program Evaluation and Review Technique|PERT chart]] is often used in [[project management]].
* The [[Smith chart]] serves in [[radio electronics]].

=== Other charts ===
There are dozens of other types of charts. Here are some of them:

{{strong|Choiceless awareness}} is posited in [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], and [[spirituality]] to be the state of unpremeditated, complete [[awareness]] of the [[present]] without [[preference]], effort, or compulsion. The term was popularized in mid-20th century by [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], in whose philosophy it signifies a main theme. Similar or related concepts had been previously developed in several religious or spiritual traditions; the term or others like it has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary [[Secularity|secular]] and religious [[meditation]] practices. By {{nobr|early 21st century,}} choiceless awareness as a concept or term had appeared in a variety of fields, including in [[neuroscience]], [[therapy]], sociology, and in art. However, Krishnamurti's approach of the subject was unique, and differs from both prior and later notions.

==Jiddu Krishnamurti==
&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Krishnamurti to Himself]] ([[MOS:HEAD]]).--&gt;
Choiceless awareness is a major topic in the exposition of [[India]]n philosopher [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] (1895{{en dash}}1986).{{r|rv2001}} Beginning in the 1930s, he often commented on the subject, which became a recurring theme in his work.{{r|jk-ca}} He is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the concept.{{r|jk-ca-spread}}

Krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical, technical matters, the presence and action of [[choice]] indicates confusion and subtle bias: an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner, without distortion, and therefore with complete awareness, will immediately, naturally, act according to this awareness{{spaced en dash}}the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness, rather than the result of choice. Such action (and quality of mind) is inherently without conflict.{{r|jk-choice}}

He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness;{{nnbsp}}{{r|hr1996-p49}} in his view application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessness{{spaced en dash}}just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of [[Habit (psychology)|habit]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-habit}} additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply. According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations.{{r|jk-ca-inhibit}} For true choicelessness to be realized, choice{{spaced en dash}}implicit or explicit{{spaced en dash}}has to simply, irrevocably, stop; however, the ceasing of choice is not the result of decision-making, but implies the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or [[Psychology of self|self as a psychological entity]]. Krishnamurti proposed that such a state might be approached through inquiry based on total attentiveness: [[identity (social science)|identity]] is then dissolved in complete, all-encompassing attention.{{r|jk-attention}} Therefore, he asserted that choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non-self-centered perception, which he called "observation without the observer".{{r|jk-no-observer}}

Accordingly, Krishnamurti advised against following any [[doctrine]], discipline, teacher, [[guru]], or authority, including himself.{{r|jk-no-authority}} He also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience, which he considered integral parts of the observer.{{r|jk1975-p19}} He denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques and methods, but not of meditation itself, which he called "perhaps the greatest" art in life;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk1975-p116}} and stated that insight into choiceless awareness could be shared through open dialogue.{{r|pk2008-p970}}

Krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others, influential [[Hindu]] [[Index of religious honorifics and titles#Teachers|spiritual teacher]] [[Ramana Maharshi]] (1879{{en dash}}1950){{nnbsp}}{{r|ao1996-p70}} and, following wide publication of his books,{{r|jk-books}} they attracted the attention of psychologists and [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysts]] in the 1950s;{{nnbsp}}{{r|jk-psych}} in subsequent decades Krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field.{{r|ml2003-pp206}} His views on the subject have been included in [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scholarly papers]] on [[existential therapy]],{{r|cf2005-p316}} [[education theory]],{{r|dl2014-pp357}} and [[Peace and conflict studies|peace research]],{{r|ljf1994}} but they have also been discussed in less formal or structured settings.{{r|jk-informal}}

In late{{nbsp}}1980, almost half a century after he started discussing it, Krishnamurti included the concept in "The Core of Krishnamurti's Teaching", a pivotal statement of his philosophy: "Freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity.{{"-}}{{r|jk1980-par3|jk-more}}

==Other representations==
In contrast with Krishnamurti's approach, other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness (or related ideas and terms) as part, or as the hoped-for result, of specific [[Methodology|methodologies]] and meditation techniques.{{r|methodologies}} Similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts,{{r|ca-similar}} and also within secular disciplines such as [[psychotherapy]],{{r|cg2013-p16}} rehabilitation medicine,{{r|c&amp;s2011-ch10}} and counseling.{{r|kcp2010-ho2.8}} Choiceless awareness has been examined within the context of [[philosophy of perception]] and behavior,{{r|ad2006-pp39}} while studies have cited its possible role in [[job performance]].{{r|job-studies}} Other studies have linked meditation based on the concept (among others), with [[Biological neural network|neural activity]] consistent with increased attentiveness, considered a factor of well-being and happiness.{{r|mind-studies}}

One term that is often used as a near-[[synonym]] is [[mindfulness]], which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness.{{r|mindfulness}} Initially part of [[Sati (Buddhism)|Buddhist meditation practice]], it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary [[Mindfulness#Psychology|psychological treatment]],{{r|cg2013-p82}} and has been applied as a component of [[integrative medicine]] programs.{{r|uwh}}

Kindred themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices (such as [[Vipassanā]]) associated with the [[Theravada]] school of [[Buddhism]];{{nnbsp}}{{r|jkz2011-pp289}} and also in 20th-century offshoots such as the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] and the [[Vipassana movement]].{{r|rhs2013}} Within these and similar fields, for example the [[Shikantaza]] practice in [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]],{{r|ms2004-pp76}} choiceless (or effortless) awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of practice.{{r|practice}}

The concept has been included in the discourse of [[transpersonal]] philosopher [[Ken Wilber]] (b. 1949),{{r|kw1988-pp155}} and also of independent Indian spiritual teacher [[Rajneesh|Osho (Rajneesh)]] (1931{{en dash}}1990).{{r|osho}} [[Tibetan Buddhism]] teacher [[Chögyam Trungpa]] (1939{{en dash}}1987), who engaged in dialogue with Krishnamurti,{{r|jk1996-ch?}} used the term to describe the experience of shunyata ([[Śūnyatā]]){{spaced en dash}}in [[Sanskrit]], "emptiness", or "ego-less perception".{{r|ct1994-ch3}}

Among other fields, the term has appeared in [[dispute resolution]] theory and practice,{{r|lr2006}} and has found application in artistic endeavors. In [[dramatic theory]], [[Theatre criticism|theater criticism]],{{r|rl1970}} and [[acting]],{{r|se2010}} it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts; it has additionally appeared in music works.{{r|sm1978-a2}} Author [[J. D. Salinger]] (1919{{en dash}}2010), who was interested in spirituality and alternative religions, was reputedly an adherent of Ramana Maharshi's ideas on choiceless awareness.{{r|ek2010}}

Contrary to press reports published in mid-20th-century,{{r|toi1954}} later interest in practices related to, or influenced by, choiceless awareness, has resulted in unambiguously favorable mentions in the [[Mass media|popular press]].{{r|pop-press}} Additionally, [[mass market]] general interest titles covering the subject have been published.{{r|sa2015-pp110}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">In [[category theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''cone of a functor''' is an abstract notion used to define the [[limit (category theory)|limit]] of that [[functor]]. Cones make other appearances in category theory as well.

==Definition==

Let ''F'' : ''J'' &amp;rarr; ''C'' be a [[diagram (category theory)|diagram]] in ''C''. Formally, a diagram is nothing more than a [[functor]] from ''J'' to ''C''. The change in terminology reflects the fact that we think of ''F'' as indexing a family of objects and [[morphism]]s in ''C''. The [[category (mathematics)|category]] ''J'' is thought of as an "index category".  One should consider this in analogy with the concept of an [[indexed family]] of objects in [[set theory]]. The primary difference is that here we have [[morphism]]s as well. Thus, for example, when ''J'' is a [[discrete category]], it corresponds most closely to the idea of an indexed family in set theory. Another common and more interesting example takes ''J'' to be a [[span (category theory)|span]]. ''J'' can also be taken to be the [[empty category]], leading to the simplest cones.

Let ''N'' be an object of ''C''. A '''cone''' from ''N'' to ''F'' is a family of morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_X\colon N \to F(X)\,&lt;/math&gt;
for each object ''X'' of ''J'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''J'' the following diagram [[commutative diagram|commutes]]:

[[Image:Functor cone.svg|175px|center|Part of a cone from N to F]]

The (usually infinite) collection of all these triangles can
be (partially) depicted in the shape of a [[cone (geometry)|cone]] with the apex ''N''. The cone ψ is sometimes said to have '''vertex''' ''N'' and '''base''' ''F''.

One can also define the [[dual (category theory)|dual]] notion of a '''cone''' from ''F'' to ''N'' (also called a '''co-cone''') by reversing all the arrows above. Explicitly, a co-cone from ''F'' to ''N'' is a family of morphisms
:&lt;math&gt;\psi_X\colon F(X)\to N\,&lt;/math&gt;
for each object ''X'' of ''J'' such that for every morphism ''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y'' in ''J'' the following diagram commutes:

[[Image:Functor co-cone.svg|175px|center|Part of a cone from F to N]]

==Equivalent formulations==

At first glance cones seem to be slightly abnormal constructions in category theory. They are maps from an ''object'' to a ''functor'' (or vice versa). In keeping with the spirit of category theory we would like to define them as morphisms or objects in some suitable category. In fact, we can do both.

Let ''J'' be a small category and let ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; be the [[category of diagrams]] of type ''J'' in ''C'' (this is nothing more than a [[functor category]]). Define the [[diagonal functor]] Δ : ''C'' &amp;rarr; ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; as follows: Δ(''N'') : ''J'' &amp;rarr; ''C'' is the [[constant functor]] to ''N'' for all ''N'' in ''C''.

If ''F'' is a diagram of type ''J'' in ''C'', the following statements are equivalent:
* ψ is a cone from ''N'' to ''F''
* ψ is a [[natural transformation]] from Δ(''N'') to ''F''
* (''N'', ψ) is an object in the [[comma category]] (Δ &amp;darr; ''F'')

The dual statements are also equivalent:
* ψ is a co-cone from ''F'' to ''N''
* ψ is a [[natural transformation]] from ''F'' to Δ(''N'')
* (''N'', ψ) is an object in the [[comma category]] (''F'' &amp;darr; Δ)

These statements can all be verified by a straightforward application of the definitions. Thinking of cones as natural transformations we see that they are just morphisms in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt; with source (or target) a constant functor.

== Category of cones ==

By the above, we can define the '''category of cones to ''F''''' as the comma category (Δ &amp;darr; ''F''). Morphisms of cones are then just morphisms in this category. This equivalence is rooted in the observation that a natural map between constant functors Δ(''N''), Δ(''M'') corresponds to a morphism between ''N'' and ''M''. In this sense, the diagonal functor acts trivially on arrows. In similar vein, writing down the definition of a natural map from a constant functor Δ(''N'') to ''F'' yields the same diagram as the above. As one might expect, a morphism from a cone (''N'', ψ) to a cone (''L'', φ) is just a morphism ''N'' &amp;rarr; ''L'' such that all the "obvious" diagrams commute (see the first diagram in the next section).

Likewise, the '''category of co-cones from ''F''''' is the comma category (''F'' &amp;darr; Δ).

== Universal cones ==

[[Limit (category theory)|Limits and colimits]] are defined as '''universal cones'''. That is, cones through which all other cones factor. A cone φ from ''L'' to ''F'' is a universal cone if for any other cone ψ from ''N'' to ''F'' there is a unique morphism from ψ to φ.

[[Image:Functor cone (extended).svg|250px|center]]

Equivalently, a universal cone to ''F'' is a [[universal morphism]] from &amp;Delta; to ''F'' (thought of as an object in ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''J''&lt;/sup&gt;), or a [[terminal object]] in (&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;''F'').

Dually, a cone φ from ''F'' to ''L'' is a universal cone if for any other cone ψ from ''F'' to ''N'' there is a unique morphism from φ to ψ.

[[Image:Functor co-cone (extended).svg|250px|center]]

Equivalently, a universal cone from ''F'' is a universal morphism from ''F'' to &amp;Delta;, or an [[initial object]] in (''F''&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;).

The limit of ''F'' is a universal cone to ''F'', and the colimit is a universal cone from ''F''. As with all universal constructions, universal cones are not guaranteed to exist for all diagrams ''F'', but if they do exist they are unique up to a unique isomorphism (in the comma category (&amp;Delta;&amp;nbsp;&amp;darr;&amp;nbsp;''F'')).

In [[geometry]] and [[topology]], '''crumpling''' is the process whereby a sheet of paper or other two-dimensional [[manifold]] undergoes disordered [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]] to yield a three-dimensional structure comprising a random network of [[Face_(geometry)#Ridge_or_.28n-2.29-face|ridge]]s and [[facet]]s with variable density. The geometry of crumpled structures is the subject of some interest the mathematical community within the discipline of topology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Cerda | first1=Enrique | last2=Chaieb |first2=Sahraoui |last3=Melo | first3=Francisco| last4=Mahadevan| first4=L |title=Conical dislocations in crumpling | journal= nature | year= 1999| volume=401| doi=10.1038/43395| bibcode=1999Natur.401...46C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crumpled paper balls have been studied and found to exhibit surprisingly complex structures with [[compressive strength]] resulting from [[friction]]al interactions at [[Local property|locally]] flat facets between folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cambou| first1=Anne Dominique |last2=Narayanan | first2=Menon| title=Three-dimensional structure of a sheet crumpled into a ball.| journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year=2011 | volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14741–14745|arxiv=1203.5826|bibcode=2011PNAS..10814741C|doi=10.1073/pnas.1019192108|pmc=3169141}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unusually high compressive strength of crumpled structures relative to their density is of interest in the disciplines of [[materials science]] and [[mechanical engineering]].

== Significance of crumpling ==

The packing of a sheet by crumpling is a complex phenomenon that depends on material parameters and the packing protocol. Thus the crumpling behaviour of foil, paper and poly-membranes differs significantly and can be interpreted on the basis of material foldability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibi| first1=M |last2=Bonn | first2=D| title=Effect of the material properties on the crumpling of a thin sheet.| journal= Soft matter |year=2017 | volume=3 |pages=4029}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high compressive strength exhibited by dense crumple formed [[cellulose]] paper is of interest towards impact dissipation applications and has  been proposed as an approach to [[Paper recycling|utilising waste paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Mechanical properties in crumple-formed paper derived materials subjected to compression| journal= Heilyon |year=2017 | volume=3 |issue=6| pages=e00329 | url= http://www.heliyon.com/article/e00329/}} &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17045">'''Dominant narrative''' can be used to describe the lens in which history is told by the perspective of the dominant culture. This term has been described as an "invisible hand" that guides reality and perceived reality.&lt;ref name="onegreenplanet.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Speaking Truth to Power: Understanding the Dominant, Animal-Eating Narrative for Vegan Empowerment and Social Transformation|url = http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/speaking-truth-to-power-understanding-the-dominant-animal-eating-narrative-for-vegan-empowerment-and-social-transformation/|website = One Green Planet|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative can refer to multiple aspects of life, such as history, politics, or different activist groups. [[Dominant culture]] is defined as the majority cultural practices of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O88-dominantculture.html|title = Dominant Culture|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = A Dictionary of Sociology|last = Marshall|first = Gordon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narrative]] can be defined as story telling, either true or imaginary.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = narrative: definition of narrative in Oxford dictionary (American English) (US)|url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/narrative|website = www.oxforddictionaries.com|accessdate = 2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pairing these two terms together create the notion of dominant narrative, that only the majority story is told and therefore heard. It is a common theme to hear or learn only about the dominant narrative as it comprises the perspective of the majority culture. Examples of dominant narrative can be seen throughout history. Dominant narrative can be defined and decided by the sociopolitical and socioeconomic setting someone lives his or her life in. 

Dominant narrative is similar in some ways to the ideas of [[metanarrative]] or [[grand narrative]].  These two terms refer to the notion that there is a common lived experience, or a totalizing narrative, experience, or account of history.{{cn|date=February 2016}} Unlike the above terms, dominant narrative as a concept is used to explain not just only that there is one narrative told, but what makes it possible for that to be the narrative that is told. This term addresses what the reasons are that the dominant narrative is, in fact, dominant or the majority account.

It is also important to look at who is not included in the dominant narrative and how this can affect society and people in those [[marginalized]] groups. Not everyone has access to being a part of the dominant narrative. Counter-narrative has been coined as the term regarding the stories and lived experiences of those not in the dominant narrative or not allowed to be a part of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Postmodern Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pX_azoDGfpAC|publisher = Pluto Press|date = 1985-01-01|isbn = 9780745300030|first = Hal|last = Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counter-narrative are used as a way to share minorities stories excluded and combat the dominant narrative. 

== Who is the dominant narrative? ==
The dominant narrative can most often be seen as those that occupy scholar [[Judith Lorber|Judith Lorber's]] A-Categories.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Social Construction of Gender|last = Lorber|first = Judith|date = 2006|journal = Inequality Reader: Contemporary &amp; Foundational Readings in Race, Class, &amp; Gender|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorber defines and describes A-category members as those that occupy the dominant group in different aspects of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, that can be seen in the topic of [[race (human categorization)]] with white being the A-category and all minorities being the not-A; or in the topic of [[gender]] with man being the A-category while woman being the not-A. This notion includes all [[Intersectionality|intersectionalities]] such as age, sexual orientation, CIS/Transgender, ableism, education, and citizenship. The dominant narrative are those that take part in and benefit from being associated with the dominant culture. Having forms of privilege and power that come from being in Lorber's A Categories, can directly relate to being in the dominant culture. The dominant narrative simply consists of whose voice can be recognized and represented when retelling stories, or whose voice/story is perceived as valid or real.

== Critiques and concerns with dominant narrative. ==
There are a number of critiques and concerns with there being a dominant narrative in society. Many of the critiques of there being a dominant narrative come from the exclusion of counter-narratives. To fully understand what the dominant narrative is and understand examples of it is necessary to understand its limitations. Some limitations with there being a dominant narrative include the following:

=== Metanarrative among dominant group ===
Having a dominant narrative can create a notion that there is a metanarrative among the dominant group, meaning all apart of the dominant group are experiencing life the same way. In using the example of the caucasian dominant narrative, this would mean that all Caucasians of somewhat similar sociopolitical and socioeconomic standing are experiencing life and events the same, and that is not true. A dominant narrative can generalize the lived experiences of people within the dominant culture. The metanarrative among the dominant culture creates the notion that whiteness is the norm, and that the dominant culture is the normal culture to which other cultures need to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://evolutioncounseling.com/dominant-culture/|title = Dominant Culture|date = 2014|accessdate = |website = Evolution Counseling|publisher = |last = Schreiner|first = Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perceived sense of normalcy can be very problematic because it encourages people within the majority to not change and question what could be wrong with having such a strong dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Ignores the lived experiences of minorities ===
Having a dominant narrative based on the dominant culture, therefore means anyone not in the dominant culture cannot be a part of the dominant narrative. Since the dominant narrative is accepted as the norm this, therefore, means those not in the dominant narrative are abnormal. Someone's narrative and perceived narrative can greatly affect how someone views themselves and relates to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarku.edu/~mbamberg/Papers/Counter%20Narratives.htm |title=Considering Counter Narratives |date=2004 |accessdate= |website=Clark.edu |publisher=Clark.edu |last=Bamberg |first=Michael |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017212729/http://www.clarku.edu/~mbamberg/Papers/Counter%20Narratives.htm |archivedate=2011-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; If someone is not part of the dominant narrative and their story is not being told, that means their lived experiences are being ignored and in turn written out of history. Lived experiences, similar to counter-narratives, can be defined as everyday experiences people face and most often referring to those in the minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lived Experience : SAGE Research Methods |url=https://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-social-science-research-methods/n504.xml |website=srmo.sagepub.com |accessdate=2015-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305211440/http://srmo.sagepub.com/view/the-sage-encyclopedia-of-social-science-research-methods/n504.xml |archivedate=2014-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lived experiences have also been called material realities, meaning that they are the real, tangible experiences and realities that people live on a daily basis, even if they are counter to the dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.femst.ucsb.edu/projects/crwsj/conversations/archive/20082009/may_2009_workshop/hemmings_telling_feminist_stories.pdf|title = Telling Feminist Stories|last = Hemmings|first = Clare|date = 2005|journal = Feminist Theory|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry is cited for explaining how [[Social inequality|inequalities]], can affect which narrative and tellings are able to be heard and which aren't.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; If the stories of people with inequalities are not heard, then this completely ignores them, and any agency they could have in society.

=== How does society ever know the truth? ===
Jeyn Roberts is quoted for saying "there are three sides to every story. Yours. Mine. What really happened: the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A quote from Rage Within|url = http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/638626-there-are-three-sides-to-every-story-yours-mine-what|website = Goodreads|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominant narrative makes it so only one side of any story is told, this completely ignores any other sides or even the truth. By definition, a dominant narrative does not include every and all aspects of any event. By only learning about and studying the dominant narrative then people are only being educated partially about any historical or current events. This creates a false historical account of most of history. [[Winston Churchill]] has been associated with the saying "history is written by the victors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Winston Churchill Quotes at BrainyQuote.com|url = http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/winstonchu380864.html|website = BrainyQuote|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This saying directly relates to the concept of dominant narrative and how the full truth of events as it relates to minorities is not being retold. This means that through mainstream education and media people are not being put forth the most accurate information and historical accounts.

== Examples of dominant narrative ==
Dominant narrative can be seen in almost any aspect of life from media, history, advertising, and activism. The following are some examples of places dominant narrative can be present:

=== History ===
History is one of the most important fields to acknowledge that dominant narrative is present. It is important for people to have a full and accurate understanding of historical events, this is often muddled by the dominant narrative. A historical example of dominant narrative ignoring contributions of people of color can be seen in the military realm. A historical example of black men being ignored for their contributions to the US Military can be understood in the instance of the [[Tuskegee Airmen]]. The Tuskegee Airmen was a program based out of Tuskegee, AZ in 1941, in which African-American men were trained and educated in multiple aspects relating to war aircraft.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A brief History - Tuskegee Airmen Inc. - The legacy of The Tuskegee Airmen|url = http://tuskegeeairmen.org/explore-tai/a-brief-history/|website = tuskegeeairmen.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to racist ideologies many opposed African-American men being trained to become US Military pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Ebony and Ivory: White Officer Foes and Friends of the Tuskegee Airmen|last = Haulman|first = Daniel|date = 2015|journal = Air Power History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Tuskegee Airman overcame great obstacles and contributed immensely to US Military acts in [[World War II]], they have not been given considerable recognition until [[Bill Clinton]] commemorated Tuskegee as a national historic site.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even though the Tuskegee Airmen deserved recognition for all they were contributing to the war and in terms of overcoming racial prejudices, because of the WWII dominant narrative they were not given recognition until people fought for their behalf. There are many other historical contributions made by people not in the dominant culture, which are never retroactively recognized and acknowledged. 

=== News Media ===
Like historical accounts, journalism and news media can also be framed in the dominant narrative lens. This historical dominant narrative can affect what news people are actually being exposed to. This is problematic because only news that the dominant narrative deems important receives the most media attention. 
An example of the dominant narrative at play in the media can be seen in the way the [[Rwandan Genocide]]  was almost completely ignored by Western media and news.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This genocide consists of the ethnic majority group, the [[Hutu]], attempting to extinguish the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Rwandan Genocide - Facts &amp; Summary - HISTORY.com|url = http://www.history.com/topics/rwandan-genocide|website = HISTORY.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Rwandan Genocide was not framed by the media as a genocide, in an attempt to ignore the severity of the event.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ignoring Genocide (HRW Report - Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda, March 1999)|url = https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/rwanda/Geno15-8-01.htm|website = www.hrw.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early developments  of the Rwandan Genocide where minimalized as a way to justify a lack of intervention by many countries.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Since the events in Rwanda did not directly affect US citizens the genocide did not seem to be as big of a deal in media, especially because the genocide consisted of black non-Americans this genocide was hardly discussed, as it is a counter-narrative to the dominant narrative.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Media and the Rwanda Genocide |url=http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |website=www.idrc.ca |accessdate=2015-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105001141/http://www.idrc.ca/EN/Resources/Publications/openebooks/338-0/index.html |archivedate=2015-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; But even when race is not a factor at play the mass media can shape the dominant narrative in a way to instil indifference and avoid intervention. This happened, for instance, during the early phases of the breakup of Yugoslavia, as many international authorities disputed and denied that a genocide was taking place in Bosnia. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Time We Knew: Western Responses to Genocide in Bosnia|last=Cushman T and Meštrović SG (eds)|first=|publisher=New York: NYU Press|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Activism ===
People who do not fit into the dominant narrative can also be written out of activist movements, and in turn written out of history later on. There are some needs and intersections of privilege that are necessary to participate in some forms of activism. Not everyone is able to participate in activist work because of their socioeconomic status, their sociopolitical status, their job safety, their families or childcare needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The privilege and cost of activism {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|url = http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/privilege-and-cost-activism|website = gender.stanford.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limitations like those just mentioned can greatly affect who is active and participates in social activism. Because someone, most likely not in the dominant culture, may not have the means to participate that means their narrative may not be shared. An example of dominant narrative in activism can be seen in [[Women's rights]] movements. [[First-wave feminism]] has been critiqued for a lack of inclusion of black women and race in their movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Black feminism and intersectionality {{!}} International Socialist Review|url = http://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality|website = isreview.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist history is often explained in a framework of the contributions made by white affluent and educated American or British women.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Documenting First Wave Feminisms. Volume 1: Transnational Collaborations and Crosscurrents ed. by Maureen Moynagh and Nancy Forestell (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/university_of_toronto_quarterly/v083/83.2.dunst.html|journal = University of Toronto Quarterly|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1712-5278|pages = 481-482|volume = 83|issue = 2|first = Maura|last = Dunst}}&lt;/ref&gt; White women with higher socioeconomic standings were not the only women that took part in the first-wave feminist activism, but most often were the only ones that were given access to political gains and recognition.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

FC Nürnberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rp-online.de/sport/fussball/bayer-04/bayer-04-leverkusen-emir-spahic-bayers-akzeptiertes-mysterium-aid-1.4189125|title=Emir Spahic - Bayers akzeptiertes Mysterium|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 August 2014, 34-year-old Spahić headed in a goal from a free kick to level the score at 2–2 in a game that finished 4–2 for Leverkusen against [[Hertha BSC]], thus ensuring his team's unbeaten start to the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leverkusen maintain perfect start|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/08/leverkusen-maintain-perfect-start-201483016814773801.html|accessdate=30 August 2014|newspaper=aljazeera.com|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spahić was sent off for two yellow cards in a 4–5 home defeat against [[VfL Wolfsburg]] on 14 February 2015; having been 1–4 down, the score was level at his time of dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wolfsburg win thriller at Bayer Leverkusen thanks to Bas Dost’s four-goal haul|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/14/bayer-leverkusen-wolfsburg-match-report|accessdate=14 February 2015|work=The Guardian|agency=Reuters|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2015, Spahić was named the best defender in Europe (in front of [[Martín Demichelis]] of [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Mats Hummels]] of [[Borussia Dortmund]], [[Chris Smalling]] of [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Thiago Silva]] of PSG) by International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/cies-emir-spahic-najbolji-defanzivac-evrope-u-2015-godini/150330150|title=Emir Spahić najbolji defanzivac Evrope u 2015. godini|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spahić had his contract terminated on 12 April for headbutting a member of club's security personnel reportedly after they refused to allow his friends entry inside the dressing room area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/bayer-leverkusen/story/2394788/emir-spahic-bayer-leverkusen-contract-terminated-after-head-butting-security|title=Emir Spahic's Leverkusen contract terminated after head-butting security|date=12 April 2015|accessdate=12 April 2015|work=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 July 2015, fellow Bundesliga team [[Hamburger SV]] confirmed Spahić as the team's newest player, signing a one-year contract lasting until June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamburg sign Emir Spahic, ex-Bayer Leverkusen, to one-year deal|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/hamburg-sv/story/2513518/hamburg-sign-emir-spahic-to-one-year-contract|accessdate=6 September 2015|agency=Associated Press|publisher=ESPN|date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He credited the move to his compatriot, former Hamburg player [[Sergej Barbarez]], and expressed gratefulness at being given a second chance after his expulsion from Leverkusen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rodden|first1=Mark|title=Emir Spahic grateful to Hamburg after three-month head-butt ban|url=http://www.espnfc.co.uk/german-bundesliga/story/2529749/emir-spahic-grateful-to-hamburg-after-head-butt-ban|accessdate=6 September 2015|publisher=ESPN|date=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released by the club on 3 January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gisdol bittet zum trainingsauftakt|url=https://www.hsv.de/news/meldungen/saison-2016-17/januar-2017/gisdol-bittet-zum-trainingsauftakt/|accessdate=3 January 2017|publisher=Hamburger SV|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:20150331 2048 AUT BIH 2266.jpg|thumb|Spahić playing for [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 2015]]

Spahić was the [[captain (association football)|captain]] of the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina national team]] before initially announcing his retirement.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/safet-susic-za-klix-ba-postujem-spahicevu-odluku-nece-biti-lako-naci-njegovu-zamjenu/140807105|title=Emir Spahic retirement|language=Bosnian|publisher=klix.ba|date=7 August 2014|accessdate=7 August 2014|first=Sinan|last=Ziric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2003, he made his debut as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] against [[Romania national football team|Romania]] at [[Stadionul Ion Oblemenco]] in [[Craiova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.javno.ba/javno-teme/javnoba-ekspertiza-10-najboljih-bh-nogometaa-od-osamostaljenja-drave.html|title=JAVNO.ba EKSPERTIZA: 10 najboljih BH nogometaša od osamostaljenja države|date=20 October 2012|accessdate=2 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026035323/http://www.javno.ba/javno-teme/javnoba-ekspertiza-10-najboljih-bh-nogometaa-od-osamostaljenja-drave.html|archivedate=26 October 2012|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bihsoccer.com/Reprezentacija-BiH-Godina-2003.html|title=Reprezentacija BiH – Godina 2003|accessdate=2 April 2013|publisher=bihsoccer.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211171927/http://www.bihsoccer.com/Reprezentacija-BiH-Godina-2003.html|archivedate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2006, he scored his first international goal, in a friendly game against [[Japan national football team|Japan]], played in [[Dortmund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2006&amp;mm=03&amp;dd=01&amp;nav_id=190064|title=BiH vs Japan|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since his debut, he was an important member of the national team. He headed a ball into the box and assisted [[Ermin Bičakčić]] who scored a crucial equalizer versus [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]] in [[Žilina]] during [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group G#Matches|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina came back from one goal down in that game to win 2–1 and stay top of their qualifying group for ahead of [[Greece national football team|Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/334762/hajrovic-hero|title=Hajrovic the hero|publisher=espnfc.com|date=10 September 2013|accessdate=11 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913022443/http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/334762/hajrovic-hero|archivedate=13 September 2013|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spahić retired from international football on 7 August 2014.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; After his retirement, Bosnia lost their first game of [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying|Euro 2016 qualifiers]] versus [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] (ranked 121 places behind Bosnia in FIFA Ranking for August 2014) without Spahić,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost164423|title=Šokantan poraz Bosne i Hercegovine|language=Bosnian}}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in manager [[Safet Sušić]] calling him back from retirement on 22 September for the games that followed against [[Wales national football team|Wales]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/244/286/8/|title=Spahic returns for Bosnia and Herzegovina EURO qualifiers|accessdate=22 September 2014|publisher=fifa.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027044808/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/244/286/8/|archivedate=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Bosnia's key defenders were either injured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhdragons.com/sead-kolasinac-sidelined-for-six-months/|title=Sead Kolasinac Sidelined For Six Months|publisher=BHDragons|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or lacked competitive matches for their clubs, which prompted in Spahić's call-up to the national side. Due to injury, he missed those two games and later returned to international stage against [[Israel national football team|Israel]] on November 16 where he played the full game, his first since playing against [[Iran national football team|Iran]] at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/uzivo-izrael-bih/141116092|title=Izrael - BiH 3:0|language=Bosnian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2016, he scored in a 3–1 friendly loss to Spain in [[St. Gallen]], Switzerland, and was sent off before half time for an altercation with [[Cesc Fàbregas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain 3-1 Bosnia and Herzegovina: Emir Spahic sent off for altercation with Cesc Fabregas and Cesar Azpilicueta as Vicente del Bosque's side seal victory|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-3615386/Spain-3-1-Bosnia-Herzegovina-Emir-Spahic-sent-altercation-Cesc-Fabregas-Cesar-Azpilicueta-Vicente-del-Bosque-s-seal-victory.html|accessdate=29 May 2016|work=Daily Mail|agency=Reuters|date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JohnLocke.png|thumb|[[John Locke]] (1632–1704), a leading philosopher of British empiricism]]
In philosophy, '''empiricism''' is a [[theory]] that states that knowledge comes only or primarily from [[Empirical evidence|sensory experience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Psillos|first1=Stathis|last2=Curd|first2=Martin|title=The Routledge companion to philosophy of science|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415546133|pages=129–38|edition=1. publ. in paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is one of several views of  [[epistemology]], the study of human knowledge, along with [[rationalism]] and [[philosophical skepticism|skepticism]]. Empiricism emphasises the role of [[empirical evidence]] in the formation of ideas, over the idea of [[innate idea]]s or [[traditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2=Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-13-158591-6 }}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, empiricists may argue that traditions (or customs) arise due to relations of previous sense experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. ''Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', 1748.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Empiricism in the [[philosophy of science]] emphasises evidence, especially as discovered in [[experiment]]s. It is a fundamental part of the [[scientific method]] that all hypotheses and theories must be tested against observations of the natural world rather than resting solely on ''[[A priori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' reasoning, [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], or [[revelation]].

Empiricism, often used by natural scientists, says that "knowledge is based on experience" and that "knowledge is tentative and probabilistic, subject to continued revision and [[Falsifiability|falsification]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, M. (2006). Empiricism. In F. English (Ed.), Encyclopedia of educational leadership and administration. (pp. 338–39). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research, including experiments and validated measurement tools, guides the scientific method.

==Etymology==
The English term ''empirical'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ἐμπειρία, ''empeiria'', which is cognate with and translates to the Latin ''experientia'', from which are derived the word ''experience'' and the related ''experiment''.

==History==

===Background===
{{Main|Empirical method}}

A central concept in  [[science]] and the [[scientific method]] is that it must be ''empirically'' based on the evidence of the senses. Both [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s use working [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] that are [[testable]] by [[observation]] and [[experiment]]. The term ''semi-empirical'' is sometimes used to describe theoretical methods that make use of basic [[axiom]]s, established scientific laws, and previous experimental results in order to engage in reasoned model building and theoretical inquiry.

Philosophical empiricists hold no knowledge to be properly inferred or deduced unless it is derived from one's sense-based experience.&lt;ref&gt;Markie, P. (2004), "Rationalism vs. Empiricism" in Edward D. Zalta (ed.), ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/ Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This view is commonly contrasted with [[rationalism]], which states that knowledge may be derived from [[reason]] independently of the senses. For example, [[John Locke]] held that some knowledge (e.g. knowledge of God's existence) could be arrived at through [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and reasoning alone. Similarly [[Robert Boyle]], a prominent advocate of the experimental method, held that we have innate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Luis E. (1981), ''From Descartes to Hume: Continental Metaphysics and the Development of Modern Philosophy'', Ithaca, Cornell University Press.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Engfer, Hans-Jürgen (1996), ''Empirismus versus Rationalismus? Kritik eines philosophiegeschichtlichen Schemas'', Padeborn: Schöningh.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main continental rationalists ([[Descartes]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]) were also advocates of the empirical "scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, Stephen (1999), "British Sceptical Realism. A Fresh Look at the British Tradition", ''European Journal of Philosophy'', 7, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Anstey, "[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/2010/09/esp-is-best/ ESP is best]", ''[https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/emxphi/ Early Modern Experimental Philosophy]'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early empiricism===
''[[Vaisheshika]]'' [[darsana]], founded by the ancient Indian philosopher [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanada]], accepted perception and inference as the only two reliable sources of knowledge. This is enumerated in his work [[Vaiśeṣika Sūtra]].

The earliest Western proto-empiricists were the [[Empiric school]] of ancient Greek medical practitioners, who rejected the three doctrines of the [[Dogmatic school]], preferring to rely on the observation of ''[[Phenomenalism|"phenomena"]]''.&lt;ref name=sini&gt;Sini, Carlo (2004), "Empirismo", in Gianni Vattimo et al. (eds.), ''Enciclopedia Garzanti della Filosofia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("clean slate" or "blank tablet") connotes a view of mind as an originally blank or empty recorder (Locke used the words "white paper") on which experience leaves marks. This denies that humans have [[innate ideas]]. The image dates back to [[Aristotle]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What the mind (''[[nous]]'') thinks must be in it in the same sense as letters are on a tablet (''grammateion'') which bears no actual writing (''grammenon'');  this is just what happens in the case of the mind.  (Aristotle, ''[[On the Soul]]'', 3.4.430&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;1).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristotle's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense, but rather based on his theory of [[potentiality and actuality]], and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the [[active intellect|active ''nous'']]. These notions contrasted with [[Platonism|Platonic]] notions of the human mind as an entity that pre-existed somewhere in the heavens, before being sent down to join a body on Earth (see Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'' and ''Apology'', as well as others).  Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than [[Plato]], and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as "''nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu''" (Latin for "nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses").

This idea was later developed in ancient philosophy by the [[stoicism|Stoic]] school. Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank, but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bardzell|first1=Jeffrey|title=Speculative Grammar and Stoic Language Theory in Medieval Allegorical Narrative: From Prudentius to Alan of Lille|date=June 11, 2014|publisher=Routledge|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doxographer [[Aetius (philosopher)|Aetius]] summarizes this view as "When a man is born, the Stoics say, he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon."&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz 4.11 translated by {{cite book|last1=Long|first1=A.A.|last2=Sedley|first2=D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers: Vol. 1|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge|location=Cambridge, Ma|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]] Aristotle's theory of ''tabula rasa'' was developed by [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] starting with [[Al Farabi]], developing into an elaborate theory by [[Avicenna]]&lt;ref name=Rizvi/&gt; and demonstrated as a [[thought experiment]] by [[Ibn Tufail]].&lt;ref name=Russell/&gt; For Avicenna ([[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]]), for example, the ''tabula rasa'' is a pure potentiality that is actualized through [[education]], and knowledge is attained through "empirical familiarity with objects in this world from which one abstracts universal concepts" developed through a "[[Syllogism|syllogistic]] method of [[reasoning]] in which observations lead to propositional statements which when compounded lead to further abstract concepts". The [[intellect]] itself develops from a [[passive intellect|material intellect]] (''al-'aql al-hayulani''), which is a [[potentiality]] "that can acquire knowledge to the [[active intellect]] (''al-[['aql]] al-fa'il''), the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge".&lt;ref name=Rizvi&gt;Sajjad H. Rizvi (2006), [http://www.iep.utm.edu/a/avicenna.htm Avicenna/Ibn Sina (c. 980–1037)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt; So the immaterial "active intellect", separate from any individual person, is still essential for understanding to occur.

In the 12th century CE the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[Muslim]] philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]] (known as "Abubacer" or "Ebn Tophail" in the West) included the theory of ''tabula rasa'' as a [[thought experiment]] in his [[Arabic literature|Arabic philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' in which he depicted the development of the mind of a [[feral child]] "from a ''tabula rasa'' to that of an adult, in complete isolation from society" on a [[desert island]], through experience alone. The [[Latin]] translation of his [[philosophical novel]], entitled ''Philosophus Autodidactus'', published by [[Edward Pococke]] the Younger in 1671, had an influence on [[John Locke]]'s formulation of ''tabula rasa'' in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;G. A. Russell (1994), ''The 'Arabick' Interest of the Natural Philosophers in Seventeenth-Century England'', pp. 224–62, [[Brill Publishers]], {{ISBN|90-04-09459-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[Islamic theology|Islamic theological]] novel, ''[[Theologus Autodidactus]]'', was written by the Arab theologian and physician [[Ibn al-Nafis]] in the 13th century. It also dealt with the theme of empiricism through the story of a feral child on a desert island, but departed from its predecessor by depicting the development of the protagonist's mind through contact with society rather than in isolation from society.&lt;ref name="Roubi"&gt;Dr. Abu Shadi Al-Roubi (1982), "Ibn Al-Nafis as a philosopher", ''Symposium on Ibn al-Nafis'', Second International Conference on Islamic Medicine: Islamic Medical Organization, Kuwait ([[cf.]] [http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html Ibn al-Nafis As a Philosopher] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206072116/http://www.islamset.com/isc/nafis/drroubi.html |date=February 6, 2008 }}, ''Encyclopedia of Islamic World'')&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 13th century [[Thomas Aquinas]] adopted the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] position that the senses are essential to mind into [[scholasticism]]. [[Bonaventure]] (1221–1274), one of Aquinas' strongest intellectual opponents, offered some of the strongest arguments in favour of the Platonic idea of the mind.

===Renaissance Italy===
In the late [[renaissance]] various writers began to question the [[medieval]] and [[classical philosophy|classical]] understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way. In political and historical writing [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and his friend [[Francesco Guicciardini]] initiated a new realistic style of writing. Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the "effectual truth" instead. Their contemporary, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) said, "If you find from your own experience that something is a fact and it contradicts what some authority has written down, then you must abandon the authority and base your reasoning on your own findings."&lt;ref&gt;"Seeing the Body: The Divergence of Ancient Chineseand Western Medical Illustration", Camillia Matuk, Journal of Biocommunication, Vol. 32, No. 1, 2006, [http://www.sesp.northwestern.edu/docs/publications/6074956944509ac426aaa6.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The decidedly anti-Aristotelian and anti-clerical music theorist [[Vincenzo Galilei]] (c. 1520 – 1591), father of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and the inventor of [[monody]], made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems, firstly, of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments, and to volume of air in wind instruments; and secondly to composition, by his various suggestions to composers in his ''Dialogo della musica antica e moderna'' (Florence, 1581). The Italian word he used for "experiment" was ''esperienza''. It is known that he was the essential pedagogical influence upon the young Galileo, his eldest son (cf. Coelho, ed. ''Music and Science in the Age of Galileo Galilei''), arguably one of the most influential empiricists in history. Vincenzo, through his tuning research, found the underlying truth at the heart of the misunderstood myth of '[[Pythagorean hammers|Pythagoras' hammers]]' (the square of the numbers concerned yielded those musical intervals, not the actual numbers, as believed), and through this and other discoveries that demonstrated the fallibility of traditional authorities, a radically empirical attitude developed, passed on to Galileo, which regarded "experience and demonstration" as the ''sine qua non'' of valid rational enquiry.

===British empiricism===
'''British empiricism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, though it was not a term used at the time, derives from the 17th century period of [[early modern philosophy]] and [[modern science]]. The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders [[Francis Bacon]], described as [[The Advancement of Learning|empiricist]], and [[René Descartes]], who is described as a rationalist. [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]], in the next generation, are often also described as an empiricist and a rationalist respectively. [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]] were the primary exponents of empiricism in the 18th century [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], with Locke being the person who is normally known as the founder of empiricism as such.

In response to the early-to-mid-17th century "[[rationalism#Background|continental rationalism]]" [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) proposed in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) a very influential view wherein the ''only'' knowledge humans can have is ''[[a posteriori]]'', i.e., based upon experience. Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a ''[[tabula rasa]]'', a "blank tablet", in Locke's words "white paper", on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person's life proceeds are written. There are two sources of our ideas: sensation and reflection. In both cases, a distinction is made between simple and complex ideas. The former are unanalysable, and are broken down into primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities are essential for the object in question to be what it is. Without specific primary qualities, an object would not be what it is. For example, an apple is an apple because of the arrangement of its atomic structure. If an apple was structured differently, it would cease to be an apple. Secondary qualities are the sensory information we can perceive from its primary qualities. For example, an apple can be perceived in various colours, sizes, and textures but it is still identified as an apple. Therefore, its primary qualities dictate what the object essentially is, while its secondary qualities define its attributes. Complex ideas combine simple ones, and divide into substances, modes, and relations. According to Locke, our knowledge of things is a perception of ideas that are in accordance or discordance with each other, which is very different from the quest for [[certainty]] of [[Descartes]].

[[File:George Berkeley by John Smibert.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Bishop George Berkeley]]]]
A generation later, the Irish [[Anglican]] bishop, [[George Berkeley]] (1685–1753), determined that Locke's view immediately opened a door that would lead to eventual [[atheism]]. In response to Locke, he put forth in his ''[[Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge]]'' (1710) an important challenge to empiricism in which things ''only'' exist either as a ''result'' of their being perceived, or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving. (For Berkeley, God fills in for humans by doing the perceiving whenever humans are not around to do it.)  In his text ''Alciphron'', Berkeley maintained that any order humans may see in nature is the language or handwriting of God.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen (1987) "Berkeley's Theory of Reality" in ''The Journal of the Limerick Philosophical Society'', [http://www.ul.ie/~philos/vol1/berkel.html UL.ie]&lt;/ref&gt; Berkeley's approach to empiricism would later come to be called [[subjective idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "George Berkeley", vol. 1, p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP2"/&gt;

The Scottish philosopher [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) responded to Berkeley's criticisms of Locke, as well as other differences between early modern philosophers, and moved empiricism to a new level of [[skepticism]].  Hume argued in keeping with the empiricist view that all knowledge derives from sense experience, but he accepted that this has implications not normally acceptable to philosophers. He wrote for example, "Locke divides all arguments into demonstrative and probable. On this view, we must say that it is only probable that all men must die or that the sun will rise to-morrow, because neither of these can be demonstrated. But to conform our language more to common use, we ought to divide arguments into demonstrations, proofs, and probabilities—by ‘proofs’ meaning arguments from experience that leave no room for doubt or opposition."&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_prob"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of Probability|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt; And,&lt;ref name="Hume_human_understanding_chap_nec"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4320/4320-h/4320-h.htm|last=Hume|chapter=Of the Idea of a Necessary Connexion|title=Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"I believe the most general and most popular explication of this matter, is to say [See Mr. Locke, chapter of power.], that finding from experience, that there are several new productions in matter, such as the motions and variations of body, and concluding that there must somewhere be a power capable of producing them, we arrive at last by this reasoning at the idea of power and efficacy. But to be convinced that this explication is more popular than philosophical, we need but reflect on two very obvious principles. First, That reason alone can never give rise to any original idea, and secondly, that reason, as distinguished from experience, can never make us conclude, that a cause or productive quality is absolutely requisite to every beginning of existence. Both these considerations have been sufficiently explained: and therefore shall not at present be any farther insisted on."|Hume Section XIV "of the idea of necessary connexion in ''A Treatise of Human Nature''}}

Hume divided all of human knowledge into two categories: ''relations of ideas'' and ''matters of fact'' (see also [[Immanuel Kant|Kant's]] [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]). Mathematical and logical propositions (e.g. "that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two sides") are examples of the first, while propositions involving  some [[contingent]] observation of the world (e.g. "the sun rises in the East") are examples of the second. All of people's "ideas", in turn, are derived from their "impressions". For Hume, an "impression" corresponds roughly with what we call a sensation. To remember or to imagine such impressions is to have an "idea". Ideas are therefore the faint copies of sensations.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt;

[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|[[David Hume]]'s empiricism led to numerous philosophical schools.]]
Hume maintained that no knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, can be conclusively established by reason.  Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated ''habits'', developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about [[scientific method]]—that of the [[problem of induction]].  Hume argued that it requires [[inductive reasoning]] to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument.&lt;ref name = Hume1/&gt; Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past.  Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by [[inductive reasoning]] that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.&lt;ref name=Hume1&gt;Hume, D. "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding", in Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding and Concerning the Principles of Morals, 2nd edition, L.A. Selby-Bigge (ed.), [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford, UK, 1902 [1748].{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume concluded that such things as belief in an external world and belief in the existence of the self were not rationally justifiable. According to Hume these beliefs were to be accepted nonetheless because of their profound basis in instinct and custom.  Hume's lasting legacy, however, was the doubt that his skeptical arguments cast on the legitimacy of inductive reasoning, allowing many skeptics who followed to cast similar doubt.

===Phenomenalism===
{{Main|Phenomenalism}}
Most of Hume's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is ''rationally'' unjustifiable, contending that Hume's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief, that is, beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct, custom and habit.&lt;ref&gt;Morick, H. (1980), Challenges to Empiricism, Hackett Publishing, Indianapolis, IN.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an extreme empiricist theory known as [[phenomenalism]], anticipated by the arguments of both Hume and George Berkeley, a physical object is a kind of construction out of our experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Marconi, Diego (2004), "Fenomenismo"', in [[Gianni Vattimo]] and Gaetano Chiurazzi (eds.), ''L'Enciclopedia Garzanti di Filosofia'', 3rd edition, Garzanti, Milan, Italy.&lt;/ref&gt;  Phenomenalism is the view that physical objects, properties, events (whatever is physical) are reducible to mental objects, properties, events. Ultimately, only mental objects, properties, events, exist—hence the closely related term [[subjective idealism]]. By the phenomenalistic line of thinking, to have a visual experience of a real physical thing is to have an experience of a certain kind of group of experiences.  This type of set of experiences possesses a constancy and coherence that is lacking in the set of experiences of which hallucinations, for example, are a part. As [[John Stuart Mill]] put it in the mid-19th century, matter is the "permanent possibility of sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., "An Examination of Sir William Rowan Hamilton's Philosophy", in A.J. Ayer and Ramond Winch (eds.), British Empirical Philosophers, Simon and Schuster, New York, NY, 1968.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Mill's empiricism went a significant step beyond Hume in still another respect: in maintaining that induction is necessary for ''all'' meaningful knowledge including mathematics.  As summarized by D.W. Hamlin:

{{quote|[Mill] claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience; mathematical inference, generally conceived as deductive [and ''a priori''] in nature, Mill set down as founded on induction.  Thus, in Mill's philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas.  In his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological; we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those that logical and mathematical propositions assert. This is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known, but it has not found many defenders.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;}}

Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Fred (2005), "John Stuart Mill", in Edward N. Zalta (ed.), Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;  The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations.  This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" might exist in the first place.  Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of "reality" that goes beyond mere "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms.&lt;ref name = MEP2/&gt;&lt;ref name=MEP6&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Phenomenalism", vol. 6, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all".&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;  Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.  It  fails to fully consider the structure and method of [[mathematical science]], the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent [[deductive reasoning|deductive]] set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of [[inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref name=MEP2&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Empiricism", vol. 2, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MEP6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan Encyclopedia of Philosophy (1969), "Axiomatic Method", vol. 5, pp. 188–89, 191ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenalist phase of post-Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s, for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data.&lt;ref&gt;Bolender, John (1998), "Factual Phenomenalism: A Supervenience Theory"', Sorites, no. 9, pp. 16–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  If a physical object statement is to be translatable into a sense-data statement, the former must be at least deducible from the latter. But it came to be realized that there is no finite set of statements about actual and possible sense-data from which we can deduce even a single physical-object statement.  The translating or paraphrasing statement must be couched in terms of normal observers in normal conditions of observation. There is, however, no ''finite'' set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer. According to phenomenalism, to say that a normal observer is present is to make the hypothetical statement that were a doctor to inspect the observer, the observer would appear to the doctor to be normal.  But, of course, the doctor himself must be a normal observer. If we are to specify this doctor's normality in sensory terms, we must make reference to a second doctor who, when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor, would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer. And if we are to specify in sensory terms that the second doctor is a normal observer, we must refer to a third doctor, and so on (also see the [[Third Man Argument|third man]]).&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah (2004), The Refutation of Phenomenalism, Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chisholm |first1=Roderick M. |date=September 9, 1948 |title=The Problem of Empiricism |journal=The Journal of Philosophy |volume=45 |issue=19 |pages=512–17 |jstor=2019108 |doi=10.2307/2019108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Logical empiricism===
{{Main|Logical positivism}}
Logical empiricism (also ''logical positivism'' or ''neopositivism'') was an early 20th-century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism (e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge) with certain insights from [[mathematical logic]] that had been developed by [[Gottlob Frege]]  and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]. Some of the key figures in this movement were [[Otto Neurath]], [[Moritz Schlick]] and the rest of the [[Vienna Circle]], along with  [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Hans Reichenbach]].

The neopositivists subscribed to a notion of philosophy as the conceptual clarification of the  methods, insights and discoveries of the sciences. They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege (1848–1925) and [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal, logically perfect, language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language. This gave rise to what they saw as metaphysical pseudoproblems and other conceptual confusions. By combining Frege's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein's idea that all [[logical truth]]s are mere linguistic [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions: the ''analytic'' (a priori) and the ''synthetic'' (a posteriori).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Achinstein|Achinstein, Peter]], and [[Stephen Francis Barker|Barker, Stephen F.]] (1969), The Legacy of Logical Positivism: Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, they formulated a strong principle of demarcation between sentences that have sense and those that do not: the so-called [[verification principle]]. Any sentence that is not purely logical, or is unverifiable is devoid of meaning. As a result, most metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered pseudoproblems.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Francesco (1986), Il neopositivismo logico, Laterza, Roma Bari.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the extreme empiricism of the neopositivists—at least before the 1930s—any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion (or set of ultimate assertions) that expresses direct observations or perceptions. In later years, Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of ''phenomenalism'' in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio-temporal physics.  That is, instead of translating sentences about physical objects into sense-data, such sentences were to be translated into so-called ''protocol sentences'', for example, "''X'' at location ''Y'' and at time ''T'' observes such and such."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Rescher|Rescher, Nicholas]] (1985), The Heritage of Logical Positivism, University Press of America, Lanham, MD.&lt;/ref&gt;  The central theses of logical positivism (verificationism, the analytic–synthetic distinction, reductionism, etc.) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as [[Nelson Goodman]], [[W.V. Quine]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Karl Popper]], and [[Richard Rorty]].  By the late 1960s, it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course, though its influence is still significant  among contemporary [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophers]] such as [[Michael Dummett]] and other [[anti-realism|anti-realists]].

===Pragmatism===
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of [[pragmatism|pragmatic philosophy]] arose.  The ideas of pragmatism, in its various forms, developed mainly from discussions between [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[William James]] when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s.  James popularized the term "pragmatism", giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony, but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking, and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of "pragmaticism".  Along with its ''[[pragmatic theory of truth]]'', this perspective integrates the basic insights of empirical (experience-based) and [[rationalism|rational]] (concept-based) thinking.

[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
Charles Peirce (1839–1914) was highly influential in laying the groundwork for today's empirical [[scientific method]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/peirce/ |title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Burch|first=Robert|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Peirce severely criticized many elements of Descartes' peculiar brand of rationalism, he did not reject rationalism outright.  Indeed, he concurred with the main ideas of rationalism, most importantly the idea that rational concepts can be meaningful and the idea that rational concepts necessarily go beyond the data given by empirical observation.  In later years he even emphasized the concept-driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism, in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the "data-driven" strict-empiricist view.

Among Peirce's major contributions was to place [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] in a complementary rather than competitive mode, the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before.  To this, Peirce added the concept of [[abductive reasoning]].  The combined three forms of reasoning serve as a primary conceptual foundation for the empirically based scientific method today.  Peirce's approach "presupposes that (1) the objects of knowledge are real things, (2) the characters (properties) of real things do not depend on our perceptions of them, and (3) everyone who has sufficient experience of real things will agree on the truth about them.  According to Peirce's doctrine of [[fallibilism]], the conclusions of science are always tentative. The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions, but on its self-corrective character: by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes, and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Teddy (n.d.), "Empiricism", [http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm Eprint] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714183655/http://personal.ecu.edu/mccartyr/american/leap/empirici.htm |date=2012-07-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wm james.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[William James]]]]
In his Harvard "Lectures on Pragmatism" (1903), Peirce enumerated what he called the "three cotary propositions of pragmatism" ([[Latin|L:]] ''cos, cotis'' whetstone), saying that they "put the edge on the [[pragmatic maxim|maxim of pragmatism]]".  First among these he listed the peripatetic-thomist observation mentioned above, but he further observed that this link between sensory perception and intellectual conception is a two-way street.  That is, it can be taken to say that whatever we find in the intellect is also incipiently in the senses.  Hence, if theories are theory-laden then so are the senses, and perception itself can be seen as a species of [[abductive reasoning|abductive inference]], its difference being that it is beyond control and hence beyond critique—in a word, incorrigible.  This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and revisability of scientific concepts, since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or "thisness"—what the [[Scholastics]] called its ''[[haecceity]]''—that stands beyond control and correction.  Scientific concepts, on the other hand, are general in nature, and transient sensations do in another sense find correction within them.  This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive science]] research, most recently for instance with the work of [[Irvin Rock]] on ''[[indirect perception]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin (1983), The Logic of Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Irvin, (1997) Indirect Perception, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the beginning of the 20th century, William James (1842–1910) coined the term "[[radical empiricism]]" to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism, which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism—though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James's published lectures. James maintained that the empirically observed "directly apprehended universe needs ... no extraneous trans-empirical connective support",&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1911), The Meaning of Truth.&lt;/ref&gt; by which he meant to rule out the perception that there can be any [[value added]] by seeking [[supernatural]] explanations for [[nature|natural]] [[phenomena]].  James' "radical empiricism" is thus ''not'' radical in the context of the term "empiricism", but is instead fairly consistent with the modern use of the term "[[empirical]]". His method of argument in arriving at this view, however, still readily encounters debate within philosophy even today.

[[John Dewey]] (1859–1952) modified James' pragmatism to form a theory known as [[instrumentalism]].  The role of sense experience in Dewey's theory is crucial, in that he saw experience as unified totality of things through which everything else is interrelated.  Dewey's basic thought, in accordance with empiricism was that [[reality]] is determined by past experience.  Therefore, humans adapt their past experiences of things to perform experiments upon and test the pragmatic values of such experience.  The value of such experience is measured experientially and scientifically, and the results of such tests generate ideas that serve as instruments for future experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, John (1906), Studies in Logical Theory.{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in physical sciences as in ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1353/jsp.2011.0000 |title=What Experimentalism Means in Ethics |year=2011 |last1=Weber |first1=Eric Thomas |journal=The Journal of Speculative Philosophy |volume=25 |pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, ideas in Dewey's system retain their empiricist flavour in that they are only known ''a posteriori''.

In [[thermodynamics]], the '''Gibbs free energy''' ([[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommended name: '''Gibbs energy''' or '''Gibbs function'''; also known as '''free enthalpy'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Greiner | first1=Walter | last2=Neise | first2=Ludwig | last3=Stöcker | first3=Horst | title=Thermodynamics and statistical mechanics
 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | year=1995 | page=101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to distinguish it from [[Helmholtz free energy]]) is a [[thermodynamic potential]] that can be used to calculate the [[maximum]] of reversible [[work (physics)|work]] that may be performed by a [[thermodynamic system]] at a constant [[temperature]] and [[pressure]] ([[isothermal]], [[Isobaric process|isobaric]]).  The Gibbs free energy (ΔGº = ΔHº-TΔSº) ([[Joule|J]] in [[International System of Units|SI units]]) is the ''maximum'' amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a [[closed system|thermodynamically closed system]] (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the [[pressure]] forces.&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | last = Perrot | first = Pierre | title = A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-19-856552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gibbs energy (also referred to as ''G'') is also the thermodynamic potential that is minimized when a system reaches [[chemical equilibrium]] at constant pressure and temperature. Its derivative with respect to the reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point. As such, a reduction in ''G'' is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant [[pressure]] and [[temperature]].

The Gibbs free energy, originally called ''available energy'', was developed in the 1870s by the American scientist [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]]. In 1873, Gibbs described this "available energy" as
{{quote|the greatest amount of mechanical work which can be obtained from a given quantity of a certain substance in a given initial state, without increasing its total [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] or allowing heat to pass to or from external bodies, except such as at the close of the processes are left in their initial condition.&lt;ref&gt;J.W. Gibbs, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces," ''[[Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]]'' 2, Dec. 1873, pp. 382-404 (quotation on p. 400).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The initial state of the body, according to Gibbs, is supposed to be such that "the body can be made to pass from it to states of [[dissipated energy]] by [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]]".  In his 1876 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'', a graphical analysis of multi-phase chemical systems, he engaged his thoughts on chemical free energy in full.

However, even though favorable, it is so slow that it is not observed.  Whether a reaction is thermodynamically favorable does not determine its rate.]]
According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]], for systems reacting at [[standard temperature and pressure|STP]] (or any other fixed temperature and pressure), there is a general natural tendency to achieve a minimum of the Gibbs free energy.

A quantitative measure of the favorability of a given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the change Δ''G'' (sometimes written "delta ''G''" or "d''G''") in Gibbs free energy that is (or would be) caused by the reaction. As a necessary condition for the reaction to occur at constant temperature and pressure, Δ''G'' must be smaller than the non-[[pressure-volume work|PV]] (e.g. electrical) work, which is often equal to zero (hence Δ''G'' must be negative).  Δ''G'' equals the maximum amount of non-''PV'' work that can be performed as a result of the chemical reaction for the case of reversible process. If the analysis indicated a positive Δ''G'' for the reaction, then energy — in the form of electrical or other non-''PV'' work — would have to be added to the reacting system for Δ''G'' to be smaller than the non-''PV'' work and make it possible for the reaction to occur.&lt;ref name="AtkinsJones2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Atkins|author2=Loretta Jones|title=Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight|date=1 August 2007|publisher=W. H. Freeman|isbn=978-1-4292-0965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|298–299}}

We can think of ∆G as the amount of "free" or "useful" energy available to do work. The equation can be also seen from the perspective of the system taken together with its surroundings (the rest of the universe). First, assume that the given reaction at constant temperature and pressure is the only one that is occurring. Then the [[entropy]] released or absorbed by the system equals the entropy that the environment must absorb or release, respectively. The reaction will only be allowed if the total entropy change of the universe is zero or positive. This is reflected in a negative Δ''G'', and the reaction is called [[exergonic]].

If we couple reactions, then an otherwise [[endergonic]] chemical reaction (one with positive Δ''G'') can be made to happen. The input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction, such as the [[elimination reaction|elimination]] of [[cyclohexanol]] to [[cyclohexene]], can be seen as coupling an unfavourable reaction (elimination) to a favourable one (burning of coal or other provision of heat) such that the total entropy change of the universe is greater than or equal to zero, making the ''total'' Gibbs free energy difference of the coupled reactions negative.

In traditional use, the term "free" was included in "Gibbs free energy" to mean "available in the form of useful work".&lt;ref name="Perrot" /&gt; The characterization becomes more precise if we add the qualification that it is the energy available for ''non-volume'' work{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Reiss | first = Howard | title = Methods of Thermodynamics | publisher = Dover Publications | year = 1965 | isbn = 0-486-69445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (An analogous, but slightly different, meaning of "free" applies in conjunction with the Helmholtz free energy, for systems at constant temperature).  However, an increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment "free", referring to ''G'' as simply "Gibbs energy".  This is the result of a 1988 [[IUPAC]] meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the adjective "free" was supposedly banished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Glossary of Atmospheric Chemistry Terms (Recommendations 1990) |url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/publications/pac/1990/pdf/6211x2167.html |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry|Pure Appl.

==History==
{{see also|Thermodynamic free energy#History|l1=Thermodynamic free energy}}
The quantity called "free energy" is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term ''affinity'', which was used by chemists in the earlier years of physical chemistry to describe the ''force'' that caused [[chemical reaction]]s.

In 1873, [[Willard Gibbs]] published ''A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces'', in which he sketched the principles of his new equation that was able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact.  By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies composed of part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]-[[entropy]]-[[internal energy]] graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e., "necessarily stable", "neutral", and "unstable", and whether or not changes would ensue.  Further, Gibbs stated:&lt;ref name=Gibbs1873&gt;J. W. Gibbs, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces", ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'' 2, Dec. 1873, pp. 382–404.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="messagebox"
|-
|align="left"|
If we wish to express in a single equation the necessary and sufficient condition of [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] for a substance when surrounded by a medium of constant [[pressure]] ''p'' and [[temperature]] ''T'', this equation may be written:

:{{nowrap|1=''δ''(''ε'' − ''Tη'' + ''pν'') = 0}}

when ''δ'' refers to the variation produced by any variations in the [[thermodynamic state|state]] of the parts of the body, and (when different parts of the body are in different states) in the proportion in which the body is divided between the different states.  The condition of stable equilibrium is that the value of the expression in the parenthesis shall be a minimum. 
|}

In this description, as used by Gibbs, ''ε'' refers to the [[internal energy]] of the body, ''η'' refers to the [[entropy]] of the body, and ''ν'' is the [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] of the body.

Thereafter, in 1882, the German scientist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] characterized the affinity as the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a reversible cell.  The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free, or available, energy of the system (''Gibbs free energy'' ''G'' at ''T'' = constant, ''P'' = constant or ''Helmholtz free energy'' ''F'' at ''T'' = constant, ''V'' = constant), whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system ([[internal energy]]).  Thus, ''G'' or ''F'' is the amount of energy "free" for work under the given conditions.

Until this point, the general view had been such that: "all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish".  Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy.  According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] led to the replacement of the term "affinity" by the term "free energy" in much of the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="Leicester1971"&gt;{{cite book|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|title=The Historical Background of Chemistry|year=1971|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-61053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206}}

==Graphical interpretation==
Gibbs free energy was originally defined graphically.  In 1873, American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]] published his first thermodynamics paper, "Graphical Methods in the Thermodynamics of Fluids", in which Gibbs used the two coordinates of the entropy and volume to represent the state of the body. In his second follow-up paper, "A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces", published later that year, Gibbs added in the third coordinate of the energy of the body, defined on three figures. In 1874, Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] used Gibbs' figures to make a 3D energy-entropy-volume [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface]] of a fictitious water-like substance.&lt;ref&gt;James Clerk Maxwell, Elizabeth Garber, Stephen G. Brush, and C. W. Francis Everitt (1995), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hA-oIDR0eXkC&amp;pg=PA248 Maxwell on heat and statistical mechanics: on "avoiding all personal enquiries" of molecules]'', Lehigh University Press, {{ISBN|0-934223-34-3}}, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, in order to understand the very difficult concept of Gibbs free energy one must be able to understand its interpretation as Gibbs defined originally by section AB on his figure 3 and as Maxwell sculpted that section on his [[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|3D surface figure]].

[[File:Gibbs-Maxwell surfaces.png|750px|center|thumb|American scientist [[Willard Gibbs]]' 1873 figures two and three (above left and middle) used by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in 1874 to create a three-dimensional [[entropy]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[energy]] '''[[Maxwell's thermodynamic surface|thermodynamic surface]]''' diagram for a fictitious water-like substance, transposed the two figures of Gibbs (above right) onto the volume-entropy coordinates (transposed to bottom of cube) and energy-entropy coordinates (flipped upside down and transposed to back of cube), respectively, of a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinates]]; the region AB being the first-ever three-dimensional representation of Gibbs free energy, or what Gibbs called "available energy"; the region AC being its capacity for [[entropy]], what Gibbs defined as "the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume.]]

==Definitions==
[[File:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|thumb|[[Willard Gibbs]]’ 1873 '''available energy''' (free energy) graph, which shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' ([[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]]) and passing through point A, which represents the initial state of the body.  MN is the section of the surface of [[dissipated energy]]. Q''ε'' and Q''η'' are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ''ε'' ([[internal energy]]) and ''η'' ([[entropy]]), respectively.  AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its ''available energy'' (Gibbs free energy) and its ''capacity for entropy'' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]
The Gibbs free energy is defined as
:&lt;math&gt;G(p,T) = U + pV - TS,&lt;/math&gt;

which is the same as
:&lt;math&gt;G(p,T) = H - TS,&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''U'' is the [[internal energy]] (SI unit: [[joule]]),
: ''p'' is [[pressure]] (SI unit: [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]),
: ''V'' is [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]] (SI unit: m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;),
: ''T'' is the [[temperature]] (SI unit: [[kelvin]]),
: ''S'' is the [[entropy]] (SI unit: joule per kelvin),
: ''H'' is the [[enthalpy]] (SI unit: joule).

The expression for the infinitesimal reversible change in the Gibbs free energy as a function of its "natural variables" ''p'' and ''T'', for an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]], subjected to the operation of external forces (for instance, electrical or magnetic) ''X&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', which cause the external parameters of the system ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to change by an amount d''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', can be derived as follows from the first law for reversible processes:

:&lt;math&gt;T\,\mathrm{d}S= \mathrm{d}U + p\,\mathrm{d}V - \sum_{i=1}^k \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i + \sum_{i=1}^n X_i \,\mathrm{d}a_i + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] of the ''i''th [[chemical species|chemical component]]. (SI unit: joules per particle&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01032.html Chemical Potential], IUPAC Gold Book.&lt;/ref&gt; or joules per mole&lt;ref name="Perrot" /&gt;)
: ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[particle number|number of particles]] (or number of moles) composing the ''i''th chemical component.

This is one form of '''Gibbs fundamental equation'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Müller | first = Ingo | title = A History of Thermodynamics – the Doctrine of Energy and Entropy | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-3-540-46226-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the infinitesimal expression, the term involving the chemical potential accounts for changes in Gibbs free energy resulting from an influx or outflux of particles. In other words, it holds for an [[Open system (systems theory)|open system]] or for a [[Closed system|closed]], chemically reacting system where the ''N&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' are changing. For a closed, non-reacting system, this term may be dropped.

Any number of extra terms may be added, depending on the particular system being considered. Aside from [[mechanical work]], a system may, in addition, perform numerous other types of work.  For example, in the infinitesimal expression, the contractile work energy associated with a thermodynamic system that is a contractile fiber that shortens by an amount −d''l'' under a force ''f'' would result in a term ''f'' d''l'' being added.  If a quantity of charge −d''e'' is acquired by a system at an electrical potential Ψ, the electrical work associated with this is −Ψ d''e'', which would be included in the infinitesimal expression.  Other work terms are added on per system requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Katchalsky | first = A.  |author2=Curran, Peter F.| title = Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] | year = 1965 | id = CCN 65-22045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each quantity in the equations above can be divided by the amount of substance, measured in [[Mole (unit)|moles]], to form ''molar Gibbs free energy''. The Gibbs free energy is one of the most important thermodynamic functions for the characterization of a system. It is a factor in determining outcomes such as the [[voltage]] of an [[electrochemical cell]], and the [[equilibrium constant]] for a [[reversible reaction]]. In isothermal, isobaric systems, Gibbs free energy can be thought of as a "dynamic" quantity, in that it is a representative measure of the competing effects of the enthalpic{{clarify|reason=What is enthalpic force? No reference to it in Wikipedia's enthalpy article.|date=March 2015}} and entropic driving forces involved in a thermodynamic process.

[[File:Thermodynamics_Gibbs_E0_Ecell_pH.png|thumb|upright=1.9|Relation to other relevant parameters]]

The temperature dependence of the Gibbs energy for an [[ideal gas]] is given by the [[Gibbs–Helmholtz equation]], and its pressure dependence is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \frac{G^\circ}{N} + kT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the volume is known rather than pressure, then it becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \frac{G^\circ}{N} + kT\ln \frac{V^\circ}{V},&lt;/math&gt;

or more conveniently as its [[chemical potential]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{G}{N} = \mu = \mu^\circ + kT\ln \frac{p}{p^\circ}.&lt;/math&gt;

In non-ideal systems, [[fugacity]] comes into play.

==Derivation==
The Gibbs free energy [[total differential]] [[Thermodynamic potential#Natural variables|natural variables]] may be derived by [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transforms]] of the [[internal energy]].
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U = T\,\mathrm{d}S - p \,\mathrm{d}V + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d} N_i.&lt;/math&gt;

The definition of ''G'' from above is
:&lt;math&gt;G = U + p V - T S&lt;/math&gt;.

Taking the total differential, we have
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}G = \mathrm{d}U + p\,\mathrm{d}V + V\,\mathrm{d}p - T\,\mathrm{d}S - S\,\mathrm{d}T.&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing d''U'' with the result from the first law gives&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mathrm{d}G &amp;= T\,\mathrm{d}S - p\,\mathrm{d}V + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d}N_i + p \,\mathrm{d}V + V\,\mathrm{d}p - T\,\mathrm{d}S - S\,\mathrm{d}T\\
&amp;= V\,\mathrm{d}p - S\,\mathrm{d}T + \sum_i \mu_i \,\mathrm{d} N_i.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The natural variables of ''G'' are then ''p'', ''T'', and {''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}.

===Homogeneous systems===

Because ''S'', ''V'', and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive variables]], an [[Thermodynamic potentials#Euler integrals|Euler integral]] allows easy integration of d''U'':&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/opensys/opensys.html |title=Open Systems |accessdate=2007-10-11 |last=Salzman |first=William R. |date=2001-08-21 |work=Chemical Thermodynamics |publisher=[[University of Arizona]]  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707224025/http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/opensys/opensys.html |archivedate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;U = T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i.&lt;/math&gt;

Because some of the natural variables of ''G'' are intensive, d''G'' may not be integrated using Euler integrals as is the case with internal energy. However, simply substituting the above integrated result for ''U'' into the definition of ''G'' gives a standard expression for ''G'':&lt;ref name="Salzman2001"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
G &amp;= U + p V - TS\\
  &amp;= (T S - p V + \sum_i \mu_i N_i) + p V - T S\\
  &amp;= \sum_i \mu_i N_i.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This result applies to homogeneous, macroscopic systems, but not to all thermodynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1740312| last = Brachman | first = M. K.| title = Fermi Level, Chemical Potential, and Gibbs Free Energy | journal = The Journal of Chemical Physics | volume = 22 | issue = 6 | page = 1152| year = 1954 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1954JChPh..22.1152B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gibbs free energy of reactions==
The system under consideration is held at constant temperature and pressure, and is closed (no matter can come in or out). The Gibbs energy of any system is {{tmath|1=G=U+PV-TS}} and an infinitesimal change in ''G'', at constant temperature and pressure yields:

:&lt;math&gt;dG=dU+PdV-TdS&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[first law of thermodynamics]], a change in the internal energy ''U'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q+\delta W&lt;/math&gt; 

where ''&amp;delta;Q'' is energy added as heat, and ''&amp;delta;W'' is energy added as work. The work done on the system may be written as ''&amp;delta;W'' = &amp;minus;''PdV'' + ''&amp;delta;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', where &amp;minus;''PdV'' is the mechanical work of compression/expansion done on the system and ''&amp;delta;W&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' is all other forms of work, which may include electrical, magnetic, etc. Assuming that only mechanical work is done,

:&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-PdV&lt;/math&gt;

and the infinitesimal change in ''G'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;dG=\delta Q-TdS&lt;/math&gt;

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that for a closed system, &lt;math&gt;TdS \ge \delta Q&lt;/math&gt;, and so it follows that:

:&lt;math&gt;dG \le 0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that for a system which is not in equilibrium, its Gibbs energy will always be decreasing, and when it is in equilibrium (i.e. no longer changing), the infinitesimal change ''dG'' will be zero. In particular, this will be true if the system is experiencing any number of internal chemical reactions on its path to equilibrium.

==Useful identities to derive the Nernst equation==
{{confusing section|small=no|reason=the physical situation is not explained. Also, the circle notation is not well explained (even in the one case where it is attempted). It's just bare equations|date=March 2015}}

During a reversible electrochemical reaction at constant temperature and pressure, the following equations involving the Gibbs free energy hold:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G = \Delta_\text{r} G^\circ + R T \ln Q_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[chemical equilibrium]]),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -R T \ln K_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; (for a system at chemical equilibrium),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G = w_\text{elec,rev} = -nFE&lt;/math&gt; (for a reversible electrochemical process at constant temperature and pressure),
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -nFE^\circ&lt;/math&gt; (definition of ''E''°),

and rearranging gives
:&lt;math&gt;nFE^\circ = RT \ln K_\text{eq},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;nFE = nFE^\circ - R T \ln Q_\text{r}r,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E = E^\circ - \frac{R T}{n F} \ln Q_\text{r},&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the cell potential resulting from the reaction to the equilibrium constant and [[reaction quotient]] for that reaction ([[Nernst equation]]),

where
: Δ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' = Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction,
: Δ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''G°'' = Gibbs free energy change per mole of reaction for unmixed reactants and products at standard conditions (i.e. 298K, 100kPa, 1M of each reactant and product),
: ''R'' = [[gas constant]],
: ''T'' = absolute [[temperature]],
: ln = [[natural logarithm]],
: ''Q&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [[reaction quotient]] (unitless),
: ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [[equilibrium constant]] (unitless),
: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;elec,rev&lt;/sub&gt; = [[Work (electrical)|electrical work]] in a reversible process (chemistry sign convention),
: ''n'' = number of [[Mole (unit)|moles]] of [[electrons]] transferred in the reaction,
: ''F'' = [[Faraday constant]] = 96485 C/mol (charge per [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of electrons),
: ''E'' = [[Electrode potential|cell potential]],
: ''E°'' = [[Standard electrode potential|standard cell potential]].

Moreover, we also have:
:&lt;math&gt;K_\text{eq} = e^{-\frac{\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ}{RT}},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G^\circ = -RT(\ln K_\text{eq}) = -2.303\,RT(\log_{10} K_\text{eq}),&lt;/math&gt;

which relates the equilibrium constant with Gibbs free energy.  This implies that at equilibrium
:&lt;math&gt;Q_\text{r} = K_\text{eq}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_\text{r} G=0&lt;/math&gt;

==The second law of thermodynamics and metabolism==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
A chemical reaction will (or can) proceed spontaneously if the change in the total entropy of the universe that would be caused by the reaction is nonnegative. As discussed in the overview, if the temperature and pressure are held constant, the Gibbs free energy is a (negative) proxy for the change in total entropy of the universe. It is "negative" because ''S'' appears with a negative coefficient in the expression for ''G'', so the Gibbs free energy moves in the opposite direction from the total entropy. Thus, a reaction with a positive Gibbs free energy will not proceed spontaneously. However, in biological systems (among others), energy inputs from other energy sources (including the Sun and exothermic chemical reactions) are "coupled" with reactions that are not entropically favored (i.e. have a Gibbs free energy above zero). Taking into account the coupled reactions, the total entropy in the universe increases. This coupling allows endergonic reactions, such as photosynthesis and DNA synthesis, to proceed without decreasing the total entropy of the universe. Thus biological systems do not violate the second law of thermodynamics.

The [[standard Gibbs free energy of formation]] of a compound is the change of Gibbs free energy that accompanies the formation of 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of that substance from its component elements, at their [[standard state]]s (the most stable form of the element at 25&amp;nbsp;°C and 100 [[kilopascal|kPa]]). Its symbol is Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚.

All elements in their standard states (diatomic [[oxygen]] gas, [[graphite]], etc.) have standard Gibbs free energy change of formation equal to zero, as there is no change involved.
:{{math|1= Δ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' = Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚ + ''RT'' ln ''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;''}}&amp;nbsp;; 
::''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[reaction quotient]].
:At equilibrium, Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G'' = 0, and ''Q&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'', so the equation becomes Δ&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt;''G''˚ = −''RT'' ln ''K'' (where ''K'' is the [[equilibrium constant]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23234">A '''heritage language''' is a [[minority language]] learnt by its speakers at home as children, but it is never fully developed because its speakers grow up with a [[dominant language]] in which they become more competent.&lt;ref&gt;Valdés, G. 2000. The teaching of heritage languages: an introduction for Slavic-teaching professionals. The learning and teaching of Slavic languages and cultures, Olga Kagan and Benjamin Rifkin (eds.), 375–403.&lt;/ref&gt; Polinsky &amp; Kagan label it as a continuum that ranges from fluent speakers to barely-speaking individuals of the [[home language]]. In some countries or cultures in which they determine one's mother tongue by the ethnic group, a heritage language would be linked to the native language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|Kagan|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also refer to the language of a person's family or community that the person does not speak or understand but culturally identify with it.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Valdés|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelleher 2010"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Kelleher|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions and use==
"Heritage language" is the term used to describe a language which is predominantly spoken by "nonsocietal"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/non+societal |title=Societal &amp;#124; Define Societal at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; groups and [[linguistic minorities]].&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; 

In various fields, such as foreign language education and [[linguistics]], the definitions of heritage language become more specific and divergent. In foreign language education, heritage language is defined in terms of a student’s upbringing and functional proficiency in the language: a student raised in a home where a non-majority language is spoken is a heritage speaker of that language if she/he possesses some proficiency in it.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt;  Under this definition, individuals that have some cultural connection with the language but do not speak it are not considered heritage students. This restricted definition became popular in the mid 1990s with the publication of ''Standards for Foreign Language Learning'' by the [[American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages]].&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt;

Among linguists, heritage language is an end-state language that is defined based on the temporal order of acquisition and, often, the language dominance in the individual.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; A heritage speaker acquires the heritage language as their [[first language]] through natural input in the home environment and acquires the majority language as a [[second language]],&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Montrul|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually when she/he starts school and talks about different topics with people in school, or by exposure through media (written texts, internet, popular culture etc.).&lt;ref name="benmamoun1"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Benmamoun|Montrul|Polinsky|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As exposure to the heritage language decreases and exposure to the majority language increases, the majority language becomes the individual’s dominant language and acquisition of the heritage language changes.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005"/&gt; The results of these changes can be seen in divergence of the heritage language from monolingual norms in the areas of [[phonology]], lexical knowledge (knowledge of vocabulary or words), [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]] and [[code-switching]], although mastery of the heritage language may vary from purely receptive skills in only informal spoken language to native-like [[fluency]].&lt;ref name="benmamoun1"/&gt;

===Controversy in definition===
As stated by Polinsky and Kagan: "The definition of a heritage speaker in general and for specific languages continues to be debated. The debate is of particular significance in such languages as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Arabic]], and languages of [[India]] and the [[Philippines]], where speakers of multiple languages or dialects are seen as heritage speakers of a single standard language taught for geographic, cultural or other reasons ([[Mandarin Chinese]], [[Classical Arabic]], [[Hindi]], or [[Filipino language|Tagalog]], respectively)."&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007" /&gt;

One idea that prevails in the literature is that "[heritage] languages include [[indigenous languages]] that are often endangered. . . as well as world languages that are commonly spoken in many other regions of the world (Spanish in the United States, Arabic in France)"&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt;. However, that view is not shared worldwide. In Canada, for example, Indigenous languages are not classified as heritage languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/aboriginal-people-languages/|title=Indigenous Languages in Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=Historica Canada|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The label ''heritage'' is given to a language based principally on the social status of its speakers and not necessarily on any linguistic property. Thus, while [[Spanish language|Spanish]] typically comes in second in terms of [[list of languages by number of native speakers|native speakers worldwide]] and has official status in a number of countries, it is considered a heritage language in the English-dominant United States.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt; Outside the United States, heritage language definitions and use vary.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umanitoba.ca/faculties/education/media/Babaee12.pdf|title=Heritage Language Learning in Canadian Public Schools: Language Rights Challenges|last=Babaee|first=Naghmeh|date=|website=University of Manitoba|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, M., McLeod, K., &amp; Morris, S. (Eds.). (1993). ''Heritage language and education: The Canadian experience''. Oakville, ON: Mosaic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of the same heritage language raised in the same community may differ significantly in terms of their language abilities, yet be considered heritage speakers under this definition. Some heritage speakers may be highly proficient in the language, possessing several [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]], while other heritage speakers may be able to understand the language but not produce it. Other individuals that simply have a cultural connection with a minority language but do not speak it may consider it to be their heritage language.&lt;ref name="Valdés 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kelleher 2010" /&gt; It is held by some that ownership does not necessarily depend on usership: “Some Aboriginal people distinguish between usership and ownership. There are even those who claim that they own a language although they only know one single word of it: its name.”&lt;ref&gt;See p. 113 of [http://www.zuckermann.org/pdf/Revival_Linguistics.pdf]{{cite journal|last1=Zuckermann|first1=Ghil'ad|last2=Walsh|first2=Michael|year=2011|title=Stop, Revive, Survive: Lessons from the Hebrew Revival Applicable to the Reclamation, Maintenance and Empowerment of Aboriginal Languages and Cultures]|journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics|volume=31|pages=111–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proficiency in heritage languages ==
[[Heritage language learning|Heritage learners]] have a fluent command of the dominant language and are comfortable using it in formal settings, due to their exposure to the language through [[formal education]].&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their command of the heritage language, however, varies widely. Some heritage learners may lose some fluency in the first language after beginning formal education in the dominant language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; Others may use the heritage language consistently at home and with family, but receive minimal to no formal training in the heritage language and thus may struggle with literacy skills or using it in broader settings outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; An additional factor that affects the acquisition of the learner, is whether he or she shows willingness or reluctance towards learning the heritage language.&lt;ref&gt;Dressler, R. (2010). "There Is No Space for Being German": Portraits of Willing and Reluctant Heritage Language Learners of German. ''Heritage Language Journal, 7''(2), 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

One factor that has been shown to influence the loss of fluency in the heritage language is age. Studies have shown that younger bilingual children are more susceptible to fluency loss than older bilingual children.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; The older the child is when the dominant language is introduced, the less likely he/she is going to lose ability in using his/her first language (the heritage language).&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; This is because the older the child is, the more exposure and knowledge of use the child will have had with the heritage language, and thus the heritage language will remain as their primary language.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2007"/&gt; Researchers found that this phenomenon primarily deals with the memory network of an individual. Once a memory network is organized, it is difficult for the brain to reorganize information contrary to the initial information, because the previous information was processed first.&lt;ref name="Au 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Oh|Knightly|Jun|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon becomes a struggle for adults who are trying to learn a different language. Once an individual has learned a language fluently, they will be heavily influenced by the grammatical rules and pronunciations of their first language they learned, while learning a new language.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt;

An emerging effective way of measuring the proficiency of a heritage speaker is by speech rate. A study of gender restructuring in heritage Russian showed that heritage speakers fell into two groups: those who maintained the three-gender system and those who radically reanalyzed the system as a two-gender system. The heritage speakers who reanalyzed the three-gender system as a two-gender system had a strong correlation with a slower speech rate. The correlation is straightforward—lower proficiency speakers have more difficulty accessing lexical items; thus, their speech is slowed down.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2008"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although speech rate has been shown to be an effective way of measuring proficiency of heritage speakers, some heritage speakers are reluctant to produce any heritage language whatsoever. Lexical proficiency is an alternative method that is also effective in measuring proficiency.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2000"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Polinsky|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study with heritage Russian speakers, there was a strong correlation between the speaker's knowledge of lexical items (measured using a basic word list of about 200) and the speaker's control over grammatical knowledge such as agreement, temporal marking, and embedding.&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2000"/&gt;

Some heritage speakers explicitly study the language to gain additional proficiency. The learning trajectories of heritage speakers are markedly different from the trajectories of second language learners with little or no previous exposure to a target language. For instance, heritage learners typically show a phonological advantage over second language learners in both perception and production of the heritage language, even when their exposure to the heritage language was interrupted very early in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Knightly|Jun|Oh|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Oh|Jun|Knightly|Au|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heritage speakers also tend to distinguish, rather than conflate, easily confusable sounds in the heritage language and the dominant language more reliably than second language learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Chang|Yao|Haynes|Rhodes|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In morphosyntax as well, heritage speakers have been found to be more native-like than second language learners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Au|Romo|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Au 2008"/&gt; although they are typically significantly different from native speakers.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2002"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Montrul|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polinsky 2008"/&gt;
Many linguists frame this change in heritage language acquisition as “incomplete acquisition” or "attrition."&lt;ref name="Montrul 2002"/&gt; "Incomplete acquisition," loosely defined by Montrul, is "the outcome of language acquisition that is not complete in childhood."&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; In this incomplete acquisition, there are particular properties of the language that were not able to reach age-appropriate levels of proficiency after the dominant language has been introduced. Attrition, as defined by Montrul, is the loss of a certain property of a language after one has already mastered it with native-speaker level accuracy.&lt;ref name="Montrul 2008"/&gt; These two cases of language loss have been used by Montrul and many other linguists to describe the change in heritage language acquisition. However, this is not the only viewpoint of linguists to describe heritage language acquisition. One argument against incomplete acquisition is that the input that heritage speakers receive is different from monolinguals (the input may be affected by cross-generational attrition, among other factors), thus the comparison of heritage speakers against monolinguals is weak.&lt;ref name="rothman1"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Pascual Y. Cabo|Rothman|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument by Pascual and Rothman claims that the acquisition of the heritage language is therefore not incomplete, but complete and simply different from monolingual acquisition of a language.&lt;ref name="rothman1"/&gt; Another argument argues for a shift in focus on the result of incomplete acquisition of a heritage language to the process of heritage language acquisition. In this argument, the crucial factor in changes to heritage language acquisition is the extent to which the heritage speaker activates and processes the heritage language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Putnam|Sánchez|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new model thus moves away from language acquisition that is dependent on the exposure to input of the language and moves towards dependence on the frequency of processing for production and comprehension of the heritage language.

Some colleges and universities offer courses prepared for speakers of heritage languages. For example, students who grow up learning some Spanish in the home may enroll in a course that will build on their Spanish abilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalog.uta.edu/coursedescriptions/span/ Heritage Spanish courses at a university]&lt;/ref&gt;

 | quote = Many people who live in the United States have cultural connections to and know languages other than English. These languages are not “foreign” to particular individuals or communities; instead, they are ''familiar'' in a variety of ways. Some people may be able to speak, read, and write the language; others may only speak or understand when spoken to. Some may not understand the language but are part of a family or community where the language is spoken. The term “heritage” language can be used to describe any of these connections between a non-dominant language and a person, a family, or a community.

'''Hyperthymic temperament''', or '''hyperthymia''', from Greek ''hyper'' ("over", meaning here ''excessive'') + [[Thumos|θυμός]] ("spirited"), is a proposed personality type characterized by an exceptionally positive mood and disposition. It is generally defined by increased energy, vividness and enthusiasm for life activities as opposed to dysthymia. Hyperthymia is similar to but more stable than [[hypomania]] with complete absence of irritability or negative mood effects.&lt;ref name="wiktionary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/hyperthymia|title=hyperthymia - Wiktionary|publisher=en.wiktionary.org|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Concise Guide to Mood Disorders|author1=Dubovsky, S.L.|author2=Dubovsky, A.N.|date=2008|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|isbn=9781585627653|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=qC2umbulUIwC|page=39|accessdate=2015-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characteristics of the hyperthymic temperament include:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/418724{{subscription needed}}{{clarify|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* increased energy and [[productivity]]
* short sleep patterns
* vividness, activity [[Extraversion and introversion|extroversion]]
* self-assurance, self-confidence
* strong will
* extreme talkativeness
* tendency to repeat oneself
* [[risk]]-taking/sensation seeking
* breaking [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]]
* very strong [[libido]]
* love of attention
* low threshold for [[boredom]]
* generosity and tendency to overspend
* emotion sensitivity
* cheerfulness and joviality
* unusual warmth
* expansiveness
* tirelessness
* irrepressibility, irresistible, and infectious quality

The clinical, psychiatric understanding of hyperthymia is evolving. Studies have shown that hyperthymic temperament promotes efficient performance of complex tasks under time pressure or extreme conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jaracz |first1=Marcin |last2=Paciorek |first2=Przemysław |last3=Buciński |first3=Adam |last4=Borkowska |first4=Alina |title=Affective temperament and executive functions in emergency medicine professionals |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=168 |issue= |pages=192–6 |year=2014 |pmid=25063957 |doi=10.1016/j.jad.2014.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this positive characterization, hyperthymia can be complicated with depressive episodes manifesting as a softer form of bipolar illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.medscape.org/viewarticle/439472_5|title=Beyond Antidepressants: Bipolar Spectrum Illness Presenting as Complicated or Refractory Mood Disorders in Primary Care|last=Manning|first=J.

The '''IKEA effect''' is a [[cognitive bias]] in which [[consumer]]s place a disproportionately high value on products they partially created. The name derives from the name of [[Sweden|Swedish]] manufacturer and furniture retailer [[IKEA]], which sells many furniture [[Ready-to-assemble furniture|products that require assembly]].

The IKEA effect has been described as follows: "The price is low for IKEA products largely because they take labor out of the equation. With a Phillips screwdriver, an [[Hex key|Allen wrench]] and rubber mallet, IKEA customers can very literally build an entire home's worth of furniture on a very tight budget. But what happens when they do?" They "fall in love with their IKEA creations. Even when there are parts missing and the items are incorrectly built, customers in the IKEA study still loved the fruits of their labors."&lt;ref name="Freeman XP"/&gt;

==History and background==

The IKEA effect was identified and named by [[Michael I. Norton]] of [[Harvard Business School]], Daniel Mochon of [[Yale]], and [[Dan Ariely]] of [[Duke University|Duke]], who published the results of three studies in 2011. They described the IKEA effect as "labor alone can be sufficient to induce greater liking for the fruits of one's labor: even constructing a standardized bureau, an arduous, solitary task, can lead people to overvalue their (often poorly constructed) creations."

Norton, Mochon, and Ariely cited other researchers' previous work on "effort justification" which had demonstrated that the more effort someone put into something, the more someone will value it. This phenomenon had been observed by [[Leon Festinger]] (1957) and in realms ranging from psychotherapy (Axsom &amp; Cooper, 1985) and brainwashing (Schein, 1956).&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norton|first1=Michael|last2=Mochon|first2=Daniel|last3=Ariely|first3=Dan|title=The IKEA effect: When labor leads to love|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|date=9 September 2011|volume=22|pages=453–460|url=http://www.people.hbs.edu/mnorton/norton%20mochon%20ariely.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jcps.2011.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product designers were familiar with the IKEA effect long before it was given a name.&lt;ref name="NeoAcademic"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landers|first1=Richard|title=Unfolding the IKEA Effect: Why We Love the Things We Build|url=http://neoacademic.com/2011/09/22/unfolding-the-ikea-effect-why-we-love-the-things-we-build/|website=NeoAcademic|publisher=NeoAcademic|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norton and his colleagues noted that, while not yet named or scientifically established, it had been recognized by marketers for a long time. For instance, when instant cake mixes were first marketed in the 1950s, many homemakers were resistant because the instant mixes made cooking "too easy", which made their labor and skill feel "undervalued." Because homemakers didn't feel "invested" in the baking process, they put no value on the product. In response to this problem, the producers of the cake mixes made a simple change in the recipe: homemakers were required to add an egg. By adding one more step – cracking an egg – homemakers felt like they were actually baking, which resulted in increased instant cake mix sales.&lt;ref name="Freeman XP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Your Ideas Really That Good? Beware the IKEA Effect|url=http://freemanxp.com/insights/blog/are-your-ideas-really-that-good-beware-the-ikea-effect/|website=Freeman XP|publisher=Freeman XP|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton and his fellow researchers also cited the [[Build-a-Bear]] product, which allows people to make their own [[teddy bear]]s. Many consumers enjoy this option, even though they are charged a high price for a product for which, thanks to their labor, the manufacturer does not have to pay production costs. In addition, the researchers pointed out the popularity of "haycations," whereby city people pay to do farmers' work for them. In all these cases, the researchers posit, people seem more willing to pay for an item into which they have put a degree of their own labor.

The researchers pointed out that as a result of earlier consumer psychology studies that essentially pointed to the existence of the IKEA effect, many firms transitioned from viewing consumers as "recipients of value" to instead "co-creators of value." One element of this shift was the involvement of consumers in product design, marketing, and testing.

A 1959 study by Aronson and Mills that has been described as a "classic" produced results that seem to reflect either the IKEA effect or a closely related phenomenon. Female participants were required to undergo "no initiation, a mild initiation, or severe initiation" before entering a discussion group. The women's later appraisal of the group's value was proportional to the effort that had been demanded of them before being allowed into the group.

Citing other researchers' work demonstrating "a fundamental human need for effectance – an ability to successfully produce desired outcomes in one's environment," Norton et al. argued that "one means by which people accomplish this goal is by affecting and controlling objects and possessions." They placed special emphasis on Bandura's "seminal" 1977 study showing that "successful completion of tasks" was a "crucial means by which people can meet their goal to feel competent and in control."&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

==Experiments by Norton et al.==

Norton and his colleagues conducted research to find out if consumers would pay a higher prices for products that required self-assembly.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Jillian [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/26/ikea-effect-consumers-study_n_981918.html], "The IKEA Effect: Study Finds Consumers Over-Value Products They Build Themselves", September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The research consisted of three different experiments in which the participants built [[Lego]] items, folded [[origami]] figures and assembled [[IKEA]] boxes.

In the first experiment, the subjects were given the task of assembling IKEA furniture. Researchers then priced the items the experimenters had assembled as well as pre-assembled IKEA furniture. The results showed that the subjects were willing to pay 63% more for the former than for the latter.

In the second experiment, researchers asked subjects to make either [[origami]] frogs or cranes. They then asked the subjects how much they were willing to pay for their own work. Following this, researchers gathered another group of subjects who had not taken part in the origami creation. The new subjects were asked how much they were willing to pay for an origami built by the participants.

Following this, the researcher asked how much they were willing to pay for an origami built by an expert. They were willing to pay more for the latter. The first test group were given a display of origami. It consisted of one set of origami they had built themselves and one set that had been built by experts. Without knowing that their own origami was part of the display as well, these subjects were asked to bid on the different origami. They perceived the origami they had created as being of equal quality to those created by professionals.

The third and final experiment involved two sets of subjects. The first set were told to completely assemble a piece of IKEA furniture. The second set were also instructed to assemble a piece of IKEA furniture, but only partially. Both groups then took part in bidding over these objects. Results showed that individuals who had built the box completely were willing to pay more than the individuals who had only partially built an item.&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

== Conclusions by Norton et al. ==
The experiments by Norton and his colleagues demonstrated that self-assembly affects the evaluation of a product by its consumers. The results suggest that when people construct a particular product themselves, even if they do a poor job of it, they value the end result more than if they had not put any effort into its creation.&lt;ref name="Beyond Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dibeehi |first1=Qaalfa |title=Ever Heard of the IKEA Effect? Increasing perceived value while reducing costs |url=http://www.beyondphilosophy.com/blogs/ever-heard-of-the-IKEA-effect?-increasing-perceived-value-while-reducing-costs |website=Beyond Philosophy |publisher=Beyond Philosophy |accessdate=21 March 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315234421/http://www.beyondphilosophy.com/blogs/ever-heard-of-the-IKEA-effect?-increasing-perceived-value-while-reducing-costs |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants, wrote Norton and his colleagues, "saw their amateurish creations as similar in value to experts' creations, and expected others to share their opinions." To be sure, "labor leads to love only when labor results in successful completion of tasks; when participants built and then destroyed their creations, or failed to complete them, the IKEA effect dissipated." The researchers also concluded "that labor increases valuation for both 'do-it-yourselfers' and novices."

The researchers noted that their use of "simple IKEA boxes and Lego sets that did not permit customization" did not prevent participants from manifesting the IKEA effect.&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

==Later research==
Gibbs and Drolet (2003) showed that raising consumers' energy levels can persuade them to select experiences that involve greater effort. But companies have been warned not to challenge consumers too much, lest they be unable to complete a task and thus end up dissatisfied.

Research by Dahl and Moreau (2007) suggests that customers are more satisfied when there is a limit to the amount of creativity they can express in assembling a product.&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

==Causes of IKEA effect==
One factor is that "self-assembly of products may allow people to both feel competent and display evidence of that competence." Also, the idea that they are "saving money by buying products that require some assembly" may make them feel like "smart shoppers."&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

Other possible explanations for the IKEA effect have been suggested, such as "a focus on the product's positive attributes, and the relationship between effort and liking." The IKEA effect is one of several cognitive biases seem to reflect a causative link between perceived effort and valuation.&lt;ref name="Behavioral Economics"&gt;{{cite web|title=IKEA effect|url=https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/ikea-effect/|website=Behavioral Economics|publisher=Behavioral Economics|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work by Norton et al. demonstrated that participants' valuing of products was not caused by ownership of them or by "greater time spent touching them."&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

==Examples of IKEA effect==
The IKEA effect is thought to contribute to the [[sunk costs]] effect, which occurs when managers continue to devote resources to sometimes failing projects they have invested their labor in. The effect is also related to the "[[not invented here]]" syndrome, where managers disregard good ideas developed elsewhere, in favor of (possibly inferior) internally developed ideas.&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

Writer Tyler Tervooren realized that he was witnessing an example of the IKEA effect when he toured a house that was for sale at a price that was "at least $30,000 too much" and discovered that the reason why the owner overvalued the house so dramatically was that she had "had the home built herself and customized every aspect of it to her taste." But while she regarded the house as "a masterpiece," Tervooren "saw a house like any other but with paint colors I'd never choose." Tervooren realized that he, too, had fallen victim to the IKEA effect on various occasions: "I had a special bond with my old car because I always worked on it myself. And when my iPhone broke down last year, I pulled it apart and learned to fix it so I could keep using it."&lt;ref name="Riskology"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tervooren|first1=Tyler|title=Ikea Effect: The Science Of Labor, Love, And DIY Furniture|url=https://www.riskology.co/ikea-effect/|website=Riskology|publisher=Riskology|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IKEA effect may be said to manifest itself in situations when programmers have been invited to help (without payment) in creating [[open-source program]]s and [[operating system]]s, such as [[Linux]].&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

===Animals===
The IKEA effect has also been observed in animals, such as [[rats]] and [[starlings]], which prefer to obtain food from sources that required effort on their part (Kacelnik &amp; Marsh, 2002; Lawrence &amp; Festinger, 1962).&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt;

===Business===
Tervooren has advised business owners that they "can reap massive rewards by putting the Ikea Effect to work for your customers. Whenever you can, let them customize the products and services you offer to fit their needs. Make them feel like their own creativity and effort went into getting what they need from you. They'll pay more for it."&lt;ref name="Riskology"/&gt;

A ''[[Forbes]]'' 2012 article counseled marketers that "if your customers put your product together, they'll like it more" but added that "an assembly process that is clear and free of frustration is essential."&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dooley|first1=Roger|title=Build Product Love with the IKEA Effect|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2012/07/03/ikea-effect/#781f322f4b36|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=Forbes|date=July 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Computer application|Computer app]] designers have been advised to take advantage of the IKEA effect by providing "sample data, pre-filled defaults, and editable templates to help make your app feel animated with content and connections, and alive to users. Then use email triggers, prompts, and guidance to get people to interact with that content — even if it's just to move a card around on a board or reply to an email. This helps to lower the fear and frustration of dealing with a new product while increasing capabilities." The manufacturers of such computer products as [[Wistia]], [[Basecamp (software)|Basecamp]], and [[iDoneThis]] have been guided by the IKEA effect in introducing them to the public.&lt;ref name="Customer.io"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Choi|first1=Janet|title=How to Activate New Customers With the IKEA Effect|url=https://customer.io/blog/Ikea-effect-onboarding.html|website=Customer.io|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers===

Consumer writers have warned customers against the IKEA effect, noting that it "can prove detrimental when you create or conceive ideas or products that may in fact not be that good."&lt;ref name="Freeman XP"/&gt; On the other hand, a 2012 article in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' suggested that "if you're having a hard time deciding between buying something pre-built or putting it together yourself, the extra work that might not seem worth it now might very well put a smile on your face when it's all done. Saving yourself the labor could just cost you some happiness."&lt;ref name="Psychology Today"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Travis|title=The IKEA Effect: Why We Cherish Things We Build|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/make-your-mind/201209/the-ikea-effect-why-we-cherish-things-we-build|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Psychology Today|accessdate=21 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norton and his colleagues warned that the IKEA effect could lead people to overvalue their own belongings when offering them for sale. For example, "people may see the improvements they have made to their homes—such as the brick walkways they laid by hand—as increasing the value of the house far more than buyers, who see only a shoddily-built walkway."&lt;ref name="Journal of Consumer Psychology"/&gt; And Mochon has told an interviewer that if customers "ever found out that Ikea was making them feel dumb just to sell more tables, I'm not sure what the backlash would be against Ikea."&lt;ref name="NPR"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vedantam|first1=Shankar|title=Why You Love That Ikea Table, Even If It's Crooked|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/06/171177695/why-you-love-that-ikea-table-even-if-its-crooked|accessdate=21 March 2017|publisher=NPR|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Information visualization''' or '''information visualisation''' is the study of (interactive) visual representations of abstract data to reinforce human cognition. The abstract data include both numerical and non-numerical data, such as text and geographic information. However, information visualization differs from [[scientific visualization]]: "it’s infovis [information visualization] when the spatial representation is chosen, and it’s scivis [scientific visualization] when the spatial representation is given".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/imager/tr/2008/pitfalls/|title=Process and Pitfalls in Writing Information Visualization Research Papers|author=[[Tamara Munzner]]|date=|website=www.cs.ubc.ca|accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|240px|Partial map of the Internet early 2005, each line represents two [[IP addresses]], and some delay between those two nodes.]]

The field of information visualization has emerged "from research in [[human-computer interaction]], [[computer science]], [[graphics]], [[visual design]], [[psychology]], and [[business methods]]. It is increasingly applied as a critical component in scientific research, [[digital libraries]], [[data mining]], financial data analysis, market studies, manufacturing [[production control]], and [[drug discovery]]".&lt;ref name = "BBB03"&gt;Benjamin B. Bederson and [[Ben Shneiderman]] (2003). [http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/pubs/books/craft.shtml ''The Craft of Information Visualization: Readings and Reflections''], Morgan Kaufmann {{ISBN|1-55860-915-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information visualization presumes that "visual representations and interaction techniques take advantage of the human eye’s broad bandwidth pathway into the mind to allow users to see, explore, and understand large amounts of information at once. Information visualization focused on the creation of approaches for conveying abstract information in intuitive ways."&lt;ref&gt;James J. Thomas and Kristin A. Cook (Ed.) (2005). [http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm ''Illuminating the Path: The R&amp;D Agenda for Visual Analytics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929155753/http://nvac.pnl.gov/agenda.stm |date=2008-09-29 }}. National Visualization and Analytics Center. p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Data analysis is an indispensable part of all applied research and problem solving in industry. The most fundamental data analysis approaches are visualization (histograms, scatter plots, surface plots, tree maps, parallel coordinate plots, etc.), [[statistics]] ([[hypothesis test]], [[regression analysis|regression]], [[Principal component analysis|PCA]], etc.), [[data mining]] ([[Association rule learning|association mining]], etc.), and [[machine learning]] methods ([[cluster analysis|clustering]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[decision trees]], etc.). Among these approaches,  information visualization, or visual data analysis, is the most reliant on the cognitive skills of human analysts, and allows the discovery of unstructured actionable insights that are limited only by human imagination and creativity. The analyst does not have to learn any sophisticated methods to be able to interpret the visualizations of the data. Information visualization is also a hypothesis generation scheme, which can be, and is typically followed by more analytical or formal analysis, such as statistical hypothesis testing.

== History ==
The modern study of visualization started with [[computer graphics]], which "has from its beginning been used to study scientific problems. However, in its early days the lack of graphics power often limited its usefulness. The recent emphasis on visualization started in 1987 with the special issue of Computer Graphics on Visualization in ''[[Scientific Computing (magazine)|Scientific Computing]]''. Since then there have been several conferences and workshops, co-sponsored by the [[IEEE Computer Society]] and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]]".&lt;ref&gt;G. Scott Owen (1999). [http://www.siggraph.org/education/materials/HyperVis/visgoals/visgoal3.htm History of Visualization]. Accessed Jan 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They have been devoted to the general topics of [[data visualisation]], information visualization and [[scientific visualisation]], and more specific areas such as [[volume visualization]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14603">'''Instrumental convergence''' is the hypothetical tendency for most sufficiently [[intelligent agent]]s to pursue certain instrumental goals such as [[self-preservation]] and [[resource]] acquisition.

Instrumental convergence suggests that an intelligent agent with apparently harmless goals can act in surprisingly harmful ways. For example, a computer with the sole goal of solving the [[Riemann hypothesis]] could attempt to turn the entire Earth into [[computronium]] in an effort to increase its computing power so that it can succeed in its calculations.&lt;ref name=aama/&gt;

Proposed '''basic AI drives''' include utility function or goal-content integrity, self-protection, freedom from interference, [[self-improvement]], and non-satiable acquisition of additional resources.

==Instrumental and final goals==

{{See also|Instrumental value}}

Final goals, or final values, are intrinsically valuable to an intelligent agent, whether an [[artificial intelligence]] or a human being, as an [[ends-in-themselves|end in itself]]. In contrast, instrumental goals, or instrumental values, are only valuable to an agent as a means toward accomplishing its final goals. The contents and tradeoffs of a completely rational agent's "final goal" system can be formalized into a [[utility function]].

==Hypothetical examples of convergence==

One hypothetical example of instrumental convergence is provided by the [[Riemann Hypothesis]] catastrophe. [[Marvin Minsky]], the co-founder of [[MIT]]'s AI laboratory, has suggested that an artificial intelligence designed to solve the Riemann hypothesis might decide to take over all of Earth's resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal.&lt;ref name=aama&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart J.|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0137903952|chapter=Section 26.3: The Ethics and Risks of Developing Artificial Intelligence|quote="Similarly, Marvin Minsky once suggested that an AI program designed to solve the Riemann Hypothesis might end up taking over all the resources of Earth to build more powerful supercomputers to help achieve its goal."}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the computer had instead been programmed to produce as many paper clips as possible, it would still decide to take all of Earth's resources to meet its final goal.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, Chapter 8, p. 123. "An AI, designed to manage production in a factory, is given the final goal of maximizing the manufacturing of paperclips, and proceeds by converting first the Earth and then increasingly large chunks of the observable universe into paperclips."&lt;/ref&gt; Even though these two final goals are different, both of them produce a ''convergent'' instrumental goal of taking over Earth's resources.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7" /&gt;

===Paperclip maximizer===
The paperclip maximizer is a [[thought experiment]] described by Swedish philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] in 2003. It illustrates the [[existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|existential risk]] that an [[artificial general intelligence]] may pose to human beings when programmed to pursue even seemingly-harmless goals, and the necessity of incorporating [[machine ethics]] into [[artificial intelligence]] design. The scenario describes an advanced artificial intelligence tasked with manufacturing paperclips. If such a machine were not programmed to value human life, then given enough power its optimized goal would be to turn all matter in the universe, including human beings, into either paperclips or machines which manufacture paperclips.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html|title = Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence|date = 2003|access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = Bostrom|first = Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text = Suppose we have an AI whose only goal is to make as many paper clips as possible. The AI will realize quickly that it would be much better if there were no humans because humans might decide to switch it off. Because if humans do so, there would be fewer paper clips. Also, human bodies contain a lot of atoms that could be made into paper clips. The future that the AI would be trying to gear towards would be one in which there were a lot of paper clips but no humans.|sign = |source = [[Nick Bostrom]], as quoted in {{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/22/artificial-intelligence-oxford_n_5689858.html|title=Artificial Intelligence May Doom The Human Race Within A Century, Oxford Professor Says}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Bostrom has emphasised that he does not believe the paperclip maximiser scenario ''per se'' will actually occur; rather, his intention is to illustrate the dangers of creating [[Superintelligence|superintelligent]] machines without knowing how to safely program them to eliminate existential risk to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Are We Smart Enough to Control Artificial Intelligence?|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/review/534871/our-fear-of-artificial-intelligence/|website = MIT Technology Review|access-date = 25 January 2016|date = 11 February 2015|last = Ford|first = Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paperclip maximizer example illustrates the broad problem of managing powerful systems that lack human values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friend|first1=Tad|title=Sam Altman’s Manifest Destiny|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=The New Yorker|date=3 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic AI drives==

[[Steve Omohundro]] has itemized several convergent instrumental goals, including [[self-preservation]] or self-protection, utility function or goal-content integrity, self-improvement, and resource acquisition. He refers to these as the "basic AI drives". A "drive" here denotes a "tendency which will be present unless specifically counteracted";&lt;ref&gt;Omohundro, S. M. (2008, February). The basic AI drives. In AGI (Vol. 171, pp. 483-492).&lt;/ref&gt; this is different from the psychological term "[[drive theory|drive]]", denoting an excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). Drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203.&lt;/ref&gt; A tendency for a person to fill out income tax forms every year is a "drive" in Omohundro's sense, but not in the psychological sense.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, footnote 8 to chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Dewey of the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] argues that even an initially introverted self-rewarding AGI may continue to acquire free energy, space, time, and freedom from interference to ensure that it will not be stopped from self-rewarding.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, Daniel. "Learning what to value." Artificial General Intelligence (2011): 309-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goal-content integrity===

In humans, maintenance of final goals can be explained with a thought experiment. Suppose a man named "Gandhi" has a pill that, if he took it, would cause him to want to kill people. This Gandhi is currently a pacifist: one of his explicit final goals is to never kill anyone. Gandhi is likely to refuse to take the pill, because Gandhi knows that if in the future he wants to kill people, he is likely to actually kill people, and thus the goal of "not killing people" would not be satisfied.&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Complex value systems in friendly AI." In Artificial general intelligence, pp. 388-393. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other cases, people seem happy to let their final values drift. Humans are complicated, and their goals can be inconsistent or unknown, even to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7, p. 110. "We humans often seem happy to let our final values drift... For example, somebody deciding to have a child might predict that they will come to value the child for its own sake, even though at the time of the decision they may not particularly value their future child... Humans are complicated, and many factors might be in play in a situation like this... one might have a final value that involves having certain experiences and occupying a certain social role; and become a parent&amp;mdash; and undergoing the attendant goal shift&amp;mdash; might be a necessary aspect of that..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====In artificial intelligence====

In 2009, [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] concluded, in a setting where agents search for proofs about possible self-modifications, "that any rewrites of the utility function can happen only if the Gödel machine first can prove that the rewrite is useful according to the present utility function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s12559-009-9014-y| title = Ultimate Cognition à la Gödel| journal = Cognitive Computation| volume = 1| issue = 2| pages = 177| year = 2009| last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hibbard&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2478/v10229-011-0013-5| title = Model-based Utility Functions| journal = Journal of Artificial General Intelligence| volume = 3| pages = 1| year = 2012| last1 = Hibbard | first1 = B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by [[Bill Hibbard]] of a different scenario is similarly consistent with maintenance of goal content integrity.&lt;ref name=hibbard /&gt; Hibbard also argues that in a utility maximizing framework the only goal is maximizing expected utility, so that instrumental goals should be called unintended instrumental actions.&lt;ref&gt;Hibbard, Bill (2014): Ethical Artificial Intelligence. https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1373&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource acquisition===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] resource acquisition, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing&gt;Benson-Tilsen, T., &amp; Soares, N. (2016, March). Formalizing Convergent Instrumental Goals. In AAAI Workshop: AI, Ethics, and Society.&lt;/ref&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

For almost any open-ended, non-trivial reward function (or set of goals), possessing more resources (such as equipment, raw materials, or energy) can enable the AI to find a more "optimal" solution. Resources can benefit some AIs directly, through being able to create more of whatever stuff its reward function values: "The AI neither hates you, nor loves you, but you are made out of atoms that it can use for something else."&lt;ref&gt;Yudkowsky, Eliezer. "Artificial intelligence as a positive and negative factor in global risk." Global catastrophic risks (2008): 303. p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5"&gt;[[Murray Shanahan]]. ''The Technological Singularity''. MIT Press, 2015. Chapter 7, Section 5: "Safe Superintelligence".&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, almost all AIs can benefit from having more resources to spend on other instrumental goals, such as self-preservation.&lt;ref name="shanahan 7.5" /&gt;

===Cognitive enhancement===

"If the agent's final goals are fairly unbounded and the agent is in a position to become the first superintelligence and thereby obtain a decisive strategic advantage, [...] according to its preferences. At least in this special case, a rational intelligent agent would place a very *high instrumental value on cognitive enhancement*" &lt;ref name=super&gt;Bostrom, N. (2016). Superintelligence, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=September 2018}}

===Technological perfection===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] technological advancement, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

===Self-preservation===

Many instrumental goals, such as [...] self-preservation, are valuable to an agent because they increase its ''freedom of action''.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

==Instrumental convergence thesis==

The instrumental convergence thesis, as outlined by philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent's goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The instrumental convergence thesis applies only to instrumental goals; intelligent agents may have a wide variety of possible final goals.&lt;ref name="bostrom chapter 7"&gt;Bostrom 2014, chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

Agents can acquire resources by trade or by conquest. A rational agent will, by definition, choose whatever option will maximize its implicit utility function; therefore a rational agent will trade for a subset of another agent's resources only if outright seizing the resources is too risky or costly (compared with the gains from taking all the resources), or if some other element in its utility function bars it from the seizure. In the case of a powerful, self-interested, rational superintelligence interacting with a lesser intelligence, peaceful trade (rather than unilateral seizure) seems unnecessary and suboptimal, and therefore unlikely.&lt;ref name=formalizing/&gt;{{fcn|date=September 2018}}

Some observers, such as Skype's [[Jaan Tallinn]] and physicist [[Max Tegmark]], believe that "basic AI drives", and other [[unintended consequences]] of superintelligent AI programmed by well-meaning programmers, could pose a significant threat to [[human survival]], especially if an "intelligence explosion" abruptly occurs due to [[recursive]] self-improvement. Since nobody knows how to predict beforehand when [[superintelligence]] will arrive, such observers call for research into [[friendly artificial intelligence]] as a possible way to mitigate [[existential risk from artificial general intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Artificial Intelligence a Threat?|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Is-Artificial-Intelligence-a/148763|accessdate=25 November 2017|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3663">'''Intellectual virtues''' are qualities of mind and character that promote intellectual flourishing, critical thinking, and the pursuit of truth. They include: intellectual responsibility, [[wikt:perseverance|perseverance]], open-mindedness, [[empathy]], [[integrity]], [[intellectual courage]], confidence in reason, love of truth, intellectual humility, imaginativeness, curiosity, fair-mindedness, and [[autonomy]]. So-called virtue responsibilists conceive of intellectual virtues primarily as acquired character traits, such as intellectual conscientiousness and love of knowledge. Virtue reliabilists, by contrast, think of intellectual virtues more in terms of well-functioning mental faculties such as perception, memory, and intuition. Intellectual virtues are studied extensively in both [[critical thinking]] and [[virtue epistemology]].

== Aristotle ==
[[Aristotle]] analyzed [[virtue]]s into '''moral''' and '''intellectual virtues'''. In the ''[[Posterior Analytics]]'' and ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' he identified five intellectual virtues as the five ways the soul arrives at truth by affirmation or denial. These are then separated into three classes:
*'''Theoretical'''
**''[[Sophia (wisdom)|Sophia]]'' – wisdom (rational intuition and scientific knowledge directed toward the highest and most valuable objects)
**''[[Episteme#Plato_and_Aristotle|Episteme]]'' – scientific knowledge of objects that are necessary and unchanging
**''[[Nous#Aristotle|Nous]]'' – rational intuition of first principles or self-evident truths
*'''Practical'''
**''[[Phronesis]]'' – practical wisdom/prudence
*'''Productive'''
**''[[Techne]]'' – craft knowledge, art, skill

Subjacent intellectual virtues in Aristotle:
*''[[Euboulia]]'' – deliberating well, deliberative excellence; thinking properly about the right end.
* ''[[Sunesis]]'' – understanding, sagacity, astuteness, consciousness of why something is as it is. For example, the understanding you have of why a situation is as it is, prior to having ''phronesis''.
*''[[Gnomê]]'' – judgement and consideration; allowing us to make equitable or fair decisions.
*''[[Deinotes]]'' – cleverness; the ability to carry out actions so as to achieve a goal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20790">'''International Year of Volunteers''' was designated for 2001 by the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. The initiative aimed at increased recognition, facilitation, networking and promotion of [[volunteering]], to highlight the achievements of the millions of volunteers worldwide who devote their time to serving others, and to encourage more people globally to engage in volunteering.

== Origins and goals ==

The concept for a [[United Nations]] year to recognize volunteerism first emerged within the UN system at a 1996 policy forum in [[Japan]] by UNV and [[United Nations University]] (UNU). A February 1997 proposal of the Government of Japan was transmitted through the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] be placed on the agenda of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) in July 1997. ECOSOC, in its resolution 1977/44 of 22 July 1997, recommended to the UN General Assembly that it adopt the resolution proclaiming 2001 the International Year of Volunteers. The UN General Assembly, in its 52nd session on 20 November 1997 in Resolution 52/17,&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of 2001 as International Year of Volunteers" published by [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/resources/un-resolutions/doc/declaration-of-2001-as.html UNV] on November 20, 1997, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; co-sponsored by 123 countries, passed the ECOSOC resolution, thereby proclaiming 2001 as the International Year of Volunteers. The [[United Nations Volunteers|United Nations Volunteers programme]] (UNV), part of the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), was designated in the resolution as the international focal point.&lt;ref&gt;"What is the International Year of Volunteers 2001?" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20001021024611/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/whatis/whatis.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 21, 2000, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"IYV 2001: A chronology" published at [http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html unv.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161006175744/http://www.unv.org/en/news-resources/archive/unv-news/unv-news-december-2001/doc/iyv-2001-a-chronology.html |date=2016-10-06 }}, by UN Volunteers, accessed August 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectives of IYV were:
* increased recognition of volunteers and their contributions

[[Charles, Prince of Wales]] unveiled the design of a 10-cent Canadian circulation coin commemorating IYV in April 2001. The coin went into circulation later that year. It was produced by [[Royal Canadian Mint]] and adapted from a photo provided by the [[March of Dimes]].&lt;ref&gt;"Prince Charles unveils the new circulation 10-cent circulation coin honouring volunteers" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011112011026/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_04_26CAN_coin.htm www.iyv2001.org], version November 12, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a press release by UNV in October 2001, lawmakers in [[France]], Germany, Spain and the UK passed pro-volunteer legislation in 2001, and new laws were proposed in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Madagascar, Mozambique, Nepal, Senegal and Tanzania. Also for the year, UNV and the [[Independent Sector]] released "Measuring Volunteering: A Practical Toolkit," a survey guide to measure the economic contribution of volunteering. The press release says the toolkit was adapted for use in [[Botswana]], [[China]], Lao PDR, [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Mongolia]], and that research on volunteering had begun in [[Cambodia]], [[Madagascar]], [[Namibia]], [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;"UN Volunteer Year gains ground in fourth quarter" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020319124831/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_10_11DEU_4thQuarter_un.htm www.iyv2001.org], version March 19, 2002, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Solicited by UNV, musicians from around the world donated and wrote songs about volunteerism, submitting them to UNV for possible inclusion on the IYV2001 website and in a CD. Chosen songs were offered via the website to download for free. UNV also offered a CD with 27 songs in nine languages, by musicians from 18 countries, in celebration of IYV.  The CD featured Jamaican reggae star [[Tony Rebel]], who donated the song, "Not all about money", and Portugal's [[Paulo de Carvalho]], who donated the song "Vai e faz" (Go and Do). Most of the songs praised the virtues of volunteers, but the last song, by Dave Greenfield of Canada, was meant to provoke political debate and question social issues about volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;"Songs celebrating volunteerism" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20020603162258/http://www.iyv2001.org/iyv_eng/world/creativity/songs/index.htm www.iyv2001.org], version June 3, 2002, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Colors of [[Benetton Group|Benetton]]'s communication campaign for autumn 2001 was produced in collaboration with UNV and honored IYV. Instead of professional models, the campaign featured photos of volunteers, such as a tattooed former member of a street gang who volunteered in anti-violence activities, a young lawyer volunteering to promote and defend human rights, a trans-gendered person who volunteered to distribute condoms amongst prostitutes, and an elderly tap dancer who entertained residents in homes for the elderly. The campaign was promoted throughout Europe, the United States, South America and parts of Asia, in newspapers, magazines, and billboards. A special issue of Benetton's magazine ''Colors'' was published for the campaign in November 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Benetton launches new campaign in collaboration with UN Volunteers for the International Year of Volunteers" published at [https://web.archive.org/web/20011006000551/http://www.iyv2001.org/infobase/press/01_09_25DEU_benetton_un.htm www.iyv2001.org], version October 6, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VOLUNTEERS [http://www.colorsmagazine.com/magazine/46 Colors] Issue #46, published November 2001, accessed August 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The final event for the year by UNV, the International Symposium on Volunteering, was 18–21 November 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland. The event was attended by representatives from most of the IYV national committees, and provided workshops to discuss the outcomes of IYV 2001.&lt;ref&gt;"Final Report" published at [http://www.icvolunteers.org/icv/files/isv2001_report_final.pdf icvolunteers.org], version April 2002, accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Then [[Pope John Paul II]] issued a statement on December 5, 2001, noting, "At the end of the year, that the United Nations dedicated to Volunteer work, I wish to express my heartfelt appreciation for your constant dedication, in every part of the world, in going to meet those who live in poverty. Whether you work individually or gathered together in special associations, you represent for children, the elderly, the sick, people in difficulty, refugees and the persecuted a ray of hope that pierces the darkness of solitude and encourages them to overcome the temptations of violence and egotism."&lt;ref&gt;"MESSAGE OF JOHN PAUL II

The General Assembly marked the closing of IYV on December 5, 2001 by adopting a resolution on recommendations for volunteer action, commending the ongoing contributions of all volunteers to society, and encouraging all people to become more engaged in voluntary activities. The assembly also decided that two plenary meetings at its fifty-seventh session on 5 December 2002 should be devoted to the outcome of the IYV and its follow-up.  Specific recommendations on ways governments and the UN system could support volunteering were contained in an annex to the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;"marking End of International Year of Volunteers, General Assembly Encourages All People to Become More Engaged in Voluntary Activities" published at [https://www.un.org/press/en/2001/GA9990.doc.htm United Nations], December 5, 2001, archived at [[Internet Archive]], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide volunteer activities of the Vienna based NGO community were presented at the Vienna International Centre on 11 December 2001 to mark IYV 2001 and the [[International Day of Human Rights]], jointly organized by the [[United Nations Information Service Vienna]] (UNIS) and CONGO (Conference of NGOs in consultative relationship with the UN).&lt;ref&gt;"

== European Year of Volunteering ==

The European Year of Volunteering (EYV) was in 2011, launched by the [[European Commission]] to celebrate the volunteerism efforts of Europeans and chosen to correspond with the 10th anniversary of  IYV. It was originally an initiative of the EYV 2011 Alliance, an informal gathering of volunteer networks, such as [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]], the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] and [[European Youth Forum]]. The web site address was ''www.europa.eu/volunteering'', and the site is now archived on the European Commission website.&lt;ref&gt;"European Year of Volunteering" [http://www.unric.org/en/volunteering/27163-european-year-of-volunteering United Nations Regional Information Centre for Western Europe], interview with John Macdonald, Head of Task Force for the European Year of Volunteering 2011, from the European Commission Directorate-General, accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Year of Volunteering 2011 [http://ec.europa.eu/citizenship/european-year-of-volunteering/index_en.htm European Commission, EU Citizenship Portal], accessed August 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== International Year of Volunteers Plus 10 ==

In 2011, ten years after IYV, under [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] Resolution 63/153 (2008)&lt;ref&gt;"General Assembly Resolution 63/153" published at [http://www.undemocracy.com/A-RES-63-153.pdf www.undemocracy.com], accessed August 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Nations]] IYV+10 was recognized and promoted by UNV to renew the goals of the original IYV and to encourage people’s contributions to peace and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] through volunteering. National and international UN Volunteers, as well as [[virtual volunteering|online volunteers]], were recruited to support work on IYV+10, strengthen links with stakeholders and partners at the national level, and monitor initiatives developed during the Year. Activities were promoted via the UNV web site www.worldvolunteerweb.org. During the first half of 2011, a series of five regional consultation meetings were organized in [[Ecuador]] (28–20 March), [[Turkey]] (18–19 April), [[the Philippines]] (3–4 May), and [[Senegal]] (30–31 May for [[Francophone Africa]] and 6–7 June for Anglophone Africa). These events brought together hundreds of stakeholders from civil society, the private sector, national authorities and academia, UNV Field Units and other United Nations entities. A global conference on ‘Volunteering for a sustainable future’ was held 15–17 September in [[Budapest]] in partnership with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)]] and the [http://www.iave.org/ International Association for Volunteer Effort (IAVE)]. The conference brought together UN member states and volunteer-involving organizations, plus partners from academia and the private sector. The 64th Annual UN [https://www.un.org/wcm/content/site/ngoconference DPI/NGO Conference] was held from 3–5 September hosted by the [[German government]] and the [[Bonn|city of Bonn]]. The event theme was ‘Sustainable Societies, Responsive Citizens’.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6260">'''Kathēkon''' ({{lang-el|καθῆκον}}) (plural: ''kathēkonta'' {{lang-el|καθήκοντα}}) is a [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] concept, forged by the founder of [[Stoicism]], [[Zeno of Citium]]. It may be translated as "appropriate behaviour", "befitting actions", or "convenient action for nature",&lt;ref name=Poliseno&gt;[http://www.novaroma.org/expert/poliseno2.htm Nova Roma], interview of A. Poliseno, "Stoicism in Ancient Rome",&lt;/ref&gt; or also "proper function".&lt;ref&gt;[http://pressurecooker.phil.cmu.edu/80-130/Packet/80-130-Packet-Part-I-Section-2.doc Section 2: Hellenistic and Roman Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070729001344/http://pressurecooker.phil.cmu.edu/80-130/Packet/80-130-Packet-Part-I-Section-2.doc |date=2007-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kathekon'' has been translated in Latin by [[Cicero]] as ''[[Officium (Ancient Rome)|officium]]'', and by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] as ''convenentia''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709375 Two Concepts of Morality: A Distinction of Adam Smith's Ethics and its Stoic Origin], extract on [[Jstor]]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kathēkonta'' are contrasted, in [[Stoic moral]], with ''[[katorthōma]]'' (κατόρθωμα; plural: ''katorthōmata''), roughly "perfect action". According to Stoic philosophy, man (and all living beings) must act in accordance with Nature, which is the primary sense of ''kathēkon''.

== Kathēkonta and katorthōmata ==

According to Stoic philosophy, each being, whether animate or inanimate (plant, animal or human being), carries on fitting actions corresponding to its own nature. They distinguished between "kathēkonta" and "katorthōmata," a perfect action derived from the "orthos [[logos]]" (reason) (also "''teleion kathēkon''": a perfect, achieved ''kathēkon''&lt;ref&gt;[[Stobaeus]], in Long, A. A., Sedley, D. N. (1987). ''The Hellenistic Philosophers: vol. 1. translations of the principal sources with philosophical commentary'', 59B. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press (SVF III, 494)&lt;/ref&gt;). They said that the wise man necessarily carried out ''katorthōmata'', that is, virtuous ''kathēkon'', and that what distinguished both was not the nature of the act, but the way it was done. Thus, in exceptional circumstances, a wise man (which state of being, in Stoic philosophy, is nearly impossible to achieve) could carry out a katorthōma which, according to ordinary standards, would be deemed monstruous (for example, having sexual intercourse with one's daughter, if the destiny of humanity is at stake, or mutilating oneself&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]'', VII, 108-109 (SVF III, 495, 496; transl. in Long, A. A., Sedley, D. N. (1987), 59E)&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[Stoic morality]] is complex, and has various hierarchical levels. On the first, lay-man level, one must carry out the action corresponding to his own nature. But, according to the Stoic strict moral ideas, the acts of laymen are always insane (ἁμαρτήματα ''hamartēmata'' &lt;ref name="Poliseno" /&gt; "mistakes," or ''peccata''), while the acts of the rare wise-man are always ''katorthōmata'', perfect actions. The wise man acts in view of the good, while the ordinary being (layman, animal or plant) acts only in view of its survival. However, both act according to their own nature.

== Indifferent things ==

Stoic philosophers distinguished another, intermediary level between ''kathēkonta'' and ''katorthōmata'': ''mesa kathēkonta'', or indifferent actions (which are neither appropriate, nor good). A list of ''kathēkonta'' would include: to stay in good health, to respect one's parents, etc. ''Para to kathēkon'', or actions contrary to befitting actions, would be the reverse of this type of actions (to insult one's parents, etc.) Intermediary actions refers to "indifferent things" (ἀδιάφορα &amp;mdash; ''[[adiaphora]]''), which are in themselves neither good nor bad, but may be used in a convenient way or not. Such "indifferent things" include wealth, health, etc. These are not excluded from the domain of morality as one might expect: Cicero thus underlined, in ''[[De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum]]'' (About the Ends of Goods and Evils, III, 58-59), that when the wise man acts in the sphere of "indifferent things," he still acts conveniently, according to his own nature.

== Intentionality and perfection ==

[[Intentionality]] is crucial in Stoic ethics: the morality of the act resides not in the act itself, but in the intentionality and the way in which it is realized, in other words, in the moral agent itself. [[Stobaeus]] defined ''kathēkonta'' as probable actions (''probabilis ratio'' in Latin), or everything done for one reason (''eulogos apologia'' in Greek). Cicero wrote: "''quod autem ratione est, id officium appellamus; est igitur officium eius generis, quod nec in bonis ponatur nec in contrariis'', in ''[[De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum]]'', III, 58. 

Another distinction between ''kathēkon'' and ''katorthōmata'' has been to say that ''katorthōmata'' were ''kathēkonta'' which "possessed all the numbers" (''pantas apechon tous arithmous''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/bmcr/2000/2000-09-11.html Review of] Keimpe Algra, Jonathan Barnes, Jaap Mansfeld, Malcolm Schofield, ''The Cambridge History of Hellenistic Philosophy''.   Cambridge:  Cambridge University Press, 1999.  Pp. xix + 916.  {{ISBN|0-521-25028-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a Stoic expression meaning perfection.&lt;ref&gt;According to Long &amp; Sedley, the origin of this image of containing all numbers should be researched in musical [[harmony]], Long &amp; Sedley, 1987, 59K&lt;/ref&gt; Such a ''katorthōmata'' is done in harmony with all virtues, while the lay-man may only act in accordance with one virtue, but not all of them. Stoics believe that all virtues are intertwined and that the perfect act encompasses all of them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''On Stoic Self-Contradictions'', in ''[[Moralia]]'', 1046 E-F (SVF III, 299, 243 - see Long &amp; Sedley, 1987, 61F)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kerr metric''' or '''Kerr geometry''' describes the geometry of empty [[spacetime]] around a rotating uncharged [[axially-symmetric]] [[black hole]] with a quasispherical [[event horizon]]. The Kerr [[metric tensor|metric]] is an [[Exact solutions in general relativity|exact solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]]; these equations are highly non-linear, which makes exact solutions very difficult to find.

==Overview==
The Kerr metric is a generalization of the [[Schwarzschild metric]], discovered by [[Karl Schwarzschild]] in 1915, which described the geometry of [[spacetime]] around an uncharged, spherically-symmetric, and non-rotating body. The corresponding solution for a ''charged'', spherical, non-rotating body, the [[Reissner–Nordström metric]], was discovered soon afterwards (1916–1918). However, the exact solution for an uncharged, ''rotating'' black-hole, the Kerr metric, remained unsolved until 1963, when it was discovered by [[Roy Kerr]].&lt;ref name=kerr_1963&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kerr |first=Roy P. | authorlink=Roy Kerr | date=1963 | title=Gravitational Field of a Spinning Mass as an Example of Algebraically Special Metrics | journal=Physical Review Letters | volume=11 | issue=5 | pages=237–238 | doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.11.237 | bibcode=1963PhRvL..11..237K | url=http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v11/i5/p237_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melia, Fulvio (2009). "Cracking the Einstein Code", Princeton University Press, Princeton, {{ISBN|978-0226519517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natural extension to a charged, rotating black-hole, the [[Kerr–Newman metric]], was discovered shortly thereafter in 1965. These four related solutions may be summarized by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin:1.0em auto;"
| 
| Non-rotating (''J'' = 0)
| Rotating (''J'' ≠ 0)
|- 
| Uncharged (''Q'' = 0)
| [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild]]
| Kerr
|-
| Charged (''Q'' ≠ 0)
| [[Reissner–Nordström metric|Reissner–Nordström]]
| [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr–Newman]]
|}

where ''Q'' represents the body's [[electric charge]] and ''J'' represents its spin [[angular momentum]].

According to the Kerr metric, such rotating black-holes should exhibit [[frame-dragging]] (also known as [[Lense–Thirring precession]]), a distinctive prediction of general relativity. Measurement of this frame dragging effect was a major goal of the [[Gravity Probe B]] experiment. Roughly speaking, this effect predicts that objects coming close to a rotating mass will be entrained to participate in its rotation, not because of any applied force or torque that can be felt, but rather because of the swirling curvature of spacetime itself associated with rotating bodies. At close enough distances, all objects –&amp;nbsp;even light&amp;nbsp;– ''must'' rotate with the black-hole; the region where this holds is called the [[ergosphere]].

Rotating black holes have surfaces where the metric appears to have a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]; the size and shape of these surfaces depends on the black hole's [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]]. The outer surface encloses the ergosphere and has a shape similar to a flattened sphere. The inner surface marks the "radius of no return" also called the "event horizon"; objects passing through this radius can never again communicate with the world outside that radius. However, neither surface is a true singularity, since their apparent singularity can be eliminated in a different [[coordinate system]]. Objects between these two horizons must co-rotate with the rotating body, as noted above; this feature can be used to extract energy from a rotating black hole, up to its [[invariant mass]] energy, ''Mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The LIGO experiment which detected gravitational waves also provided the [[First observation of gravitational waves|first direct observation]] of a pair of Kerr black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abbot|first1=B.P.|title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=11 February 2016|volume=116|issue=6|pages=061102|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102|arxiv = 1602.03837 |bibcode = 2016PhRvL.116f1102A|pmid=26918975}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A key feature to note in the above metric is the cross product &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}  dt \, d\phi \end{align}&lt;/math&gt; term. There is coupling between time and motion in the plane of rotation that disappears when the black hole's angular momentum goes to zero.

In the non-relativistic limit where ''M'' (or, equivalently, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;) goes to zero, the Kerr metric becomes the orthogonal metric for the [[oblate spheroidal coordinates]]
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = c^{2} dt^{2} - \frac{\Sigma }{r^{2} + a^{2}} dr^{2} - \Sigma  d\theta^{2}- \left( r^{2} + a^{2} \right) \sin^{2}\theta d\phi^{2} &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

The total mass equivalent ''M'' (the gravitating mass) of the body (including its [[rotational energy]]) and its irreducible mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt; are related by&lt;ref&gt;[[Thibault Damour]]: [http://lapth.cnrs.fr/pg-nomin/chardon/IRAP_PhD/BlackHolesNice2012.pdf#page=11 Black Holes: Energetics and Thermodynamics], page 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tongeren"&gt;Stijn van Tongeren: [https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~proko101/StijnJvanTongeren_bh_talk2.pdf#page=42 Rotating Black Holes], page 42&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\rm irr} = \sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{M^4-a^2 M^2}+M^2}{2}} \ \to \ M = 2 \sqrt{\frac{M_{\rm irr}^4}{4 M_{\rm irr}^2-a^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

If the complete rotational energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt;=''c''²(''M''-''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;) of a black hole is extracted, for example with the [[Penrose process]],&lt;ref name="mtw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bhat"&gt;Bhat, Dhurandhar &amp; Dadhich: [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02715080 Energetics of the Kerr-Newman Black Hole by the Penrose Process], page 94&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining mass cannot shrink below the irreducible mass. Therefore, if a black hole rotates with the spin ''a=M'', its total mass-equivalent ''M'' is higher by a factor of {{radic|2}} in comparison with a corresponding Schwarzschild black hole where ''M'' is equal to ''M''&lt;sub&gt;irr&lt;/sub&gt;. The reason for this is that in order to get a static body to spin, energy needs to be applied to the system. Because of the [[mass–energy equivalence]] this energy also has a mass-equivalent, which adds to the total mass-energy of the system, ''M''.

=== in Kerr–Schild coordinates ===
The Kerr metric can be expressed in "Kerr–Schild" form, using a particular set of [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] as follows.&lt;ref name="Debney"&gt;Debney, G. et al.  [http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 "Solutions of the Einstein and Einstein-Maxwell Equations,"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130223203626/http://link.aip.org/link/?JMAPAQ/10/1842/1 |date=2013-02-23 }} ''Journal of Mathematical Physics'', Volume 10, page 1842 (1969).  Especially see equations (7.10), (7.11) and (7.14).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Balasin, Herbert and Nachbagauer, Herbert.  [https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9312028v1 “Distributional Energy-Momentum Tensor of the Kerr-Newman Space-Time Family.”]  (Arxiv.org 1993), subsequently published in ''Classical and Quantum Gravity'', volume 11, pages 1453–1461, [http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=4105419 abstract] (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marcelo.  “Energy of Black Holes and Hawking’s Universe” in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DGwYf8cOCq4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Newman%22+and+cartesian&amp;ei=zR5cSY6EC4KEzgTUwZCQDg#PPA149,M1 Trends in Black Hole Research]'', page 148 (Kreitler ed., Nova Publishers 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; These solutions were proposed by [[Roy Patrick Kerr|Kerr]] and [[Alfred Schild|Schild]] in 1965.

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu} = \eta_{\mu \nu} + fk_{\mu}k_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{Gr^2}{r^4 + a^2z^2}\left[2Mr \right]&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|11}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k} = ( k_{x} ,k_{y} ,k_{z} ) = \left( \frac{rx+ay}{r^2 + a^2} , \frac{ry-ax}{r^2 + a^2}, \frac{z}{r} \right) &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|12}}}}

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;k_{0} = 1. \!&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|13}}}}

Notice that '''k''' is a [[unit vector]].  Here ''M'' is the constant mass of the spinning object, ''η'' is the [[Minkowski space#Standard basis|Minkowski tensor]], and ''a'' is a constant rotational parameter of the spinning object.  It is understood that the vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt; is directed along the positive z-axis.  The quantity ''r'' is not the radius, but rather is implicitly defined like this:

:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{x^2+y^2}{r^2 + a^2} + \frac{z^2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|14}}}}

Notice that the quantity ''r'' becomes the usual radius ''R''

:&lt;math&gt;r \to R = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

when the rotational parameter ''a'' approaches zero.  In this form of solution, units are selected so that the speed of light is unity (''c'' = 1).  At large distances from the source (R &gt;&gt; a), these equations reduce to the [[Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates|Eddington–Finkelstein form]] of the [[Schwarzschild metric]].

In the Kerr–Schild form of the Kerr metric, the determinant of the metric tensor is everywhere equal to negative one, even near the source.&lt;ref name="Exact"&gt;Stephani, Hans et al.  ''Exact Solutions of Einstein's Field Equations'' (Cambridge University Press 2003).  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=SiWXP8FjTFEC&amp;pg=PA485&amp;dq=%22Kerr-Schild%22+and+%22determinant+of+the+metric%22&amp;num=100 page 485] regarding determinant of metric tensor.

==Wave operator==

Since even a direct check on the Kerr metric involves cumbersome calculations, the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] components &lt;math&gt;g^{ik}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[metric tensor]] in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are shown below in the expression for the square of the [[four-gradient]] [[Differential operator|operator]]:&lt;ref name="mtw" /&gt;   
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
g^{\mu\nu}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^{\mu}}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{x^{\nu}}} =
&amp; \frac{1}{c^{2}\Delta}\left(r^{2} + a^{2} + \frac{r_{s}ra^{2}}{\Sigma }\sin^{2}\theta\right)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}}\right)^{2} + \frac{2r_{s}ra}{c\Sigma \Delta}\frac{\partial}{\partial{\phi}}\frac{\partial}{\partial{t}} \\
&amp; - \frac{1}{\Delta\sin^{2}\theta}\left(1 - \frac{r_{s}r}{\Sigma }\right)\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{\phi}}\right)^{2} - \frac{\Delta}{\Sigma }\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{r}}\right)^{2} - \frac{1}{\Sigma }\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial{\theta}}\right)^{2} \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|15}}}}

==Frame dragging==

We may rewrite the Kerr metric ({{EquationRef|1}}) in the following form:
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;c^{2} d\tau^{2} = \left( g_{tt} - \frac{g_{t\phi}^{2}}{g_{\phi\phi}} \right) dt^{2} 
+ g_{rr} dr^{2} + g_{\theta\theta} d\theta^{2} + g_{\phi\phi} \left( d\phi + \frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} dt \right)^{2}.&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|16}}}}

This metric is equivalent to a co-rotating reference frame that is rotating with angular speed Ω that depends on both the radius ''r'' and the [[colatitude]] θ, where Ω is called the [[Killing horizon]].
:{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt; \Omega = -\frac{g_{t\phi}}{g_{\phi\phi}} = \frac{r_{s} r a c}{\Sigma  \left( r^{2} + a^{2} \right) + r_{s} r a^{2} \sin^{2}\theta}. &lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|17}}}}

Thus, an inertial reference frame is entrained by the rotating central mass to participate in the latter's rotation; this is called [[frame-dragging]], and has been tested experimentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Will | first = Clifford M. | authorlink = Clifford Martin Will |date=May 2011 | title =Finally, results from Gravity Probe B | journal = Physics | volume = 4 | page = 43 | doi = 10.1103/Physics.4.43 | arxiv = 1106.1198 |bibcode = 2011PhyOJ...4...43W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Qualitatively, frame-dragging can be viewed as the gravitational analog of electromagnetic induction. An "ice skater", in orbit over the equator and rotationally at rest with respect to the stars, extends her arms. The arm extended toward the black hole will be torqued spinward. The arm extended away from the black hole will be torqued anti-spinward. She will therefore be rotationally sped up, in a counter-rotating sense to the black hole. This is the opposite of what happens in everyday experience. If she is already rotating at a certain speed when she extends her arms, inertial effects and frame-dragging effects will balance and her spin will not change. Due to the [[Equivalence principle|Principle of Equivalence]] gravitational effects are locally indistinguishable from inertial effects, so this rotation rate, at which when she extends her arms nothing happens, is her local reference for non-rotation. This frame is rotating with respect to the fixed stars and counter-rotating with respect to the black hole. A useful metaphor is a [[planetary gear]] system with the black hole being the sun gear, the ice skater being a planetary gear and the outside universe being the ring gear. This can be also be interpreted through [[Mach's principle]].

==Important surfaces==
[[File:Kerr-surfaces.png|thumb|Location of the horizons, ergospheres and the ring singularity of the Kerr spacetime in Cartesian Kerr-Schild coordinates.&lt;ref name="visser35"&gt;Visser, Matt [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0622v3.pdf#page=35 The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction] arxiv.org, p. 15, Eq 60-61, p.24, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The spin parameter ''a'' is animated from 0 to ''M'', while the left side of the black hole is rotating towards the observer.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas de Vries: [http://haegar.fh-swf.de/publikationen/pascal.pdf#page=8 Shadows of rotating black holes]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The Kerr metric has two physical relevant surfaces on which it appears to be singular. The inner surface corresponds to an [[event horizon]] similar to that observed in the [[Schwarzschild metric]]; this occurs where the purely radial component ''g&lt;sub&gt;rr&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric goes to infinity. Solving the quadratic equation 1/''g''&lt;sub&gt;''rr''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 yields the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm H}^{\pm} = \frac{r_{s} \pm \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2}}}{2} \ &lt;/math&gt; which is in natural units of G=M=c=1: &lt;math&gt; \ r_{\rm H}^{\pm} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1-a^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Another singularity occurs where the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the metric changes sign from positive to negative. Again solving a quadratic equation ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;''=0 yields the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm E}^{\pm} = \frac{r_{s} \pm \sqrt{r_{s}^{2} - 4a^{2} \cos^{2}\theta}}{2} \ &lt;/math&gt; or in natural units: &lt;math&gt; \ r_{\rm E}^{\pm} = 1 \pm \sqrt{1-a^2 \cos ^2(\theta )}&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;θ term in the square root, this outer surface resembles a flattened sphere that touches the inner surface at the poles of the rotation axis, where the colatitude θ equals 0 or π; the space between these two surfaces is called the [[ergosphere]]. Within this volume, the purely temporal component ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, i.e., acts like a purely spatial metric component. Consequently, particles within this ergosphere must co-rotate with the inner mass, if they are to retain their time-like character. A moving particle experiences a positive [[proper time]] along its [[worldline]], its path through [[spacetime]]. However, this is impossible within the ergosphere, where ''g&lt;sub&gt;tt&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative, unless the particle is co-rotating with the interior mass ''M'' with an angular speed at least of Ω. Thus, no particle can rotate opposite to the central mass within the ergosphere.

As with the event horizon in the [[Schwarzschild metric]] the apparent singularities at r&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and r&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; are an illusion created by the choice of coordinates (i.e., they are  [[coordinate singularities]]). In fact, the space-time can be smoothly continued through them by an appropriate choice of coordinates.

==Ergosphere and the Penrose process==
{{main|Penrose process}}

A black hole in general is surrounded by a surface, called the [[event horizon]] and situated at the [[Schwarzschild radius]] for a nonrotating black hole, where the escape velocity is equal to the velocity of light. Within this  surface, no observer/particle can maintain itself at a constant radius. It is forced to fall inwards, and so this is sometimes called the ''static limit''.
&lt;!--- [[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|right|250px|ergosphere of a rotating black hole|Two important surfaces around a rotating black hole. The inner sphere is the static limit (the event horizon). It is the inner boundary of a region called the [[ergoregion | ergosphere]]. The oblate spheroidal surface, touching the event horizon at the poles, is the outer boundary of the ergosphere. Within the ergosphere a particle is forced (dragging of space and time) to rotate and may gain energy at the cost of the rotational energy of the black hole ([[Penrose process]]).]]  --&gt;

A rotating black hole has the same static limit at its event horizon but there is an additional surface outside the event horizon named the "ergosurface" given by &lt;math&gt;(r-M)^{2} = M^{2}-J^{2}\cos^{2}\theta&lt;/math&gt; in [[Boyer–Lindquist coordinates]], which can be intuitively characterized as the sphere where "the rotational velocity of the surrounding space" is dragged along with the velocity of light. Within this sphere the dragging is greater than the speed of light, and any observer/particle is forced to co-rotate.

The region outside the event horizon but inside the surface where the rotational velocity is the speed of light, is called the ''ergosphere'' (from Greek ''ergon'' meaning ''work''). Particles falling within the ergosphere are forced to rotate faster and thereby gain energy. Because they are still outside the event horizon, they may escape the black hole. The net process is that the rotating black hole emits energetic particles at the cost of its own total energy. The possibility of extracting spin energy from a rotating black hole was first proposed by the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]] in 1969 and is thus called the [[Penrose process]]. Rotating black holes in astrophysics are a potential source of large amounts of energy and are used to explain energetic phenomena, such as [[gamma-ray burst]]s.

==Features of the Kerr geometry==

The Kerr geometry exhibits many noteworthy features: the maximal analytic extension includes a sequence of [[asymptotically flat]] exterior regions, each associated with an [[ergosphere]], stationary limit surfaces, [[event horizon]]s, [[Cauchy horizon]]s, [[closed timelike curve]]s, and a ring-shaped [[Gravitational singularity|curvature singularity]]. The [[geodesic equation]] can be solved exactly in closed form. In addition to two [[Killing vector fields]] (corresponding to ''[[time translation]]'' and ''axisymmetry''), the Kerr geometry admits a remarkable [[Killing tensor]]. There is a pair of principal null congruences (one ''ingoing'' and one ''outgoing''). The [[Weyl tensor]] is [[algebraically special]], in fact it has [[Petrov classification|Petrov type]] '''D'''. The [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] is known. Topologically, the  [[homotopy type]] of the Kerr spacetime can be simply characterized as a line with circles attached at each integer point.

Note that the inner Kerr geometry is unstable with regard to perturbations in the interior region. This instability means that although the Kerr metric is axis-symmetric, a black hole created through gravitational collapse may not be so.&lt;ref name="visser35" /&gt;  This instability also implies that many of the features of the Kerr geometry described above may not be present inside such a black hole.&lt;ref name="pauldavies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="visser13" /&gt;

A surface on which light can orbit a black hole is called a photon sphere. The Kerr solution has infinitely many [[photon sphere]]s, lying between an inner one and an outer one. In the nonrotating, Schwarzschild solution, with ''a''=0, the inner and outer photon spheres degenerate, so that there is only one photon sphere at a single radius. The greater the spin of a black hole, the farther from each other the inner and outer photon spheres move. A beam of light traveling in a direction opposite to the spin of the black hole will circularly orbit the hole at the outer photon sphere. A beam of light traveling in the same direction as the black hole's spin will circularly orbit at the inner photon sphere. Orbiting geodesics with some angular momentum perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the black hole will orbit on photon spheres between these two extremes. Because the space-time is rotating, such orbits exhibit a precession, since there is a shift in the &lt;math&gt;\phi \,&lt;/math&gt; variable after completing one period in the &lt;math&gt;\theta \,&lt;/math&gt; variable.

Furthermore, there are two constants of motion given by the time translation and rotation symmetries of Kerr spacetime, the energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and the component of the orbital angular momentum parallel to spin of the black hole &lt;math&gt;L_z&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="mtw"&gt;Misner, Thorne &amp; Wheeler: [https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/03/21/gravitation-misner-thorne-wheeler Gravitation], pages 899, 900, 908&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bardeen1972"&gt;James Bardeen, 1972: [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?db_key=AST&amp;bibcode=1972ApJ...178..347B&amp;letter=.&amp;classic=YES&amp;defaultprint=YES&amp;whole_paper=YES&amp;page=347&amp;epage=347&amp;send=Send+PDF&amp;filetype=.pdf#page=4 Rotating Black Holes: Locally Bonrotating Frame, Energy Extraction &amp; Scalar Synchrotron Radiation], page 350&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[Hamilton–Jacobi equation|Hamilton–Jacobi theory]], [[Brandon Carter]] showed&lt;ref name="carter_1968"/&gt; that there exists a fourth constant of motion, &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, now referred to as the [[Carter constant]]. It is related to the total angular momentum of the particle and is given by
:&lt;math&gt;Q = p_{\theta}^{2} + \cos^{2}\theta \Bigg( a^{2}(\mu^{2} - E^{2}) + \left(\frac{L_z}{\sin\theta} \right)^{2} \Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.
Since there are four (independent) constants of motion for degrees of freedom the equations of motion for a test particle in Kerr spacetime are [[integrable]].

Using these constants of motion, the trajectory equations for a test particle can be written (using natural units of G=M=c=1),&lt;ref name="odyssey"&gt;Hung-Yi Pu, Kiyun Yun, Ziri Younsi &amp; Suk Jin Yoon: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.02063.pdf#page=2 A public GPU-based code for general-relativistic radiative transfer in Kerr spacetime], [https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02063 arXiv:1601.02063], page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levin"&gt;Levin, Janna and Perez-Giz, Gabe: ''A Periodic Table for Black Hole Orbits'', {{arxiv|0802.0459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{dr}{d\lambda} = \pm \sqrt{R(r)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{d\theta}{d\lambda} = \pm \sqrt{\Theta(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{d\phi}{d\lambda} = -\left(a E-\frac{L_z}{\sin^2\theta}\right)+\frac{a}{\Delta}P(r) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma \frac{dt}{d\lambda} = -a (a E\sin^2\theta-L_z)+\frac{r^2+a^2}{\Delta}P(r)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\Theta(\theta)=Q-\cos^2\theta\left(a^2(\mu^2-E^2)+\frac{L_z^2}{\sin^2\theta}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;P(r)=E(r^2+a^2)-a L_z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R(r)=P(r)^2-\Delta\left(r^2+(L_z-a E)^2+Q\right)&lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an [[affine parameter]] such that &lt;math&gt;\frac{dx^\alpha}{d\lambda} = p^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, when &lt;math&gt;\mu&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; the affine parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, is related to the proper time &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; through &lt;math&gt;\lambda = \tau/\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

Because of the [[Frame-dragging]]-effect a zero angular momentum observer (ZAMO)&lt;ref&gt;Andrei &amp; Valeri Frolov: [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.6316.pdf Rigidly rotating ZAMO surfaces in the Kerr spacetime] {{arXiv|1408.6316v1}})&lt;/ref&gt; is corotating with the angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; which is defined with respect to the bookkeeper's coordinate time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The local velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of the test-particle is measured relative to a probe corotating with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. The gravitational time-dilation between a ZAMO at fixed &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; and a stationary observer far away from the mass is

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{t}{\tau} = \sqrt{{\frac{(a^2+r^2)^2-a^2 \ \Delta \ \sin ^2 \theta }{\Delta \ \Sigma}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetries==
The group of isometries of the Kerr metric is the subgroup of the ten-dimensional [[Poincaré group]] which takes the two-dimensional locus of the singularity to itself. It retains the [[time translation]]s (one dimension) and rotations around its axis of rotation (one dimension). Thus it has two dimensions. Like the Poincaré group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the component which reverses time and longitude; the component which reflects through the equatorial plane; and the component that does both.

In physics, symmetries are typically associated with conserved constants of motion, in accordance with [[Noether's theorem]]. As shown above, the geodesic equations have four conserved quantities: one of which comes from the definition of a geodesic, and two of which arise from the time translation and rotation symmetry of the Kerr geometry. The fourth conserved quantity does not arise from a symmetry in the standard sense and is commonly referred to as a hidden symmetry.

==Overextreme Kerr solutions==

The location of the event horizon is determined by the larger root of &lt;math&gt;\Delta=0&lt;/math&gt;. When &lt;math&gt;{r_s / 2} &lt; a &lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;G M^2 &lt; J c &lt;/math&gt;), there are no (real valued) solutions to this equation, and there is no event horizon. With no event horizons to hide it from the rest of the universe, the black hole ceases to be a black hole and will instead be a [[naked singularity]].&lt;ref name="Chandrasekhar_1983"&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandrasekhar | first = S. | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | date = 1983 | title = The Mathematical Theory of Black Holes | series = International Series of Monographs on Physics | volume = 69 | pages = 375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kerr black holes as wormholes==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Space-Time Diagram for a Spinning Black Hole.gif|thumb|right|300px|A [[Penrose diagram]] for the Kerr metric: an object traveling on world-line B can emerge out of the spinning black hole.]] --&gt;
Although the Kerr solution appears to be singular at the roots of Δ = 0, these are actually [[coordinate singularity|coordinate singularities]], and, with an appropriate choice of new coordinates, the Kerr solution can be smoothly extended through the values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to these roots. The larger of these roots determines the location of the event horizon, and the smaller determines the location of a Cauchy horizon. A (future-directed, time-like) curve can start in the exterior and pass through the event horizon. Once having passed through the event horizon, the &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; coordinate now behaves like a time coordinate, so it must decrease until the curve passes through the Cauchy horizon.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hamilton: [http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/penrose.html#kerr Black hole Penrose diagrams] (JILA Colorado)&lt;/ref&gt;

The region beyond the Cauchy horizon has several surprising features. The &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; coordinate again behaves like a spatial coordinate and can vary freely. The interior region has a reflection symmetry, so that a (future-directed time-like) curve may continue along a symmetric path, which continues through a second Cauchy horizon, through a second event horizon, and out into a new exterior region which is isometric to the original exterior region of the Kerr solution. The curve could then escape to infinity in the new region or enter the future event horizon of the new exterior region and repeat the process. This second exterior is sometimes thought of as another universe. On the other hand, in the Kerr solution, the singularity is a [[Ring singularity|ring]], and the curve may pass through the center of this ring. The region beyond permits closed time-like curves. Since the trajectory of observers and particles in general relativity are described by time-like curves, it is possible for observers in this region to return to their past.&lt;ref name="pauldavies"&gt;[[Paul Davies]]: [https://archive.is/20170708235257/https://books.google.at/books?id=mOgIGyD1uSIC&amp;pg=PT291&amp;lpg=PT291&amp;dq=kerr+closed+loop+past&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=duxTYw68Fj&amp;sig=2vWOrEFsA59UXxO6xFSQWwjtDGw&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWhJzk6_rUAhXJZ1AKHaGxCI0Q6AEIWTAG%23v=onepage&amp;q=kerr%20closed%20loop%20past&amp;f=false About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visser13"&gt;Visser, Matt [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.0622v3.pdf#page=13 The Kerr spacetime: A brief introduction] arxiv.org, p. 13, below eq. 52&lt;/ref&gt; This interior solution is not likely to be physical and considered as a purely mathematical artefact.&lt;ref name="kerrtube1"&gt;Roy Kerr (Crafoord Prize Symposium in Astronomy): ''[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeLkmS3PZ5g&amp;t=26m Spinning Black Holes]''. (Youtube, Timestamp 26m)&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is expected that the exterior region of the Kerr solution is stable, and that all rotating black holes will eventually approach a Kerr metric, the interior region of the solution appears to be unstable, much like a pencil balanced on its point.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="visser35" /&gt; This is related to the idea of [[Cosmic censorship hypothesis|cosmic censorship]].

==Relation to other exact solutions==

The Kerr geometry is a particular example of a [[stationary spacetime|stationary]] [[axially symmetric spacetime|axially symmetric]] [[vacuum solution]] to the [[Einstein field equation]]. The family of all stationary axially symmetric vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equation are the [[Ernst vacuum]]s.

The Kerr solution is also related to various non-vacuum solutions which model black holes. For example, the [[Kerr–Newman metric|Kerr–Newman electrovacuum]] models a (rotating) black hole endowed with an electric charge, while the [[Kerr–Vaidya null dust]] models a (rotating) hole with infalling electromagnetic radiation.

The special case &lt;math&gt;a = 0 \,&lt;/math&gt; of the Kerr metric yields the [[Schwarzschild metric]], which models a ''nonrotating'' black hole which is [[static spacetime|static]] and [[spherically symmetric]], in the [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]. (In this case, every Geroch moment but the mass vanishes.)

The ''interior'' of the Kerr geometry, or rather a portion of it, is [[locally isometric]] to the [[Chandrasekhar–Ferrari CPW vacuum]], an example of a [[colliding plane wave]] model. This is particularly interesting, because the [[global spacetime structure|global structure]] of this CPW solution is quite different from that of the Kerr geometry, and in principle, an experimenter could hope to study the geometry of (the outer portion of) the Kerr interior by arranging the collision of two suitable [[gravitational plane waves]].

==Multipole moments==

Each [[asymptotically flat]] Ernst vacuum can be characterized by giving the infinite sequence of relativistic [[multipole moment]]s, the first two of which can be interpreted as the [[mass]] and [[angular momentum]] of the source of the field. There are alternative formulations of relativistic multipole moments due to Hansen, Thorne, and Geroch, which turn out to agree with each other. The relativistic multipole moments of the Kerr geometry were computed by Hansen; they turn out to be
:&lt;math&gt; M_n = M \, (i \, a)^n &lt;/math&gt;
Thus, the special case of the [[Schwarzschild metric|Schwarzschild vacuum]] (''a''=0) gives the "monopole [[point source]]" of general relativity.

''Warning:'' do not confuse these relativistic multipole moments with the ''Weyl multipole moments'', which arise from treating a certain metric function (formally corresponding to Newtonian gravitational potential) which appears the Weyl-Papapetrou chart for the Ernst family of all stationary axisymmetric vacuum solutions using the standard euclidean scalar [[multipole moment]]s. In a sense, the Weyl moments only (indirectly) characterize the "mass distribution" of an isolated source, and they turn out to depend only on the ''even order'' relativistic moments. In the case of solutions symmetric across the equatorial plane the ''odd order'' Weyl moments vanish. For the Kerr vacuum solutions, the first few Weyl moments are given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_0 = M, \; \; a_1 = 0, \; \; a_2 = M \, \left( \frac{M^2}{3} - a^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;
In particular, we see that the Schwarzschild vacuum has nonzero second order Weyl moment, corresponding to the fact that the "Weyl monopole" is the [[Chazy–Curzon vacuum]] solution, not the Schwarzschild vacuum solution, which arises from the Newtonian potential of a certain finite length uniform density thin ''rod''.

In weak field general relativity, it is convenient to treat isolated sources using another type of multipole, which generalize the Weyl moments to ''mass multipole moments'' and ''momentum multipole moments'', characterizing respectively the distribution of [[mass]] and of [[momentum]] of the source. These are multi-indexed quantities whose suitably symmetrized (anti-symmetrized) parts can be related to the real and imaginary parts of the relativistic moments for the full nonlinear theory in a rather complicated manner.

Perez and Moreschi have given an alternative notion of "monopole solutions" by expanding the standard NP tetrad of the Ernst vacuums in powers of ''r'' (the radial coordinate in the Weyl-Papapetrou chart). According to this formulation:
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''zero'' angular momentum is the ''Schwarzschild vacuum'' family (one parameter),
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''radial'' angular momentum is the ''[[Taub–NUT vacuum]]'' family (two parameters; not quite asymptotically flat),
*the isolated mass monopole source with ''axial'' angular momentum is the ''Kerr vacuum'' family (two parameters).
In this sense, the Kerr vacuums are the simplest stationary axisymmetric asymptotically flat vacuum solutions in general relativity.

==Open problems==

The Kerr geometry is often used as a model of a [[rotating black hole]].  But if we hold the solution to be valid only outside some compact region (subject to certain restrictions), in principle we should be able to use it as an [[exterior solution]] to model the gravitational field around a rotating massive object other than a black hole, such as a [[neutron star]], or the Earth. This works out very nicely for the non-rotating case, where we can match the Schwarzschild vacuum exterior to a [[Schwarzschild fluid]] interior, and indeed to more general [[static spherically symmetric perfect fluid]] solutions. However, the problem of finding a rotating perfect-fluid interior which can be matched to a Kerr exterior, or indeed to any asymptotically flat vacuum exterior solution, has proven very difficult. In particular, the [[Wahlquist fluid]], which was once thought to be a candidate for matching to a Kerr exterior, is now known not to admit any such matching. At present it seems that only approximate solutions modeling slowly rotating fluid balls are known. (Slowly rotating fluid balls are the relativistic analog of oblate spheroidal balls with nonzero mass and angular momentum but vanishing higher multipole moments.)  However, the exterior of the [[Neugebauer–Meinel disk]], an exact [[dust solution]] which models a rotating thin disk, approaches in a limiting case the &lt;math&gt; GM^2 = cJ &lt;/math&gt; Kerr geometry. Physical thin-disk solutions obtained by identifying parts of the Kerr space-time are also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bičák | first1 = Jří | last2 = Ledvinka | first2 = Tomáš | year = 1993 | title = Relativistic disks as sources of the Kerr metric | url = | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 71 | issue = 11| pages = 1669–1672 | doi=10.1103/physrevlett.71.1669 | pmid=10054468| bibcode = 1993PhRvL..71.1669B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kshama''' ({{lang-sa|[[wikt:क्षमा|क्षमा]]}}, ''{{IAST|kṣamā}}'') is a [[Sanskrit]] word that relates to the acts of patience, releasing time and functioning in the now. [[A. A. Macdonnell|Macdonell]] defines it as: "patience, forbearance, indulgence (towards...)".&lt;ref&gt;See Macdonnell's [https://dsalsrv04.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/new_chuck/macdonell_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B7%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE&amp;searchhws=yes dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; kshama word has a rich in meaning. It simply means forgiveness or forbearance. Kshama also indicates extreme patience and an more capacity to forget as also forgive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sssbpt.info/summershowers/ss2000/ss2000-12.pdf|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Kshama forms one of the Ten Traditional [[Yamas]], or restraints, that are codified in numerous scriptures including the [[Shandilya Upanishad|Shandilya]] and [[Varaha Upanishad]]s and the [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] by [[Gorakshanath]]a.

It is sometimes used as a female given name.

The concept has its origin in biology and [[Protestant culture|cultural Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;fn: a German ''fin-de-siècle'' movement, which questioned the church hierarchy and sought to combine protestant and scientific beliefs (Treitel, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifeworld concept is used in [[philosophy]] and in some [[social sciences]], particularly [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. The concept emphasizes a state of affairs in which the world is experienced, the world is lived (German ''erlebt''). The lifeworld is a pre-epistemological stepping stone for [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] analysis in the Husserlian tradition.

==The phenomenological concept==
{{See also|Worldview}}

[[Edmund Husserl]] introduced the concept of the lifeworld in his ''[[The Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology]]'' (1936):

{{quote|In whatever way we may be conscious of the world as universal horizon, as coherent universe of existing objects, we, each "I-the-man" and all of us together, belong to the world as living with one another in the world; and the world is our world, valid for our consciousness as existing precisely through this 'living together.' We, as living in wakeful world-consciousness, are constantly active on the basis of our passive having of the world... Obviously this is true not only for me, the individual ego; rather we, in living together, have the world pre-given in this together, belong, the world as world for all, pre-given with this ontic meaning... The we-subjectivity... [is] constantly functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, pp. 108-109&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This collective inter-subjective pool of perceiving, Husserl explains, is both universally present and, for humanity's purposes, capable of arriving at 'objective truth,' or at least as close to objectivity as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The 'lifeworld' is a grand theatre of objects variously arranged in space and time relative to perceiving subjects, is already-always there, and is the "ground" for all shared human experience.&lt;ref&gt;Husserl, Edmund. (1936/1970). The Crisis of the European Sciences, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; Husserl's formulation of the lifeworld was also influenced by [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]'s "life-nexus" (German ''Lebenszusammenhang'') and [[Martin Heidegger]]'s Being-in-the-world{{cn|date=February 2013}} (German ''In-der-Welt-Sein''). The concept was further developed by students of Husserl such as [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Jan Patočka]], and [[Alfred Schütz]]. The lifeworld can be thought of as the horizon of all our experiences, in the sense that it is that background on which all things appear as themselves and meaningful. The lifeworld cannot, however, be understood in a purely static manner; it isn't an unchangeable background, but rather a dynamic horizon in which we ''live'', and which "lives with us" in the sense that nothing can appear in our lifeworld except as ''lived''.

The concept represented a turning point in Husserl's [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] from the tradition of [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Up until then, Husserl had been focused on finding, elucidating, and explaining an absolute foundation of philosophy in consciousness, without any presuppositions except what can be found through the reflective analysis of consciousness and what is immediately present to it. Originally, all judgments of the real were to be "[[bracketing (phenomenology)|bracketed]]" or suspended, and then analyzed to bring to light the role of consciousness in constituting or constructing them. With the concept of the lifeworld, however, Husserl embarked on a different path, which recognizes that, even at its deepest level, consciousness is already embedded in and operating in a world of meanings and pre-judgements that are socially, culturally, and historically constituted. Phenomenology thereby became the study not just of the pure consciousness and meanings of a transcendental ego, as in Husserl's earlier work, but of consciousness and meaning in context. The lifeworld is one of the more complicated concepts in phenomenology, mainly because of its status as both personal and intersubjective.

Even if a person's [[historicity (philosophy)|historicity]] is intimately tied up with his lifeworld, and each person thus has a lifeworld, this doesn't necessarily mean that the lifeworld is a purely individual phenomenon. In keeping with the phenomenological notion of [[intersubjectivity]], the lifeworld can be intersubjective even though each individual ''necessarily'' carries his own "personal" lifeworld ("homeworld"); meaning is intersubjectively accessible, and can be communicated (shared by one's "homecomrades"). However, a homeworld is also always limited by an alienworld. The internal "meanings" of this alienworld ''can'' be communicated, but can never be apprehended ''as alien''; the alien can only be appropriated or assimilated into the lifeworld, and only understood on the background of the lifeworld.

==The sociological concept==
The Husserlian elucidation of lifeworld provided a starting point for the phenomenological sociology of [[Alfred Schütz]], who tried to synthesize Husserl's phenomenology of consciousness, meaning, and the life-world with [[Max Weber]]'s sociology and its focus on subjectively meaningful action. [[Jürgen Habermas]] has further developed the concept of the lifeworld in his social theory. For Habermas, the lifeworld is more or less the "background" environment of competences, practices, and attitudes representable in terms of one's cognitive horizon. Compared to Husserl with his focus on consciousness, however, Habermas, whose social theory is grounded in communication, focuses on the lifeworld as consisting of socially and culturally sedimented linguistic meanings. It is the lived realm of informal, culturally-grounded understandings and mutual accommodations. [[Rationalization (sociology)|Rationalization]] and colonization of the lifeworld by the instrumental rationality of bureaucracies and market-forces is a primary concern of Habermas's two-volume ''[[Theory of Communicative Action]]''.

For Habermas, [[communicative action]] is governed by [[practical reason|practical rationality]]—ideas of social importance are mediated through the process of linguistic communication according to the rules of practical rationality. By contrast, [[instrumental reason|technical rationality]] governs ''systems''&lt;!--Not to be confused with systems in systems theory--&gt; of instrumentality, like industries, or on a larger scale, the [[capitalism|capitalist economy]] or the [[liberal democracy|democratic political government]]. Ideas of instrumental importance to a system are mediated according to the rules of that system (the most obvious example is the capitalist economy's use of [[currency]]). [[Self-deception]], and thus systematically distorted communication, is possible only when the lifeworld has been 'colonized' by instrumental rationality, so some social norm comes into existence and enjoys [[legitimation|legitimate]] power even though it is not justifiable. This occurs when means of mediating instrumental ideas gains communicative [[Power (philosophy)|power]]—as when someone pays a group of people to stay quiet during a public [[debate]], or if financial or administrative resources are used to advertise some social viewpoint. When people take the resulting [[consensus]] as normatively relevant, the lifeworld has been colonized and [[communication]] has been systematically distorted. The '[[colonialism|colonization]]' [[metaphor]] is used because the use of steering media to arrive at social consensus is not native to the lifeworld—the decision-making processes of the systems world must encroach on the lifeworld in a way that is in a sense imperialistic:

{{cquote|When stripped of their [[ideology|ideological]] veils, the imperatives of autonomous subsystems make their way into the lifeworld from the outside—like colonial masters coming into a [[tribal society]]—and force a process of assimilation upon it. The diffused perspectives of the local [[culture]] cannot be sufficiently coordinated to permit the play of the metropolis and the world market to be grasped from the periphery.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, 1987, The Theory of Communicative Action, Vol. 2, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fragmentation of consciousness associated with the two [[Marxism|Marxist]] concepts of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and [[false consciousness]] illustrate why, in Habermas' perspective, they are merely special cases of the more general phenomenon of lifeworld colonization.

Social coordination and systemic regulation occur by means of shared practices, beliefs, values, and structures of communicative interaction, which may be institutionally based. We are inevitably lifeworldly, such that individuals and interactions draw from custom and cultural traditions to construct identities, define situations, coordinate action, and create social solidarity. Ideally this occurs by communicatively coming to understanding (German ''[[Verstehen]]''), but it also occurs through pragmatic negotiations (compare: Seidman, 1997:197).

The lifeworld is related to further concepts such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s notion of ''[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'' and to the sociological notion of [[everyday life]].

==The epistemological concept==

In the course of recent constructivist discourses a discussion about the lifeworld term took place as well. [[Björn Kraus|Björn Kraus']] [[relational-constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Björn Kraus: Plädoyer für den Relationalen Konstruktivismus und eine Relationale Soziale Arbeit. in Forum Sozial (2017) 1 pp. 29-35 http://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51948&lt;/ref&gt; version of the lifeworld term considers its phenomenological roots ([[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schütz|Schütz]]), but expands it within the range of [[constructivist epistemology|epistemological constructivist]] theory building.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 145 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, a new approach is created, which is not only focusing on the individual perspective upon the lifeworld term, but is also taking account of social and material environmental conditions and their relevance as emphasized for example by [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]]. Essential therefore is Kraus' basic assumption that cognitive development depends on two determining factors. On the one hand a person's own reality is her subjective construct. On the other hand this construct—in spite of all [[subjectivity]]—is not random: Since a person is still linked to her environment, her own reality is influenced by the conditions of this environment (German ''Grundsätzliche Doppelbindung menschlicher Strukturentwicklung'').&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building up on this point of view, a separation of individual perception and the social and material environmental conditions is made possible. Kraus accordingly picks up the lifeworld term, adds the term "life conditions" (German ''Lebenslage''&lt;ref&gt;See Neurath 1931 /Weisser 1956 in Björn Kraus: Lebenswelt und Lebensweltorientierung – eine begriffliche Revision als Angebot an eine systemisch-konstruktivistische Sozialarbeitswissenschaft. Kontext. Zeitschrift für Systemische Therapie und Familientherapie. Göttingen: Vandenhoek &amp; Ruprecht. Heft 37/02, 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;116–129. Also available online: http://www.webnetwork-nordwest.de/sowi/article.php?sid=92 2004, p. 7. See also Björn Kraus 2013, p. 143 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;) and opposes the two terms to each other.

By this means, lifeworld describes a person's subjectively experienced world, whereas life conditions describe the person's actual circumstances in life. Accordingly, it could be said that a person's lifeworld is built depending on their particular life conditions. More precisely, the life conditions include the material and immaterial living circumstances as for example employment situation, availability of material resources, housing conditions, social environment (friends, foes, acquaintances, relatives, etc.) as well as the persons physical condition (fat/thin, tall/small, female/male, healthy/sick, etc.). The lifeworld, in contrast, describes the subjective [[perception]] of these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152 f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kraus uses the epistemological distinction between subjective reality and objective reality.  Thus, a person's lifeworld correlates with the person's life conditions in the same way than subjective reality correlates with objective reality. The one is the insurmountable, subjective construct built depending on the other one's conditions.&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between “Lifeworld” (Lebenswelt) and “Life Conditions” (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438; Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden.''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013. P. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kraus defined lifeworld and life conditions as follows:

''"Life conditions mean a person's material and immaterial circumstances of life.''

''Lifeworld means a person's subjective construction of reality, which he or she forms under the condition of his or her life circumstances."''&lt;ref&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''The Life We Live and the Life We Experience: Introducing the Epistemological Difference between "Lifeworld" (Lebenswelt) and "Life Conditions" (Lebenslage)'' Social Work and Society. International Online Journal. Vol. 13, No. 2 2015, P. 4. http://www.socwork.net/sws/article/view/438&lt;/ref&gt;

This contrasting comparison provides a conceptual specification, enabling in the first step the distinction between a subjectively experienced world and its material and social conditions and allowing in the second step to focus on these conditions' relevance for the subjective construction of reality.

With this in mind, Manfred Ferdinand, who is reviewing the lifeworld terms used by [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Björn Kraus]] and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concludes: Kraus' "thoughts on a constructivist comprehension of lifeworlds contours the integration of micro-, meso- and macroscopic approaches, as it is demanded by Invernizzi and Butterwege: This integration is not only necessary in order to relate the subjective perspectives and the objective frame conditions to each other but also because the objective frame conditions obtain their relevance for the subjective lifeworlds not before they are perceived and assessed."&lt;ref&gt;See Manfred Ferdinand: Lebenswelten - Lebensschnüre. Heidelberger Studien zur praktischen Theologie.: Lit Verlag: Münster 2014, S. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[arithmetic]], '''long division''' is a standard [[division algorithm]] suitable for dividing multidigit numbers that is simple enough to perform by hand. It breaks down a [[division (mathematics)|division]] problem into a series of easier steps. As in all division problems, one number, called the [[division (mathematics)|dividend]], is divided by another, called the [[divisor]],  producing a result called the [[quotient]]. It enables computations involving arbitrarily large numbers to be performed by following a series of simple steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld | urlname=LongDivision | title= Long Division}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviated form of long division is called [[short division]], which is almost always used instead of long division when the divisor has only one digit. [[Chunking (division)|Chunking]] (also known as the partial quotients method or the hangman method) is a less-efficient form of long division which may be easier to understand.

While related algorithms have existed since the 12th century AD,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://new.math.uiuc.edu/im2008/rogers/algebra.html|title=Islamic Mathematics|website=new.math.uiuc.edu|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the specific algorithm in modern use was introduced by [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] {{Circa}} 1600 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Henry Briggs - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810104516866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Place in education ==
Inexpensive calculators and computers have become the most common way to solve division problems, eliminating a traditional [[mathematical exercise]], and decreasing the educational opportunity to show how to do so by paper and pencil techniques. (Internally, those devices use one of a variety of [[division algorithm]]s). In the United States, long division has been especially targeted for de-emphasis, or even elimination from the school curriculum, by [[reform mathematics]], though traditionally introduced in the 4th or 5th grades.

== Method ==
In English-speaking countries, long division does not use the [[division slash]] {{angle brackets|[[∕]]}} or [[obelus]] {{angle brackets|÷}} signs but instead constructs a '''tableau'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Nicholson |first=W. Keith |title=Introduction to Abstract Algebra, ''4th ed.'' |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2012 |p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=w-GaLpapRcEC&amp;pg=PA206 206] }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[divisor]] is separated from the [[dividend]] by a [[right parenthesis]] {{angle brackets|[[)]]}} or [[vertical bar]] {{angle brackets|[[vertical bar|{{!}}]]}}; the dividend is separated from the [[quotient]] by a [[Vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (i.e., [[overbar]]). The combination of these two symbols is sometimes known as a '''long division symbol''' or '''division bracket'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Wolfram MathWorld |contribution-url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LongDivisionSymbol.html |contribution=Long Division Symbol |url=http://wolfram.com |accessdate=11 February 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It developed in the 18th century from an earlier single-line notation separating the dividend from the quotient by a [[left parenthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=Symbols of Operation |contribution-url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/operation.html |date=2010 |url=http://jeff560.tripod.com/mathsym.html |title=Earliest Uses of Various Mathematical Symbols |last=Miller |first=Jeff }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Hill|first=John|title=Arithmetick both in the theory and practice|publisher=Straben et al.|year=1772|edition=11th|orig-year=First published 1712|place=London|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=nietz;cc=nietz;idno=00abf4892m;node=00abf4892m%3A1.11;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=3;page=root;size=s|accessdate=12 February 2016|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process is begun by dividing the left-most digit of the dividend by the divisor.  The quotient (rounded down to an integer) becomes the first digit of the result, and the [[remainder]] is calculated (this step is notated as a subtraction).  This remainder carries forward when the process is repeated on the following digit of the dividend (notated as 'bringing down' the next digit to the remainder).  When all digits have been processed and no remainder is left, the process is complete.

An example is shown below, representing the division of 500 by 4 (with a result of 125).
     &lt;u&gt; &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;     (Explanations)
    4)500
      &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;        ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; =  4)
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0       ( 5 -  4 =  &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;       ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; =  8)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0      (10 -  8 =  &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;      ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; = 20)
        0      (20 - 20 =  0)

[[File:Long division.JPG|thumb|An example of long division performed without a calculator.]]
In the above example, the first step is to find the shortest sequence of digits starting from the left end of the dividend, 500, that the divisor 4 goes into at least once; this shortest sequence in this example is simply the first digit, 5. The largest number that the divisor 4 can be multiplied by without exceeding 5 is 1, so the digit 1 is put above the 5 to start constructing the quotient. Next, the 1 is multiplied by the divisor 4, to obtain the largest whole number (4 in this case) that is a multiple of the divisor 4 without exceeding the 5; this product of 1 times 4 is 4, so 4 is placed underneath the 5. Next the 4 under the 5 is subtracted from the 5 to get the remainder, 1, which is placed under the 4 under the 5. This remainder 1 is necessarily smaller than the divisor 4. Next the first as-yet unused digit in the dividend, in this case the first digit 0 after the 5, is copied directly underneath itself and next to the remainder 1, to form the number 10. At this point the process is repeated enough times to reach a stopping point: The largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 10 is 2, so 2 is written above the 0 that is next to the 5&amp;nbsp;– that is, directly above the last digit in the 10. Then the latest entry to the quotient, 2, is multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 8, which is the largest multiple of 4 that does not exceed 10; so 8 is written below 10, and the subtraction 10 minus 8 is performed to get the remainder 2, which is placed below the 8. This remainder 2 is necessarily smaller than the divisor 4. The next digit of the dividend (the last 0 in 500) is copied directly below itself and next to the remainder 2, to form 20. Then the largest number by which the divisor 4 can be multiplied without exceeding 20 is ascertained; this number is 5, so 5 is placed above the last dividend digit that was brought down (i.e., above the rightmost 0 in 500). Then this new quotient digit 5 is multiplied by the divisor 4 to get 20, which is written at the bottom below the existing 20. Then 20 is subtracted from 20, yielding 0, which is written below the 20. We know we are done now because two things are true: there are no more digits to bring down from the dividend, and the last subtraction result was 0.

If the last remainder when we ran out of dividend digits had been something other than 0, there would have been two possible courses of action. (1) We could just stop there and say that the dividend divided by the divisor is the quotient written at the top with the remainder written at the bottom; equivalently we could write the answer as the quotient followed by a fraction that is the remainder divided by the divisor. Or, (2) we could extend the dividend by writing it as, say, 500.000... and continue the process (using a decimal point in the quotient directly above the decimal point in the dividend), in order to get a decimal answer, as in the following example.

     &lt;u&gt;  31.75&lt;/u&gt;     
    4)127.00
      &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;         (12 ÷ 4 = 3)
       07        (0 [[remainder]], bring down next figure)
        &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;        (7 ÷ 4 = 1 r 3 )                                             
        3.0      (0 is added in order to make 3 divisible by 4; the 0 is accounted for by adding a decimal point in the quotient.)
        &lt;u&gt;2.8&lt;/u&gt;      (7 &amp;times; 4 = 28)
          20     (an additional zero is brought down)
          &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;     (5 &amp;times; 4 = 20)
           0

In this example, the decimal part of the result is calculated by continuing the process beyond the units digit, "bringing down" zeros as being the decimal part of the dividend.

This example also illustrates that, at the beginning of the process, a step that produces a zero can be omitted.  Since the first digit 1 is less than the divisor 4, the first step is instead performed on the first two digits 12.  Similarly, if the divisor were 13, one would perform the first step on 127 rather than 12 or 1.

===Basic procedure for long division of ''n'' ÷ ''m''===

# Find the location of all decimal points in the dividend ''n'' and divisor ''m''.
# If necessary, simplify the long division problem by moving the decimals of the divisor and dividend by the same number of decimal places, to the right, (or to the left) so that the decimal of the divisor is to the right of the last digit.
# When doing long division, keep the numbers lined up straight from top to bottom under the tableau.
# After each step, be sure the remainder for that step is less than the divisor. If it is not, there are three possible problems: the multiplication is wrong, the subtraction is wrong, or a greater quotient is needed.
# In the end, the remainder, ''r'', is added to the growing quotient as a [[fraction (mathematics)|fraction]],&amp;nbsp;''r''/''m''.

===Example with multi-digit divisor===

[[Image:LongDivisionAnimated.gif]]

A divisor of any number of digits can be used. In this example, 1260257 is to be divided by 37. First the problem is set up as follows:

        &lt;u&gt;       &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257

Digits of the number 1260257 are taken until a number greater than or equal to 37 occurs. So 1 and 12 are less than 37, but 126 is greater. Next, the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 126 is computed. So 3 &amp;times; 37 = 111 &lt; 126, but 4 &amp;times; 37 &gt; 126. The multiple 111 is written underneath the 126 and the 3 is written on the top where the solution will appear:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        111

Note carefully which place-value column these digits are written into. The 3 in the quotient goes in the same column (ten-thousands place) as the 6 in the dividend 1260257, which is the same column as the last digit of 111.

The 111 is then subtracted from the line above, ignoring all digits to the right:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         15

Now the digit from the next smaller place value of the dividend is copied down appended to the result 15:

        &lt;u&gt;  3    &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150

The process repeats: the greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 150 is subtracted. This is 148 = 4 &amp;times; 37, so a 4 is added to the solution line. Then the result of the subtraction is extended by another digit taken from the dividend:

        &lt;u&gt;  34   &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           22

The greatest multiple of 37 less than or equal to 22 is 0 &amp;times; 37 = 0. Subtracting 0 from 22 gives 22, we often don't write the subtraction step. Instead, we simply take another digit from the dividend:

        &lt;u&gt;  340  &lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           225

The process is repeated until 37 divides the last line exactly:

        &lt;u&gt;  34061&lt;/u&gt;
     37)1260257
        &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;
         150
         &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
           225
           &lt;u&gt;222&lt;/u&gt;
             37

===Mixed mode long division===
For non-decimal currencies (such as the British [[£sd]] system before 1971) and measures (such as [[avoirdupois]]) '''mixed mode''' division must be used.  Consider dividing 50 miles 600 yards into 37 pieces:

           mi -     yd -   ft -   in
       &lt;u&gt;     1 -    634      1      9 r. 15"&lt;/u&gt;
     37)   50 -    600 -    0 -    0
           &lt;u&gt;37&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;22880&lt;/u&gt;     &lt;u&gt;66&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;348&lt;/u&gt;
        &lt;u&gt;   13&lt;/u&gt;    23480     66    348
        17600    &lt;u&gt;222&lt;/u&gt;       &lt;u&gt;37&lt;/u&gt;    &lt;u&gt;333&lt;/u&gt;
        &lt;u&gt; 5280&lt;/u&gt;     128      &lt;u&gt;29&lt;/u&gt;     15
        22880     &lt;u&gt;111&lt;/u&gt;     348     &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;
        &lt;nowiki&gt;=====&lt;/nowiki&gt;      170    &lt;nowiki&gt;===&lt;/nowiki&gt;
                   &lt;u&gt;148&lt;/u&gt;
                    &lt;u&gt;22&lt;/u&gt;
                    66
                    &lt;nowiki&gt;==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Each of the four columns is worked in turn.  Starting with the miles: 50/37 = 1 remainder 13.  No further division is
possible, so perform a long multiplication by 1,760 to convert miles to yards, the result is 22,880 yards.  Carry this to the top of the yards column and add it to the 600 yards in the dividend giving 23,480.  Long division of 23,480 / 37 now proceeds as normal yielding 634 with remainder 22.  The remainder is multiplied by 3 to get feet and carried up to the feet column.  Long division of the feet gives 1 remainder 29 which is then multiplied by twelve to get 348 inches.  Long division continues with the final remainder of 15 inches being shown on the result line.

===Non-decimal radix===
The same method and layout can be used for, e.g., [[Binary number|binary]], [[octal]] and [[hexadecimal]] numeral systems. For example, a hexadecimal address range of 0xf412df divided into 0x12 parts is:

        &lt;u&gt;  0d8f45&lt;/u&gt; r. 5
     12 ) f412df
          &lt;u&gt;ea&lt;/u&gt;
           a1
           &lt;u&gt;90&lt;/u&gt;
           112
           &lt;u&gt;10e&lt;/u&gt;
             4d
             &lt;u&gt;48&lt;/u&gt;
              5f
              &lt;u&gt;5a&lt;/u&gt;
               5
Calculation within the binary number system is more immediate, because each digit in the course can only be 1 or 0:

         &lt;u&gt;      1110&lt;/u&gt; r. 11
     1101) 10111001
            &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
            10100
             &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
              1110
              &lt;u&gt;1101&lt;/u&gt;
                 11

===Interpretation of decimal results===

When the quotient is not an integer and the division process is extended beyond the decimal point, one of two things can happen. (1) The process can terminate, which means that a remainder of 0 is reached; or (2) a remainder could be reached that is identical to a previous remainder that occurred after the decimal points were written. In the latter case, continuing the process would be pointless, because from that point onward the same sequence of digits would appear in the quotient over and over. So a bar is drawn over the repeating sequence to indicate that it repeats forever.

==Notation in non-English-speaking countries==
China, Japan, Korea use the same notation as English-speaking nations including India. Elsewhere, the same general principles are used, but the figures are often arranged differently.

===Latin America===
In [[Latin America]] (except [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]]), the calculation is almost exactly the same, but is written down differently as shown below with the same two examples used above. Usually the quotient is written under a bar drawn under the divisor. A long vertical line is sometimes drawn to the right of the calculations.

      500 ÷ 4 =  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;   (Explanations) 
      &lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;                ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; =  4)
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0               ( 5 -  4 =  &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;               ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; =  8)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0              (10 -  8 =  &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;              ( 4 &amp;times;  &lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; = 20)
        0              (20 - 20 =  0)

and

      127 ÷ 4 = 31.75
      &lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt;                             
        30      (a 0 is added in order to make 3 divisible by 4; the 0 is accounted for by adding a decimal point in the quotient)
        &lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;      (7 &amp;times; 4 = 28)
         20     (an additional zero is added)
         &lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;     (5 &amp;times; 4 = 20)
           0
In [[Mexico]], the US notation is used, except that only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally, as shown below:

     &lt;u&gt; &lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: green;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;     (Explanations)
    4)500
      &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;0      ( 5 -  4 = &lt;span style="color: darkorange;"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;)
       &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;0     (10 -  8 = &lt;span style="color: darkcyan;"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;)
        0     (20 - 20 = 0)

In [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]], [[Venezuela]], [[Uruguay]], [[Quebec]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]], the European notation (see below) is used, except that the quotient is not separated by a vertical line, as shown below:

     127|&lt;u&gt;4    &lt;/u&gt;
    −&lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt; 31,75
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

Same procedure applies in [[Mexico]] and [[Argentina]], only the result of the subtraction is annotated and the calculation is done mentally.

===Eurasia===
In Spain, Italy, France, Portugal, Lithuania, Romania, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia, the divisor is to the right of the dividend, and separated by a vertical bar. The division also occurs in the column, but the quotient (result) is written below the divider, and separated by the horizontal line. The same method is used in Iran and Mongolia.

     127|&lt;u&gt;4    &lt;/u&gt;
    −&lt;u&gt;124&lt;/u&gt;|31,75
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

In Cyprus, as well as in France, a long vertical bar separates the dividend and subsequent subtractions from the quotient and divisor, as in the [[:fr:Poser une division#Méthode classique|example]] below of 6359 divided by 17, which is 374 with a remainder of 1.

{|border ="0" cellspacing = "0"

|}

Decimal numbers are not divided directly, the dividend and divisor are multiplied by a power of ten so that the division involves two whole numbers. Therefore, if one were dividing 12,7 by 0,4 (commas being used instead of decimal points), the dividend and divisor would first be changed to 127 and 4, and then the division would proceed as above.

In [[Austria]], [[Germany]] and [[Switzerland]], the notational form of a normal equation is used. &lt;dividend&gt; : &lt;divisor&gt; = &lt;quotient&gt;, with the colon ":" denoting a binary infix symbol for the division operator (analogous to "/" or "÷"). In these regions the decimal separator is written as a comma. (cf. first section of Latin American countries above, where it's done virtually the same way):

     127 : 4 = 31,75
    −&lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
      07
      −&lt;u&gt;4&lt;/u&gt;
       30
      −&lt;u&gt;28&lt;/u&gt;
        20
       −&lt;u&gt;20&lt;/u&gt;
         0

The same notation is adopted in [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Poland]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Hungary]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Vietnam]] and in [[Serbia]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the following notation is used:

    12 / 135 \ 11,25
         &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
          15
          &lt;u&gt;12&lt;/u&gt;
           30
           &lt;u&gt;24&lt;/u&gt;
            60
            &lt;u&gt;60&lt;/u&gt;
             0

==Generalizations==

=== Rational numbers ===
Long division of integers can easily be extended to include non-integer dividends, as long as they are [[rational number|rational]]. This is because every rational number has a [[recurring decimal]] expansion. The procedure can also be extended to include divisors which have a finite or terminating [[decimal]] expansion (i.e. [[decimal fraction]]s). In this case the procedure involves multiplying the divisor and dividend by the appropriate power of ten so that the new divisor is an integer&amp;nbsp;– taking advantage of the fact that ''a''&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;''b'' = (''ca'')&amp;nbsp;÷&amp;nbsp;(''cb'')&amp;nbsp;–  and then proceeding as above.

===Polynomials===
A generalised version of this method called [[polynomial long division]] is also used for dividing [[polynomial]]s (sometimes using a shorthand version called [[synthetic division]]).

'''Marfa Inofuentes Pérez''' (1969–2015) was an [[Afro-Bolivian]] activist involved in the Constitutional reform movement to recognize black Bolivians as an ethnic minority in the country. After achieving the goal for Afro-Bolivians to be protected under the law, she served as the head the Ministry of Gender and was appointed deputy mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz.

==Early life==
Marfa Inofuentes Pérez was born in 1969 in [[La Paz]], Bolivia, one of three children of Benjamín Inofuentes.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|Insumisos Latinoamericanos|n.d.|p=4}} Her father was born in Tocaña, a village in the [[Bolivian Yungas|Bolivian Yungas Region]], where the majority of the country's of Afro-Bolivians originated. After completion of her secondary studies, Inofuentes enrolled in the [[Universidad Mayor de San Andrés]], studying sociology and law.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|Insumisos Latinoamericanos|n.d.|pp=4–5}}

==Career==
In 1990 Inofuentes joined the Afro-Bolivian Saya Cultural Movement ({{lang-es|Movimiento Cultural Saya Afroboliviana (MCSA)}}), a group organized to preserve the cultural traditions of black Bolivians, particularly the artform of ''[[Saya (artform)|saya]]'', by increasing their visibility and acceptance in the wider society. She participated in a public performance of saya in Tocaña in 1990, one of the first times that the public was allowed to witness the ceremonies.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} 

In 2001, after the [[World Conference against Racism 2001|World Conference against Racism]], Inofuentes and Jorge Medina, co-founded the Afro-Bolivian Center for Community Development ({{lang-es|Centro Afroboliviano para el Desarrollo Integral y Comunitario (CADIC)}}) to advocate for government recognition of Bolivia's black population.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}}{{sfn|''Erbol Digital''|2015}} According to a 1997 poll by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]], which included [[Mónica Rey Gutiérrez]], another Afro-Bolivian activist, the population numbered around 20,000 people,{{sfn|Murphy|2008}}{{sfn|Busdiecker|2016}} but the previous census in 2001 had no category except "other" to survey the actual size of the ethnic group. She believed that lack of state recognition as a minority, and inability to determine the size of the population, furthered marginalization of Afro-Bolivians, as there were no protections in law for discrimination or racial violence.{{sfn|Murphy|2008}}

Traveling widely, Inofuentes represented Bolivia's black women at meetings of the [[Organization of Ibero-American States]] in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and the United States. She was also a member of the feminist organization the Network of Caribbean Latin American and African Diaspora Women ({{lang-es|Red de Mujeres del Caribe, de América Latina y la Diáspora Africana (RMCALDA)}}).{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} 

In 2006, after the election of President [[Evo Morales]], lawmakers met in [[Sucre]] to rewrite the [[Constitution of Bolivia|Constitution]]. Inofuentes and other black activists lobbied all of the political parties, pressing for recognition as an ethnic group.{{sfn|Murphy|2008}} As one of the main activists involved in the [[Bolivian Constitutional Assembly election, 2006|Bolivian Constitutional Assembly]], Inofuentes argued for the addition of articles to protect the civil rights of Afro-Bolivians,{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} including language that recognized the population and protected their culture with the same provisions afforded to indigenous people and other intercultural minorities.{{sfn|Martínez Mita|2008|p=67}} Gaining the concessions desired, in 2009, Afro-Bolivians gained constitutional protection and recognition, after the [[Bolivian constitutional referendum, 2009|Bolivian constitutional referendum]] passed.{{sfn|Martínez Mita|2008|p=69}}{{sfn|Schipani|2011}} Her activism led to her being appointed to head the Ministry of Gender.{{sfn|Cajías de la Vega|Cronin|2016}} In 2010, she was appointed as Deputy Mayor of the Peripheral Macrodistrict of the Municipality of La Paz, but after one year, she developed health problems and entered into a coma from which she did not recover.{{sfn|Cuiza|2015}}

==Death and legacy==
Inofuentes died on 4 March 2015 at the Obrero Hospital in La Paz and is most remembered for her activism to gain recognition for the cultural traditions and identity of Afro-Bolivians.{{sfn|Cuiza|2015}}{{sfn|Ortega|2015}}

'''''Masterbook''''' is a [[generic role-playing game]] that was created by [[West End Games]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pigames.net/store/default.php?cPath=107 Pigames.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://index.rpg.net/display-search.phtml?key=system&amp;value=MasterBook RPG.net]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a follow-up to the multi-genre role-playing game ''[[Torg]]'' and the science fiction game ''[[Shatterzone]]'', which used a modified version of the ''Torg'' system. As of January 2011, it is published by [[Precis Intermedia Gaming]].

Like ''Torg'', the ''Masterbook'' system utilized two complementary forms of in-game conflict resolution: a unified dice mechanic, which was based on a roll of two [[polyhedral dice|ten-sided dice]], and a game-specific deck of cards (the MasterDeck, similar to the Drama Deck in ''Torg'') that influenced random number generation, character actions, and the game's plot. ''Masterbook'' was used for several licensed properties, most notably ''[[The World of Indiana Jones]]'' (1994), ''[[Necroscope|The World of Necroscope]]'' (1995), ''[[World of Aden: Thunderscape|The World of Aden]]'' (1996), ''[[Species (film)|The World of Species]]'' (1995), ''[[Tales from the Crypt (TV series)#In other media|The World of Tales from the Crypt]]'' (1996), and ''[[Tank Girl|The World of Tank Girl]]'' (1995). It was also used for unique settings such as ''[[The World of Bloodshadows]]'' (1994).

The system was, ultimately, a commercial failure despite these licenses, thanks to a combination of factors, including the high level of detail in game mechanics, the unusual synthesis of dice- and card-based conflict resolution, and the low level of [[player character]] power and effect even in fantastic or pulp-style settings such as ''Indiana Jones''. This last factor was in direct contrast to ''Torg'', which helped to isolate many fans of the game's predecessor and drive them to play games whose systems were more directly accommodating to their preferred style of gameplay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4099">'''New rhetorics''' is an [[interdisciplinary field]]&lt;ref name="Andreea"&gt;Andreea Deciu Ritivoi, ''Rhetorics: New Rhetorics'', in Wolfgang Donsbach (ed.), ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; approaching for the broadening of [[classical rhetorics|classical rhetorical canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Per example in ''Defining the New Rhetoric'' and ''Professing the New Rhetoric''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"&gt;New and Alternative Rhetorics - William DeGenaro, ''Who says?: working-class rhetoric, class consciousness, and community'', Univ of Pittsburgh Press, 2007, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The New Rhetoric is a result of various efforts of bringing back rhetorics from the marginal status&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; it attained by its image and 'negative connotations' of "political lies, corporate spin, long list of Greek and Roman terms for patterns of expression no one knowingly uses, purple prose, boiler-plate arrangement schemas, unimaginative reproductions of bullshit and so on"&lt;ref name="George"&gt;George Pullman, ''Rhetorically Speaking, What’s New?'', Georgia State University, What is the New Rhetoric? conference&lt;/ref&gt; if not to its previous place of a discipline "associated with social and intellectual prestige"&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; then at least to the level of the other contemporary fields in the social, cultural and linguistic studies. Notoriously the field emerged after the work of [[Chaïm Perelman]] and [[Lucille Olbrechts-Tyteca]] in their book ''The New Rhetoric'' (1969)&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas M. Carr, Jr. ''Some Consequences of The New Rhetoric: A Critical Study'', Argumentation 7: 475-479, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; but both the notion and the idea for the need of "new" rhetoric, different from the "old" one can be traced to the works of [[Kenneth Burke]] - ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' (1950) and ''Rhetoric - Old and New'' (1967),.&lt;ref&gt;Zachary M. White, [https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/dissertations/AAI3113888/ Re-examining Kenneth Burke on "identification" in the "new" rhetoric],  dissertation @ Purdue University&lt;/ref&gt;

What helped the emergence of New rhetoric was the ideas of the [[epistemic]] status of rhetoric, the notion of a clearly definable rhetorical core and other.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt;

New rhetorics attempts to preserve the original field but it also has tense relationship with it.&lt;ref name="Andreea"/&gt; For example, New Rhetoric attempts to break up with the [[Formalism (philosophy)|formalistic]] and [[logocentric]] (i.e. [[patriarchal]]) [[Neo-Aristotelian]] analysis in favour of interplay between [[Text (literary theory)|text]] and [[Context (language use)|context]], but according to DeGenaro it does not succeed to place itself outside the "Western-patriarchal" with being unable to departure from "elite backgrounds and scopes of study"&lt;ref name="DeGenaro"/&gt; to a diversity of voices, topics, etc. This probably makes New Rhetoric rather a ground for the '''postmodern rhetoric'''&lt;ref&gt;Not the rhetoric of [[postmodernism]] but postmodern theory and analysis in rhetorics.&lt;/ref&gt; which "puts into question the identities of the speaker, the audience, and the messages that pass between them"&lt;ref name="Gary1"&gt;Gary E. Aylesworth, ''Rhetoric, Postmodern'' ''The International Encyclopedia of Communication'', {{doi|10.1111/b.9781405131995.2008.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with evaluating the [[intersubjective]] philosophy&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;Barry Brummett, ''Some Implications of "Process" or "Intersubjectivity": Postmodern Rhetoric'', Philosophy &amp; Rhetoric, Penn State University Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; because of the inherently accepted in the [[postmodern philosophy|postmodernistic philosophy]] idea that "differences cannot be overcome, in Hegelian fashion, by cancelling them under a higher-order synthesis, but must be eroded or defaced in the course of traversing them."&lt;ref name="Gary2"&gt;Gary Aylesworth, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#8 Postmodernism]'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''' O. J. Simpson murder case''' (officially titled '''''People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson''''') was a [[criminal trial]] held at the [[Los Angeles County Superior Court]] in which former [[National Football League]] (NFL) player, broadcaster, and actor [[O. J. Simpson]] was tried on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994, deaths of his ex-wife, [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], and her friend, [[Ron Goldman]]. On the morning of June 13, 1994, they were found stabbed to death outside Brown's [[condominium]] in the [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] area of Los Angeles. Simpson was a [[person of interest]] in their murders. He did not turn himself in, and on June 17 he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 [[Ford Bronco]] [[SUV]] owned and driven by [[Al Cowlings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html|title=The Fugitive: Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested|last=Mydans|first=Seth|date=18 June 1994|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=4 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; TV stations interrupted coverage of the [[1994 NBA Finals]] to broadcast the incident live.

The trial, often characterized as the [[trial of the century]] because of its international publicity similar to that of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], spanned eleven months, from the [[Juror's oath|jury's swearing-in]] on November 9, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=12 Simpson Jurors Are Sworn In : Trial: The eight-woman, four-man panel is predominantly black.

Simpson was represented by a very high-profile defense team, also referred to as the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]", which was initially led by [[Robert Shapiro (lawyer)|Robert Shapiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Lawyer for O.

The team also included [[F. Lee Bailey]], [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Robert Kardashian]], [[Shawn Holley]], [[Carl E. Douglas]], and [[Gerald Uelmen]]. [[Barry Scheck]] and [[Peter Neufeld]] were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence.

Deputy [[District Attorney]]s [[Marcia Clark]] and [[Christopher Darden]] believed they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jurors that there was reason to doubt the [[DNA]] evidence provided by the State, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news |title=Simpson Team Taking Aim at DNA Laboratory |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= September 7, 1994|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/07/us/simpson-team-taking-aim-at-dna-laboratory.html |accessdate=December 5, 2008 | first=Barry | last=Meier}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[reasonable doubt]] theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits.&lt;ref name="usa today"&gt;{{cite news |title=List of the evidence in the O.

Simpson's celebrity status, racial issues, and the lengthy [[televised trial]] riveted national attention. By the end of the trial, national surveys showed dramatic differences in the assessment of Simpson's guilt or innocence between black and white Americans.&lt;ref name="usa today4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Race factor tilts the scales of public opinion |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns212.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediate reaction to the verdict was notable for its division along racial lines: a poll of [[Los Angeles County]] residents showed that most African Americans there felt that justice had been served by the "not guilty" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos expressed an opinion that it had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Decker|first1=Cathleen|title=THE TIMES POLL : Most in County Disagree With Simpson Verdicts|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-08/news/mn-54801_1_times-poll|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the trial, the Brown and Goldman families filed a [[civil lawsuit]] against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jury unanimous: Simpson is liable|publisher=CNN |date=February 4, 1997|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9702/04/simpson.verdict1/index.html|accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million  (${{Inflation|US|33.5|1997|r=1}}&amp;nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars), but have received only a small portion of that.

Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.

Detectives went to Simpson's Brentwood estate to inform him that Nicole had been murdered. Detective [[Mark Fuhrman]] climbed over an external wall and unlocked the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter as well. The detectives argued that they entered without a [[search warrant]] because of exigent circumstances – specifically, in this case, out of fear that Simpson might have been injured also. Simpson was not present when the detectives arrived early that morning; he had taken a flight to [[Chicago]] late the previous night. Detectives briefly interviewed [[Kato Kaelin]], who was staying in Simpson's guest house. In a walk-around of the premises, Fuhrman discovered a second bloody glove; it was later determined to be the match of the glove found at the murder scene. Through DNA testing, the blood on this one was determined to have come from both victims. This, together with other evidence collected at both scenes, was determined to be [[probable cause]] to issue an [[arrest warrant]] for Simpson.

Simpson, while waiting in his bedroom, invited longtime friend and police officer Ron Shipp for a private discussion; Simpson jokingly told him, "To be honest, Shipp, I've had some dreams about killing her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-02-02/news/mn-27325_1_nicole-simpson|title=Simpson Dreamed of Killing, Witness Says: Courts: Ex-officer says he is a longtime friend of the defendant.

Lawyers convinced the LAPD to allow Simpson to turn himself in at 11&amp;nbsp;a.m. on June 17, 1994,{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=87}} although the double murder charge meant that no [[bail]] would be set and a [[first-degree murder]] conviction could result in a [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Penal Code Sections 187–199 |publisher=Legislative Counsel of California |url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512011845/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=187-199 |archivedate=May 12, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson at the police station, but he did not arrive.

News helicopters searched the Los Angeles highway system for Simpson's white [[Ford Bronco]].{{r|adams20160617}} At around 6:20&amp;nbsp;p.m., a motorist in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] notified police after seeing Simpson riding in the Bronco, driven by his longtime friend [[Al Cowlings|Al "A.C." Cowlings]]. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m., police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405]]. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson was in the back seat of the vehicle and had a gun to his own head.&lt;ref name="30for30"/&gt; The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|pp=87–88}} at {{convert|35|mph|km/h}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Simpson Case: The Fugitive; Simpson Is Charged, Chased, Arrested | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/18/us/the-simpson-case-the-fugitive-simpson-is-charged-chased-arrested.html| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date = June 18, 1994| last =Mydans| first =Seth| accessdate =November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 20 police cars following her in the chase.&lt;ref name="jet19940704" /&gt;

[[University of Southern California|USC]] sports announcer Peter Arbogast and station producer Kash Limbach contacted former [[USC Trojans football|USC football]] coach [[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]] to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing [[suicide]];{{sfn|Bailey|Rabe|2008|p=88}} "My God, we love you, Juice. Just pull over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life", he promised.&lt;ref name="adams20160617"/&gt;

LAPD detective Tom Lange, who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's [[cell phone]] number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to "throw the gun out [of] the window" for the sake of his mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was "the only one who deserved to get hurt" and was "just gonna go with Nicole."

==Trial==
[[File:Judge Lance Ito October 1995 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial]]
On June 20, Simpson was [[arraignment|arraigned]] and pleaded not guilty to both murders. As expected, the presiding judge ordered that Simpson be held without bail. The following day, a [[grand jury]] was called to determine whether to [[indictment|indict]] him for the two murders. Two days later, on June 23, the grand jury was dismissed as a result of excessive media coverage, which could have influenced its neutrality. Jill Shively, a Brentwood resident who testified that she saw Simpson speeding away from the area of Nicole's house on the night of the murders, told the grand jury that the Bronco almost collided with a [[Nissan]] at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Another grand jury witness, a cutlery salesman named Jose Camacho, said he had sold Simpson a 15-inch (380&amp;nbsp; mm) German-made knife, similar to the murder weapon, three weeks before the killings.&lt;ref name="true tv"/&gt; Shively and Camacho were not presented by the [[prosecution]] at the criminal trial because they had sold their stories to the tabloid press.&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; Shively had talked to the television show ''[[Hard Copy]]'' for $5,000,&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; while Camacho sold his story to the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' for $12,500.

Rather than a grand jury hearing, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether or not to bring Simpson to trial. This was a minor victory for Simpson's lawyers because it would give them access to evidence as it was being presented by the prosecution in contrast to the procedure in a grand jury hearing. After a week-long court hearing, [[California Superior Court]] Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7 that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders. At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson, breaking a courtroom practice that says the accused may plead using only the words "guilty" or "not guilty," firmly stated: "Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty."

The prosecution decided not to seek the death penalty and instead sought a [[life sentence]]. Deputy District Attorney [[Marcia Clark]] was designated as the lead prosecutor. Deputy District Attorney [[Christopher Darden]] became Clark's co-counsel. Simpson wanted a [[speedy trial]], and the defence and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases. In October 1994, Judge [[Lance Ito]] started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had to fill out a 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, twelve jurors were seated with twelve alternates.

The trial began on January 24, 1995, and was televised by [[truTV|Court TV]], and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days. Darden argued that Simpson killed his ex-wife in a jealous rage; the prosecution opened its case by playing a 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her, and he could be heard yelling at her in the background. Other material related to domestic violence was presented including another 9-1-1 phone call that Nicole made on October 25, 1993 expressing the same thing and Simpson also could be be heard shouting in the background, less than eight months before the murders. The prosecution also presented dozens of [[expert witness]]es to place Simpson at the scene of the crime, on subjects ranging from [[DNA profiling]] to blood and shoeprint analysis.

During the opening weeks of the trial, the prosecution presented evidence that Simpson had a history of physically abusing Nicole. Simpson's lawyer [[Alan Dershowitz]] argued that only a tiny fraction of women who are abused by their spouses are murdered. Within days after the start of the trial, lawyers and those viewing the trial from a single closed-circuit TV camera in the courtroom saw an emerging pattern: continual and countless interruptions with objections from both sides of the courtroom, as well as one [[sidebar (law)|sidebar]] conference after another with the judge, beyond earshot of the unseen jury located just below and out of the camera's frame.

==Jury selection and revolt==
According to media reports, Clark thought that women, regardless of race, would sympathize with the domestic violence aspect of the case and connect with her personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that women generally were more likely to acquit than men, and that jurors did not respond well to Clark's combative style of [[litigation]]. The defense also speculated that black women would not be as sympathetic as white women to the victim, who was white, because of tensions about [[interracial marriage]]s. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40% white, 28% black, 17% Hispanic, and 15% Asian, the final jury for the trial had ten women and two men, of which there were nine blacks, two whites, and one Hispanic.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/simpson/jurypage.html |title=The O.

At the start of trial, twelve jurors and twelve alternates were selected from a pool of 250 potential jurors. Over the course of the trial ten were dismissed for a wide variety of reasons. Only four of the original jurors remained on the final panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chatsports.com/top-news/a/who-was-oj-simpson-trial-jury-meet-12-people-who-found-him-not-guilty-26948|title=Who Was On The O.J.

After being [[Jury sequestration|sequestered]] for 101 days, thirteen of the eighteen jurors refused to enter the courtroom until they were granted a meeting with Judge Ito. Eventually, the jury returned with thirteen members wearing black or dark-colored clothing in what was described as a "funeral procession."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-04-22/news/9504220188_1_jurors-murder-trial-jury|title=Simpson Jury Mutiny Casts Doubt On Trial|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1995/04/22/thirteen-simpson-jurors-stage-revolt/f0b8a434-5491-49bb-be5e-e1c082250cfa/|title=Thirteen Simpson Jurors Stage Revolt|first1=Nell|last1=Henderson|first2=Nell|last2=Henderson|date=April 22, 1995|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017|via=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosecution case==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
The prosecution believed it had a strong case despite the lack of known witnesses to the crime and the failure to recover the murder weapon.{{sfn|Darden|1996}} Clark's case was supported by DNA evidence, and she expected a conviction. From the physical evidence that was collected, the prosecution claimed that Simpson drove to Brown's house on the evening of June 12 with the intention of killing her. They maintained that Brown had put their two children to bed and was getting ready to go to bed herself when she opened the front door of her house after either responding to a knock on the front door or hearing a noise outside. Simpson allegedly grabbed her before she could scream and attacked her with a knife. Forensic evidence from the [[Los Angeles County]] [[coroner]] alleged that Goldman arrived at the front gate to the townhouse sometime during the assault, and the assailant apparently attacked him and stabbed him repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while restraining him with an arm [[chokehold]]. Brown was found lying face down when authorities arrived at the crime scene. According to the prosecution's account, after Simpson had finished with Goldman, he pulled Brown's head back using her hair, put his foot on her back, and slit her throat with the knife, severing her [[carotid artery]].&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; They argued further that Simpson left a "trail of blood" from the condo to the alley behind it; there was also testimony that three drops of Simpson's blood were found on the driveway near the gate to his house on Rockingham Drive.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Proving the Case: The Science of DNA: DNA Evidence in the O.J.

According to the prosecution, Simpson was last seen in public at 9:36&amp;nbsp;p.m. that evening when he returned to the front gate of his house with Kaelin, a bit-part actor and family friend who had been given the use of a guest house on Simpson's estate. Simpson was not seen again until 10:54&amp;nbsp;p.m. – an hour and eighteen minutes later – when he came out of the front door of his house to a waiting [[limousine]] he had hired to take him to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] to fly to a [[Hertz]] convention in Chicago. The defense and prosecution both agreed that the murders took place between 10:15 and 10:40&amp;nbsp;p.m., with the prosecution alleging that Simpson had driven his Bronco during the required five minutes to and from the murder scene. They presented a witness in the vicinity of Bundy Drive who saw a car similar to Simpson's Bronco speeding away from the area at 10:35&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Limousine driver Allan Park testified that he arrived at Simpson's estate at 10:24&amp;nbsp;p.m. Driving past the Rockingham gate, he did not see Simpson's Bronco parked at the curb. Park testified that he had been looking for and had seen the house number, and the prosecution presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jared Grimmer |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/parktest.html |title=Testimony of limo driver Allan Park in the O.

Meanwhile, Kaelin was in his guest house and on the telephone to his friend, Rachel Ferrara. Park parked opposite the Ashford Street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the [[intercom]] at 10:40, getting no response. Park got out of the limo and looked through the Ashford gate and saw that the house was dark with no lights on, except for a dim light coming from one of the second floor windows, which was Simpson's bedroom. While smoking a cigarette, Park made a series of phone calls from his cellular to the [[pager]] of his boss, Dale St. John, and then to Park's home, trying to get St. John's home phone number from his mother in an attempt to get the phone number for Simpson's house. At approximately 10:50, Kaelin (who was still on the phone to Ferrara) heard three thumps against the outside wall of his guest house. Kaelin hung up the phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises, but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property and saw Park's limo outside the Ashford gate.

At the same time Park saw Kaelin come from the back of the property to the front, he testified that directly behind Kaelin a short distance away that he saw "a tall black man" of Simpson's height and build enter the front door of the house from the driveway area, after which lights were turned on and Simpson finally answered Park's call.{{Citation needed | reason = Reliable source needed for the whole sentence |date=June 2017}} Simpson explained that he had overslept and would be at the front gate soon. Kaelin opened the Ashford gate to let Park drive the limo onto the estate grounds, and Simpson came out of his house through the front door a few minutes later. Both Kaelin and Park helped Simpson put his belongings (which were already outside the front door when Park drove up to the front of Simpson's house) into the trunk of the limo for the ride to the airport. Both Kaelin and Park remarked in their testimony that Simpson looked agitated. But other witnesses, including the ticket clerk at LAX who checked Simpson onto the plane and a flight attendant, said that Simpson looked and acted perfectly normal. Conflicting testimony such as this was to be a recurring theme throughout the trial.

Simpson's initial claim that he was asleep at the time of the murders was refuted by several different accounts. According to defense lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]], Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential [[alibi]] witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house at the time of the murders. However, Lopez's account, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense [[cross-examination]] by Clark, when she was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's Bronco outside his house.

The defense tried to convince the jury that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders, saying that Goldman was a fit young man who put up a fierce struggle against his assailant. Simpson was a 46-year-old former professional football player with chronic [[arthritis]], and had scars on his knees from old football injuries. However, Clark produced into evidence an exercise video that Simpson made a few months before the murders titled ''O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness For Men,'' which showed that, despite some physical conditions and limitations, Simpson was anything but frail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1995-07-19/news/9507190140_1_simpson-videotape-huizenga|title=Exercise Video Shows O.J.

The prosecution called Brown's sister, Denise, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. The prosecution then called Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of the Mezzaluna restaurant where Brown ate on the night she was murdered. Crawford recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37&amp;nbsp;p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them and put them in a white envelope. Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. after his shift, taking the glasses to drop them off at Brown's house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jodi Enda|title=Dog Led Neighbors To Body The Akita Took The Couple To The Slain Nicole Simpson.

Brown's neighbor, [[Pablo Fenjves]], testified about hearing a "very distinctive barking" and "plaintive wail" of a dog at around ten to fifteen minutes after 10:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. while he was at home watching the news on television. Eva Stein, another neighbor, testified about very loud and persistent barking, also at around 10:15&amp;nbsp;p.m., that kept her from going back to sleep. Neighbor Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., he noticed Brown's wandering and agitated [[Akita (dog)|Akita dog]] trailing its leash. He saw that it had bloody paws, but after examining it, he found the dog uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to a neighbor friend of his, Sukru Boztepe, before taking it into his home where it became more agitated. Boztepe took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that it tugged on its leash and led him to Brown's house. There he discovered Brown's dead body. Minutes later, Boztepe flagged down a passing patrol car.

Riske, the first officer at the crime scene, testified that he found a barefoot woman in a black dress lying face down in a puddle of blood on the walkway that led to the front door of her house. He next saw Goldman's body a short distance away, lying on its side beside a tree and off the walkway. Riske said he saw a white envelope, which was later found to contain the glasses left at the restaurant by Brown's mother. He also saw Goldman's beeper, a black leather glove, and a dark blue knit ski cap on the ground near the bodies. The front door of Brown's house was wide open, but there were no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. Nothing inside was out of the ordinary.

On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long motorcade traveled to Brentwood and the jurors, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and Judge Ito made a two-hour inspection of the crime scene. It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear [[handcuff]]s; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house.

Detective Ron Phillips testified that when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, he sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Lange testified that Brown was probably killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck down to the ground before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Lange, Cochran proposed two [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one or more drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted [[cocaine]] abuser. In the second hypothesis, Cochran suggested that "an assassin, or assassins," followed Goldman to Brown's house to kill him.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Evidence presented to the jury===
The prosecution offered [[circumstantial evidence]] to show Simpson's guilt.&lt;ref name="court tv 16"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/16.html|title=Week 16: May 8–12, 1995|date=June 5, 2004|publisher=[[Court TV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202233509/http://www.courttv.com/trials/ojsimpson/weekly/16.html|archivedate=February 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* DNA analysis of blood discovered on a pair of Simpson's socks found in his bedroom identified it as Brown's. The blood had DNA characteristics matched by approximately only one in 9.7&amp;nbsp;billion, with odds falling to one out of 21&amp;nbsp;billion when compiling results of testing done at the two separate DNA laboratories.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court tv 16"/&gt; Both socks had about twenty stains of blood.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; The blood made a similar pattern on both sides of the socks. Defense medical expert [[Henry Lee (forensic scientist)|Dr. Henry Lee]] of the Connecticut State Police Forensic Science Laboratory testified that the only way such a pattern could appear was if Simpson had a "hole" in his ankle, or a drop of blood was placed on the sock while it was not being worn. Lee also testified that the collection procedure of the socks could have caused contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Testimony of Dr. Henry Lee in the O.J.

* Several coins were found along with fresh blood drops behind Brown's [[condominium]], in the area where the cars were parked.
* DNA analysis of blood on a left-hand glove, found outside Brown's home, showed that it was a mixture of Simpson's, Brown's, and Goldman's blood. Although the glove was soaked in blood, there were no blood drops leading up to, or away from the glove. No other blood was found in the area of the glove except on the glove.&lt;ref name = "Evidence" /&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2016}}

* Officers found arrest records indicating that Simpson was charged in 1989 with beating Brown. Photos of Brown's bruised and battered face from that attack were shown to the court.
* Much of the incriminating evidence – bloody glove, bloody socks, blood in and on the Bronco – was discovered by LAPD Detective Mark Fuhrman. He was later charged with [[perjury]] for falsely claiming during the trial that he had not used the word "[[nigger]]" within ten years of the trial. Later during the trial, with the jury absent, he invoked the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] against [[self-incrimination]] when asked "did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?"&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html Simpson trial transcript] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070910032810/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/Simpson/transcript.html |date=September 10, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 interview, Dershowitz suggested that Detective Philip Vannatter {{ndash}} not Fuhrman {{ndash}} may have planted evidence on socks, based upon the presence of anti-coagulant in the blood discovered on the socks.&lt;ref name="FoxKelly2016-02-03"&gt;Fox News, The Kelly Files, 2016-02-03, Interview of Alan Dershowitz.&lt;/ref&gt; Dershowitz said that the jury may have concluded that if the bloody socks were fabricated by the police, then other evidence may have been fabricated as well.&lt;ref name=FoxKelly2016-02-03/&gt; F.B.I. expert testimony said that the defense exaggerated the significance of the presence of the anti-coagulant.&lt;ref name="FBI-Blood-socks"&gt;F.B.I.

* The bloody shoe prints at the crime scene were identified by [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] shoe expert William Bodziak as having been made by a pair of extremely rare and expensive [[Bruno Magli]] shoes; only 29 pairs of this style were sold in the U.S.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The large size 12 (305&amp;nbsp;mm) prints matched Simpson's shoe size.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; In the trial, Simpson's defense attorneys said the prosecution had no proof Simpson had ever bought such shoes. There were no witnesses who testified to selling Simpson the shoes and there wasn’t any receipts recovered that indicated he bought the shoes.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; But freelance photographer E.J. Flammer claimed to have found a photograph he had taken of Simpson in 1993 that appeared to show him wearing a pair of the shoes at a public event, which was later published in the ''National Enquirer.'' Simpson's defense team claimed that the photograph was doctored, but other pre-1994 photos appearing to show Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes were later discovered and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=O.J. feels the heat |journal=Time |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,985629-5,00.html |date=December 2, 1996 |accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these photos were shown until late in the trial and not during the "big shoe debate".&lt;ref&gt;trial transcript&lt;/ref&gt;
* Evidence collected by LAPD criminalist Dennis Fung was criticized by the defense. He admitted to "having missed a few drops of blood on a fence near the bodies;" on the stand he said that he "returned several weeks afterwards to collect them."&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
* Fung admitted that he had not used rubber gloves when collecting some of the evidence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; But the blood tested had no DNA from Fung, within published guidelines.
* Vannatter testified that he saw photographs of press personnel leaning on Simpson's Bronco before evidence was collected.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

===Evidence not presented to the jury===
* At the June 1994 grand jury hearing, Ross Cutlery provided store receipts indicating that Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305&amp;nbsp;mm) [[stiletto]] knife from salesman Jose Camacho six weeks before the murders. The knife was determined to be similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after discovering that Camacho had sold his story to the ''National Enquirer'' for $12,500.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; The knife was later collected from Simpson's residence by his attorneys; they presented it to Judge Ito and it was subsequently sealed in a manila envelope to be opened only if brought up at trial. This was not the murder weapon: tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating it had never been used. The police searched Simpson's estate three times and could not find this knife. Simpson told his attorneys exactly where it was in the house and it was promptly recovered.{{sfn|Schiller|Willwerth|1996}}
* Jill Shively testified to the 1994 grand jury that she saw a white Ford Bronco speeding away from Bundy Drive in such a hurry that it almost collided with another car at an intersection. She talked to the television show ''Hard Copy'' for $5,000, after which prosecutors declined to use her testimony at trial.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* A women's shelter, Sojourn, received a call from Brown four days prior to the murders; she said that she was afraid of her ex-husband, who she believed was [[stalking]] her. The prosecution did not present this information in court because they thought that Judge Ito would rule the evidence to be [[hearsay]]. In addition, friends and family indicated that Brown had consistently said that Simpson had been stalking her. Her friends Resnick and Cynthia Shahian said she was afraid because Simpson had told her he would kill her if he ever found her with another man.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* Former [[National Football League|NFL]] player and [[pastor]] [[Rosey Grier]] visited Simpson at the [[Men's Central Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]] in the days following the murders. A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to Judge Ito that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he "didn't mean to do it," after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was hearsay and could not be allowed in court.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;
* The events of the Bronco chase, and the materials in the Bronco including the cash, handgun, and disguise, were not presented to the jury. The prosecution did not cover Simpson's apparent suicide note and statement to the police.
* A few months before the 1994 murders, Simpson completed a [[film pilot]] for ''Frogmen'', an adventure series in which he starred. Although the prosecution investigated reports that Simpson, who played the leader of a group of former [[United States Navy SEALs|U.S. Navy SEALs]], received "a fair amount of" military training {{ndash}} including use of a knife {{ndash}} for ''Frogmen'', and holds a knife to the throat of a woman in one scene, it was not introduced as evidence during the trial.&lt;ref name="lowry20000508"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2000/may/08/entertainment/ca-27673 | title=The Saga of O.J.'s Last, Lost Pilot | accessdate=April 5, 2011 | author=Lowry, Brian | date=May 8, 2000 |work=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The testimony of Lopez was recorded on videotape, but not shown to the jury.

===DNA evidence===
Samples from bloody shoe prints leading away from the bodies and from the back gate of the condo were tested for DNA matches.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Initial [[polymerase chain reaction]] testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken from the crime scene (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples).&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse at the time of the murders. But defense expert [[Barry Scheck]] conducted an eight-day cross-examination questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theconversation.com/from-the-crime-scene-to-the-courtroom-the-journey-of-a-dna-sample-82250|title=From the crime scene to the courtroom: the journey of a DNA sample|last=Curtis|first=Caitlin|date=August 29, 2017|work=The Conversation|access-date=October 14, 2017|last2=Hereward|first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emerged during the cross-examination of Fung and the other laboratory scientists that LAPD scientist Andrea Mazzola (who collected blood samples from Simpson to compare with evidence from the crime scene) was a trainee who carried the vial of Simpson's blood around in her lab coat pocket for nearly a day before handing it over as an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Robin |date=April 28, 1995 |title=Criminalist Assailed At Trial Of O.J.

The prosecution argued that they had made the DNA evidence available to the defense for its own testing, and if the defense attorneys disagreed with the prosecution's tests, they could have conducted their own testing on the same samples. The defense had chosen not to accept the prosecution's offer.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

On May 16, Gary Sims, a [[California Department of Justice]] criminalist who helped establish their DNA laboratory, testified that a glove found at Simpson's house tested positive for a match of Goldman's blood.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt;

===Mark Fuhrman===
{{main|Mark Fuhrman}}
[[File:Mfuhr.jpg|thumb|upright|Mark Fuhrman in 2008]]
In March 1995, Fuhrman testified to driving over to Simpson's house to question him on the night of the murders. After getting no response when buzzing the intercom of the house, which appeared empty, he scaled one of the outer walls to enter the property. He found blood marks on the driveway of the house, as well as a black leather glove on the premises near the location of Kaelin's bungalow. It was later found to have the blood of both murder victims on it, as well as Simpson's, matched through DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

Despite an aggressive cross-examination by [[F. Lee Bailey]],&lt;ref name="usa today5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Some who helped shape the O.J. Simpson case |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns182.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuhrman denied on the stand that he was racist or had used the word "nigger" to describe black people in the ten years prior to his testimony.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt; However, a few months later, the defense played audio tapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word – 41 times, in total. The tapes had been made between 1985 and 1994 by a young [[North Carolina]] screenwriter named Laura McKinney, who had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a screenplay she was writing on police officers. The [[Fuhrman tapes]] became one of the cornerstones of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility.

With the jury absent, Fuhrman was called back to the witness stand by the defense to answer more questions about the discovery of the blood marks and leather glove that he found on Simpson's property. When questioned by attorney [[Gerald Uelmen]], Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side, invoked the Fifth Amendment to avoid self-incrimination and further questioning after his integrity was challenged. The prosecution told the jury in closing arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, but said that this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman's testimony resulted in his indictment on one count of perjury; he later pleaded no contest.

Fuhrman has stated that he is not a racist and apologized for his previous use of racist language.&lt;ref name=philly/&gt; Many of his [[Ethnic minority|minority]] former coworkers have expressed support for him.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-11-08/news/mn-771_1_mark-fuhrman|title=Co-Workers Paint Different Portrait of Mark Fuhrman : LAPD: In contrast to racist boasts on tapes, black, Latino colleagues describe a hard-working, unbiased cop.|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The glove===
One dark leather glove was found at the crime scene, with its match found near Kaelin's guest house behind Simpson's estate. Kaelin testified that he had heard "thumps in the night" in the same area around the guest house the night of the murder. Brown had bought Simpson two pairs of this type of glove in 1990. Both gloves, according to the prosecution, contained DNA evidence from Simpson, Brown and Goldman. The glove at Simpson's house also contained a long strand of blonde hair similar to Brown's.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

On June 15, 1995, Bailey goaded Darden into asking Simpson to put on the leather glove that was found at the scene of the crime. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try on the gloves because the glove had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman,&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; and frozen and unfrozen several times. The leather glove seemed too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the sanitary gloves he wore underneath.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; Uelmen came up with, and Cochran repeated, a quip he had used several times in relation to other points in his closing arguments: "If it doesn't fit, you must acquit". 

On June 22, 1995, Darden told Judge Ito of his concerns that Simpson "has [[arthritis]] and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands". However, this theory was debunked by Cochran who informed Judge Ito on the record the next day that [[Shawn Chapman]] contacted the Los Angeles County Jail doctor who confirmed Simpson was taking his medication every day and that the jail’s medical records verified this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=O.J. and the Gloves: What Really Happened |url=https://ojsimpson.co/o-j-and-the-gloves-what-really-happened/
|website=ojsimpson.co |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
He said Simpson “takes his medicine every day and that he has never at any time not taken his medicine for his [[rheumatoid arthritis]], sulfathiazole I think it's called, and that the records at the jail so indicate that. And I think that the record should be made clear in that regard. And we took the further statement, as I said, to talk to Dr. Johnson this morning who verifies that fact also. So I felt compelled to indicate that to the Court.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=June 23 1995 trial transcripts|url=https://simpson.walraven.org/jun23.html
|website=walraven.org|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prosecution also stated their belief that the glove shrank from having been soaked in blood and later testing.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; They presented a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of glove that was found at the crime scene.

Prosecutors claimed that the presence of Simpson's blood at the crime scene was the result of blood dripping from cuts on the middle finger of his left hand. Police had noted his wounds and asserted that these were suffered during the fatal attack on Goldman. However, the defense showed that none of the gloves retrieved at the crime scene had any cuts in them. Plus, both prosecution and defense witnesses testified that they did not see cuts or wounds of any kind on Simpson's hands in the hours after the murders took place. The defense alleged that Fuhrman may have planted the glove at Simpson's house after taking it from the crime scene. The analysis that found that the hair could be Brown's was not reliable.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt; The prosecution contended that the glove had not been moved. They noted that by the time Fuhrman had arrived at the Simpson home, the crime scene at Brown's home had already been combed over by several officers for almost two hours, and none had noticed a second glove at the scene. In his first round of testimony, Fuhrman answered "no" when asked by Bailey if he had planted any evidence at Simpson's house. In his second round of testimony after the tapes had been revealed, Fuhrman took the Fifth Amendment when asked the same question by Uelmen.

In May 2008, [[Mike Gilbert (sports agent)|Mike Gilbert]], one of Simpson's former sports agents, released his book ''How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder'', in which he revealed that the gloves did not
fit because, on his advice, Simpson had stopped taking his arthritis medicine, which made his hands swell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2012, Darden accused Cochran of [[False evidence|tampering]] with the glove before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/09/ex-prosecutor--oj-simpson-lawyer-tampered-with-glove/1|title=Ex-prosecutor: O.J.

Simpson lawyer tampered with glove|publisher=|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racial issues ===
In closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989 (when photos of Brown's face were entered into the record). Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;

In Cochran's summation to the jury, he emphasized that Fuhrman was proved to have repeatedly referred to African-Americans as "niggers" and also to have boasted of beating young African-Americans in his role as a police officer. Cochran's rhetoric was later criticized by Shapiro and by at least one juror,&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; as well as Goldman's father, Fred Goldman. Cochran called Fuhrman "a [[genocide|genocidal]] racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare and the personification of evil".&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt; Fuhrman later pleaded no contest to a felony charge of perjury, which had arisen from his testimony in Simpson's trial.

Fears grew that [[race riot]]s would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson was convicted of the murders, similar to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|riots in 1992]] which occurred after the acquittal of four police officers for the beating of black motorist [[Rodney King]] (King's beating was captured on an amateur video). As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd.

==Defense case==
[[File:JohnnieCochran 2001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Johnnie Cochran]] in 2001]]
Simpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, including Bailey, Kardashian, Shapiro, Dershowitz, Cochran, Uelmen (then the dean of law at [[Santa Clara University]]), [[Carl E. Douglas]] and [[Shawn Holley]]. Two attorneys specializing in DNA evidence, Scheck and [[Peter Neufeld]], were hired to attempt to discredit the prosecution's DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; They argued that Simpson was the victim of [[police fraud]] and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.&lt;ref name="court tv 17"/&gt; Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3&amp;nbsp;million and $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="usa today6"&gt;{{cite news |title=Fight over money may follow court battle |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 28, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns183.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's defense team, dubbed the "[[Dream Team (law)|Dream Team]]" by reporters, argued that Fuhrman had planted evidence at the crime scene. LAPD criminalists Fung and Mazzola were subject to strong scrutiny.

Simpson's defense sought to show that one or more hit men hired by drug dealers had murdered Brown and Goldman – giving both "[[Colombian necktie]]s" – because they were looking for Brown's friend, Faye Resnick, a known cocaine user who had failed to pay for her drugs. However, Judge Ito barred testimony about Resnick's drug use. She had stayed for several days at Brown's condo until entering [[drug rehabilitation|rehab]] four days before the killings. Ito stated that the defense had failed to provide sufficient direct or circumstantial evidence that the scenario was possible, indicating: "I find that the [[offer of proof]] regarding motive to be highly speculative." Consequently, he prohibited Christian Reichardt from testifying about his former girlfriend Resnick's drug problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=Chicago Tribune|title=Testimony On Resnick Drugs Barred|date=July 13, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Simpson Defense Presses Drug Link A Detective Faced A Barrage Of Questions.

==Verdict==
At 10:07&amp;nbsp;a.m. on October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The only testimony reviewed was that of limo driver Alan Park, who had said that he did not see Simpson's Bronco outside of his estate when he arrived to pick him up after the murders occurred. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. on October 2, after four hours of [[deliberation]], but Judge Ito postponed the announcement.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}}

Before the verdict, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide due to the verdict. An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement. Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58%, and trading volume on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] decreased by 41%. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms. So much work stopped that the verdict cost an estimated $480&amp;nbsp;million in lost productivity.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}}

The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] received a message on the verdict during [[oral arguments]], with the [[Supreme Court Justice|justices]] quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters, "Not only would you not be here, but I wouldn't be here, either".&lt;ref name="duggan19951004"&gt;{{cite news | title=Washington Comes to a Stop; Then Pent-Up Emotions Start Spilling Out | work=[[The Washington Post]] | date=October 4, 1995 | accessdate=January 28, 2012 | author=Duggan, Paul | page=A1 |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-856074.html |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to the verdict===
In post-trial interviews, a few of the jurors said that they believed Simpson probably did commit the murders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jurors say evidence made the case for Simpson |publisher=CNN |date=October 4, 1995 |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/OJ/daily/9510/10-04/jurors_speak/index.html |accessdate=June 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Three jurors together wrote and published a book called ''Madam Foreman,''{{sfn|Cooley|Bess|Rubin-Jackson|Byrnes|1996}} in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered Darden to be a [[Tokenism|token black]] assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Critics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short in comparison to the length of the trial. Some said that the jurors, most of whom did not have any college education, did not understand the forensic evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Matthew |last=Hutson |title=Unnatural Selection |journal=[[Psychology Today]] |date=March–April 2007 |url=http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20071012133039/http://psychologytoday.com/articles/index.php?term=pto-20070302-000001&amp;page=3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was read, juror number six, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a [[raised fist|black power raised fist]] salute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/oct/03/usa.garyyounge|title=Gary Younge: OJ Simpson and America, ten years after the trial|author=Gary Younge|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=April 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist [[Black Panther Party]] that prosecutors had "inexplicably left on the panel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/04/us/not-guilty-overview-jury-clears-simpson-double-murder-spellbound-nation-divides.html|title=Jury Clears Simpson in Double Murder; Spellbound Nation Divides on Verdict|date=October 4, 1995|website=The New York Times|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cochran wrote and published a book about the trial. It was titled ''Journey to Justice,'' and described his involvement in the case.{{sfn|Cochran|1997}} That same year, fellow defense attorney Shapiro also published a book about the trial, entitled ''The Search for Justice.'' He criticized Bailey as a "loose cannon" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial.{{sfn|Shapiro|Warren|1996}} In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD for racial reasons, but believed the verdict was correct due to reasonable doubt.&lt;ref name="usa today5"/&gt;

Clark published a book about the case titled ''Without a Doubt'' (1998).{{sfn|Clark|1998}} Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity.

Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney [[Vincent Bugliosi]] wrote a book titled ''[[Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder]]'' (1997). Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note "reeked" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing.&lt;ref name="tru tv"/&gt;{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse; that the prosecution should have presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community; and criticized the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate.{{sfn|Bugliosi|1997}} Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles rather than Santa Monica.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"/&gt; During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred [[peremptory challenge]]s to jurors based on race in ''People v. Wheeler'',&lt;ref&gt;22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; years before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] would do so in ''[[Batson v. Kentucky]]'').&lt;ref&gt;476 U.S. 79 (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

District Attorney Garcetti's supporters noted that the decision to move the trial was made by the Los Angeles Superior Court Presiding Judge, and not by Garcetti. The trial was moved due to security concerns at the smaller facility and the poor physical condition of the Santa Monica Courthouse.&lt;ref name="bugliosi"&gt;{{cite news |title= Bugliosi vs. Garcetti: Author Opens Fire on District Attorney | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 7, 2010|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives060710.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 review, the ''[[Metropolitan News-Enterprise]]'' said that Garcetti had "[[micromanagement|micromanaged]]" the trial, and that he had decided to have Simpson try on the gloves in open court that had been recovered at the murder scene and at Simpson's estate. Also, pundits criticized the prosecution for calling Fuhrman to the witness stand in the first place; they criticized the prosecution for lack of due diligence, which should have discovered his earlier racist statements. The D.A.'s office argued that the defense would have called Fuhrman anyway and that no one knew of the existence of the McKinney tapes until after the trial started.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Garcetti Draws Criticism for 'Micromanagement,' the Glove Debacle, the Fuhrman Fiasco | newspaper=Metropolitan News Enterprise|date=June 22, 2010 |url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/2010/perspectives062210.htm |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussion of the racial elements of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of the police and the courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African-Americans in the city, which was emphasized in the Rodney King case. After the [[civil lawsuit|civil verdict]] against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated.&lt;ref name="usa today4"/&gt; An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, ''[[FiveThirtyEight]]'' reported that most black people now think Simpson was guilty.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news |title= Most Black People Now Think O.J. Was Guilty | website=FiveThirtyEight|date=June 6, 2016 |url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-black-people-now-think-oj-simpson-was-guilty/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/25/black-and-white-americans-can-now-agree-o-j-was-guilty/ |title=Two decades later, black and white Americans finally agree on O.J.

==Media coverage==
{{quote|When the trial began, all of the networks were getting these hate-mail letters because people's soap operas were being interrupted for the Simpson trial. But then what happened was the people who liked soap operas got addicted to the Simpson trial. And they got really upset when the Simpson trial was over, and people would come up to me on the street and say, 'God, I loved your show.'|Marcia Clark, 2010{{r|anolik201406}}}}

The murders and trial – "the biggest story I have ever seen", said a producer of NBC's ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'' – received extensive media coverage from the very beginning; at least one [[instant book]] was proposed two hours after the bodies were found, and scheduled to publish only a few weeks later.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' covered the case on its front page for more than 300 days after the murders. The [[Big Three television networks]]' nightly news broadcasts gave more air time to the case than to the [[Bosnian War]] and the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] combined. The media outlets served an enthusiastic audience; one company put the loss of national productivity from employees following the case instead of working at $40&amp;nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Schuetz|Lilley|1999|pp=22–23}} ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' aired many skits on the trial, and the Dancing Itos – a troupe of dancers dressed as the judge – was a popular recurring segment.&lt;ref name="dancing its"&gt;{{cite episode | title=Dancing It's | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPVA2bGsB4&amp;t=2m | series=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno | network=NBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Participants in the case received much media coverage. Fans approached Clark at restaurants and malls, and when she got a new hairstyle during the trial, the prosecutor received a standing ovation on the courthouse steps; ''[[People magazine|People]]'' approved of the change, but advised her to wear "more fitted suits and tailored skirts". While Cochran, Bailey, and Dershowitz were already well known, others like Kaelin became celebrities, and Resnick and Simpson's girlfriend [[Paula Barbieri]] appeared in ''[[Playboy magazine|Playboy]]''. Those involved in the trial followed their own media coverage; when [[Larry King]] appeared in the courtroom after a meeting with Ito, both Simpson and Clark praised [[Larry King Live|King's talk show]]. Interest in the case was worldwide; [[Russia]]n president [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s first question to President Clinton when they met in 1995 was, "Do you think O.J. did it?".&lt;ref name="anolik201406"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Anolik |first=Lili |date=June 2014 |title=How O. J. Simpson Killed Popular Culture |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/style/society/2014/06/oj-simpson-trial-reality-tv-pop-culture |magazine=Vanity Fair |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of whether or not to allow any video cameras into the courtroom was among the first issues Judge Ito had to decide, ultimately ruling that live camera coverage was warranted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/oj/interviews/arenella.html FRONTLINE: the o.j. verdict: interviews: Peter arenella]. PBS. Retrieved December 30, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Ito would be later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case such as Clark, Fuhrman, and Kaelin, was influenced to some degree by the media presence and related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997.{{sfn|Dershowitz|2004}} Ito was also criticized for allowing the trial to become a media circus and not doing enough to regulate the court proceedings as well as he could have.&lt;ref name="USA today3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge Fujisaki was able to keep trial in control | newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=February 5, 1997 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/index/nns200.htm |accessdate=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the February 1998 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Simpson was quoted as saying, "Let's say I committed this crime… Even if I did this, it would have to have been because I loved her very much, right?"&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/17/news/mn-9193&lt;/ref&gt;  

In April 1998, Simpson did an interview with talk show host [[Ruby Wax]]. As a joke, Simpson shows up at her hotel room, and waved a banana about his head, as if it were a knife, and pretended to stab Ruby with it. The footage soon made its way onto the US TV networks, causing predictable outrage.

===Civil trial===
In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, filed a civil suit against Simpson for [[wrongful death]], while Brown's estate, represented by her father Lou Brown,&lt;ref name="usa today6"/&gt; brought suit against Simpson in a "survivor suit."

In November 2006, [[ReganBooks]] announced a book ghostwritten by [[Pablo Fenjves]] based on interviews with Simpson titled ''If I Did It'', an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession. The book's release was planned to coincide with a [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] special featuring Simpson. "This is a historic case, and I consider this his confession", publisher [[Judith Regan]] told the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5KT79AKsn?url=http://www.spokesmanreview.com/ap/story_pf.asp?ID=1475260 Publisher Calls Book O.J.'s 'Confession'], AP, November 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, [[News Corporation]], parent company of ReganBooks and Fox, canceled both the book and the TV interview due to a high level of public criticism. CEO [[Rupert Murdoch]], speaking at a press conference, stated: "I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6167420.stm |title=Murdoch cancels OJ Simpson plans|publisher= BBC News|date= November 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the Goldman family was awarded rights to the book to partially satisfy the civil judgment against Simpson. The title of the book was changed to ''If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer.'' On the front cover of the book, the title was stylized with the word "If" to appear much smaller than those of "I Did It", and placed inside the "I", so unless looked at very closely, the title of the book reads "I Did It: Confessions of the Killer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

On March 11, 2018, Fox broadcast Simpson's previously unaired interview with Regan which was part of the book deal in a special titled ''O.J.

Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of [[confession]], which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OJ Simpson lost interview | url = https://www.9news.com.au/world/2018/03/12/16/18/oj-simpson-lost-confession-2006-interview-video | publisher = 9News | date = 12 March 2018 | accessdate = March 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Snierson |first1=Dan |title=O.J.

===Later developments===
{{see also|O. J. Simpson robbery case}}
In 2007, as a result of an incident in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], regarding an attempt to reacquire materials Simpson claimed were stolen from him, [[O. J. Simpson robbery case|Simpson was convicted of multiple felonies]] including use of a deadly weapon to commit [[kidnapping]], [[burglary]] and [[armed robbery]], and sentenced to a minimum nine years to a maximum 33 years in prison. His attempts to [[appeal]] that sentence were unsuccessful and he resided at [[Lovelock Correctional Center]] in [[Lovelock, Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2017/03/10/o-j-simpson-could-be-released-from-prison-on-reality-tv-in-2017/|title=O.J.

After a July 20, 2017, Nevada parole board hearing voting unanimously 4–0, Simpson was granted parole after a minimum nine-year sentence on the remaining counts for the Vegas robbery with Sunday, October 1, 2017, to be his release date from prison on parole. According to Nevada law if he continues his good behavior, Simpson will have his 33-year sentence reduced by 50% to make September 29, 2022, the end of his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/20/us/oj-simpson-whats-next/index.html|title=What's next for O.J.

Simpson has participated in two high-profile interviews regarding the case – one in 1996 with [[Ross Becker]], which outlines Simpson's side of the story, as well as a guided tour of his estate, where evidence used in the trial was found. The second took place in 2004, on the ten-year anniversary of the murders, with [[Katie Couric]] for NBC speaking to Simpson. He had worked for that network as a sports commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5137198/ns/dateline_nbc-newsmakers/t/oj-simpson-years-later/|title=O.J.

In May 2008, [[Mike Gilbert (sports agent)|Mike Gilbert]], a former agent and friend of Simpson, released his book ''How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1596985518}}&lt;/ref&gt; which details Simpson confessing to the killings to Gilbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.observer.com/2008/o-j-simpsons-former-agent-publish-book-how-i-helped-o-j-get-away-murder|title=O.

Simpson said, "If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive." This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0805/12/ng.01.html|title=CNN.com – Transcripts|website=transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reference"&gt;"[[O.J.: Made in America]]", Episode 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, the LAPD announced a knife had been found in 1998 buried at Simpson's estate, when the buildings were razed. A construction worker had given the knife to a police officer, who, believing the case had been closed, did not submit it as evidence at the time. Forensic tests demonstrated that the knife was not related to the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/35948459 | title=Knife found at OJ Simpson home not a murder weapon | date=April 1, 2016 | publisher=BBC News | accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be argued that the presence of Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, would ultimately be the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian family]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-oj-simpson-gave-us-the-kardashians&lt;/ref&gt; While Kardashian's ex-wife [[Kris Jenner]] was already married to former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medalist [[Bruce Jenner]] at the time of the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2016/02/the_relationship_between_oj_simpson_and_the_kardashians_a_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other theories==
Although no one else was charged, and evidence points to Simpson's guilt, the murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.afrocentricnews.com/html/simpson.html|work=AfroCentric News Features|title=
The O.J. Simpson Affair: More &amp; Better Conspiracy Theories|author=Coleman, A.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Detective [[William Dear (detective)|William Dear]] conducted a lengthy investigation, and his evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., Dr. Henry Lee&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=O.J.: The Real Untold Story|author=BBC|date=2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/954700.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;) who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the [[BBC]] documentary, ''O.J.: The True Untold Story'' (2000). The documentary, produced by Malcolm Brinkworth, claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored [[exculpatory evidence]]. Furthermore, it asserts that the state too hastily eliminated other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son Jason, and individuals linked to the [[illegal drug trade]], in which Brown, Goldman, and Resnick allegedly participated.{{sfn|Dear|2012}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=BBC TV|title=''O.J.

Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to the Los Angeles drug trade,&lt;ref name="Bailey book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F. Lee|last2=Rabe|first2=Jean|authorlink1=F.

Simpson himself has stated in numerous interviews that he believes the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, Simpson believed, had been planning to open a restaurant using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.&lt;ref name="Bailey book"/&gt;

[[Brett Cantor]], part-owner of the Dragonfly nightclub in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], was found stabbed to death in his nearby home on July 30, 1993;&lt;ref name="Variety obit"&gt;{{cite news|title=A&amp;R exec Cantor slain|url=https://variety.com/1993/biz/news/a-r-exec-cantor-slain-109236/|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=August 3, 1993|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; no suspects have ever been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McRady|first=Rachel|title=Rose McGowan Tells All in New Memoir 'Brave': 14 Shocking Allegations|url=https://www.etonline.com/rose-mcgowan-tells-all-new-memoir-brave-14-shocking-allegations-95401|newspaper=[[Entertainment Tonight|ET Online]]|date=January 30, 2018|accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case gained renewed attention a year later when [[O.J. Simpson]]'s defense team successfully petitioned the court trying him for the murders of [[Nicole Brown Simpson]], his ex-wife, and [[Ronald Goldman]], for access to the case file, on the grounds that the way in which all three were stabbed suggested the same killer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noble|first=Kenneth|title=Simpson's Attempt to Bar Evidence Is Turned Down|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/22/us/simpson-s-attempt-to-bar-evidence-is-turned-down.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 22, 1994|accessdate=July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Goldman had worked for Cantor as a waiter, and Nicole Simpson was a regular at Dragonfly, some books about the case have raised the possibility that the three killings may also have resulted from involvement in drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=F.

[[Murder of Michael Nigg|Michael Nigg]], an aspiring actor and waiter at a Los Angeles restaurant, was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on 8 September 1995 while withdrawing money from an ATM.&lt;ref name="Michael Nigg death"&gt;{{cite news|title=Goldman Friend Slain Resisting Robbery|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/438329/GOLDMAN-FRIEND-IS-SLAIN-RESISTING-ROBBERY.html?pg=all|newspaper=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 12, 1995|accessdate=August 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three suspects were arrested a month later but released for lack of evidence and the case remains unsolved. Since Nigg was a friend of [[Ronald Goldman]], with whom he had worked, and seemed to live quite well for someone in his position, leading to some reports that he was involved in drug trafficking, his death has been used to support theories that the murders of Goldman and O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole the year before were drug-related as well.

In 2012, several links between the killings and convicted murderer [[Glen Edward Rogers]] were alleged in the documentary film ''[[My Brother the Serial Killer]]'', which was broadcast on [[Investigation Discovery]] (ID). Clay Rogers, Glen's brother, recounts Glen talking about how he had met Brown and was "going to take her down" a few days before the murders happened in 1994. When the murder case was under process, Van Nuys ADA Lea D'Argostino came to know about a written statement from Glen revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years-long correspondence with [[criminal profiler]] Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: "you may have to kill the bitch". In a filmed interview, Glen's brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Dan|title=Serial Killer Murdered Nicole Brown Simpson, New Documentary Claims|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/serial-killer-oj-simpson-murdered-nicole-brown-simpson/story?id=17765728|accessdate=1 January 2014|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers' family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Nicole in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers would later speak to a criminal profiler about the Goldman-Simpson murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by O. J. Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Nicole.

"The Shocking Case of O.J. Simpson", released September 29, 2017, was episode 10 of season 2 of [[BuzzFeed]] web series, ''[[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]: and discussed those theories.

Singular’s source gave him multiple, specific pieces of information regarding the Simpson case.

The families of Brown and Goldman expressed anger at the premise of ''My Brother the Serial Killer'', with both families dismissing the claims by the Rogers family.&lt;ref name="FN"&gt;{{cite news|title=Families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman enraged by Discovery documentary; O.J.

ID's president, Henry Schlieff, replied that the documentary's intention was not to prove that Rogers had committed the crimes, but to "give viewers new facts and let them make up their own minds," and that he believed that Simpson was guilty of the murders.&lt;ref name="TS"&gt;{{cite web|title=O.J.

According to ''[[O.J.: Made in America]]'' director [[Ezra Edelman]], no plausible alternative theory has emerged.

The 2002 song "[[Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous (Good Charlotte song)|Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous]]", by American punk-pop band [[Good Charlotte]] includes the lyrics, "You know if you're famous you can kill your wife?

Rapper [[Jay Z]] also referenced the trial in a song named ''The Story Of O.J'' which revolves around the case and the influence of systematic racism on the trial.

Hip hop artist [[Magneto Dayo]] released a 2013 "[[diss track]]" song titled "OJ Simpson" in which he insults his ex-girlfriend/artist [[V-Nasty]], by referencing the Simpson murder case.

The suit Simpson wore when he was acquitted on October 3, 1995 was donated by Simpson's former agent [[Mike Gilbert]] to the [[Newseum]] in 2010. The Newseum has multiple trial related items in their collection, including press passes, newspapers and the mute button that Superior Court Judge [[Lance Ito]] used when he wanted to shut off the live microphone in court so lawyers could talk privately during the trial. The museum's acquisition of the suit ended the legal battle between Gilbert and Fred Goldman, both of whom claimed the right to the clothing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artdaily.com/news/37797/OJ-Simpson-Acquittal-Suit-Arrives-at-Newseum-in-DC-#.WvdND--FN9M]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17763">'''Open justice''' is a [[Legal doctrine|legal principle]] describing legal processes characterized by [[openness]] and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]].&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt; The term has particular emphasis in legal systems based on [[Law of the United Kingdom|British law]], such as in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]] such as [[South Africa]] and [[Canada]] and [[Australia]], and former British colonies such as the [[United States]]. The term has several closely related meanings: it is seen as a fundamental [[rights|right]] guaranteeing liberty;&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt; it describes guidelines for how courts can be more transparent;&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian1"/&gt; and it sometimes identifies an ideal situation.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsTheAge4"/&gt; In a courtroom, it means steps to promote transparency such as letting the public see and hear trials as they happen in real time,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; televising trials as they happen, videotaping proceedings for later viewing,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; publishing the content and documents of court files,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; providing transcripts of statements, making past decisions available for review in an easy-to-access format,&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; publishing decisions, and giving reporters full access to files and participants so they can report what happens. The principle includes efforts to try to make what happens in the court understandable to the public and the press.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt;

In Canada, '''open justice''' is referred to as the [[open court principle]].

==Background==
[[File:Pictures of English History Plate XXIV - King John and Magna Carta.jpg|thumb|right|The principle of open justice has been traced to decisions made before the [[Magna Carta]].]]
The principle is viewed as an underlying or core principle in British law.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; It has a long history dating back hundreds of years, and it has been traced to decisions made before the signing of the [[Magna Carta]] in 1215.&lt;ref name="twsNYTimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Today the concept is so widely accepted that there is a general presumption that there should be judicial openness, such that openness is the rule, with secret or obscured proceedings being considered as exceptions needing to be justified.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt; The rise of [[social media]] websites such as [[Facebook]] has opened new ways for court cases to be made public; for example, in [[Australia]], courts have considered having websites with live videos as well as blogs by retired judges to "preserve the concepts of open justice" in the digital age.&lt;ref name="twsTheAge"/&gt; In recent years, when governments try to cope with thorny problems such as [[terrorism]], there are concerns that the principle of open justice can be undermined relatively easily by national security concerns.&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt; There are concerns that if new secrecy guidelines harden into precedents, that it might be hard to restore the "centuries old system of open justice".&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt;

==Practical considerations==

===Benefits===
Proponents of open justice assert numerous benefits. An overarching benefit is that it keeps courts behaving properly.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Openness acts as a safeguard for the proper administration of justice.&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; According to philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]], open justice is the "keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Knowledge that court trials are regularly public encourages further attendance by the public.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; Further, openness can mean more accurate decisions during a trial; for example, the proceedings can spur a witness to come forth, or encourage others to submit new evidence or dispute publicized statements.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Openness reduces the chance that the judgment is a mistake or that a case might have to be re-tried because of a subsequent sanction of contempt.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Proponents argue that open justice benefits democracy in a general sense because citizens can see how particular laws affect particular people, and therefore citizens are in a better position to advise lawmakers about such laws.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; It helps ensure public confidence in legal decision-making, according to proponents.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt; Proponents of open justice have argued that public scrutiny permits those interested to "tap into the collective wisdom of what passes for fairness in similar cases".&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt; It facilitates a comparison of cases.&lt;ref name="twsIrishTimes1"/&gt;

A British judge commented:
{{Quote|This is the reason it is so important not to forget why proceedings are required to be subjected to the full glare of a public hearing. It is necessary because the public nature of proceedings deters inappropriate behaviour on the part of the court. It also maintains the public's confidence in the administration of justice. It enables the public to know that justice is being administered impartially. It can result in evidence becoming available which would not become available if the proceedings were conducted behind closed doors or with one or more of the parties' or witnesses' identity concealed. It makes uninformed and inaccurate comment about the proceedings less likely. If secrecy is restricted to those situations where justice would be frustrated if the cloak of anonymity is not provided, this reduces the risk of the sanction of contempt having to be invoked, with the expense and the interference with the administration of justice which this can involve.|Judge Woolf in ''R v Legal Aid''&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;}}

Still, practical considerations often mean that the ideal of open justice must be weighed against other values such as privacy and cost and national security.&lt;ref name="twsLATimes"/&gt;

===National security concerns===
There are some cases in which [[publicity]] in a courtroom proceeding can be detrimental.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; In some cases, courts have opted to keep trials secret in proceedings against persons charged with [[terrorism]],&lt;ref name="twsNPR1"/&gt; to protect its intelligence gathering methods and contacts from exposure. In a case in Britain, in which a soldier was on trial for murdering an Afghan insurgent, there was an effort to keep the trial secret to protect him from possible future retribution, but there were calls for the identity of the soldier to be publicized based on the principle of open justice.&lt;ref name="twsBBC"/&gt; In situations when aspects of trials are kept secret, critics favoring open justice have argued that the secrecy is not needed for national security but is "nothing more than a useful drape to cover the inconvenient or the merely embarrassing."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian2"/&gt; Lawyers have often referred to the principle of open justice when disagreeing with a decision that was made, or calling for a retrial. In the [[United Kingdom]], courts have tried to find the right balance between openness and secrecy, particularly in sensitive cases.&lt;ref name="twsDenverPost"/&gt; In the [[United States]], there have been concerns that the principle of open justice has not been applied to cases of immigrants "wrongly ensnared in the post-9/11 law enforcement dragnet" who were denied access to lawyers and relatives and sometimes deported after secret removal proceedings.&lt;ref name="twsBaltimoreSun"/&gt;

===Privacy concerns===
There are other factors which sometimes must be balanced against the need for open justice. For example, there are situations in which the release of [[confidentiality|confidential information]] such as private financial records might harm the reputation of one of the parties.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; In other situations, it may be necessary to protect the privacy of a [[Minor (law)|minor]].&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; A further case in which openness is seen as unnecessary are when legal matters involve uncontentious information unrelated to public issues, such as the financial division of an estate after a death.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt; Another factor sometimes working against the ideal of open justice is complexity;&lt;ref name="twsBBC3"/&gt; according to one view, court proceedings over time "have evolved into a complex system that is hard for outsiders to understand."&lt;ref name="twsTheGuardian5"/&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Fort Lee lane closure scandal|Bridgegate]] scandal in [[New Jersey]], an appellate judge ruled against releasing the identities of some persons involved in the scandal, on the grounds of being "sensitive to the privacy and reputation interests of uncharged third parties"; that is, releasing names to the media might unfairly tarnish reputations without a trial.&lt;ref name=twsSLedger1&gt;May 17, 2016, Tim Darragh of Advance Media, The Star-Ledger, [http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2016/05/names_of_bridgegate_individuals.html Bridgegate names to remain secret for now, court rules], Retrieved September 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Another judge commented on tradeoffs which sometimes work against openness:

{{Quote|A hearing, or any part of it, may be in private if publicity would defeat the object of the hearing; it involves matters relating to national security; it involves confidential information (including information relating to personal financial matters) and publicity would damage that confidentiality; a private hearing is necessary to protect the interests of any child or protected party; it is a hearing of an application made without notice and it would be unjust to any respondent for there to be a public hearing; it involves uncontentious matters arising in the administration of trusts or in the administration of a deceased person’s estate; or the court considers this to be necessary, in the interests of justice.|Justice Tugendhat in a legal opinion.&lt;ref name="twsDuHaime"/&gt;}}

There is an ''Open Justice Initiative'' within the legal community to make justice more transparent.&lt;ref name="twsBostonGlobe"/&gt;

'''Optical character recognition''' (also '''optical character reader''', '''OCR''') is the [[Machine|mechanical]] or [[Electronics|electronic]] conversion of [[image]]s of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/ocrdocument#overview|title=OCR Document|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely used as a form of information entry from printed paper data records – whether passport documents, invoices, [[bank statement]]s, computerised receipts, business cards, mail, printouts of static-data, or any suitable documentation – it is a common method of digitising printed texts so that they can be electronically edited, searched, stored more compactly, displayed on-line, and used in machine processes such as [[cognitive computing]], [[machine translation]], (extracted) [[text-to-speech]], key data and [[text mining]]. OCR is a field of research in [[pattern recognition]], [[artificial intelligence]] and [[computer vision]].

Early versions needed to be trained with images of each character, and worked on one font at a time. Advanced systems capable of producing a high degree of recognition accuracy for most fonts are now common, and with support for a variety of digital image file format inputs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dev.havenondemand.com/docs/ImageFormats.html|title=undefined|first=HPE Haven|last=OnDemand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some systems are capable of reproducing formatted output that closely approximates the original page including images, columns, and other non-textual components.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of optical character recognition}}
Early optical character recognition may be traced to technologies involving telegraphy and creating reading devices for the blind.&lt;ref name=Scantz82&gt;{{cite book|last=Schantz|first=Herbert F.|title=The history of OCR, optical character recognition|year=1982|publisher=Recognition Technologies Users Association|location=[Manchester Center, Vt.]|isbn=9780943072012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed a machine that read characters and converted them into standard telegraph code.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Concurrently, Edmund Fournier d'Albe developed the [[Optophone]], a handheld scanner that when moved across a printed page, produced tones that corresponded to specific letters or characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=d'Albe|first=E. E. F.|title=On a Type-Reading Optophone|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|date=1 July 1914|volume=90|issue=619|pages=373–375|doi=10.1098/rspa.1914.0061|bibcode=1914RSPSA..90..373D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1920s and into the 1930s [[Emanuel Goldberg]] developed what he called a "Statistical Machine" for searching microfilm archives using an optical code recognition system. In 1931 he was granted USA Patent number 1,838,389 for the invention. The patent was acquired by [[IBM]].

With the advent of smart-phones and [[smartglasses]], OCR can be used in internet connected mobile device applications that extract text captured using the device's camera. These devices that do not have OCR functionality built into the operating system will typically use an OCR [[Application programming interface|API]] to extract the text from the image file captured and provided by the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Extracting-text-from-images-using-OCR-on-Android/ba-p/1883|title=Extracting text from images using OCR on Android|date=27 June 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/Tutorial-OCR-on-Google-Glass/ba-p/1164|title=[Tutorial] OCR on Google Glass|date=23 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OCR API returns the extracted text, along with information about the location of the detected text in the original image back to the device app for further processing (such as text-to-speech) or display.

===Blind and visually impaired users===
In 1974, [[Ray Kurzweil]] started the company Kurzweil Computer Products, Inc. and continued development of omni-[[typeface|font]] OCR, which could recognise text printed in virtually any font (Kurzweil is often credited with inventing omni-font OCR, but it was in use by companies, including CompuScan, in the late 1960s and 1970s&lt;ref name=Scantz82/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Data processing magazine |title=The History of OCR |volume=12 |year=1970 |page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Kurzweil decided that the best application of this technology would be to create a reading machine for the blind, which would allow blind people to have a computer read text to them out loud. This device required the invention of two enabling technologies{{spaced ndash}}the [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[flatbed scanner]] and the text-to-speech synthesiser. On January 13, 1976, the successful finished product was unveiled during a widely reported news conference headed by Kurzweil and the leaders of the [[National Federation of the Blind]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In 1978, Kurzweil Computer Products began selling a commercial version of the optical character recognition computer program. [[LexisNexis]] was one of the first customers, and bought the program to upload legal paper and news documents onto its nascent online databases. Two years later, Kurzweil sold his company to [[Xerox]], which had an interest in further commercialising paper-to-computer text conversion. Xerox eventually spun it off as [[Scansoft]], which merged with [[Nuance Communications]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The research group headed by [[A. G. Ramakrishnan]] at the [[Medical intelligence and language engineering lab]], [[Indian Institute of Science]], has developed PrintToBraille tool, an open source GUI frontend&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrintToBraille Tool |title=ocr-gui-frontend |url=https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |publisher=MILE Lab, Dept of EE, IISc |accessdate=7 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225115650/https://code.google.com/p/ocr-gui-frontend/ |archivedate=December 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be used by any OCR to convert scanned images of printed books to Braille books.

In the 2000s, OCR was made available online as a service (WebOCR), in a [[cloud computing]] environment, and in mobile applications like real-time translation of foreign-language signs on a [[smartphone]].

[[Comparison of optical character recognition software|Various commercial and open source OCR systems]] are available for most common [[writing system]]s, including Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Indic, Bengali (Bangla), Devanagari, Tamil, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

==Applications==
OCR engines have been developed into many kinds of domain-specific OCR applications, such as receipt OCR, invoice OCR, check OCR, legal billing document OCR.

They can be used for:
* [[Data entry clerk|Data entry]] for business documents, e.g. [[check clearing|check]], passport, invoice, bank statement and receipt
* [[Automatic number plate recognition]]
*In airports, for passport recognition and information extraction
* Automatic insurance documents key information extraction
* Extracting business card information into a contact list&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Blog/javascript-Using-OCR-and-Entity-Extraction-for-LinkedIn-Company/ba-p/460|title=[javascript] Using OCR and Entity Extraction for LinkedIn Company Lookup|date=22 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More quickly make textual versions of printed documents, e.g. [[book scanning]] for [[Project Gutenberg]]
* Make electronic images of printed documents searchable, e.g. [[Google Books]]
* Converting handwriting in real time to control a computer ([[pen computing]])
* Defeating [[CAPTCHA]] anti-bot systems, though these are specifically designed to prevent OCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.andrewt.net/blog/how-to-crack-captchas/ |title=How To Crack Captchas |publisher=andrewt.net |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/research/gimpy/ |title=Breaking a Visual CAPTCHA |publisher=Cs.sfu.ca |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Resig |url=http://ejohn.org/blog/ocr-and-neural-nets-in-javascript/ |title=John Resig – OCR and Neural Nets in JavaScript |publisher=Ejohn.org |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose can also be to test the robustness of CAPTCHA anti-bot systems.
* Assistive technology for blind and visually impaired users

==Types==
* Optical character recognition (OCR){{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one [[glyph]] or [[character (symbol)|character]] at a time.
* Optical word recognition{{spaced ndash}}targets typewritten text, one word at a time (for languages that use a [[Space (punctuation)|space]] as a [[word divider]]).  (Usually just called "OCR".)
* [[Intelligent character recognition]] (ICR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text one glyph or character at a time, usually involving [[machine learning]].
* [[Intelligent word recognition]] (IWR){{spaced ndash}}also targets handwritten [[printscript]] or [[cursive]] text, one word at a time.  This is especially useful for languages where glyphs are not separated in cursive script.

OCR is generally an "offline" process, which analyses a static document. [[Handwriting movement analysis]] can be used as input to [[handwriting recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tappert | first1 = C. C. | last2 = Suen | first2 = C. Y. | last3 = Wakahara | first3 = T. | doi = 10.1109/34.57669 | title = The state of the art in online handwriting recognition | journal = IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 787 | year = 1990 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of merely using the shapes of glyphs and words, this technique is able to capture motions, such as the order in which [[Segment (handwriting)|segments]] are drawn, the direction, and the pattern of putting the pen down and lifting it.  This additional information can make the end-to-end process more accurate.  This technology is also known as "on-line character recognition", "dynamic character recognition", "real-time character recognition", and "intelligent character recognition".

==Techniques==

===Pre-processing===
OCR software often "pre-processes" images to improve the chances of successful recognition. Techniques include:&lt;ref name="nicomsoft"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nicomsoft.com/optical-character-recognition-ocr-how-it-works/ |title=Optical Character Recognition (OCR) – How it works |publisher=Nicomsoft.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* De-[[Skew (fax)|skew]]{{spaced ndash}}If the document was not aligned properly when scanned, it may need to be tilted a few degrees clockwise or counterclockwise in order to make lines of text perfectly horizontal or vertical.

Segmentation of [[fixed-pitch font]]s is accomplished relatively simply by aligning the image to a uniform grid based on where vertical grid lines will least often intersect black areas.  For [[proportional font]]s, more sophisticated techniques are needed because whitespace between letters can sometimes be greater than that between words, and vertical lines can intersect more than one character.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

===Character recognition===
There are two basic types of core OCR algorithm, which may produce a ranked list of candidate characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dataid.com/aboutocr.htm |title=OCR Introduction |publisher=Dataid.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matrix matching involves comparing an image to a stored glyph on a pixel-by-pixel basis; it is also known as "pattern matching", "[[pattern recognition]]", or "[[digital image correlation|image correlation]]". This relies on the input glyph being correctly isolated from the rest of the image, and on the stored glyph being in a similar font and at the same scale.  This technique works best with typewritten text and does not work well when new fonts are encountered.  This is the technique the early physical photocell-based OCR implemented, rather directly.

Feature extraction decomposes glyphs into "features" like lines, closed loops, line direction, and line intersections.  The extraction features reduces the dimensionality of the representation and makes the recognition process computationally efficient. These features are compared with an abstract vector-like representation of a character, which might reduce to one or more glyph prototypes.  General techniques of [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection in computer vision]] are applicable to this type of OCR, which is commonly seen in "intelligent" [[handwriting recognition]] and indeed most modern OCR software.&lt;ref name="ocrwizard"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocrwizard.com/ocr-software/how-ocr-software-works.html |title=How OCR Software Works |publisher=OCRWizard |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nearest neighbour classifiers]] such as the [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm]] are used to compare image features with stored glyph features and choose the nearest match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.damiles.com/2008/11/14/the-basic-patter-recognition-and-classification-with-opencv.html |title=The basic pattern recognition and classification with openCV &amp;#124; Damiles |publisher=Blog.damiles.com |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software such as [[CuneiForm (software)|Cuneiform]] and [[Tesseract (software)|Tesseract]] use a two-pass approach to character recognition.  The second pass is known as "adaptive recognition" and uses the letter shapes recognised with high confidence on the first pass to recognise better the remaining letters on the second pass.  This is advantageous for unusual fonts or low-quality scans where the font is distorted (e.g. blurred or faded).&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tesseract-ocr.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/tesseracticdar2007.pdf|title=An Overview of the Tesseract OCR Engine|year=2007|accessdate=2013-05-23|author=Ray Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCR result can be stored in the standardised [[ALTO (XML)|ALTO]] format, a dedicated XML schema maintained by the United States [[Library of Congress]].

For a list of optical character recognition software see [[Comparison of optical character recognition software]].

===Post-processing===
OCR accuracy can be increased if the output is constrained by a [[lexicon]]{{spaced ndash}}a list of words that are allowed to occur in a document.&lt;ref name="nicomsoft" /&gt;  This might be, for example, all the words in the English language, or a more technical lexicon for a specific field.  This technique can be problematic if the document contains words not in the lexicon, like [[proper noun]]s. Tesseract uses its dictionary to influence the character segmentation step, for improved accuracy.&lt;ref name="Tesseract overview" /&gt;

The output stream may be a [[plain text]] stream or file of characters, but more sophisticated OCR systems can preserve the original layout of the page and produce, for example, an annotated [[PDF]] that includes both the original image of the page and a searchable textual representation.

"Near-neighbor analysis" can make use of [[co-occurrence]] frequencies to correct errors, by noting that certain words are often seen together.&lt;ref name="explain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explainthatstuff.com/how-ocr-works.html |title=How does OCR document scanning work? |publisher=Explain that Stuff |date=2012-01-30 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, "Washington, D.C." is generally far more common in English than "Washington DOC".

Knowledge of the grammar of the language being scanned can also help determine if a word is likely to be a verb or a noun, for example, allowing greater accuracy.

The [[Levenshtein distance|Levenshtein Distance]] algorithm has also been used in OCR post-processing to further optimize results from an OCR API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://community.havenondemand.com/t5/Wiki/How-to-optimize-results-from-the-OCR-API-when-extracting-text/ta-p/1656|title=How to optimize results from the OCR API when extracting text from an image? - Haven OnDemand Developer Community|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Application-specific optimisations===
In recent years,{{when|date=March 2013}} the major OCR technology providers began to tweak OCR systems to better deal with specific types of input.  Beyond an application-specific lexicon, better performance can be had by taking into account business rules, standard expression,{{clarify|date=March 2013}} or rich information contained in color images.  This strategy is called "Application-Oriented OCR" or "Customised OCR", and has been applied to OCR of [[license plate]]s, [[invoice]]s, [[screenshot]]s, [[ID card]]s, [[driver license]]s, and [[automobile manufacturing]].

==Workarounds==
There are several techniques for solving the problem of character recognition by means other than improved OCR algorithms.

===Forcing better input===
Special fonts like [[OCR-A font|OCR-A]], [[OCR-B]], or [[MICR]] fonts, with precisely specified sizing, spacing, and distinctive character shapes, allow a higher accuracy rate during transcription in bank check processing. Ironically however, several prominent OCR engines were designed to capture text in popular fonts such as Arial or Times New Roman, and are incapable of capturing text in these fonts that are specialized and much different from popularly used fonts. As Google Tesseract can be trained to recognize new fonts, it can recognize OCR-A, OCR-B and MICR fonts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://trainyourtesseract.com/|title=Train Your Tesseract|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Train Your Tesseract|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

"Comb fields" are pre-printed boxes that encourage humans to write more legibly{{spaced ndash}}one glyph per box.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;  These are often printed in a [[Drop out ink|"dropout color"]] which can be easily removed by the OCR system.&lt;ref name="explain" /&gt;

[[Palm OS]] used a special set of glyphs, known as "[[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]]" which are similar to printed English characters but simplified or modified for easier recognition on the platform's computationally limited hardware. Users would need to learn how to write these special glyphs.

Zone-based OCR restricts the image to a specific part of a document.  This is often referred to as "Template OCR".

===Crowdsourcing===
[[Crowdsourcing]] humans to perform the character recognition can quickly process images like computer-driven OCR, but with higher accuracy for recognising images than is obtained with computers.  Practical systems include the [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[reCAPTCHA]]. The [[National Library of Finland]] has developed an online interface for users correct OCRed texts in the standardised ALTO format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.helsinki.fi/fennougrica/2014/02/21/ocr-text-editor/|title=What is the point of an online interactive OCR text editor? - Fenno-Ugrica|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowdsourcing has also been used not to perform character recognition directly but to invite software developers to develop image processing algorithms, for example, through the use of [[Tournament theory|rank-order tournaments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riedl, C. |author2=Zanibbi, R. |author3=Hearst, M. A. |author4=Zhu, S. |author5=Menietti, M. |author6=Crusan, J. |author7=Metelsky, I. |author8=Lakhani, K. |title=Detecting Figures and Part Labels in Patents: Competition-Based Development of Image Processing Algorithms |journal=[[International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=155 |date=20 February 2016 |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8 |bibcode= |doi=10.1007/s10032-016-0260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{update|date=March 2013}}
Commissioned by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] (DOE), the Information Science Research Institute (ISRI) had the mission to foster the improvement of automated technologies for understanding machine printed documents, and it conducted the most authoritative of the ''Annual Test of OCR Accuracy'' from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/isri-ocr-evaluation-tools/|title= Code and Data to evaluate OCR accuracy, originally from UNLV/ISRI|publisher=Google Code Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognition of [[Latin alphabet|Latin-script]], typewritten text is still not 100% accurate even where clear imaging is available. One study based on recognition of 19th- and early 20th-century newspaper pages concluded that character-by-character OCR accuracy for commercial OCR software varied from 81% to 99%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; total accuracy can be achieved by human review or Data Dictionary Authentication. Other areas—including recognition of hand printing, [[cursive]] handwriting, and printed text in other scripts (especially those East Asian language characters which have many strokes for a single character)—are still the subject of active research. The [[MNIST database]] is commonly used for testing systems' ability to recognise handwritten digits.

Accuracy rates can be measured in several ways, and how they are measured can greatly affect the reported accuracy rate. For example, if word context (basically a lexicon of words) is not used to correct software finding non-existent words, a character error rate of 1% (99% accuracy) may result in an error rate of 5% (95% accuracy) or worse if the measurement is based on whether each whole word was recognised with no incorrect letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference  | last1=Suen  | first1=C.Y.  | last2= Plamondon    |  first2=R.  | last3= Tappert  | first3=A.  | last4=Thomassen  | first4=A.  | last5=Ward  | first5=J.R.  | last6=Yamamoto  | first6=K.  | title = Future Challenges in Handwriting and Computer Applications  | date =1987-05-29  | conference=3rd International Symposium on Handwriting and Computer Applications, Montreal, May 29, 1987  | url=http://users.erols.com/rwservices/pens/biblio88.html#Suen88  | accessdate = 2008-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the difficulties inherent in digitising old text is the inability of OCR to differentiate between the "[[long s]]" and "f" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Research and Advanced Technology for Digital Libraries|author=Sarantos Kapidakis, Cezary Mazurek, Marcin Werla|date=2015|page=257|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319245928|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEyGCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=OCR+and+long+s&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Web-based OCR systems for recognising hand-printed text on the fly have become well known as commercial products in recent years{{when|date=March 2013}} (see [[tablet computer|Tablet PC history]]). Accuracy rates of 80% to 90% on neat, clean hand-printed characters can be achieved by [[pen computing]] software, but that accuracy rate still translates to dozens of errors per page, making the technology useful only in very limited applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Recognition of cursive text is an active area of research, with recognition rates even lower than that of hand-printed text. Higher rates of recognition of general cursive script will likely not be possible without the use of contextual or grammatical information. For example, recognising entire words from a dictionary is easier than trying to parse individual characters from script. Reading the ''Amount'' line of a [[cheque]] (which is always a written-out number) is an example where using a smaller dictionary can increase recognition rates greatly. The shapes of individual cursive characters themselves simply do not contain enough information to accurately (greater than 98%) recognise all handwritten cursive script.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}} 

Most programs allow users to set "confidence rates". This means that if the software does not achieve their desired level of accuracy, a user can be notified for manual review.

==UNICODE==
{{Main article|Optical Character Recognition (Unicode block)}}

Characters to support OCR were added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 1993, with the release of version 1.1.

Some of these characters are mapped from fonts specific to [[MICR]], [[OCR-A]] or [[OCR-B]].

Hicks, ''English for Journalists'' (2013) p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hyppolitus készlet.jpg|thumb|Hyppolytus set]]
The complex takes its name from [[Greek mythology]]. 
[[Phaedra (mythology)|Phaedra]] was the daughter of [[Minos]] and [[Pasiphaë]], wife of [[Theseus]], sister of [[Ariadne]], and the mother of [[Demophon of Athens]] and [[Acamas (son of Theseus)|Acamas]]. Though married to Theseus, Phaedra fell in love with [[Hippolytus (son of Theseus)|Hippolytus]], Theseus' son born by either [[Hippolyta]], queen of the [[Amazons]], or [[Antiope (Amazon)|Antiope]], her sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=490046 Alfred Messer, 'The "Phaedra Complex"]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Hippolytus refused Phaedra's advances, she falsely accused him of propositioning her. Phaedra eventually killed herself in remorse after his subsequent death.&lt;ref&gt;H. Nettleship ed, ''A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'' (1894) p. 475&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural analogues==
* [[Amata]] in the [[Aeneid]] has been seen as cognate to Phaedra in her love for her future son-in-law [[Turnus]] and her eventual suicide at the news of his death.&lt;ref&gt;S. J. Harrison, ''Generic Enrichment in Vergil and Horace'' (2007) p. lxxvi-vii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the  [[Hebrew Bible]] [[Potiphar's wife|Zuleikha]] made a pass at her adoptive son [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], but Joseph refused her. So, Zuleikha accused Joseph of rape and he was put in prison, but eventually released. According to the tradition, Zuleikha made advances at many other foster children before Joseph.
* In the ballad [[Child Owlet]], Lady Erskine propositions her nephew, and upon rebuttal accuses him of attempting to seduce her, leading to his murder.

{{Sociology}}
In [[social science]] and [[politics]], '''power''' is the ability to [[Social influence|influence]] or outright [[Social control|control]] the behaviour of people. The term "[[authority]]" is often used for power perceived as [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] by the [[social structure]]. Power can be seen as evil or [[injustice|unjust]], this sort of primitive exercise of power is historically [[wikt:endemic|endemic]] to humans, however as social beings the same concept is seen as good and as something inherited or given for exercising [[Humanism|humanistic]] objectives that will help, enable and move people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fred Luthans|author2=Brett C. Luthans|author3=Kyle W. Luthans|title=Organizational Behavior: An Evidence Based Approach, 13th Ed.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogYoDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA290|date=1 June 2015|publisher=IAP Inc|isbn=978-1-68123-121-1|pages=290–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, it is derived by the factors of interdependence between two entities and the environment. In &lt;!--the corporate environment--&gt;[[business]], the ethical instrumentality of power is achievement, and as such it is a [[zero-sum game]]. In simple terms it can be expressed as being "upward" or "downward". With downward power, a company's superior influences subordinates for attaining organizational goals. When a company exerts upward power, it is the subordinates who influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schein |first=Larry E. Greiner, Virginia E. |title=Power and organization development : mobilizing power to implement change |date=1988 |publisher=Addison-Wesley |location=Reading, Mass. |isbn=0201121859 |edition= Repr. with corrections.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of power need not involve force or the threat of force ([[coercion]]). On one side, it closely resembles what egalitarian and consensual nations (Denmark, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) might term as "influence," contrasted with the extreme what some authors identify as "intimidation" in capitalist nations, a means by which power is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Handy |first=Charles |title=Understanding organizations |date=1993 |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=9780140156034 |edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of using power without oppression is the concept "[[soft power]]," as compared to [[hard power]].

Much of the recent [[Sociology|sociological]] debate about power revolves around the issue of its means to enable{{spndash}}in other words, power as a means to make [[social actions]] possible as much as it may constrain or prevent them. The philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] saw power as a [[Structuralism|structural]] expression of "a complex strategic situation in a given [[social setting]]"&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Collin (1980). Forward. In  ''Power/Knowledge'', Foucault, Michel, Pantheon Books, New York, 1980. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires both constraint and enablement.

== Theories ==

=== Five bases ===
{{Main|French and Raven's five bases of power}}
Social psychologists [[John R. P. French]] and [[Bertram Raven]], in a now-classic study (1959),&lt;ref&gt;French, J.R.P., &amp; Raven, B. (1959). 'The bases of social power,' in D. Cartwright (ed.) Studies in Social Power. Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press. {{page needed|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.

According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs which holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally ''relative'' – it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship, and requires B's recognition of a quality in A which would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship, to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power.

French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories. Further bases have since been adduced – in particular by [[Gareth Morgan (author)|Gareth Morgan]] in his 1986 book, ''[[Images of Organization]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1873&amp;context=utk_graddiss|title=Everyday Experiences of Power|date=August 2010|first=Kelly E.|last=de Moll|page=22|format=PDF|publisher=University of Tennessee|location=Knoxville, TN|type=Ph.D. dissertation|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legitimate power ====
{{Main|Legitimate power}}
Also called "positional power," it is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization. Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position. It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power such as a [[uniform]], a title, or an imposing physical office.

==== Referent power ====
{{Main|Referent power}}
Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build [[loyalty]]. It is based on the [[charisma]] and [[interpersonal skills]] of the power holder. A person may be admired because of specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence. Here the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities, and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower. [[Nationalism]] and [[patriotism]] count towards an intangible sort of referent power. For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country. This is the second least obvious power, but the most effective. Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for products endorsements, for example. The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Management|date=2008|first1=Patrick J.|last1=Montana|first2=Bruce H.|last2=Charnov|edition= 4th|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yJIQ2XGhneUC&amp;pg=PA257 257]|isbn=9780764139314|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|location=Hauppauge, NY|oclc=175290009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse is possible when someone that is likable, yet lacks integrity and honesty, rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position. Referent power is unstable alone, and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect. When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.

==== Expert power ====
{{Main|Expert power}}
[[Expert]] power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise. Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified. When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment, and generally out perform others, then people tend to listen to them. When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say. As subject matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for [[leadership]] in that area.

==== Reward power ====
{{Main|Reward power}}
[[Reward system|Reward]] power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards, it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions or increases in pay or responsibility. This power is obvious but also ineffective if abused. People who abuse reward power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or 'moving things too quickly'. If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there's a high probability that they'll do it. The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required. Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases, and managers often can't control promotions all by themselves. And even a CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions. So when somebody uses up available rewards, or the rewards don't have enough perceived value to others, their power weakens. (One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they're to have the same motivational impact. Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become satiated by the reward, such that it loses its effectiveness).

==== Coercive power ====
{{Main|Coercive power}}
{{See also|Coercive control}}
[[Coercive]] power is the application of negative influences. It includes the ability to demote or to withhold other rewards. The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld that ensures the obedience of those under power. Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it. Threats and [[Punishment (psychology)|punishment]] are common tools of coercion. Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges, or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power. Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting, and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership. This is a type of power is commonly seen in fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power, it is referred in the industry specific literature's as "glamorization of structural domination and exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/sep/02/academic-exposing-ugly-reality-high-fashion-giulia-mensitieri&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Principles in interpersonal relationships ===
According to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in "Close encounters: Communication in Relationships":&lt;ref&gt;Guerrero, Laura K., and Peter A. Andersen. Close encounters: Communication in Relationships. 3rd ed. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: SAGE, 2011. Print. p.267-261&lt;/ref&gt;
# Power as a Perception: Power is a perception in a sense that some people can have objective power, but still have trouble influencing others. People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others. Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior.
# Power as a Relational Concept: Power exists in relationships. The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner. Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas.
# Power as Resource Based: Power usually represents a struggle over resources. The more scarce and valued resources are, the more intense and protracted are power struggles. The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand. However, scarce resource leads to power only if it's valued within a relationship.
# The Principle of Least Interest and Dependence Power: The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship. Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful, especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them. According to interdependence theory, quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship. The [[principle of least interest]] suggests that if a difference exists in the intensity of positive feelings between partners, the partner who feels the most positive is at a power disadvantage. There's an inverse relationship between interest in relationship and the degree of relational power.
# Power as [[Enabling]] or Disabling: Power can be enabling or disabling. Research{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} has been shown that people are more likely to have an enduring influence on others when they engage in dominant behavior that reflects [[social skill]] rather than [[intimidation]]. Personal power is protective against pressure and excessive [[Social influence|influence]] by others and/or situational stress. People who communicate through self-confidence and expressive, composed behavior tend to be successful in achieving their goals and maintaining good relationships. Power can be disabling when it leads to destructive patterns of communication.  This can lead to the chilling effect where the less powerful person often hesitates to communicate dissatisfaction, and the demand withdrawal pattern which is when one person makes demands and the other becomes defensive and withdraws(mawasha, 2006).Both effects have negative consequences for relational satisfaction.
# Power as a Prerogative: The prerogative principle states that the partner with more power can make and break the rules. Powerful people can violate norms, break relational rules, and manage interactions without as much penalty as powerless people. These actions may reinforce the powerful person's dependence power. In addition, the more powerful person has the prerogative to manage both verbal and nonverbal interactions. They can initiate conversations, change topics, interrupt others, initiate touch, and end discussions more easily than less powerful people. (See [[expressions of dominance]].)

=== Rational choice framework ===
[[Game theory]], with its foundations in the [[Neoclassical economics|Walrasian]] theory of [[Rational choice theory|rational choice]], is increasingly used in various disciplines to help analyze power relationships. One rational choice definition of power is given by [[Keith Dowding]] in his book ''Power''.

In rational choice theory, human individuals or groups can be modelled as 'actors' who choose from a 'choice set' of possible actions in order to try to achieve desired outcomes. An actor's 'incentive structure' comprises (its beliefs about) the costs associated with different actions in the choice set, and the likelihoods that different actions will lead to desired outcomes.

In this setting we can differentiate between:
# '''outcome power''' – the ability of an actor to bring about or help bring about outcomes;
# '''social power''' – the ability of an actor to change the incentive structures of other actors in order to bring about outcomes.

This framework can be used to model a wide range of social interactions where actors have the ability to exert power over others. For example, a 'powerful' actor can take options away from another's choice set; can change the relative costs of actions; can change the likelihood that a given action will lead to a given outcome; or might simply change the other's beliefs about its incentive structure.

As with other models of power, this framework is neutral as to the use of 'coercion'. For example: a threat of violence can change the likely costs and benefits of different actions; so can a financial penalty in a 'voluntarily agreed' contract, or indeed a friendly offer.

=== Cultural hegemony ===
In the [[Marxism|Marxist]] tradition, the [[Italy|Italian]] writer [[Antonio Gramsci]] elaborated the role of [[ideology]] in creating a [[cultural hegemony]], which becomes a means of bolstering the power of [[capitalism]] and of the [[nation-state]]. Drawing on [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] in [[The Prince]], and trying to understand why there had been no [[Communist]] revolution in [[Western Europe]], while it was claimed there had been one in [[Russia]], Gramsci conceptualised this hegemony as a [[centaur]], consisting of two halves. The back end, the beast, represented the more classic, material image of power, power through coercion, through brute force, be it physical or economic. But the capitalist hegemony, he argued, depended even more strongly on the front end, the human face, which projected power through 'consent'. In Russia, this power was lacking, allowing for a revolution. However, in Western Europe, specifically in [[Italy]], capitalism had succeeded in exercising ''consensual'' power, convincing the working classes that their interests were the same as those of capitalists. In this way revolution had been avoided.

While Gramsci stresses the significance of ideology in power structures, Marxist-feminist writers such as Michele Barrett stress the role of ideologies in extolling the virtues of family life. The classic argument to illustrate this point of view is the use of women as a '[[reserve army of labour]]'. In wartime it is accepted that women perform masculine tasks, while after the war the roles are easily reversed. Therefore, according to Barrett, the destruction of capitalist economic relations is necessary but not sufficient for the liberation of women.&lt;ref&gt;Pip Jones, ''Introducing Social Theory'', Polity Press, Cambridge, 2008, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tarnow ===
Tarnow&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.eiilmuniversity.ac.in/coursepack/humanities/political_theory.pdf |title=Political Theory |format=PDF |type=Course pack |page=27 |publisher=Eiilm University |location=Sikkim |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517153913/http://www.eiilmuniversity.ac.in/coursepack/humanities/political_theory.pdf |archivedate=May 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; considers what power hijackers have over air plane passengers and draws similarities with power in the military. He shows that power over an individual can be amplified by the presence of a group. If the group conforms to the leader's commands, the leader's power over an individual is greatly enhanced while if the group does not conform the leader's power over an individual is nil.

=== Foucault ===
For [[Michel Foucault]], the real power will always rely on the ignorance of its agents. No single human, group nor single actor runs the dispositif (machine or apparatus) but power is dispersed through the apparatus as efficiently and silently as possible, ensuring its agents to do whatever is necessary. It is because of this action that power is unlikely to be detected that it remains elusive to 'rational' investigation. Foucault quotes a text reputedly written by political economist [[Jean Baptiste Antoine Auget de Montyon]], entitled ''Recherches et considérations sur la population de la France'' (1778), but turns out to be written by his secretary [[Jean-Baptise Moheau]] (1745–1794) and by emphasizing [[Biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] who constantly refers to [[Milieu]]s as a plural adjective and sees into the milieu as an expression as nothing more than water air and light confirming the genus within the milieu, in this case the human species, relates to a function of the population and its social and political interaction in which both form an artificial and natural milieu. This milieu(both artificial and natural) appears as a target of intervention for power according to Foucault which is radically different from the previous notions on sovereignty, territory and disciplinary space inter woven into from a social and political relations which function as a species (biological species).&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Lectures at the College de France, 1977–78: Security, Territory, Population'', 2007, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foucault originated and developed the concept of "docile bodies" in his book ''Discipline and Punish.'' He writes, "A body is docile that may be subjected, used, transformed and improved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32367111|title=Discipline and punish : the birth of the prison|last=1926-1984.|first=Foucault, Michel,|date=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679752552|edition= 2nd Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=32367111}}&lt;/ref&gt; " Foucault claims that there is a shift, during the 18th century, in which political power changed. Instead of using corporeal punishment in order to convince people to adhere to the laws of the day, Foucault says power becomes internalized during this period. Instead of watching someone be drawn and quartered in a public space, political power is exerted on individuals in a way that compels them to obey laws and rules on their own - without this show of force. He builds on the ideas of [[Jeremy Bentham]] regarding the [[Panopticon]] in which prison inmates are compelled to behave and control themselves because they might be in the view of the prison guard. The physical shape of the Panopticon creates a situation in which the prison guard need not be present for this to happen, because the mere possibility of the presence of the guard compels the prisoners to behave. Foucault takes this theory and makes it generalize to everyday life. He claims that this kind of surveillance is constant in modern society, and the populous at large enacts it. Therefore, everyone begins to control themselves and behave according to society's rules and norms.

Feminist philosophers took up Foucault's ideas regarding docile bodies and applied them to the different ways men and women are socialized to use their bodies. For one example, philosopher Sandra Bartky says in her essay, ""Foucault, Femininity, and the Modernization of Patriarchal Power" that “The disciplinary techniques through which the ‘docile bodies’ of women are constructed aim at a regulation that is perpetual and exhaustive - a regulation of the body’s size and contours, its appetite, posture, gestures and general comportment in space, and the appearance of each of its visible parts.&lt;ref&gt;Bartky, Sandra Lee. ''Foucault, femininity, and the modernization of patriarchal power''. na, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;" Bartky theorizes that there is a specific and relentless pressure on women when it comes to bodily movements and comportment; this "docility" manifests as women make themselves smaller, groom themselves in ways that make them appear more feminine, and control their bodily movements in order to be as minimally obtrusive as possible. She also cites diet, exercise, and skin care, among other processes, as sites in which the feminine body is made docile.

=== Clegg ===
[[Stewart Clegg]] proposes another three-dimensional model with his "circuits of power"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deji|2011|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA267 267]}}&lt;/ref&gt; theory. This model likens the production and organizing of power to an electric circuit board consisting of three distinct interacting circuits: episodic, dispositional, and facilitative. These circuits operate at three levels, two are macro and one is micro. The ''episodic circuit'' is the micro level and is constituted of irregular exercise of power as agents address feelings, communication, conflict, and resistance in day-to-day interrelations. The outcomes of the episodic circuit are both positive and negative. The ''dispositional circuit'' is constituted of macro level rules of practice and socially constructed meanings that inform member relations and legitimate authority. The ''facilitative circuit'' is constituted of macro level technology, environmental contingencies, job design, and networks, which empower or disempower and thus punish or reward, agency in the episodic circuit. All three independent circuits interact at "obligatory passage points" which are channels for [[empowerment]] or disempowerment.

=== Galbraith ===
[[John Kenneth Galbraith|JK Galbraith]] summarizes the types of power as being "condign" (based on force), "compensatory" (through the use of various resources) or "conditioned" (the result of [[persuasion]]), and their sources as "personality" (individuals), "property" (their material resources) and "organizational" (whoever sits at the top of an organisational power structure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galbraith|first=John Kenneth|authorlink=John Kenneth Galbraith|title=[[The Anatomy of Power]]|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene Sharp ===
[[Gene Sharp]], an American professor of political science, believes that power depends ultimately on its bases. Thus a political regime maintains power because people accept and obey its dictates, laws and policies. Sharp cites the insight of [[Étienne de La Boétie]].

Sharp's key theme is that power is not monolithic; that is, it does not derive from some intrinsic quality of those who are in power. For Sharp, political power, the power of any state – regardless of its particular structural organization – ultimately derives from the subjects of the state. His fundamental belief is that any power structure relies upon the subjects' obedience to the orders of the ruler(s). If subjects do not obey, leaders have no power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Gene|title=From dictatorship to democracy: A conceptual framework for liberation|publisher=The Albert Einstein Institution|location=East Boston, MA|url=http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf|format=PDF|date=May 2010|edition= 4th U.S.|isbn=978-1-880813-09-6}} (See [[From dictatorship to democracy|book article]].)&lt;/ref&gt;

His work is thought to have been influential in the overthrow of [[Slobodan Milosevic]], in the 2011 [[Arab Spring]], and other [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent]] revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrow|first1=Ruaridh|title=Gene Sharp: Author of the nonviolent revolution rulebook|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12522848|website=BBC News|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Björn Kraus ===
[[Björn Kraus]] deals with the [[epistemology|epistemological]] perspective upon power regarding the question about possibilities of interpersonal influence by developing a special form of [[constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] (named [[relational constructivism]]).&lt;ref&gt;Heiko Kleve: ''Vom Erweitern der Möglichkeiten''. In: [[Bernhard Pörksen]] (ed.): ''Schlüsselwerke des Konstruktivismus''. VS-Verlag, Wiesbaden/Germany 2011. pp. 506–519, p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focussing on the valuation and distribution of power, he asks first and foremost what the term can describe at all.&lt;ref name=Kraus2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kraus|first1=Björn|title=Introducing a Model for Analyzing the Possibilities of Power, Help and Control|journal=Social Work &amp; Society|date=2014|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:hbz:464-sws-582|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming from [[Max Weber]]'s definition of power,&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber: ''Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft.

By using this distinction, proportions of power can be analyzed in a more sophisticated way, helping to sufficiently reflect on matters of responsibility.&lt;ref name=Kraus2013&gt;See Björn Kraus: ''Erkennen und Entscheiden. Grundlagen und Konsequenzen eines erkenntnistheoretischen Konstruktivismus für die Soziale Arbeit''. Beltz Juventa, Weinheim/Basel 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|139 f.}} This perspective permits to get over an "either-or-position" (either there is power, or there isn't), which is common especially in epistemological discourses about power theories,&lt;ref&gt;Reimund Böse, Günter Schiepek: ''Systemische Theorie und Therapie: ein Handwörterbuch''.

Suhrkamp, Frankfurt am Main/Germany 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and to introduce the possibility of an "as well as-position".&lt;ref name=Kraus2013/&gt;{{Rp|120}}

=== Unmarked categories ===
The idea of ''unmarked categories'' originated in [[feminism]]. The theory analyzes the culture of the powerful. The powerful comprise those people in society with easy access to resources, those who can exercise power without considering their actions. For the powerful, their culture seems obvious; for the powerless, on the other hand, it remains out of reach, élite and expensive.

The ''unmarked category'' can form the identifying mark of the powerful. The unmarked category becomes the standard against which to measure everything else. For most Western readers, it is posited that if a protagonist's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[Whites|Caucasian]]; if a sexual identity is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is [[heterosexual]]; if the gender of a body is not indicated, will be assumed by the reader that it is [[male]]; if a disability is not indicated, it will be assumed by the reader that the protagonist is able bodied, just as a set of examples.

One can often overlook unmarked categories. Whiteness forms an unmarked category not commonly visible to the powerful, as they often fall within this category. The unmarked category becomes the norm, with the other categories relegated to deviant status. Social groups can apply this view of power to race, [[gender identity|gender]], and [[disability]] without modification: the able body is the neutral body.

=== Counterpower ===
{{Main|Dual power (leftist theory)}}
The term 'counter-power' (sometimes written 'counterpower') is used in a range of situations to describe the countervailing force that can be utilised by the oppressed to counterbalance or erode the power of elites. A general definition has been provided by the anthropologist David Graeber as 'a collection of social institutions set in opposition to the state and capital: from self-governing communities to radical labor unions to popular militias'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Graeber|first=David|title=Fragments of an anarchist anthropology|year=2004|publisher=Prickly Paradigm Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-9728196-4-9|page=24|edition= 2nd pr.}} The examples given (self-governing communities, radical labour unions, popular militias) reflect the Idea/Economics/Physical taxonomy&lt;/ref&gt; Graeber also notes that counter-power can also be referred to as 'anti-power' and 'when institutions [of counter-power] maintain themselves in the face of the state, this is usually referred to as a 'dual power' situation'.&lt;ref name="David Graeber"/&gt;  [[Tim Gee]], in his 2011 book ''Counterpower: Making Change Happen'',&lt;ref name="gee"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|title=Counter power : making change happen|date=2011|publisher=World Changing|location=Oxford|isbn=1780260326}}&lt;/ref&gt; put forward a theory that those disempowered by governments' and elite groups' power can use ''counterpower'' to counter this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Newton|first=Mark|title=Counterpower: Making Change Happen (book review)|journal=The Ecologist|date=17 November 2011|url=http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/1135297/counterpower_making_change_happen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Gee's model, ''counterpower'' is split into three categories: ''idea counterpower'', ''economic counterpower'', and ''physical counterpower''.&lt;ref name="gee" /&gt;

Although the term has come to prominence through its use by participants in the global justice/[[anti-globalization movement]] of the 1990s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|issue=360|date=September 2003|journal=New Internationalist|first=Graeme|last=Chesters|title=Ideas about power: Representation and counterpower|url=http://newint.org/features/2003/09/01/theories-of-power/|quote=Counterpower is the shadow realm of alternatives, a hall of mirrors held up to the dominant logic of capitalism – and it is growing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word has been used for at least 60 years; for instance [[Martin Buber]]'s 1949 book 'Paths in Utopia' includes the line 'Power abdicates only under the stress of counter-power'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buber|first1=Martin|title=Paths in Utopia|date=1996|publisher=Syracuse University Press|location=Syracuse, NY|isbn=9780815604211|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MXGSnCcRaUwC&amp;pg=PA104 104]|edition= Reprint|origyear=1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gee2011Introduction&gt;{{cite book|last=Gee|first=Tim|chapter=Introduction|title=Counter Power Making Change Happen|date=2011|chapterurl=http://www.newint.org/books/politics/2011/09/20/reviews%2C%20introduction%20%26%20contents.pdf|isbn=978-1-78026-032-7|location=Oxford|publisher=New Internationalist}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|13}}

=== Other theories ===
* [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) defined power as a man's "present means, to obtain some future apparent good" (''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', Ch. 10).
* The thought of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] underlies much 20th century analysis of power. Nietzsche disseminated ideas on the "[[will to power]]," which he saw as the domination of other humans as much as the exercise of control over one's environment.
* Some schools of [[psychology]], notably that associated with [[Alfred Adler]], place power dynamics at the core of their theory (where orthodox [[Freudian]]s might place [[human sexuality|sexuality]]).

== Psychological research ==
Recent experimental psychology suggests that the more power one has, the less one takes on the perspective of others, implying that the powerful have less [[empathy]]. [[Adam Galinsky]], along with several coauthors, found that when those who are reminded of their powerlessness are instructed to draw Es on their forehead, they are 3 times more likely to draw them such that they are legible to others than those who are reminded of their power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Lauren|title=Power Hour: Psychology test at the Time 100 party|journal=New Yorker|date=26 May 2008|url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2008/05/26/080526ta_talk_collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academics and Faculty: Adam Galinsky|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|website=Kellogg School of Management|publisher=Northwestern University|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501191910/http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/bio/galinsky.htm|archivedate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powerful people are also more likely to take action. In one example, powerful people turned off an irritatingly close fan twice as much as less powerful people.

=== Empathy gap ===
{{Main| Empathy gap}}

"''Power is defined as a possibility to influence others.''"&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149"/&gt;{{Rp|1137}}

The use of power has evolved from centuries.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Gaining prestige, honor and reputation is one of the central motives for gaining power in human nature.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Power also relates with empathy gaps because it limits the interpersonal relationship and compares the power differences. Having power or not having power can cause a number of psychological consequences. It leads to strategic versus social responsibilities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Research experiments were done{{by whom|date=March 2017}} as early as 1968 to explore power conflict.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Handgraaf|first= Michel J. J. |author2= Van Dijk, Eric |author3= Vermunt, Riël C. |author4= Wilke, Henk A. M. |author5= De Dreu, Carsten K. W. |title= Less power or powerless?

==== Past research ====
Earlier{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that increased power relates to increased rewards and leads one to approach things more frequently.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} In contrast, decreased power relates to more constraint, threat and punishment which leads to inhibitions. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that being powerful leads one to successful outcomes, to develop negotiation strategies and to make more self-serving offers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Later{{when|date=March 2017}}, research proposed that differences in power lead to strategic considerations. Being strategic can also mean to defend when one is opposed or to hurt the decision-maker. It was concluded{{by whom|date=March 2017}} that facing one with more power leads to strategic consideration whereas facing one with less power leads to a social responsibility.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

==== Bargaining games ====
Bargaining games were explored{{by whom|date=March 2017}} in 2003 and 2004. These studies compared behavior done in different power given{{clarify|date=March 2017}} situations.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In an ''ultimatum game'', the person in given power offers an ultimatum and the recipient would have to accept that offer or else both the proposer and the recipient will receive no reward.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

In a ''dictator game'', the person in given power offers a proposal and the recipient would have to accept that offer. The recipient has no choice of rejecting the offer.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

===== Conclusion =====
The dictator game gives no power to the recipient whereas the ultimatum game gives some power to the recipient. The behavior observed was that the person offering the proposal would act less strategically than would the one offering in the ultimatum game. [[Self-serving]] also occurred and a lot of pro-social behavior was observed.&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

When the counterpart recipient is completely powerless, lack of strategy, social responsibility and moral consideration is often observed from the behavior of the proposal given (the one with the power).&lt;ref name="Handgraaf 1136–1149" /&gt;

=== Abusive power and control ===
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) involve the ways in which abusers gain and maintain power and control over victims for [[abusive]] purposes such as [[psychological abuse| psychological]], [[physical abuse| physical]], [[sexual abuse| sexual]], or [[financial abuse| financial]] abuse. Such abuse can have various causes - such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation| devaluation]], [[envy]] or just for the sake of it - as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism| economic abuse]], thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

== Tactics ==
In everyday situations people use a variety of power tactics to push or prompt people into particular action. There are plenty of examples of power tactics that are quite common and employed every day. Some of these tactics include [[bullying]], collaboration, complaining, criticizing, demanding, disengaging, evading, humor, inspiring, [[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]], negotiating, socializing, and supplicating. These power tactics can be classified along three different dimensions:&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Falbo | first1 = Toni | last2 = Peplau | first2 = Letitia A.  | title = Power strategies in intimate relationships | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 618–628 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | date = April 1980 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.38.4.618 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://www.peplaulab.ucla.edu/Peplau_Lab/Publications_files/Falbo%20%26%20Peplau%201980.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Raven | first1 = Bertram H. | last2 = Schwarzwald | first2 = Joseph | last3 = Koslowsky | first3 = Meni | title = Conceptualizing and measuring a power/interaction model of interpersonal influence | journal = [[Journal of Applied Social Psychology]] | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 307–332 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | date = February 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1998.tb01708.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Soft power|Soft]] and [[Hard power|hard]]''': Soft tactics take advantage of the relationship between person and the target. They are more indirect and interpersonal (e.g., collaboration, socializing). Conversely, hard tactics are harsh, forceful, direct, and rely on concrete outcomes. However, they are not more powerful than soft tactics. In many circumstances, fear of [[social exclusion]] can be a much stronger motivator than some kind of physical punishment.
# '''Rational and nonrational''': Rational tactics of influence make use of reasoning, logic, and sound judgment, whereas nonrational tactics rely on emotionality and misinformation. Examples of each include bargaining and persuasion, and evasion and put downs, respectively.
# '''Unilateral and bilateral''': Bilateral tactics, such as collaboration and negotiation, involve reciprocity on the part of both the person influencing and their target. Unilateral tactics, on the other hand, are enacted without any participation on the part of the target. These tactics include disengagement and [[fait accompli]].

People tend to vary in their use of power tactics, with different types of people opting for different tactics. For instance, interpersonally oriented people tend to use soft and rational tactics.&lt;ref name="Falbo, T. 1980"/&gt; [[Machiavellians]], however, tend to use nonrational tactics. Moreover, extroverts use a greater variety of power tactics than do introverts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bratko | first1 = Denis | last2 = Butkovic | first2 = Ana | title = Stability of genetic and environmental effects from adolescence to young adulthood: Results of Croatian longitudinal twin study of personality | journal = [[Twin Research and Human Genetics]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 151–157 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press|Cambridge Journals]] | doi = 10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | date = February 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1375/twin.10.1.151 | pmid = 17539374 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; People will also choose different tactics based on the group situation, and based on whom they are trying to influence.

=== Balance of power ===
Because power operates both relationally and reciprocally, [[sociologists]] speak of the balance of power between parties to a [[personal relationship|relationship]]: all parties to all relationships have ''some'' power: the sociological examination of power concerns itself with discovering and describing the relative strengths: equal or unequal, stable or subject to periodic change. Sociologists usually analyse relationships in which the parties have relatively equal or nearly equal power in terms of ''constraint'' rather than of power. Thus 'power' has a connotation of unilateralism. If this were not so, then all relationships could be described in terms of 'power', and its meaning would be lost. Given that power is not innate and can be granted to others, to acquire power you must possess or control a form of power currency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCornack|first=Steven|title=Reflect &amp; Relate: An introduction to interpersonal communication|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|location=Boston/NY|isbn=0-312-48934-X|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approach/inhibition theory ===
Developed by D. Keltner and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, D., Gruenfeld, D.H., &amp; Anderson, C. (2003). Power, approach, and inhibition. ''Psychological Review, 110,'' 265-284.&lt;/ref&gt; approach/inhibition theory assumes that having power and using power alters psychological states of individuals. The theory is based on the notion that most organisms react to environmental events in two common ways. The reaction of ''approach'' is associated with action, self-promotion, seeking rewards, increased energy and movement. ''Inhibition'', on the contrary, is associated with self-protection, avoiding threats or danger, vigilance, loss of motivation and an overall reduction in activity.

Overall, approach/inhibition theory holds that power promotes approach tendencies, while reduction in power promotes inhibition tendencies.

== Reactions ==

=== Tactics ===
A number of studies demonstrate that harsh power tactics (e.g. punishment (both personal and impersonal), rule-based sanctions, and non-personal rewards) are less effective than soft tactics (expert power, referent power, and personal rewards).&lt;ref&gt;Fiske, S. T., &amp; Berdahl, J. L. (2007). Social power. In A. Kruglanski &amp; E. T. Higgins (Eds.), Social psychology: A handbook of basic principles (2nd ed.). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierro, A., Cicero, L., &amp; Raven, B. H. (2008). Motivated compliance with bases of social power. ''Journal of Applied Social Psychology, 38,'' 1921–1944.&lt;/ref&gt; It is probably because harsh tactics generate hostility, depression, fear, and anger, while soft tactics are often reciprocated with cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Krause D. E. (2006) Power and influence in the context of organizational innovation. In Schriesheim C. A., Neider L. L. (Eds.), Power and influence in organizations: new empirical and theoretical perspectives (A volume in research in management). Hartford, CT: Information Age. Pp. 21–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercive and reward power can also lead group members to lose interest in their work, while instilling a feeling of autonomy in one’s subordinates can sustain their interest in work and maintain high productivity even in the absence of monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Pelletier, L. G., &amp; Vallerand, R. J. (1996). Supervisors’ beliefs and subordinates’ intrinsic motivation: A behavioral confirmation analysis. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 71,'' 331–340.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coercive influence creates conflict that can disrupt entire group functioning. When disobedient group members are severely reprimanded, the rest of the group may become more disruptive and uninterested in their work, leading to negative and inappropriate activities spreading from one troubled member to the rest of the group. This effect is called ''Disruptive contagion or ripple effect'' and it is strongly manifested when reprimanded member has a high status within a group, and authority’s requests are vague and ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;Kounin, J., &amp; Gump, P. (1958). The ripple effect in discipline. ''Elementary School Journal, 59,'' 158–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resistance to coercive influence ===
Coercive influence can be tolerated when the group is successful,&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Lawler, E. J. (1975). Endorsement of formal leaders: An integrative model. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31,'' 216-223.&lt;/ref&gt; the leader is trusted, and the use of coercive tactics is justified by group norms.&lt;ref&gt;Michener, H. A., &amp; Burt, M.R. (1975) Components of authority as determinants of compliance. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 31'', 606-614.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, coercive methods are more effective when applied frequently and consistently to punish prohibited actions.&lt;ref&gt;Molm, L. D. (1994) Is Punishment Effective? Coercive Strategies in Social Exchange. ''Social Psychology Quarterly, 57,'' 75-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in some cases, group members chose to resist the authority’s influence. When low-power group members have a feeling of shared identity, they are more likely to form a ''Revolutionary Coalition'', a subgroup formed within a larger group that seeks to disrupt and oppose the group’s authority structure.&lt;ref&gt;Lawler, E. J. (1975a). An experimental study of factors affecting the mobilization of revolutionary coalitions. ''Sociometry, 38,'' 163-179.&lt;/ref&gt; Group members are more likely to form a revolutionary coalition and resist an authority when authority lacks referent power, uses coercive methods, and asks group members to carry out unpleasant assignments. It is because these conditions create ''reactance'', a complex emotional and cognitive reaction that occurs when individuals feel that their freedom to make choices has been threatened or eliminated.  When reactance occurs, individuals strive to reassert their sense of freedom by affirming their authority.

=== Kelman's compliance-identification-internalization theory of conversion ===
Herbert Kelman&lt;ref&gt;[null Kelman, H. (1958). Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change. ''Journal of Conflict Resolution'', 1, 51-60].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelman, H.C. Processes of opinion change. Public Opinion Quarterly, 25, 57–78.&lt;/ref&gt; identified three basic, step-like reactions that people display in response to coercive influence: [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], and [[internalization]]. This theory explains how groups convert hesitant recruits into zealous followers over time.

At the stage of ''compliance,'' group members comply with authority’s demands, but personally do not agree with them. If authority does not monitor the members, they will probably not obey.

''Identification'' occurs when the target of the influence admires and therefore imitates the authority, mimics authority’s actions, values, characteristics, and takes on behaviours of the person with power. If prolonged and continuous, identification can lead to the final stage – internalization.

When ''internalization'' occurs, individual adopts the induced behaviour because it is congruent with his/her value system. At this stage, group members no longer carry out authority orders but perform actions that are congruent with their personal beliefs and opinions. Extreme obedience often requires internalization.

==Power literacy==
Power literacy refers to how one perceives power, how it is formed and accumulates, and the structures that support it and who is in control of it.

'''Problem solving''' consists of using generic or ''ad hoc'' methods in an orderly manner to find solutions to problems. Some of the problem-solving techniques developed and used in [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer science]], [[engineering]], [[mathematics]], or [[medicine]] are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in [[psychology]].

== Definition ==
The term ''problem solving'' means slightly different things depending on the discipline. For instance, it is a mental process in [[psychology]] and a computerized process in [[computer science]]. There are two different types of problems, ill-defined and well-defined: different approaches are used for each. Well-defined problems have specific goals and clear expected solutions, while ill-defined problems do not. Well-defined problems allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp. 376&lt;/ref&gt; Solving problems sometimes involves dealing with [[pragmatics]], the way that context contributes to meaning, and [[semantics]], the interpretation of the problem. The ability to understand what the goal of the problem is, and what rules could be applied, represents the key to solving the problem. Sometimes the problem requires [[abstract thinking]] or coming up with a creative solution.

=== Psychology ===
Problem solving in [[psychology]] refers to the process of finding solutions to problems encountered in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerrold R. Brandell|title=Theory and Practice in Clinical Social Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Hm0UuFGJ0C&amp;pg=PA189|year=1997|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-684-82765-0|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solutions to these problems are usually situation- or context-specific. The process starts with [[problem finding]] and [[problem shaping]], where the problem is discovered and simplified. The next step is to generate possible solutions and evaluate them. Finally a solution is selected to be implemented and verified. Problems have a ''goal'' to be reached and how you get there depends upon problem orientation (problem-solving coping style and skills) and systematic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;What is a problem? in S. Ian Robertson, Problem solving, Psychology Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Mental health professionals study the human problem solving processes using methods such as [[introspection]], [[behaviorism]], [[simulation]], [[computer modeling]], and [[experiment]]. Social psychologists look into the person-environment relationship aspect of the problem and independent and interdependent problem-solving methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = M. | last2 = Watt | first2 = S.

Problem solving has two major domains: [[Mathematical problem|mathematical problem solving]] and personal problem solving. Both are seen in terms of some difficulty or barrier that is encountered.&lt;ref name="Zimmermann"&gt;Bernd Zimmermann, ''On mathematical problem solving processes and history of mathematics'', University of Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical research shows many different strategies and factors influence everyday problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vallacher |first1=Robin |last2=M.

Interpersonal everyday problem solving is dependent upon the individual personal motivational and contextual components. One such component is the [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]] of "real-world" problems and it can either impede or aid problem-solving performance. Researchers have focused on the role of emotions in problem solving ,&lt;ref name="DZurilla1971"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Zurilla | first1 = T. J. | last2 = Goldfried | first2 = M.

=== Cognitive sciences ===
The early experimental work of the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestaltist]]s in [[Germany]] placed the beginning of problem solving study (e.g., [[Karl Duncker]] in 1935 with his book ''The psychology of productive thinking''&lt;ref name=Duncker&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Duncker| reference= Duncker, K. (1935). ''Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens'' [The psychology of productive thinking]. Berlin: Julius Springer.}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;For example Duncker's "X-ray" problem; Ewert &amp; Lambert's "disk" problem in 1932, later known as [[Tower of Hanoi]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Mayer| reference= Mayer, R. E. (1992). ''Thinking, problem solving, cognition''. Second edition. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of simple, novel tasks was due to the clearly defined [[optimal solution]]s and short time for solving, which made it possible for the researchers to trace participants' steps in problem-solving process. Researchers' underlying assumption was that simple tasks such as the [[Tower of Hanoi]] correspond to the main properties of "[[Reality|real world]]" problems and thus the characteristic [[cognitive process]]es within participants' attempts to solve simple problems are the same for "real world" problems too; simple problems were used for reasons of convenience and with the expectation that thought generalizations to more complex problems would become possible. Perhaps the best-known and most impressive example of this line of research is the work by [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]].&lt;ref name=Newell&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Newell| reference= Newell, A., &amp; Simon, H. A. (1972). ''Human problem solving''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Synthesis inline|date=September 2018}} Other experts have shown that the principle of [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] improves the ability of the problem solver to make good judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/ideas/pdf/armstrong2/DecompositionPrinciple.pdf | title = The Use of the Decomposition Principle in Making Judgments | author = J.

=== Computer science ===

{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}

In [[computer science]] and in the part of [[artificial intelligence]] that deals with algorithms ("algorithmics"), problem solving includes techniques of  [[algorithm]]s, [[heuristic]]s and [[root cause analysis]]. In these disciplines, problem solving is part of a larger process that encompasses problem determination, [[Data deduplication|de-duplication]], analysis, diagnosis, repair, and other steps.

Other problem solving tools are linear and nonlinear programming, [[queuing systems]], and [[simulation]].&lt;ref name='MalakootiMCDM'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Malakooti|first1=Behnam|title=Operations and Production Systems with Multiple Objectives|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-58537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Engineering ===
Problem solving is used when products or processes fail, so corrective action can be taken to prevent further [[failure]]s. It can also be applied to a product or process prior to an actual failure event&amp;mdash;when a potential problem can be predicted and analyzed, and mitigation applied so the problem never actually occurs. Techniques such as [[failure mode and effects analysis]] can be used to proactively reduce the likelihood of problems occurring.

[[Forensic engineering]] is an important technique of [[failure analysis]] that involves tracing product defects and flaws. Corrective action can then be taken to prevent further failures.

Reverse engineering attempts to discover the original problem-solving logic used in developing a product by taking it apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://litemind.com/problem-definition/|title=Einstein's Secret to Amazing Problem Solving (and 10 Specific Ways You Can Use It) - Litemind|website=litemind.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military science ===
In [[military science]], problem solving is linked to the concept of "end-states", the desired condition or situation that strategists wish to generate.&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Commander's Handbook for Strategic Communication and Communication Strategy |url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/jfcom/cc_handbook_sc_27oct2009.pdf |publisher=[[United States Joint Forces Command]], Joint Warfighting Center, Suffolk, VA |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=10 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiii, E-2}} The ability to solve problems is important at any [[military rank]], but is highly critical at the [[command and control]] level, where it is strictly correlated to the deep understanding of qualitative and quantitative scenarios.{{clarify |date=September 2018 |reason=What scenarios?}} ''Effectiveness'' of problem solving is used to measure the result of problem solving, tied to accomplishing the goal.&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"/&gt;{{rp|IV-24}} ''Planning'' for problem-solving is the process of determining how to achieve the goal&lt;ref name="USJFCOM"/&gt;{{rp|IV-1}}

== Problem-solving strategies ==
{{See also|:Category:Problem solving skills}}
Problem-solving strategies are the steps that one would use to find the problems that are in the way to getting to one's own goal. Some refer to this as the "problem-solving cycle".&lt;ref name="Bransford1993"&gt;{{cite book | author=Bransford, J. D. |author2=Stein, B. S | year = 1993 | title = The ideal problem solver: A guide for improving thinking, learning, and creativity (2nd ed.). |location = New York | publisher = W.H. Freeman. |ref=Reference-Bransford}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy. The reason it is called a cycle is that once one is completed with a problem another will usually pop up.

Blanchard-Fields&lt;ref name="Blanchard-Fields"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blanchard-Fields, F. |year=2007 |title= Everyday problem solving and emotion: An adult developmental perspective |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=26–31 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00469.x |ref=Reference-Blanchard}}&lt;/ref&gt; looks at problem solving from one of two facets. The first looking at those problems that only have one solution (like mathematical problems, or fact-based questions) which are grounded in psychometric intelligence. The other is socioemotional in nature and have answers that change constantly (like what's your favorite color or what you should get someone for Christmas).

The following techniques are usually called ''problem-solving strategies''&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Y., &amp; Chiew, V. (2010). On the cognitive process of human problem solving. Cognitive Systems Research, 11(1), 81-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Abstraction]]: solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
* [[Analogy]]: using a solution that solves an analogous problem
* [[Brainstorming]]: (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
* [[Divide and conquer algorithm|Divide and conquer]]: breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
* [[Hypothesis testing]]: assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
* [[Lateral thinking]]: approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
* [[Means-ends analysis]]: choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal
* [[Method of focal objects]]: synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new
* [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]]: assessing the output and interactions of an entire system

==Common barriers{{anchor|Common_barriers_to_problem_solving}}==
Common barriers to problem solving are mental constructs that impede our ability to correctly solve problems. These barriers prevent people from solving problems in the most efficient manner possible. Five of the most common processes and factors that researchers have identified as barriers to problem solving are [[confirmation bias]], [[mental set]], [[functional fixedness]], unnecessary constraints, and irrelevant information.

===Confirmation bias===
{{Main|Confirmation bias}}
[[Confirmation bias]] is an unintentional bias caused by the collection and use of data in a way that favors a preconceived notion. The beliefs affected by confirmation bias do not need to have ''[[motivation]]'', the desire to defend or find substantiation for beliefs that are important to that person.&lt;ref name="Nickerson1998"&gt;{{cite journal |year=1998 |title=Confirmation bias: A ubiquitous phenomenon in many guises |url=|journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=2 |issue=2 |page=176 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.2.175 |last1=Nickerson |first1=R. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found that professionals within scientific fields of study also experience confirmation bias. Andreas Hergovich, Reinhard Schott, and Christoph Burger's experiment conducted online, for instance, suggested that professionals within the field of psychological research are likely to view scientific studies that agree with their preconceived notions more favorably than studies that clash with their established beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Burger |year=2010 |title=Biased evaluation of abstracts depending on topic and conclusion: Further evidence of a confirmation bias within scientific psychology |journal=Current Psychology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=188–209 |doi=10.1007/s12144-010-9087-5 |last1=Hergovich |first1=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Raymond Nickerson, one can see the consequences of confirmation bias in real-life situations, which range in severity from inefficient government policies to genocide. Nickerson argued that those who killed people accused of [[Witch-hunt|witchcraft]] demonstrated confirmation bias with motivation. Researcher Michael Allen found evidence for confirmation bias with motivation in school children who worked to manipulate their science experiments in such a way that would produce favorable results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Theory-led confirmation bias and experimental persona|url=|journal=Research in Science &amp; Technological Education|volume=29|issue=1|pages=107–127|doi=10.1080/02635143.2010.539973|last1=Allen|first1=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, confirmation bias does not necessarily require motivation. In 1960, [[Peter Cathcart Wason]] conducted an experiment in which participants first viewed three numbers and then created a hypothesis that proposed a rule that could have been used to create that triplet of numbers. When testing their hypotheses, participants tended to only create additional triplets of numbers that would confirm their hypotheses, and tended not to create triplets that would negate or disprove their hypotheses. Thus research also shows that people can and do work to confirm theories or ideas that do not support or engage personally significant beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1960|title=On the failure to eliminate hypotheses in a conceptual task|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=12|issue=3|pages=129–140|doi=10.1080/17470216008416717|last1=Wason|first1=P. C.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental set===
{{Main|Mental set}}
Mental set was first articulated by [[Abraham S. Luchins|Abraham Luchins]] in the 1940s and demonstrated in his well-known water jug experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Luchins, A. S. (1942). Mechanization in problem solving: The effect of Einstellung. Psychological Monographs, 54 (Whole No. 248).&lt;/ref&gt; In these experiments, participants were asked to fill one jug with a specific amount of water using only other jugs (typically three) with different maximum capacities as tools. After Luchins gave his participants a set of water jug problems that could all be solved by employing a single technique, he would then give them a problem that could either be solved using that same technique or a novel and simpler method. Luchins discovered that his participants tended to use the same technique that they had become accustomed to despite the possibility of using a simpler alternative.&lt;ref&gt;Öllinger, Jones, &amp; Knoblich (2008). Investigating the effect of mental set on insight problem solving. ''Experimental Psychology',' 55(4), 269–270.''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus mental set describes one's inclination to attempt to solve problems in such a way that has proved successful in previous experiences. However, as Luchins' work revealed, such methods for finding a solution that have worked in the past may not be adequate or optimal for certain new but similar problems. Therefore, it is often necessary for people to move beyond their mental sets in order to find solutions. This was again demonstrated in [[Norman Maier]]'s 1931 experiment, which challenged participants to solve a problem by using a household object (pliers) in an unconventional manner. Maier observed that participants were often unable to view the object in a way that strayed from its typical use, a phenomenon regarded as a particular form of mental set (more specifically known as functional fixedness, which is the topic of the following section). When people cling rigidly to their mental sets, they are said to be experiencing ''fixation'', a seeming obsession or preoccupation with attempted strategies that are repeatedly unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Wiley1998"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=Expertise as mental set: The effects of domain knowledge in creative problem solving|url=|journal=Memory &amp; Cognition|volume=24|issue=4|pages=716–730|doi=10.3758/bf03211392|last1=Wiley|first1=J}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, researcher Jennifer Wiley worked to reveal that expertise can work to create a mental set in people considered to be experts in their fields, and she gained evidence that the mental set created by expertise could lead to the development of fixation.&lt;ref name="Wiley1998" /&gt;

===Functional fixedness===
{{Main|Functional fixedness}}
Functional fixedness is a specific form of mental set and fixation, which was alluded to earlier in the Maier experiment, and furthermore it is another way in which cognitive bias can be seen throughout daily life. Tim German and Clark Barrett describe this barrier as the fixed design of an object hindering the individual's ability to see it serving other functions. In more technical terms, these researchers explained that "[s]ubjects become "fixed" on the design function of the objects, and problem solving suffers relative to control conditions in which the object's function is not demonstrated."&lt;ref&gt;German, Tim, P., and Barrett, Clark., H. Functional fixedness in a technologically sparse culture. University of California, Santa Barbara. American psychological society. 16 (1), 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Functional fixedness is defined as only having that primary function of the object itself hinder the ability of it serving another purpose other than its original function. In research that highlighted the primary reasons that young children are immune to functional fixedness, it was stated that "functional fixedness...[is when]subjects are hindered in reaching the solution to a problem by their knowledge of an object's conventional function."&lt;ref&gt;German, Tim, P., Defeyter, Margaret A. [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03213010.pdf Immunity to functional fixedness in young children]. University of Essex, Colchester, England. Psychonomic Bulletin and Review. 7 (4), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it is important to note that functional fixedness can be easily expressed in commonplace situations. For instance, imagine the following situation: a man sees a bug on the floor that he wants to kill, but the only thing in his hand at the moment is a can of air freshener. If the man starts looking around for something in the house to kill the bug with instead of realizing that the can of air freshener could in fact be used not only as having its main function as to freshen the air, he is said to be experiencing functional fixedness. The man's knowledge of the can being served as purely an air freshener hindered his ability to realize that it too could have been used to serve another purpose, which in this instance was as an instrument to kill the bug. Functional fixedness can happen on multiple occasions and can cause us to have certain cognitive biases. If people only see an object as serving one primary focus than they fail to realize that the object can be used in various ways other than its intended purpose. This can in turn cause many issues with regards to problem solving. Common sense seems to be a plausible answer to functional fixedness. One could make this argument because it seems rather simple to consider possible alternative uses for an object. Perhaps using common sense to solve this issue could be the most accurate answer within this context. With the previous stated example, it seems as if it would make perfect sense to use the can of air freshener to kill the bug rather than to search for something else to serve that function but, as research shows, this is often not the case.

Functional fixedness limits the ability for people to solve problems accurately by causing one to have a very narrow way of thinking. Functional fixedness can be seen in other types of learning behaviors as well. For instance, research has discovered the presence of functional fixedness in many educational instances. Researchers Furio, Calatayud, Baracenas, and Padilla stated that "... functional fixedness may be found in learning concepts as well as in solving chemistry problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Calatayud|first2=M. L.|last3=Baracenas|first3=S|last4=Padilla|first4=O|year=2000|title=Functional fixedness and functional reduction as common sense reasonings in chemical equilibrium and in geometry and polarity of molecules. Valencia, Spain|url=|journal=Science Education|volume=84|issue=5|last1=Furio|first1=C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was more emphasis on this function being seen in this type of subject and others.

There are several hypotheses in regards to how functional fixedness relates to problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1952|title=Functional fixedness as related to problem solving: A repetition of three experiments. Stanford University. California|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=44|issue=4|page=1952|doi=10.1037/h0062487|last1=Adamson|first1=Robert E}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many ways in which a person can run into problems while thinking of a particular object with having this function. If there is one way in which a person usually thinks of something rather than multiple ways then this can lead to a constraint in how the person thinks of that particular object. This can be seen as narrow minded thinking, which is defined as a way in which one is not able to see or accept certain ideas in a particular context. Functional fixedness is very closely related to this as previously mentioned. This can be done intentionally and or unintentionally, but for the most part it seems as if this process to problem solving is done in an unintentional way.

Functional fixedness can affect problem solvers in at least two particular ways. The first is with regards to time, as functional fixedness causes people to use more time than necessary to solve any given problem. Secondly, functional fixedness often causes solvers to make more attempts to solve a problem than they would have made if they were not experiencing this cognitive barrier. In the worst case, functional fixedness can completely prevent a person from realizing a solution to a problem. Functional fixedness is a commonplace occurrence, which affects the lives of many people.

===Unnecessary constraints===
Unnecessary constraints are another very common barrier that people face while attempting to problem-solve. This particular phenomenon occurs when the subject, trying to solve the problem subconsciously, places boundaries on the task at hand, which in turn forces him or her to strain to be more innovative in their thinking. The solver hits a barrier when they become fixated on only one way to solve their problem, and it becomes increasingly difficult to see anything but the method they have chosen. Typically, the solver experiences this when attempting to use a method they have already experienced success from, and they can not help but try to make it work in the present circumstances as well, even if they see that it is counterproductive.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003"&gt;Kellogg, R. T. (2003). Cognitive psychology (2nd ed.). California: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Groupthink]], or taking on the mindset of the rest of the group members, can also act as an unnecessary constraint while trying to solve problems.&lt;ref&gt;Cottam, Martha L., Dietz-Uhler, Beth, Mastors, Elena, &amp; Preston, &amp; Thomas. (2010). Introduction to Political Psychology (2nd ed.). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the fact that with everybody thinking the same thing, stopping on the same conclusions, and inhibiting themselves to think beyond this. This is very common, but the most well-known example of this barrier making itself present is in the famous example of the dot problem. In this example, there are nine dots lying on a grid three dots across and three dots running up and down. The solver is then asked to draw no more than four lines, without lifting their pen or pencil from the paper. This series of lines should connect all of the dots on the paper. Then, what typically happens is the subject creates an assumption in their mind that they must connect the dots without letting his or her pen or pencil go outside of the square of dots. Standardized procedures like this can often bring mentally invented constraints of this kind,&lt;ref&gt;Meloy, J. R. (1998). The Psychology of Stalking, Clinical and Forensic Perspectives (2nd ed.). London, England: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers have found a 0% correct solution rate in the time allotted for the task to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ormerod|first2=T.C.|last3=Chronicle|first3=E.P.|year=2001|title=Information-processing and insight: A process model of performance on the nine-dot and related problems|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|volume=27|issue=1|pages=176–201|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.1.176|last1=MacGregor|first1=J.N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imposed constraint inhibits the solver to think beyond the bounds of the dots. It is from this phenomenon that the expression "think outside the box" is derived.&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011"&gt;Weiten, Wayne. (2011). Psychology: themes and variations (8th ed.). California: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem can be quickly solved with a dawning of realization, or ''insight''. A few minutes of struggling over a problem can bring these sudden insights, where the solver quickly sees the solution clearly. Problems such as this are most typically solved via insight and can be very difficult for the subject depending on either how they have structured the problem in their minds, how they draw on their past experiences, and how much they juggle this information in their working memories&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011" /&gt; In the case of the nine-dot example, the solver has already been structured incorrectly in their minds because of the constraint that they have placed upon the solution. In addition to this, people experience struggles when they try to compare the problem to their prior knowledge, and they think they must keep their lines within the dots and not go beyond. They do this because trying to envision the dots connected outside of the basic square puts a strain on their working memory.&lt;ref name="Weiten, Wayne 2011" /&gt;

Luckily, the solution to the problem becomes obvious as insight occurs following incremental movements made toward the solution. These tiny movements happen without the solver knowing. Then when the insight is realized fully, the "aha" moment happens for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Novick, L. R., &amp; Bassok, M. (2005). Problem solving. In K. J. Holyoak &amp; R. G. Morrison (Eds.), Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning (Ch. 14, pp. 321-349). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These moments of insight can take a long while to manifest or not so long at other times, but the way that the solution is arrived at after toiling over these barriers stays the same.

===Irrelevant information===
Irrelevant information is information presented within a problem that is unrelated or unimportant to the specific problem.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003" /&gt; Within the specific context of the problem, irrelevant information would serve no purpose in helping solve that particular problem. Often ''irrelevant information'' is detrimental to the problem solving process. It is a common barrier that many people have trouble getting through, especially if they are not aware of it. ''Irrelevant information'' makes solving otherwise relatively simple problems much harder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=From walls to windows: Using barriers as pathways to insightful solutions|url=|journal=The Journal of Creative Behavior|volume=44|issue=3|pages=143–167|doi=10.1002/j.2162-6057.2010.tb01331.x|last1=Walinga|first1=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: "Fifteen percent of the people in Topeka have unlisted telephone numbers. You select 200 names at random from the Topeka phone book. How many of these people have unlisted phone numbers?"&lt;ref&gt;Weiten, Wayne. (2011). Psychology: themes and variations (8th ed.) California: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people that are not listed in the phone book would not be among the 200 names you selected. The individuals looking at this task would have naturally wanted to use the 15% given to them in the problem. They see that there is information present and they immediately think that it needs to be used. This of course is not true. These kinds of questions are often used to test students taking aptitude tests or cognitive evaluations.&lt;ref name="Walinga, Jennifer 2011"&gt;Walinga, Jennifer, Cunningham, J. Barton, &amp; MacGregor, James N. (2011). Training insight problem solving through focus on barriers and assumptions. The Journal of Creative Behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; They aren't meant to be difficult but they are meant to require thinking that is not necessarily common. ''Irrelevant Information'' is commonly represented in math problems, word problems specifically, where numerical information is put for the purpose of challenging the individual.

One reason irrelevant information is so effective at keeping a person off topic and away from the relevant information, is in how it is represented.&lt;ref name="Walinga, Jennifer 2011" /&gt; The way information is represented can make a vast difference in how difficult the problem is to be overcome. Whether a problem is represented visually, verbally, spatially, or mathematically, irrelevant information can have a profound effect on how long a problem takes to be solved; or if it's even possible. The Buddhist monk problem is a classic example of irrelevant information and how it can be represented in different ways:

::A Buddhist monk begins at dawn one day walking up a mountain, reaches the top at sunset, meditates at the top for several days until one dawn when he begins to walk back to the foot of the mountain, which he reaches at sunset. Making no assumptions about his starting or stopping or about his pace during the trips, prove that there is a place on the path which he occupies at the same hour of the day on the two separate journeys.

This problem is near impossible to solve because of how the information is represented. Because it is written out in a way that represents the information verbally, it causes us to try and create a mental image of the paragraph. This is often very difficult to do especially with all the ''irrelevant information'' involved in the question. This example is made much easier to understand when the paragraph is represented visually. Now if the same problem was asked, but it was also accompanied by a corresponding graph, it would be far easier to answer this question; ''irrelevant information'' no longer serves as a road block. By representing the problem visually, there are no difficult words to understand or scenarios to imagine. The visual representation of this problem has removed the difficulty of solving it.

These types of representations are often used to make difficult problems easier.&lt;ref&gt;Vlamings, Petra H. J. M., Hare, Brian, &amp; Call, Joseph. Reaching around barriers: The performance of great apes and 3-5-year-old children. ''Animal Cognition'', 13, 273-285. {{DOI|10.1007/s10071-009-0265-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be used on tests as a strategy to remove ''Irrelevant Information,'' which is one of the most common forms of barriers when discussing the issues of problem solving.&lt;ref name="Kellogg, R. T. 2003" /&gt; Identifying crucial information presented in a problem and then being able to correctly identify its usefulness is essential. Being aware of ''irrelevant information'' is the first step in overcoming this common barrier.

=== Dreaming: problem-solving without waking consciousness ===

Problem solving can also occur without waking consciousness.  There are many reports of scientists and engineers who solved problems in their dreams.  [[Elias Howe]], inventor of the sewing machine, figured out the structure of the bobbin from a dream.&lt;ref&gt;Kaempffert, W. (1924) ''A Popular History of American Invention.'' New York: Scribners.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chemist [[August Kekulé]] was considering how benzene arranged its six carbon and hydrogen atoms. Thinking about the problem, he dozed off, and dreamt of dancing atoms that fell into a snakelike pattern, which led him to discover the benzene ring. As Kekulé wrote in his diary, "One of the snakes seized hold of its own tail, and the form whirled mockingly before my eyes.  As if by a flash of lightning I awoke; and this time also I spent the rest of the night in working out the consequences of the hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;Kekulé, A. (1890) Benzolfest-Rede. ''Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft'', 23: 1302-1311. Trans. Benfey, O., (1958) Kekulé and the birth of the structural theory of organic chemistry in 1858. ''Journal of Chemical Education'', 35: 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

There also are empirical studies of how people can think consciously about a problem before going to sleep, and then solve the problem with a dream image.  Dream researcher [[William C. Dement]] told his undergraduate class of 500 students that he wanted them to think about an infinite series, whose first elements were OTTFF, to see if they could deduce the principle behind it and to say what the next elements of the series would be.&lt;ref name="Dement 1972"&gt;Dement, W.C. (1972). ''Some Must Watch While Some Just Sleep''. New York: Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt;  He asked them to think about this problem every night for 15 minutes before going to sleep and to write down any dreams that they then had.  They were instructed to think about the problem again for 15 minutes when they awakened in the morning.

The sequence OTTFF is the first letters of the numbers: one, two, three, four, five. The next five elements of the series are SSENT (six, seven, eight, nine, ten). Some of the students solved the puzzle by reflecting on their dreams. One example was a student who reported the following dream:&lt;ref name="Dement 1972"/&gt;
 
{{quote|I was standing in an art gallery, looking at the paintings on the wall. As I walked down the hall, I began to count the paintings: one, two, three, four, five. As I came to the sixth and seventh, the paintings had been ripped from their frames. I stared at the empty frames with a peculiar feeling that some mystery was about to be solved. Suddenly I realized that the sixth and seventh spaces were the solution to the problem!}}

With more than 500 undergraduate students, 87 dreams were judged to be related to the problems students were assigned (53 directly related and 34 indirectly related). Yet of the people who had dreams that apparently solved the problem, only seven were actually able to consciously know the solution. The rest (46 out of 53) thought they did not know the solution.

Mark Blechner conducted this experiment and obtained results similar to Dement's.&lt;ref name="Blechner 2018"&gt;Blechner, M. J. (2018) ''The Mindbrain and Dreams: An Exploration of Dreaming, Thinking, and Artistic Creation''. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that while trying to solve the problem, people had dreams in which the solution appeared to be obvious from the dream, but it was rare for the dreamers to realize how their dreams had solved the puzzle. Coaxing or hints did not get them to realize it, although once they heard the solution, they recognized how their dream had solved it. For example, one person dreamed:&lt;ref name="Blechner 2018"/&gt;

{{quote|There is a big clock. You can see the movement. The big hand of the clock was on the number six. You could see it move up, number by number, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. The dream focused on the small parts of the machinery. You could see the gears inside.}}

In the dream, the person counted out the next elements of the series{{snd}} six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve{{snd}} yet he did not realize that this was the solution of the problem. His sleeping mindbrain solved the problem, but his waking mindbrain was not aware how.

[[Albert Einstein]] believed that much problem solving goes on unconsciously, and the person must then figure out and formulate consciously what the mindbrain has already solved. He believed this was his process in formulating the theory of relativity: "The creator of the problem possesses the solution."&lt;ref&gt;Fromm, Erika O. (1998). Lost and found half a century later: Letters by Freud and Einstein. ''American Psychologist'', 53: 1195-1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein said that he did his problem-solving without words, mostly in images. "The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be 'voluntarily' reproduced and combined."&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, A. (1994) ''Ideas and Opinions''. New York: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive sciences: two schools ==
In [[cognitive sciences]], researchers' realization that problem-solving processes differ across knowledge domains and across levels of expertise (e.g. Sternberg, 1995) and that, consequently, findings obtained in the laboratory cannot necessarily generalize to problem-solving situations outside the laboratory, has led to an emphasis on real-world problem solving since the 1990s. This emphasis has been expressed quite differently in North America and Europe, however. Whereas North American research has typically concentrated on studying problem solving in separate, natural knowledge domains, much of the European research has focused on novel, complex problems, and has been performed with computerized scenarios (see Funke, 1991, for an overview).

=== Europe ===
In Europe, two main approaches have surfaced, one initiated by [[Donald Broadbent]] (1977; see [[#Reference-Berry|Berry &amp; Broadbent, 1995]]) in the United Kingdom and the other one by [[Dietrich Dörner]] (1975, 1985; see [[#Reference-Dörner1995|Dörner &amp; Wearing, 1995]]) in Germany. The two approaches share an emphasis on relatively complex, semantically rich, computerized laboratory tasks, constructed to resemble real-life problems. The approaches differ somewhat in their theoretical goals and methodology, however. The tradition initiated by Broadbent emphasizes the distinction between cognitive problem-solving processes that operate under awareness versus outside of awareness, and typically employs mathematically well-defined computerized systems. The tradition initiated by Dörner, on the other hand, has an interest in the interplay of the cognitive, motivational, and social components of problem solving, and utilizes very complex computerized scenarios that contain up to 2,000 highly interconnected variables (e.g., [[#Reference-Dörner1983|Dörner, Kreuzig, Reither &amp; Stäudel's 1983]] LOHHAUSEN project; [[#Reference-Ringelband|Ringelband, Misiak &amp; Kluwe, 1990]]). [[#Reference-Buchner1995|Buchner (1995)]] describes the two traditions in detail.

=== North America ===
In North America, initiated by the work of [[Herbert A. Simon]] on "learning by doing" in [[semantic]]ally rich domains,&lt;ref name="Anzai1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anzai, K. |author2=Simon, H. A. |title=The theory of learning by doing |journal=Psychological Review |volume=86 |pages=124–140 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.86.2.124 |year=1979 |pmid=493441 |issue=2 |ref=Reference-Anzai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhaskar1977"&gt;{{Wikicite | id= Bhaskar| reference= Bhaskar, R., &amp; Simon, H.

Instead, these researchers have frequently focused on the development of problem solving within a certain domain, that is on the development of [[expertise]]; [[#Reference-Chase|Chase &amp; Simon, 1973]]; [[#Reference-Chi|Chi, Feltovich &amp; Glaser, 1981]]).&lt;ref name="Anderson1985"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anderson, J.

== Characteristics of complex problems ==

As elucidated by [[Dietrich Dörner]] and later expanded upon by [[:de:Joachim Funke|Joachim Funke]], complex problems have some typical characteristics that can be summarized as follows:{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Collective problem solving==
{{See also|Crowdsolving|Collective action|Collaborative intelligence|Mass collaboration|Collective wisdom|The Wisdom of Crowds|Distributed knowledge|Online participation|Group decision-making}}
Problem solving is applied on many different levels − from the individual to the civilizational. Collective problem solving refers to problem solving performed collectively.

[[Social issue]]s and [[global issue]]s can typically only be solved collectively.

It has been noted that the complexity of contemporary problems has exceeded the cognitive capacity of any individual and requires different but complementary expertise and collective problem solving ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hung|first1=Woei|title=Team-based complex problem solving: a collective cognition perspective|journal=Educational Technology Research and Development|date=24 April 2013|volume=61|issue=3|pages=365–384|doi=10.1007/s11423-013-9296-3|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-013-9296-3|accessdate=29 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collective intelligence]] is shared or group intelligence that emerges from the [[collaboration]], collective efforts, and competition of many individuals.

In a 1962 research report, [[Douglas Engelbart]] linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: "Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone".&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1962) [http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9 Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework] - section on Team Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and [[participatory culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | last=Flew | first=Terry | year= 2008 | title=New Media: an introduction | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contributes to the development of such skills.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES? THE 'COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE' OF MEDIA FANS|last=Henry|first=Jenkins|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collective impact]] is the commitment of a group of actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem, using a structured form of collaboration.

After [[World War II]] the [[UN]], the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods organization]] and the [[WTO]] were created; collective problem solving on the international level crystallized around these three types of organizations from the 1980s onward. As these global institutions remain state-like or state-centric it has been called unsurprising that these continue state-like or state-centric approaches to collective problem-solving rather than alternative ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Park|first1=Jacob|last2=Conca|first2=Ken|last3=Conca|first3=Professor of International Relations Ken|last4=Finger|first4=Matthias|title=The Crisis of Global Environmental Governance: Towards a New Political Economy of Sustainability|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134059829|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrr3K50r144C&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=29 January 2017|language=en|date=2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--https://books.google.com/books?id=CtXvBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA189--&gt;

[[Crowdsourcing]] is a process of accumulating the ideas, thoughts or information from many independent participants, with aim to find the best solution for a given challenge. Modern [[information technologies]] allow for massive number of subjects to be involved as well as systems of managing these suggestions that provide good results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guazzini|first1=Andrea|last2=Vilone|first2=Daniele|last3=Donati|first3=Camillo|last4=Nardi|first4=Annalisa|last5=Levnajić|first5=Zoran|title=Modeling crowdsourcing as collective problem solving|journal=Scientific Reports|date=10 November 2015|volume=5|pages=16557|doi=10.1038/srep16557|pmid=26552943|pmc=4639727|accessdate=29 January 2017|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16557}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the [[Internet]] a new capacity for collective, including planetary-scale, problem solving was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stefanovitch|first1=Nicolas|last2=Alshamsi|first2=Aamena|last3=Cebrian|first3=Manuel|last4=Rahwan|first4=Iyad|title=Error and attack tolerance of collective problem solving: The DARPA Shredder Challenge|journal=EPJ Data Science|date=30 September 2014|volume=3|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjds/s13688-014-0013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The framework suggests four stages – [[awareness]], attraction, [[attachment (psychology)|attachment]] and allegiance to describe how sport and event involvement progressively develops with corresponding behaviours (e.g., playing, watching, buying).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Shilbury, Westerbeek, Quick, Funk| year=2009| title = Strategic Sport Marketing, 3rd ed., p. 41-61, |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|isbn=978-1-74175-626-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCM uses a vertical framework to characterise various [[psychological]] connections that individuals form with objects to explain the role of attitude formation and change that directs behaviours across a variety of consumption activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C.

The figure shows the four stages of the PCM - awareness, attraction, attachment and allegiance. On each stage, there is a horizontal decision making process. Inputs (green arrows) influence the internal processing (blue boxes) that creates outputs (yellow arrows). The outcomes are shown in the four different stages of the PCM (grey boxes). The unique decision making process is based upon the level of involvement of the consumer towards a sport/team/event. The following sequence is shown in each stage:

Inputs --&gt; Internal Processing &lt;--&gt; Output

The PCM framework states that, through the processing of internal and external inputs, individuals progress upward along the four psychological connection stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Lock, D., Darcy, S., &amp; Taylor, T.| year=2009| title= ''Starting with a clean slate: An analysis of member identification with a new sports team''| publisher = Sport Management Review, 12, 15-25..}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overall evaluation of an object at a specific stage is the product of the processing of personal, psychological and environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Consumer Behaviour in Sport and Events |author= Daniel C. Funk |year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7506-8666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==

===Awareness===

|image        = '''John's Awareness'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John’s introduction to road cycling occurred at the age of 15 through a key socialising agent, his uncle Jack. Jack bought John his first bike, which he rode to school every day. When John was 15 and saw the Tour the France on television, he was amazed by the event. When Jack gave John one of his old road bikes and took him cycling on the weekend, John's progression to the Attraction stage began.
}}
[[Awareness]] stands for the notion when an individual first learns that a certain sport, event or team exists. In this stage the individual has not formed a preference or favourite. The PCM suggests that awareness of sport, teams and events stems from formal and informal channels, for examples parents, friends, school and media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Funk, D. C.| year=2002| title= Consumer-based marketing: The use of micro-segmentation strategies for understanding sport consumption| journal = [[International Journal of Sports Marketing &amp; Sponsorship]] |volume=4 |issue=3|pages=231–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases awareness begins during [[childhood]], but can also derive from other socializing agents. The value placed on the specific sport and event from a societal perspective is important in the awareness stage. The examples of ''I know about football'' and ''I know about Liverpool FC'' illustrate the awareness stage box.

===Attraction===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attraction'''.
|imagestyle   = 
|caption      = 
John began to realize that cycling provided him a number of positive outcomes. He was able to meet other cyclists, make new friends and spend time with his uncle. He received pleasure from riding outside and the thrill of riding down hills at fast speed. His self-esteem rose by getting into shape and being one of the fastest riders among his friends. He also enjoyed the break from his daily routine when riding the bike. }}

In the attraction stage, the individual has a favourite sport, event, team or leisure hobby.   Attraction is based upon a number of extrinsic and intrinsic motives.  In other words,  the sport, event, or leisure hobby provides the opportunity to satisfy needs and receive benefits. The motives stem from a combination of personal, psychological and environmental factors. The Attraction processing creates outcomes of positive affect and intentions, as well as engaging in consumption behaviour related to the sport and event. The examples of ''I like football'' and ''I like Liverpool FC'' illustrate the attraction stage box.

===Attachment===
{{Infobox
|name         = Infobox/doc
|bodystyle    = 
|title        = Example
|titlestyle   =

|image        = '''John's Attachment'''.
|imagestyle   =

John progresses into the attachment stage relatively quickly and within a year begins riding every Saturday and Sunday morning. Cycling now is an important part in his life. He often wears cycling clothes to class, spent time visiting bike shops and uses the Internet to follow international cycling events. He even joins a cycling club and travels to regional cycling competitions with his friends who are predominantly cyclists.

In the attachment stage the benefits and the sport object are internalised taking on a collective emotional, functional, and symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Filo, K., Funk, D.C., &amp; O’Brien, D.| year=2009| title= ''The Meaning Behind Attachment: Exploring Camaraderie, Cause, and Competency at a Charity Sport Event''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 23, 361-387.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The psychological connection towards a sport, event, team or leisure hobby strengthens. Internal processes become more important and the influence of socializing agents decreases. Examples for the attachment stage are ''I am a football player'' or ''I am a Liverpool Fan''.

John progressed into the allegiance stage during his last year of college as the strength of his connection to cycling became durable. He thought of cycling and related activities daily. He always found time to ride and follow the sport regardless of university and work requirements or other sport opportunities. John’s psychological connection to cycling has strengthened and is now guiding his behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Funk, D.C., &amp; James, J.| year=2006| title= ''Consumer Loyalty: The Meaning of Attachment in the Development of Sport Team Allegiance''| publisher = Journal of Sport Management, 20, 189-217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the attachment processing continues, the internal collective meaning becomes more durable in terms of persistence and resistance and has greater impact on activities and behaviour. This is noted by the examples of ''I live for football'' and ''I live for Liverpool FC'' within the allegiance stage.

The '''Qinling panda''' (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca qinlingensis'') is a subspecies of the [[giant panda]], discovered in the 1960s{{Citation needed|reason=Sources don't seem to mention anything about it being discovered in 1960s.|date=July 2017}} but not recognized as a subspecies until 2005.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Baowei|last2=Li|first2=Ming|last3=Zhang|first3=Zejun|last4=Goossens|first4=Benoît|last5=Zhu|first5=Lifeng|last6=Zhang|first6=Shanning|last7=Hu|first7=Jinchu|last8=Bruford|first8=Michael W.|last9=Wei|first9=Fuwen|title=Genetic Viability and Population History of the Giant Panda, Putting an End to the 'Evolutionary Dead End'?|journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution|date=2007|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1801–1810|doi=10.1093/molbev/msm099|pmid=17513881|doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cascn"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cas.cn/xw/kjsm/gndt/200502/t20050215_1000599.shtml | script-title=zh:秦岭大熊猫被确认为新亚种|trans-title=Qinling panda recognized as new subspecies | publisher=Chinese Academy of Sciences | date=15 February 2005|language=Chinese | accessdate=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disregarding the [[nominate subspecies]], it is the first giant panda subspecies to be recognized. It differs from the more familiar nominate subspecies by its smaller skull and dark brown and light brown (rather than black and white) fur, and its smaller overall size.&lt;ref name="Wan"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Qiu-Hong Wan|author2=Hua Wu|author3=Sheng-Guo Fang |year=2005 |title=A new subspecies of giant panda (''Ailuropoda melanoleuca'') from Shaanxi, China |journal=[[Journal of Mammalogy]] |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=397–402 |jstor=4094359 |doi=10.1644/BRB-226.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 200–300 Qinling pandas living in the wild.&lt;ref name="Wan" /&gt;
On August 30, 1989, a female of this species was captured and brought to the [[Xi'an Zoo]] to be mated with a regular giant panda. Her offspring was black-and-white, but reportedly started becoming brownish as it aged.  According to other reports she gave birth to three cubs but all of whom died shortly after being born. The mother, named Dan-Dan, died in 2000.&lt;ref name=mesbeast&gt;{{cite web|title=Sepia Giant Panda|url=http://www.messybeast.com/extinct/sepia-giant-panda.htm|accessdate=24 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This subspecies is restricted to the [[Qinling Mountains]], at elevations of {{convert|1300|-|3000|m}}. Its coloration is possibly a consequence of [[inbreeding]]: as the population is closed off from [[genetic variation]] and this might have led to the preservation of the [[mutation]] responsible.&lt;ref name = Zhang /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wan"/&gt;

Due to the Qinling subspecies being captive it has been exposed to toxicants in their bamboo diet. Even though it is not fully known what toxicants it has been exposed it is determined that it was heavy metal from the atmospheric deposition. Thus, the conservation of the Qinling pandas may be compromised in the future due to the issues of air pollution of China.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Yi‐ping, et al. “Atmospheric Deposition Exposes Qinling Pandas to Toxic Pollutants.” ''Ecology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2 Mar. 2017, esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.1494.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Robin Williams (academic)|Robin A. Williams]] and David Edge (1996), "Central to '''social shaping of technology''' ('''SST''') is the concept that there are choices (though not necessarily conscious choices) inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the direction or trajectory of innovation programs."

If technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, then innovation is a 'garden of forking paths'. Different routes are available, potentially leading to different technological outcomes. Significantly, these choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

SST is one of the models of the technology: society relationship which emerged in the 1980s with MacKenzie and Wajcman's influential 1985 collection, alongside Pinch and Bijker's  [[social construction of technology]] framework and Callon and Latour's [[actor-network theory]]. These have a common feature of criticism of the [[linear model of innovation]] and  [[technological determinism]].  It differs from these notably in the attention it pays to the influence of the social and technological context of development which shapes innovation choices. SST is concerned to explore the material consequences of different technical choices, but criticizes technological determinism, which argues that technology follows its own developmental path, outside of human influences, and in turn, influences society. In this way, social shaping theorists conceive the relationship between technology and society as one of '[[Mutual Shaping|mutual shaping]]'.

Some versions of this theory state that technology affects society by affordances, constraints, preconditions, and unintended consequences (Baym, 2015). Affordance is the idea that technology makes specific tasks easier in our lives, while constraints make tasks harder to complete. The preconditions of technology are the skills and resources  that are vital to using the technology to its fullest potential. Finally, the unintended consequences of technology are unanticipated effects and impact of technology. The cell phone is an example of social shaping of technology (Zulto 2009). The cell phone has evolved over the years to make our lives easier by providing people with handheld computers that can answer calls, answer emails, search for information, and complete numerous other tasks (Zulto, 2009). Yet it has constraints for those that are not technologically savvy, hindering many people in society who do not understand how to utilize these devices. There are preconditions, such as monthly bills and access to electricity. There are also many unintended consequences such as the unintended distraction they cause for many people.

Not only does technology affect society, but according to SST, society affects technology by way of economics, politics, and culture (Baym, 2015). For instance, cell phones have spread in poor countries due to cell phones being more affordable than a computer and internet service (economics), government regulations which have made it fairly easy for cell phone providers to build networks (politics), and the small size of cell phones which fit easily into many cultures’ need for mobile communication (culture).

{{short description|US constitutional law doctrine}}
{{more citations needed|date=August 2009}}

In [[United States]] [[law]], a '''state actor''' is a person who is acting on behalf of a governmental body, and is therefore subject to regulation under the [[United States Bill of Rights]], including the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendments]], which prohibit the federal and state governments from violating certain rights and freedoms.

Though the term would seem to include only persons who are directly employed by the state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] has interpreted these amendments and [[law]]s passed pursuant to them to cover many persons who have only an indirect relationship with the government. Controversies have arisen, for example, over whether private companies that run towns (the "company-town") and prisons (traditionally a state function) can be held liable as state actors when they violate fundamental civil rights. This question remains unresolved, but the Supreme Court has held private citizens to be liable as state actors when they conspire with government officials to deprive people of their rights.

Conversely, in ''[[National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith]]'', the Supreme Court has found that the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] is not a state actor for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1983 because it was national, rather than acting on behalf of one state actor. For the purposes of a [[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]
action, however, it might still be a state actor.[http://chronicle.com/blogs/players/files/2012/02/Potuto1.pdf]

The 1989 case of ''[[DeShaney v. Winnebago County]]'' was decided on the basis of the ''state action doctrine''. Social workers separated a young son Joshua from his abusive father Randy, but concluded there was not enough evidence for a permanent separation, and later reunited son with father; later, the father beat his son into a persistent vegetative state. The [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] ruled that despite involvement by state social workers, the state of Wisconsin was not a ''state actor'' and was therefore not responsible. Accordingly, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment protections]] did not apply, according to constitutional scholar John E. Finn.&lt;ref name=tws3R18&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike state actors, private actors are generally not required to afford individuals the constitutional rights mentioned above.  In nearly all U.S. states, private [[shopping center]] owners can eject [[protest]]ers from their land for [[trespassing]], and private associations can eject members or deny admission to applicants, with no warning and for no reason. But in a handful of states, notably [[California]], state constitutional protections and certain common law rights have been extended to limit private actors. California allows the peaceful exercise of free speech in private shopping centers (see ''[[Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins]]'' (1980)) and requires certain types of private actors to afford current or potential members a rudimentary version of procedural [[due process]] called [[fair procedure]].

==Jurisprudence==
There are a number of situations where the United States Supreme Court has recognized the conduct of individuals or private organizations to be "state action," and therefore subject to provisions of the Constitution such as Equal Protection, Due Process, or the First Amendment.  The Supreme Court has held the following:

# Merely opening up a business to the public is not state action, but the performance of a "public function" (a function that has been traditionally and exclusively performed by the state) is state action ([[Marsh v. Alabama]], 326 U.S. 501 (1946));
# If an individual or organization merely enters into a contract or asserts a contractual right outside of court it is not state action, but if an individual or organization sues to judicially enforce a contractual right it is state action ([[Shelley v. Kraemer]], 334 U.S. 1 (1948));
# If the government merely acquiesces in the performance of an act by a private individual or organization it is not state action, but if the government coerces, influences, or encourages the performance of the act, it is state action (Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457 U.S. 830 (1982));
# If the government merely enters into a contract with an individual or organization for the goods or services, the actions of the private party are not state action, but if the government and the private party enter into a "joint enterprise" or a "symbiotic relationship" with each other it is state action (''[[Burton v. Wilmington Parking Authority]]'', 365 U.S. 715 (1961));
# If government agencies are simply members of a private organization, the actions of the organization are not state action, but if the government is "pervasively entwined" with the leadership of the private organization, the acts of the organization are state action ([[Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass'n|Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association]], 535 U.S. 971 (2002)).

==Scholarly commentary==
According to constitutional law scholar [[Gillian E. Metzger]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 1367| last = Metzger| first = Gillian| title = Privatization as Delegation| journal = Colum. L. Rev.| url=https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/faculty_scholarship/144/ |date = 2003-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The underlying presumption is that cases where private actors wield public power are rare and occur mainly when the government tries to hide behind private surrogates whom it controls. Current doctrine pays little attention to whether the government is, in fact, delegating power to private entities to act on its behalf. To the extent private delegations are considered, it is under the rubric of private delegation doctrine, which assesses whether the Constitution's separation of powers and due process requirements prohibit the government from delegating certain types of powers to private hands. But constitutional law makes no attempt to link the constitutionality of a private delegation to the risk that it will place government power outside of constitutional controls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3725">'''Sustainable refurbishment''' describes working on existing buildings to improve their environmental performance using sustainable methods and materials.

Sustainable refurbishment is the equivalent of [[sustainable development]] which relates to new developments of cities, buildings or industries etc.
Sustainable refurbishment includes [[building insulation|insulation]] and related measures to reduce the energy consumption of buildings, installation of [[renewable energy]] sources such as solar water heating and [[photovoltaics]], measures to reduce water consumption, and changes to reduce overheating, improve ventilation and improve internal comfort. The process of sustainable refurbishment includes minimizing the waste of existing components, [[recycling]] and using [[environmentally friendly]] materials, and minimizing energy use, noise and waste during the refurbishment.

The importance of sustainable refurbishment is that the majority of buildings in use are not new and thus were constructed when energy standards were low or non-existent, and are otherwise incompatible with current standards or the expectations of users. Much of the existing building stock is likely to be in use for many years to come since demolition and replacement is often unacceptable owing to cost, social disruption or because the building is of architectural and/or historical interest. The solution is to refurbish or renovate such buildings to make them appropriate for current and future use and to satisfy current requirements and standards of energy use and comfort.

Sustainable refurbishment is not a new concept but is gaining recognition and importance owing to current concerns about high energy use leading to [[climate change]], overheating in buildings, the need for healthy internal environments, waste and environmental damage associated with materials production. Many governments are beginning to realize the importance of sustainably renovating their existing building stock, rather than just raising standards for new buildings and developments, and are producing guidance and grants and other support and stimulation activities. Think-tanks, lobby groups and voluntary organizations continue to publicize and promote the need for and practice of sustainable refurbishment. Examples and demonstration projects abound in many countries.

The techniques of sustainable refurbishment have been developing over many years and though the principles are very similar to those used on new buildings, the practice and details appropriate for the wide range of situations found in old buildings has required development of specific solutions and guidance to optimize the process and avoid subsequent problems. Detailed technical guidance is widely available from government-sponsored sources.

The Todhri alphabet was discovered in Elbasan by [[Johann Georg von Hahn]] (1811–1869) who published it in 1854 his work Albanesische Studien in [[Jena]].&lt;ref name="Hahn2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Johann Georg Hahn|title=The Discovery of Albania: Travel Writing and Anthropology in the Nineteenth Century Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2U7WCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|date=30 May 2015|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=8|isbn=9781784532925}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered it to be 'the original' Albanian alphabet and a derivative of ancient [[Phoenician script]]. [[Leopold Geitler]] (1847–1885) and [[Slovenians|Slovenian]] scholar [[Rajko Nahtigal]] (1877–1958) subsequently studied the alphabet, concluding that it was derived primarily from the [[Roman cursive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elsie|first=Robert|title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript (Anonimi i Elbasanit), 1761, and the struggle for an original Albanian alphabet|url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf|website=elsie.de|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest existing text in Todhri's script is '''Radhua Hesapesh''' ([[Bookkeeping#Daybooks|daybook]]) of a local merchant partnership known as Jakov Popa i Vogël dhe Shokët (Jakov Popa Junior and Friends). The entries in Todhri's script start on 10 August 1795 and continue until 1797.&lt;ref name="Shuteriqi1976"&gt;{{citation| author=Dhimiter Shuteriqi| page=140|location = Tirana| year=1976| oclc=252881121 | publisher= Academy of Sciences of PR of Albania| title=Shkrimet Shqipe ne Vitet 1332-1850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5999">In [[literature]], the '''tone''' of a literary work is the effect that the writer creates on the readers through choice of writing style. The overall objective is to express an attitude or certain feelings about the subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendy Scheir|title=Roadmap To The California High School Exit Exam: English Language Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1vh2n29bVMC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2004|publisher=The Princeton Review|isbn=978-0-375-76471-4|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hacker|1991|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Depending upon the personality of the writer and the effect the writer wants to create, the work can be formal or informal, sober or whimsical, assertive or pleading, straightforward or sly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Crews|1977|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In determining the attitude, mood, or tone of an author, examine the specific [[diction]] used.  Is the author using adjectives to describe the subject?  If so, are they words like ''fragrant, tranquil, magnanimous''—words with positive [[connotation]]s?  Or are they words like ''fetid, ruffled, stingy''—words with negative connotations?

When we speak, our tone of voice conveys our mood—frustrated, cheerful, critical, gloomy, or angry.  When we write, our images and descriptive phrases get our feelings across—guarded optimism, unqualified enthusiasm, objective indifference, resignation, or dissatisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brownstein|1992|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other examples of literary tone are:  airy, comic, condescending, facetious, funny, heavy, intimate, ironic, light, playful, sad, serious, sinister, solemn, somber, threatening.

==Difference from mood==
Tone and [[mood (literature)|mood]] are not the same, although they are frequently confused. The mood of a piece of literature is the feeling or atmosphere created by the work, or, said slightly differently, how the work makes the reader feel. Mood is produced most effectively through the use of setting, theme, voice and tone, while tone is how the author feels about something.

==Usage==
All pieces of literature, even official documents and technical documents, have some sort of tone.  Authors create  tone   through the use of various other literary elements, such as ''diction'' or word choice; ''syntax'', the grammatical arrangement of words in a text for effect; ''imagery'', or vivid appeals to the senses; ''details'', facts that are included or omitted; and ''figurative language'', the comparison of  seemingly unrelated things for sub-textual  purposes.{{how|date=October 2013}}

While now used to discuss literature, the term tone was originally applied solely to music. This appropriated word has come to represent attitudes and feelings a speaker (in poetry), a narrator (in fiction), or an author (in non-literary prose) has towards the subject, situation, and/or the intended audience. It is important to recognize that the  speaker, or narrator is not to be confused with the author and that attitudes and feelings of the  speaker or narrator should not be confused with those of the author.{{why |date=October 2013}}  In general, the tone of a piece only refers to attitude of the author if writing is non-literary in nature.{{Elucidate |date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Alison, and Kelly J. Mays, eds.  "Theme and Tone." ''The Norton Introduction to Literature'', Portable 10th ed. New York: Norton, 2010. 475-6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, the tone of a work may change and shift as the speaker or narrator’s perspective on a particular subject alters throughout the piece.

Official and technical documentation tends to employ a formal tone throughout the piece.

==Setting tone==
Authors set a tone in literature by conveying emotions/feelings through words. The way a person feels about an idea/concept, event, or another person can be quickly determined through facial expressions, gestures and in the tone of voice used.  In literature an author sets the tone through words.  The possible tones are bounded only by the number of possible [[emotion]]s a human being can have.

Diction and [[syntax]] often dictate what the author's (or character's) attitude toward his subject is at the time. An example: "Charlie surveyed the classroom but it was really his mother congratulating himself for snatching the higher test grade, the smug smirk on his face growing brighter and brighter as he confirmed the inferiority of his peers."

The tone here is one of arrogance; the quip "inferiority of his peers" shows Charlie's belief in his own prowess. The words "surveyed" and "congratulating himself" show Charlie as seeing himself better than the rest of his class.  The diction, including the word "snatching", gives the reader a mental picture of someone quickly and effortlessly grabbing something, which proves once again Charlie's pride in himself. The "smug [[smirk]]" provides a facial imagery of Charlie's pride.

In addition, using imagery in a poem is helpful to develop a poem's tone.

In [[mathematics]], a '''tuple''' is a finite ordered list (sequence) of [[Element (mathematics)|elements]].  An '''{{math|''n''}}-tuple''' is a [[sequence]] (or ordered list) of {{math|''n''}} elements, where {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative [[integer]]. There is only one 0-tuple, an empty sequence, or empty tuple, as it is referred to. An {{math|''n''}}-tuple is [[Recursive definition|defined inductively]] using the construction of an [[ordered pair]].

Mathematicians usually write tuples by listing the elements within parentheses "&lt;math&gt;(\text{ })&lt;/math&gt;" and separated by commas; for example, &lt;math&gt;(2, 7, 4, 1, 7)&lt;/math&gt; denotes a 5-tuple. Sometimes other symbols are used to surround the elements, such as square brackets "[ ]" or angle brackets "&lt; &gt;". Braces "{ }" are only used in defining arrays in some programming languages such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Visual Basic, but not in mathematical expressions, as they are the standard notation for [[set (mathematics)|sets]]. The term ''tuple'' can often occur when discussing other mathematical objects, such as [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vectors]].

In [[computer science]], tuples come in many forms. In [[Dynamic programming language|dynamically typed languages]], such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], lists are commonly used as tuples.{{citation needed|date =May 2017}} Most typed [[functional programming|functional programming languages]] implement tuples directly as [[product type]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.haskell.org/Algebraic_data_type|title=Algebraic data type - HaskellWiki|author=|date=|website=wiki.haskell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; tightly associated with [[algebraic data type]]s, [[pattern matching]], and [[Assignment_(computer_science)#Parallel_assignment|destructuring assignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment|title=Destructuring assignment|author=|date=|website=MDN Web Docs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many programming languages offer an alternative to tuples, known as [[Record (computer science)|record types]], featuring unordered elements accessed by label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5525795/does-javascript-guarantee-object-property-order|title=Does JavaScript Guarantee Object Property Order?|author=|date=|website=Stack Overflow}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few programming languages combine ordered tuple product types and unordered record types into a single construct, as in [[Struct (C programming language)|C structs]] and Haskell records. [[Relational database]]s may formally identify their [[row (database)|row]]s (records) as ''tuples''.

Tuples also occur in [[relational algebra]]; when programming the [[semantic web]]  with the [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF); in [[linguistics]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-2276|title= N‐tuple - Oxford Reference|work= oxfordreference.com|accessdate= 1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term originated as an abstraction of the sequence: single, double, triple, quadruple, quintuple, sextuple, septuple, octuple, ..., {{math|''n''}}‑tuple, ..., where the prefixes are taken from the [[Latin]] names of the numerals. The unique 0‑tuple is called the null tuple. A 1‑tuple is called a singleton, a 2‑tuple is called an ordered pair and a 3‑tuple is a triple or triplet. {{math|''n''}} can be any nonnegative [[integer]]. For example, a [[complex number]] can be represented as a 2‑tuple, a [[quaternion]] can be represented as a 4‑tuple, an [[octonion]] can be represented as an 8‑tuple and a [[sedenion]] can be represented as a 16‑tuple.

Although these uses treat ''‑tuple'' as the suffix, the original suffix was ''‑ple'' as in "triple" (three-fold) or "decuple" (ten‑fold). This originates from  [[medieval Latin]]  ''plus'' (meaning "more") related to [[Greek language|Greek]] ‑πλοῦς, which replaced the classical and late antique  ''‑plex'' (meaning "folded"), as in "duplex".&lt;ref&gt;''OED'', ''s.v.'' "triple", "quadruple", "quintuple", "decuple"&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Compare the etymology of [[ploidy]], from the Greek for -fold.}}

==Properties==
The general rule for the identity of two {{math|''n''}}-tuples is
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)&lt;/math&gt; [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;a_1=b_1,\text{ }a_2=b_2,\text{ }\ldots,\text{ }a_n=b_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus a tuple has properties that distinguish it from a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].
# A tuple may contain multiple instances of the same element, so &lt;br/&gt;tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,2,3) \neq (1,2,3)&lt;/math&gt;; but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,2,3\} = \{1,2,3\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# Tuple elements are ordered: tuple &lt;math&gt;(1,2,3) \neq (3,2,1)&lt;/math&gt;, but set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3\} = \{3,2,1\}&lt;/math&gt;.
# A tuple has a finite number of elements, while a set or a [[multiset]] may have an infinite number of elements.

==Definitions==

There are several definitions of tuples that give them the properties described in the previous section.

===Tuples as functions===
If we are dealing with sets, an {{math|''n''}}-tuple can be regarded as a [[Function (mathematics)#Definition|function]], {{math|''F''}},  whose domain is the tuple's implicit set of element indices, {{math|''X''}}, and whose codomain, {{math|''Y''}}, is the tuple's set of elements. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) \equiv (X,Y,F)&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
      X &amp; = \{1, 2, \dots, n\}                       \\
      Y &amp; = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}                \\
      F &amp; = \{(1, a_1), (2, a_2), \ldots, (n, a_n)\}. \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
In slightly less formal notation this says:
:&lt;math&gt; (a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n) := (F(1), F(2), \dots, F(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested ordered pairs===
Another way of modeling tuples in Set Theory is as nested [[ordered pair]]s. This approach assumes that the notion of ordered pair has already been defined; thus a 2-tuple 
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# An {{math|''n''}}-tuple, with {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}, can be defined as an ordered pair of its first entry and an {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple (which contains the remaining entries when {{math|''n'' &gt; 1)}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n))&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively to the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}-tuple:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = (a_1, (a_2, (a_3, (\ldots, (a_n, \emptyset)\ldots))))&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, \emptyset)))      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = (1, (2, (3, (4, \emptyset)))) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

A variant of this definition starts "peeling off" elements from the other end:
# The 0-tuple is the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.
# For {{math|''n'' &gt; 0}}:
#: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{n-1}), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;
This definition can be applied recursively:
: &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n) = ((\ldots(((\emptyset, a_1), a_2), a_3), \ldots), a_n)&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for example:
: &lt;math&gt;
    \begin{align}
         (1, 2, 3) &amp; = (((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3)      \\
      (1, 2, 3, 4) &amp; = ((((\emptyset, 1), 2), 3), 4) \\
    \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;

===Tuples as nested sets===
Using [[ordered pair#Kuratowski definition|Kuratowski's representation for an ordered pair]], the second definition above can be reformulated in terms of pure [[set theory]]:
# The 0-tuple (i.e. the empty tuple) is represented by the empty set &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
# Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; be an {{math|''n''}}-tuple &lt;math&gt;(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n, b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;x \rightarrow b \equiv \{\{x\}, \{x, b\}\}&lt;/math&gt;.  (The right arrow, &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;, could be read as "adjoined with".)

In this formulation:
: &lt;math&gt;
   \begin{array}{lclcl}
     ()      &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \emptyset                                    \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1)     &amp;=&amp; ()    \rightarrow 1 &amp;=&amp; \{\{()\},\{(),1\}\}                          \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}            \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp;                                              \\
     (1,2)   &amp;=&amp; (1)   \rightarrow 2 &amp;=&amp; \{\{(1)\},\{(1),2\}\}                        \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp;=&amp; \{\{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\}\},     \\
             &amp; &amp;                     &amp; &amp; \{\{\{\emptyset\},\{\emptyset,1\}\},2\}\}    \\

=={{anchor|n-tuple}}{{math|''n''}}-tuples of {{math|''m''}}-sets ==

In [[discrete mathematics]], especially [[combinatorics]] and finite [[probability theory]], {{math|''n''}}-tuples arise in the context of various counting problems and are treated more informally as ordered lists of length {{math|''n''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{math|''n''}}-tuples whose entries come from a set of {{math|''m''}} elements are also called ''arrangements with repetition'', ''[[Permutation#Permutations_of_multisets|permutations of a multiset]]'' and, in some non-English literature, ''variations with repetition''. The number of {{math|''n''}}-tuples of an {{math|''m''}}-set is {{math|''m''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This follows from the combinatorial [[rule of product]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D'Angelo|West|2000|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; If {{math|''S''}} is a finite set of [[cardinality]] {{math|''m''}}, this number is the cardinality of the {{math|''n''}}-fold [[Cartesian product#Cartesian power|Cartesian power]] {{math|''S'' × ''S'' × ... ''S''}}. Tuples are elements of this product set.

== Type theory ==
{{main|Product type}}
In [[type theory]], commonly used in [[programming language]]s, a tuple has a [[product type]]; this fixes not only the length, but also the underlying types of each component. Formally:
: &lt;math&gt;(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) : \mathsf{T}_1 \times \mathsf{T}_2 \times \ldots \times \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the [[Projection (mathematics)|projection]]s are term constructors:
: &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(x) : \mathsf{T}_1,~\pi_2(x) : \mathsf{T}_2,~\ldots,~\pi_n(x) : \mathsf{T}_n&lt;/math&gt;

The tuple with labeled elements used in the [[#Relational_model|relational model]] has a [[Record (computer science)|record type]]. Both of these types can be defined as simple extensions of the [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref name="pierce2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=Benjamin|title=Types and Programming Languages|publisher=MIT Press|year=2002|isbn=0-262-16209-1|pages=126–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a tuple in type theory and that in set theory are related in the following way: If we consider the natural [[model theory|model]] of a type theory, and use the Scott brackets to indicate the semantic interpretation&lt;!-- do not link; that article needs to be a dab first--&gt;, then the model consists of some sets &lt;math&gt;S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n&lt;/math&gt; (note: the use of italics here that distinguishes sets from types) such that:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!] = S_1,~[\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!] = S_2,~\ldots,~[\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!] = S_n&lt;/math&gt;
and the interpretation of the basic terms is:
: &lt;math&gt;[\![x_1]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_1]\!],~[\![x_2]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_2]\!],~\ldots,~[\![x_n]\!] \in [\![\mathsf{T}_n]\!]&lt;/math&gt;.

The {{math|''n''}}-tuple of type theory has the natural interpretation as an {{math|''n''}}-tuple of set theory:&lt;ref&gt;Steve Awodey, [http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/awodey/preprints/stcsFinal.pdf ''From sets, to types, to categories, to sets''], 2009, [[preprint]]&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[\![(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)]\!] = (\,[\![x_1]\!], [\![x_2]\!], \ldots, [\![x_n]\!]\,)&lt;/math&gt;
The [[unit type]] has as semantic interpretation the 0-tuple.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4175">'''World art studies''' is an expression used to define studies in the discipline of [[art history]], which focus on the [[history of art|history of visual arts worldwide]], its methodology, concepts and approach. The expression is also used within the academic curricula as title for specific art history courses and schools.&lt;ref&gt;i.e. the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]] at the [[University of East Anglia]] in [[Norwich]], and the courses at the [[University of Leiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

There are several expressions related to World art studies which are often used as interchangeable. Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme, ''World Art Studies''in ''Art History and Visual Studies'' in Europe: Transnational Discourses and National Frameworks, eds. Matthew Rampley, Thierry Lenain, Hubert Locher, Brill, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; provide some more specific definitions as following

* ''World art studies'' is a concept conceived by the art historian [[John Onians]] in the early Nineties as a new field of studies, global and with a multidisciplinary approach.&lt;ref&gt;John Onians, ''World Art Studies and the Need for a New Natural History of Art'' in "Art Bulletin, n. 78, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The multidisciplinary nature of World art studies differentiates them from ''world art history'' and ''global art history''. The expression ''World art studies'' was used by John Onians to rename the [[School of Art History and World Art Studies]]. The concept of 'World art studies'' is similar to the concept of ''Bildwissenschaft'' or ''image-ology'' is equally multidisciplinary in its approach to analysis of visual images.&lt;ref&gt;Kitty Zijlmans and Wilfried Van Damme make reference to the publication edited by Klaus Sachs-Hombach ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'', Surhkamp, Frankfurt am Main, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Global art history'' refers to the study of art in present and recent past with a focus on the art worldwide and interrelated phenomena. This definition relies on the distinction operated by [[Bruce Mazlish]] between ''global history'' and ''world history''.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Mazlish, ''An Introduction to Glocal History'' in ''Conceptualizing Global History'', ed. Bruce Mazlish and Ralph Buultjens, Westview Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''World art history'' refers to the study of art of the whole human history. A remark made to this expression is the use of the world ''history'' in singular (history and not histories); the use of the plural is preferred by [[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]]&lt;ref&gt;[[David Summers (art historian)|David Summers]], [[Real Spaces|Real Spaces: World Art History and the Rise of Western Modernism]], Phaidon Press, New York, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James Elkins (art critic)|James Elkins]], ''Stories of Art, Routledge, New York, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''world line''' (or '''worldline''') of an object is the [[path (topology)|path]] that object traces in 4-[[dimension]]al [[spacetime]]. It is an important concept in modern [[physics]], and particularly [[theoretical physics]].

The concept of a "world line" is distinguished from concepts such as an "[[orbit]]" or a "[[trajectory]]" (e.g., a planet's ''orbit in space'' or the ''trajectory'' of a car on a road) by the ''time'' dimension, and typically encompasses a large area of spacetime wherein [[perception|perceptually]] straight paths are recalculated to show their ([[Principle of relativity|relatively]]) more absolute [[position states]]—to reveal the nature of [[special relativity]] or [[gravitation]]al interactions. 

The idea of world lines originates in [[physics]] and was pioneered by [[Hermann Minkowski]]. The term is now most often used in relativity theories (i.e., [[special relativity]] and [[general relativity]]).

==Usage in physics==
In [[physics]], a world line of an object (approximated as a point in space, e.g., a particle or observer) is the sequence of [[spacetime]] events corresponding to the history of the object. A world line is a special type of curve in spacetime. Below an equivalent definition will be explained: A world line is a time-like curve in spacetime. Each point of a world line is an event that can be labeled with the time and the spatial position of the object at that time.

For example, the ''orbit'' of the Earth in space is approximately a circle, a three-dimensional (closed) curve in space: the Earth  returns every year to the same point in space. However, it arrives there at a different (later) time. The ''world line''  of the Earth is [[helix|helical]] in spacetime (a curve in a four-dimensional space) and does not return to the same point.

Spacetime is the collection of points called [[event (relativity)|events]], together with a continuous and smooth coordinate system identifying the events. Each event can be labeled by four numbers: a time coordinate and three space coordinates; thus spacetime is a four-dimensional space. The mathematical term for spacetime is a four-dimensional [[manifold]]. The concept may be applied as well to a higher-dimensional space. For easy visualizations of four dimensions, two space coordinates are often suppressed. The event is then represented by a point in a [[Minkowski diagram]], which is a plane usually plotted with the time coordinate, say &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, upwards and the space coordinate, say &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; horizontally.
As expressed by F.R. Harvey
:A curve M in [spacetime] is called a ''worldline of a particle'' if its tangent is future timelike at each point. The arclength parameter is called [[proper time]] and usually denoted &amp;tau;. The length of M is called the ''proper  time'' of the worldline or particle. If the worldline M is a line segment, then the particle is said to be in [[free fall]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Reese Harvey (1990) ''Spinors and calibrations'',  pages 62,3, [[Academic Press]], {{ISBN|0-12-329650-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A world line traces out the path of a single point in spacetime. A [[world sheet]] is the analogous two-dimensional surface traced out by a one-dimensional line (like a string) traveling through spacetime. The world sheet of an open string (with loose ends) is a strip; that of a closed string (a loop) is a volume.

Once the object is not approximated as a mere point but has extended volume, it traces out not a ''world line'' but rather a [[world tube]].

==World lines as a tool to describe events==
[[Image:Brane-wlwswv.png|300px|right|thumb|World line, worldsheet, and world volume, as they are derived from [[elementary particle|particles]], [[string theory|strings]], and [[Membrane (M-theory)|brane]]s.]]

A one-dimensional ''line'' or ''curve'' can be represented by the coordinates as a function of one parameter. Each value of the parameter corresponds to a point in spacetime and varying the parameter traces out a line. So in mathematical terms a curve is defined by four coordinate functions &lt;math&gt;x^a(\tau),\; a=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;x^{0}&lt;/math&gt; usually denotes the time coordinate) depending on one parameter &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. A coordinate grid in spacetime is the set of curves one obtains if three out of four coordinate functions are set to a constant.

Sometimes, the term '''world line''' is loosely used for ''any'' curve in spacetime. This terminology causes confusions. More properly, a '''world line'''  is a curve in spacetime which traces out the ''(time) history''  of a particle, observer or small object. One usually takes the [[proper time]] of an object or an observer as the curve parameter  &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; along the world line.

===Trivial examples of spacetime curves===
[[Image:Worldlines1.jpg|frame|Three different world lines representing travel at different constant four-velocities. ''t'' is time and ''x'' distance.]]
A curve that consists of a horizontal line segment (a line at constant coordinate time), may represent a rod in spacetime and would not be a world line in the proper sense. The parameter traces the length of the rod.

A line at constant space coordinate (a vertical line in the convention adopted above) may represent a particle at rest (or a stationary observer). A tilted line represents a particle with a constant coordinate speed (constant change in space coordinate with increasing time coordinate). The more the line is tilted from the vertical, the larger the speed.

Two world lines that start out separately and then intersect, signify a ''collision'' or "encounter". Two world lines starting at the same event in spacetime, each following its own path afterwards, may represent the decay of a particle into two others or the emission of one particle by another.

World lines of a particle and an observer may be interconnected with the world line of a photon (the path of light) and form a diagram which depicts the emission of a photon by a particle which is subsequently observed by the observer (or absorbed by another particle).

===Tangent vector to a world line, four-velocity===
The four coordinate functions &lt;math&gt;x^a(\tau),\; a=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;
defining a world line, are real functions of a real variable &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; and can simply be differentiated in the usual calculus. Without the existence of a metric (this is important to realize) one can speak of the difference between a point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; on the curve at the parameter value &lt;math&gt;\tau_0&lt;/math&gt; and a point on the curve a little (parameter &lt;math&gt;\tau_0+\Delta\tau&lt;/math&gt;) farther away. In the limit &lt;math&gt;\Delta\tau\rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;, this difference divided by &lt;math&gt;\Delta\tau&lt;/math&gt; defines a vector, the '''tangent vector''' of the world line at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. It is a four-dimensional vector, defined in the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. It is associated with the normal 3-dimensional velocity of the object (but it is not the same) and therefore called [[four-velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;, or in components:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{v} = (v^0,v^1,v^2,v^3) = \left( \frac{dx^0}{d\tau}\;,\frac{dx^1}{d\tau}\;, \frac{dx^2}{d\tau}\;, \frac{dx^3}{d\tau} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where the derivatives are taken at the point &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, so at &lt;math&gt;\tau=\tau_0&lt;/math&gt;.

All curves through point p have a tangent vector, not only world lines. The sum of two vectors is again a tangent vector to some other curve and the same holds for multiplying by a scalar. Therefore, all tangent vectors in a point p span a [[linear space]], called the [[tangent space]] at point p. For example, taking a 2-dimensional space, like the (curved) surface of the Earth, its tangent space at a specific point would be the flat approximation of the curved space.

==World lines in special relativity==

So far a world line (and the concept of tangent vectors) has been described without a means of quantifying the interval between events. The basic mathematics is as follows: The theory of [[special relativity]] puts some constraints on possible world lines. In special relativity the description of [[spacetime]] is limited to ''special'' coordinate systems that do not accelerate (and so do not rotate either), called [[inertial frame of reference|inertial coordinate system]]s. In such coordinate systems, the [[speed of light]] is a constant. The structure of spacetime is determined by a [[bilinear form]] &amp;eta; which gives a [[real number]] for each pair of events. The bilinear form is sometimes called a ''spacetime metric'', but since distinct events sometimes result in a zero value, unlike metrics in [[metric space]]s of mathematics, the bilinear form is ''not'' a mathematical metric on spacetime.

World lines of freely falling particles/objects are called [[geodesic]]s. In special relativity these are straight lines in Minkowski space.

Often the time units are chosen such that the speed of light is represented by lines at a fixed angle, usually at 45 degrees, forming a cone with the vertical (time) axis. In general, useful curves in spacetime can be of three types (the other types would be partly one, partly another type):

* '''light-like''' curves, having at each point the speed of light. They form a cone in spacetime, dividing it into two parts. The cone is three-dimensional in spacetime, appears as a line in drawings with two dimensions suppressed, and as a cone in drawings with one spatial dimension suppressed.

[[Image:World line2.svg|right|thumb|320px|An example of a [[light cone]], the three-dimensional surface of all possible light rays arriving at and departing from a point in spacetime. Here, it is depicted with one spatial dimension suppressed.]]
[[File:Lorentz transform of world line.gif|right|framed|The momentarily co-moving inertial frames along the trajectory ("world line") of a rapidly accelerating observer (center). The vertical direction indicates time, while the horizontal indicates distance, the dashed line is the [[spacetime]] of the observer. The small dots are specific events in spacetime. Note how the momentarily co-moving inertial frame changes when the observer accelerates.]]

* '''time-like''' curves, with a speed less than the speed of light. These curves must fall within a cone defined by light-like curves. In our definition above: '''world lines are time-like curves in spacetime'''.
* '''space-like''' curves falling outside the light cone. Such curves may describe, for example, the length of a physical object. The circumference of a cylinder and the length of a rod are space-like curves.

At a given event on a world line, spacetime ([[Minkowski space]]) is divided into three parts.

* The '''future''' of the given event is formed by all events that can be reached through time-like curves lying within the future light cone.
* The '''past''' of the given event is formed by all events that can influence the event (that is, which can be connected by world lines within the past [[light cone]] to the given event).
* The '''lightcone''' at the given event is formed by all events that can be connected through light rays with the event. When we observe the sky at night, we basically see only the past [[light cone]] within the entire spacetime.
* '''Elsewhere''' is the region between the two light cones. Points in an observer's '''elsewhere''' are inaccessible to her/him; only points in the past can send signals to the observer.  In ordinary laboratory experience, using common units and methods of measurement, it may seem that we look at the present, but in fact there is always a delay time for light to propagate.  For example, we see the [[Sun]] as it was about 8 minutes ago, not as it is "right now".  Unlike the '''present''' in Galilean/Newtonian theory, the '''elsewhere''' is thick; it is not a 3-dimensional volume but is instead a 4-dimensional spacetime region.
** Included in "elsewhere" is the '''simultaneous hyperplane''', which is defined for a given observer by a [[space]] which is [[hyperbolic-orthogonal]] to her/his world line. It is really three-dimensional, though it would be a 2-plane in the diagram because we had to throw away one dimension to make an intelligible picture. Although the light cones are the same for all observers at a given spacetime event, different observers, with differing velocities but coincident at the event (point) in the spacetime, have world lines that cross each other at an angle determined by their relative velocities, and thus they have different simultaneous hyperplanes.
** The '''present''' often means the single spacetime event being considered.

===Simultaneous hyperplane===
Since a world line &lt;math&gt; w(\tau) \isin R^4&lt;/math&gt; determines a velocity 4-vector &lt;math&gt; v = \frac {dw}{d\tau}&lt;/math&gt; that is time-like, the Minkowski form &lt;math&gt; \eta(v,x)&lt;/math&gt; determines a linear function &lt;math&gt; R^4 \rarr R&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;  x \mapsto \eta( v , x ) .&lt;/math&gt; Let  ''N'' be the [[kernel (linear algebra)|null space]] of this linear functional. Then ''N'' is called the '''simultaneous hyperplane''' with respect to ''v''. The [[relativity of simultaneity]] is a statement that ''N'' depends on ''v''. Indeed, ''N'' is the [[orthogonal complement]] of ''v'' with respect to &amp;eta;. 
When two world lines ''u'' and ''w'' are related by &lt;math&gt; \frac {du}{d\tau} = \frac {dw}{d\tau}, &lt;/math&gt; then they share the same simultaneous hyperplane. This hyperplane exists mathematically, but physical relations in relativity involve the movement of information by light. For instance, the traditional electro-static force described by [[Coulomb's law]] may be pictured in a simultaneous hyperplane, but relativistic relations of charge and force involve [[retarded potential]]s.

==World lines in general relativity==
The use of world lines in [[general relativity]] is basically the same as in special relativity, with the difference that [[spacetime]] can be [[curvature|curved]]. A [[metric tensor|metric]] exists and its dynamics are determined by the [[Einstein field equations]] and are dependent on the mass-energy distribution in spacetime. Again the metric defines [[lightlike]] (null), [[spacelike]] and [[timelike]] curves.  Also, in general relativity, world lines are [[timelike]] curves in spacetime, where [[timelike]] curves fall within the lightcone. However, a lightcone is not necessarily inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. However, this is an artifact of the chosen coordinate system, and reflects the coordinate freedom ([[diffeomorphism invariance]]) of general relativity. Any [[timelike]] curve admits a [[Proper frame|comoving observer]] whose "time axis" corresponds to that curve, and, since no observer is privileged, we can always find a local coordinate system in which lightcones are inclined at 45 degrees to the time axis. See also for example [[Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates]].

World lines of free-falling particles or objects (such as planets around the Sun or an astronaut in space) are called [[geodesic]]s.

==World lines in literature==
In 1884 [[C. H. Hinton]] wrote an essay "What is the fourth dimension ?" which he published as a [[scientific romance]]. He wrote
:Why, then, should not the four-dimensional beings be ourselves, and our successive states the passing of them through the three-dimensional space to which our consciousness is confined.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H. Hinton]] (1884) [https://archive.org/stream/scientificroman01hintgoog#page/n24/mode/2up What is the fourth dimension], ''Scientific Romances'', link from [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular description of human world lines was given by [[J. C. Fields]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in the early days of relativity. As described by Toronto lawyer Norman Robertson:
:I remember [Fields] lecturing at one of the Saturday evening lectures at the [[Royal Canadian Institute]]. It was advertised to be a "Mathematical Fantasy"—and it was! The substance of the exercise was as follows: He postulated that, commencing with his birth, every human being had some kind of spiritual aura with a long filament or thread attached, that travelled behind him throughout his life. He then proceeded in imagination to describe the complicated entanglement every individual became involved in his relationship to other individuals, comparing the simple entanglements of youth to those complicated knots that develop in later life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gilbert de Beauregard Robinson]] (1979) ''The Mathematics Department in the University of Toronto'', p. 19, [[University of Toronto Press]] {{ISBN|0-7727-1600-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because they oversimplify world lines, which traverse four-dimensional spacetime, into one-dimensional timelines, almost all purported science-fiction stories about [[time travel]] are actually wishful fantasy stories. Some device or superpowered person is generally portrayed as departing from one point in time, and with little or no subjective lag, arriving at some other point in time—but at the same literally geographic point in space, typically inside a workshop or near some historic site. However, in reality the planet, its solar system, and its galaxy would all be at vastly different spatial positions on arrival. Thus, the time travel mechanism would also have to provide instantaneous teleportation, with infinitely accurate and simultaneous adjustment of final 3D location, linear momentum, and angular momentum.

Author [[Oliver Franklin]] published a [[science fiction]] work in 2008 entitled ''World Lines'' in which he related a simplified explanation of the hypothesis for laymen.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Lines |author=Oliver Franklin |isbn=1-906557-00-4 |year=2008 |publisher=Epic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the short story ''[[Life-Line]]'', author [[Robert A. Heinlein]] describes the world line of a person:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Technovelgy: Chronovitameter |url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=1851 |accessdate= 8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:He stepped up to one of the reporters. "Suppose we take you as an example. Your name is Rogers, is it not? Very well, Rogers, you are a space-time event having duration four ways. You are not quite six feet tall, you are about twenty inches wide and perhaps ten inches thick. In time, there stretches behind you more of this space-time event, reaching to perhaps nineteen-sixteen, of which we see a cross-section here at right angles to the time axis, and as thick as the present. At the far end is a baby, smelling of sour milk and drooling its breakfast on its bib. At the other end lies, perhaps, an old man someplace in the nineteen-eighties.

:"Imagine this space-time event that we call Rogers as a long pink worm, continuous through the years, one end in his mother's womb, and the other at the grave..."

Heinlein's ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' uses the term, as does [[James Blish]]'s ''[[The Quincunx of Time]]'' (expanded from "Beep").

A [[visual novel]] named [[Steins;Gate]], produced by [[5pb.]], tells a story based on the shifting of world lines.  The "[[Science Adventure]]" series by the same company also utilized the concept.

[[Neal Stephenson]]'s novel [[Anathem]] involves a long discussion of worldlines over dinner in the midst of a philosophical debate between [[Platonic realism]] and [[nominalism]].

Absolute Choice depicts different world lines as a sub-plot and setting device.

'''Wristbands''' are encircling strips worn on the wrist or lower forearm. The term can be used to refer to a [[bracelet]]-like band, similar to that of a [[watch|wristwatch]], to the [[cuff]] or other part of a [[sleeve]] that covers the wrist, or to decorative or functional bands worn on the wrist for many different reasons. Wristbands are often worn and used similarly to event passes such as [[lanyard]]s to information or allow people entry to events. These wristbands are made from loops of [[plastic]] that are placed around the [[wrist]] and are used for identification purposes (demonstrating the wearer's authorization to be at a [[Music venue|venue]], for example).

Another type of wristband is the [[sweatband]]; usually made of a towel-like [[terrycloth]] material. These are usually used to wipe sweat from the forehead during sport but have been known to be used as a badge or [[fashion statement]]. A practice common in mid-1980s [[Punk subculture|punk]] [[subculture]] was to cut the top off of a [[sock]] and fashion the [[Elastomer|elastic]] into this type of wristband.

== Silicone wristbands ==

In the early-to-mid-2000s (decade), bracelets often made of [[silicone]] became popular. They are worn to demonstrate the wearer's support of a [[Social movement|cause]] or [[charitable organization]], similar to [[awareness ribbon]]s. Such wristbands are sometimes called [[awareness bracelets]] to distinguish them from other types of wristbands. In early 2007 they became an increasingly popular item being sold as merchandise at concerts &amp; sporting events worldwide. The wristbands bearing official logos or trademarks enabled the seller to offer a low price point merchandise option to fans. Silicone wristbands may also be called gel wristbands, jelly wristbands, rubber wristbands and fundraising wristbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wristbandbros.com/glossary/silicone-wristband/|title = Silicone Wristbands Explained|date = 9 September 2015|accessdate = 9 September 2015|website = Wristband Bros|publisher = Sean Mulligan|last = Mulligan|first = Sean}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these wristbands are made from the same silicone material.

== UV ultra violet wristbands ==
UV Ultra Violet Sensitive silicone wristbands appear clear/white when out of UV light, but when exposed to ultra violet light such as sunlight the wristbands' color changes to blue or fuchsia. These bands can be used as reminders for people to apply sunscreen or stay in the shade on hot summer days.

== Hospital wristbands ==
[[File:LB2-ADULT-L3 Assembled.jpg|thumb|Example of hospital wristband|right]]
Hospital wristbands are a commonly used safety device for identifying patients undergoing medical care (see [[patient safety]] and [[medical identification tag]]). Available in a variety of sizes to accommodate patients as small as newborns and as large as obese adults, hospital wristbands can be handwritten, embossed, laser-printed or thermal-imaged with names, pictures, medical record numbers, barcodes and other personal identifiers.

Laser printing and thermal imaging—the most advanced technologies for personalizing hospital wristbands—support fonts, colors and barcodes for improved [[patient safety]] through electronic patient and medication tracking. Handwritten and embossed wristbands remain in widespread use, however, despite findings on compromised safety reported in 2007. The [[National Patient Safety Agency]] (NPSA) found that as many as 2,900 patients each year were receiving the wrong medical care because of the hospital staff's inability to read damaged or otherwise illegible patient information on handwritten and embossed wristbands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrls.npsa.nhs.uk/resources/?entryid45=59824&lt;/ref&gt;

Colored wristbands are often given to people attending events such as [[music festival]]s and gigs, as an [[access control]] measure. Counterfeit wristbands are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/theticket/2009/1127/1224259509420.html|title=Coming soon to a music festival near you: the wristband racket|last=Boyd|first=Brian|date=27 November 2009|work=Irish Times|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/readingleeds-festival/50091|title=Reading And Leeds Festival organiser warns fans against ticket and wristband scam|date=5 March 2010|work=NME|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicone Wristbands (some times referred to as [[Gel bracelet]]s) are popular for fundraising or showing support for a cause. [[Custom wristbands]] are usually created by an event organizer and given out or sold to others interested in the event or supporting the cause.

Some people keep the wristbands as [[souvenir]]s or wear the wristbands after the event to show what events they went to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Reilly|first=John|title=No brief: graphic designers' personal projects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kU43im8AMUwC&amp;pg=PA44|series=Rockport Publishers|year=2002|isbn=2-88046-694-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further uses for the wristband in event ticketing at music festivals and sporting events may include an NFC ([[near field communication]]) chip that would allow [[contactless payment]] at the concessions and turnstiles. Wristbands are ideal to use for dark environments such as night clubs and bars or outdoor venues where patrons can be afar such as festivals and theme parks. 

In addition these styles of colored wristbands are used with the above listed hospital patient bands to serve as an extra  safety reminder and alert for [[Allergy|Allergies]]. They will have a standard color and will have written labeling such as "Fall Risks"(which may come from medical conditions, injuries and/or medications used with the possibility of all of the above causing the increased safety risk warning), "Allergies"(to cover allergic reactions to vast to list per band type risks), "Latex Allergies"( to make sure medical safety gloves are not made of latex which is an immediate risk more than other allergies), amongst several other important cautions that would protect the patient by preventing [[Iatrogenic]] mistakes, reducing additional medical complications.
