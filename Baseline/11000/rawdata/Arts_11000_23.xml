'''American News Company''' was a magazine, newspaper, book, and comic book distribution company founded in 1864&lt;ref&gt;"Patrick Farrelly," ''The Publishers' Weekly'' (April 30, 1904).&lt;/ref&gt; by Sinclair Tousey,&lt;ref&gt;"DEATH OF SINCLAIR TOUSEY, MANY WHO FOUNDED AMERICAN NEWS[sic], 'New York Times'' (June 17, 1887).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Record of Current Events", ''The American Monthly Review of Reviews'' (August 1910), pp 162–165.&lt;/ref&gt; which dominated the distribution market in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. The company's abrupt 1957 demise caused a huge shakeup in the publishing industry, forcing many magazine, comic book, and paperback publishers out of business.

==Early years==
The American News Company had its roots in two New York City newspaper and periodical wholesaling firms: Sinclair Tousey's company on Nassau St., and the firm Dexter, Hamilton &amp; Co. at 22 Ann St. These were the two largest news and periodical wholesalers in New York City at the time of their merger on Feb. 1, 1864, when American News Company was formed. The seven original partners were Sinclair Tousey, John E. Tousey, Harry Dexter, George Dexter, John Hamilton, Patrick Farrelly, and Solomon W. Johnson. These partners formed the core of the company's management until the death of the last surviving partner, Solomon Johnson, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;"Solomon Johnson Dead," ''The American Stationer'', Jan. 25, 1913, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair Tousey was the company's first president, followed after his death by Harry Dexter, who was succeeded by Solomon Johnson.

The company's Boston branch was formed by taking over the wholesale periodical business of Boston bookseller Alexander Williams. In 1854, Williams had bought out the business of [[William Pembroke Fetridge|Fetridge &amp; Co.]], which operated on the corner of State St. and Washington a large magazine store known as the Periodical Depot or the Periodical Arcade.&lt;ref&gt;"Alexander Williams", ''Publishers' Weekly'', January 20, 1900, p.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams worked up an extensive trade as a jobber of newspapers and periodicals to out of town dealers all over the East Coast, and by the time ANC was organized the wholesale side of the business had grown too large for Williams to handle alone. Along with two smaller competing firms, Dyer &amp; Co. and Federhen &amp; Co.,&lt;ref&gt;"Boston Notes", ''New England Stationer and Printer'', January 1900, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the Boston trade was reorganized as a subsidiary of American News under the name New England News Company, with Williams as one of the principal shareholders. Initially an officer of the new corporation, Williams was a bookstore proprietor at heart and left soon afterward in 1869 to take over the famous "[[Old Corner Bookstore]]".&lt;ref&gt;"A Change at the "Old Corner"", ''Publishers' Weekly'', April 14, 1883, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the company formed it added to its newspaper and magazine business a book jobbing department, under the supervision of a Mr. Dunham; this grew to be one of the largest in the country.

With the end of the Civil War, the firm grew rapidly along the expanding railroads as they opened up the West, with the commencement of coast-to-coast continental rail service in 1869. Legislation passed by Congress required the railroads to transport newspapers and periodicals as second class bulk mail at a special low subsidized rate—one cent per pound for any distance between news agencies, so that a bundle of New York newspapers could be sent across the continent to Los Angeles for the same price that it could be shipped across the river to Newark—and ANC exploited the availability of cheap rail transport to expand their distribution network across the continent, so far ahead of the competition that they effectively shut any possible rivals out of the market, establishing their periodical depots by the hundreds in every city and large town on the rail system. At the same time, the number of periodicals being published in America was exploding: [[Frank Luther Mott|Frank Mott]], in ''A History of American Magazines'', estimates that the number of titles being published boomed from 700 at the end of the Civil War to 3300 in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Mott, Frank L. ''A History of American Magazines, 1865-1885'' (Harvard Univ. Press, 1938), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, an article in ''The American Newsman'' summed up the company's success: "It is as the keeper of a thousand secrets involving the fortunes of publishers and authors that the American News Company surrounds its vast and intricate system with an atmosphere of mystery, so that few persons have any idea of its really astounding proportions. It has gradually absorbed the smaller organizations until it now embraces thirty-two powerful news companies, with an annual operating expense of $2,488,000 and an annual business of something like $18,000,000. This organization handles the bulk of the reading matter of the United States and supplies nearly nineteen thousand dealers."&lt;ref&gt;"The American News Company Up to Date," ''The American Newsman'', vol. 10, no. 11 (November 1893), p. 4-5. Unsigned article reprinted from ''The New York Herald'', October 1, 1893, 3rd section, p. 6 (as "A Vast System of Distribution").&lt;/ref&gt;

On any given day, a hundred new issues of the thousands of titles ANC handled would typically be fed into the ANC distribution system. In New York City alone (at that time consisting solely of Manhattan and the Bronx) 125 wagons and drivers crisscrossed the city every day making deliveries, with 14 local neighborhood substations.

ANC employed directly in 1893 1,154 people, with a weekly payroll of $16,255; with $1 million in real estate holdings and $1.4 million in merchandise on hand. It extended extensive credit to the firms it did business with and $800,000 was due at any given time in accounts receivable from dealers around the country. It owned outright 18 buildings around the country and rented 39 more, and had $200,000 invested in horses and wagons. The branches of the company at this time were located in Albany, Baltimore, Boston, Brooklyn, Buffalo, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Kansas City, Montreal, Newark, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Providence, San Francisco, Springfield (Mass.), St. Louis, St. Paul, Toronto, Troy, and Washington D.C. These branches were organized as subsidiaries under different names, for example the Chicago branch was the Great Western News Company, founded in 1866. The International News Company, on Duane Street in New York, was the branch handling the company's extensive overseas business. A branch called the Union News Company existed solely to sell newspapers and magazines on the railroads, with 300 newsstands in railroad stations which by 1893 covered 40% of the entire US railroad system, paying $1000 a day for exclusive rights. Under this system, Union News could keep the ''Chicago Tribune'' out of the Chicago area train stations until the ''Tribune'' agreed to their terms. In 1958, the FTC found that Union News was operating nearly a thousand newsstands around the country (the next largest operator had 57), putting Union News in a position to dictate terms and demand rebates from publishers.

Typically, in the post-Civil War era, ANC in its position as the middleman between publishers and newsstand dealers would allow the newsstand dealers to keep between 5 and 10 cents on the sale of a 35-cent magazine like the monthly ''Harper's'', and three cents on a 10-cent magazine like ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''.  Unsold copies of most titles were fully returnable, although some titles were sold to the dealers as non-returnable at a steeper discount, similar to today's "[[direct market|direct sale]]" comic book market.

American News's monopoly position in the market was virtually unchallenged until [[Frank Munsey]], frustrated by ANC's refusal to handle his cheap 10 cent pulp magazines, was forced to set up his own distribution, Red Star News.&lt;ref&gt;"The Red Star News Company", ''Munsey's Magazine'', December 1897, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first of the so-called ID or independent distributors. Munsey balked when ANC informed him that 4 cents was the most they would pay wholesale for a magazine that sold for 10 cents retail, and Munsey retaliated by cutting out the middleman and setting up his own distributor to sell directly to newsdealers for 7 cents a copy.&lt;ref&gt;"Frank A. Munsey," ''Printers' Ink, March 20, 1907, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Munsey was followed in time by [[Hearst Corporation|Hearst]], [[Fawcett Publications|Fawcett]], [[Curtis Publishing Company|Curtis]], [[Moe Annenberg|Annenberg]] and [[Harry Donenfeld|Donenfeld]], all constrained by various factors into setting up their own independent distribution networks outside the ANC monopoly; nonetheless ANC remained by far the dominant firm up until its collapse.

== Background ==
American News functioned both as a national distributor and as a local periodical wholesaler. After World War II, headed by Henry Garfinkle, the company had over 300 branches blanketing the United States, and employed several thousand employees. During the middle of the century, American News stood as the largest book wholesaler in the world, dominating the industry. It also had a near stranglehold on the distribution of magazines and newspapers within the United States market, dominating that industry as well. Listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], it had more than 5400 stockholders.&lt;ref name="lawsuit"&gt;[http://ny.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19681015_0000326.SNY.htm/qx "PERIODICAL DISTRIBS. v. AMERICAN NEWS CO.,"] UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK (October 15, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; Headquartered in [[New Jersey]], American News also had offices in downtown Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;The Park Place buildings were designed by female architect [[Fay Kellogg]]. See: [https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1911/11/12/104882402.pdf "New York's Real Lure for Women -- Opportunity,"] ''The New York Times'' (November 12, 1911). Accessed May 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comic book clients of American News included [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], [[Dell Comics]], and [[Toby Press]]. [[DC Comics|National Comics]] had its own distributor, [[Independent News Company]], and was able to take on distribution for other comic book publishers after American News failed. Comic book publishers who were not able to come to terms with National's distributors quickly went under, and others were limited in the number of titles they were allowed to distribute under the new arrangements—Atlas (later known as Marvel Comics) was rationed to eight titles a month. The change also affected paperback book publishers like Lion Library, which went out of business when Independent News (which was already distributing rival New American Library) refused to take it on. [[Avon (publisher)|Avon]] paperbacks, which had been founded as a subsidiary of ANC in 1941 in the early days of the paperback boom, managed to survive the crash and was taken over by Hearst.

Many magazines distributed in the 1940s were in [[pulp magazine|pulp]] format; by the end of 1955, nearly all had either ceased publication or switched to [[digest size|digest]] format. This change was largely the work of the refusal of American News and other distributors to carry the pulp magazines since they were no longer profitable.&lt;ref name=AshleyV3_88&gt;{{cite book | first=Michael | last=Ashley |authorlink= Mike Ashley (writer)| title=The History of the Science Fiction Magazine Vol. 3 1946–1955| publisher=Contemporary Books, Inc| location=Chicago | year=1976|isbn=0-8092-7842-1 | page = 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950s boom in science fiction magazine publishing, with 30 new titles being launched, turned overnight into collapse with the failure of ANC. Other pulp fiction genres—western, romance, detective—suffered a similar extinction event. These sections of the magazine field were already in decline and it was simply not worth the effort to rescue already marginal magazine titles.

== Demise ==
In 1952, the government began antitrust litigation against ANC which was destined to drag on until the company's demise. Around 1955 major magazine publishers began disengaging themselves from ANC and making other arrangements for newsstand distribution.  When ''[[Collier's Weekly|Collier's]]'' and ''[[Woman's Home Companion]]'', two of their biggest-selling titles, folded in January 1957, it came as a serious blow to ANC at a time when the company was already on financially shaky ground. In April [[Dell Publishing]] announced that they were pulling out and making other arrangements for their distribution.

The mammoth company's abrupt demise in June 1957 has been a source of speculation for decades. One theory is that a speculator became aware that a bookkeeping peculiarity in American News' accounts could allow a large profit from liquidating the company. He acquired control, and proceeded to sell off the assets, ultimately winding the company up.&lt;ref name=TM_191&gt;Michael Ashley, ''Transformations'', pp.&amp;nbsp;191.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was summarized in a 1960 lawsuit:
{{blockquote|In 1955 the defendant Henry Garfinkle and the members of his family acquired 11 per cent of the stock in the defendant American News Company. Soon thereafter he became its president. ... The defendant American News Company, notwithstanding its great size and notwithstanding its apparent dominance in the periodical distribution field, commencing in the fifties began to encounter difficulties. It lost franchise after franchise and began sustaining heavy losses. By 1957 it had sustained losses in connection with its distribution of periodicals in excess of $8,000,000.00. In 1957 it decided to cease its activities as a national distributor and local wholesaler. It laid off around 8,000 of its employees and sold all of the equipment used in connection with its distribution activities. By June 1957, it was entirely out of business as a national distributor and as a local wholesaler.&lt;ref name="lawsuit" /&gt;}}

An alternative (but somewhat similar explanation) for the company's demise has been offered by comic book historian and author [[Gerard Jones]]. The company in 1956...
{{blockquote|had been found guilty of restraint of trade and ordered to divest itself of the newsstands it owned. Its biggest client, [[George Delacorte]], announced he would seek a new distributor for his [[Dell Comics]] and paperbacks. The owners of American News estimated the effect that would have on their income. Then they looked at the value of the [[New Jersey]] real estate where their headquarters sat. They liquidated the company and sold the land. The company ... vanished without a trace in the [[suburban]] growth of the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. ''Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book'' (Basic Books, 2004; trade paperback {{ISBN|0-465-03657-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Repercussions ==
The effect on the American magazine market was catastrophic. Many magazines had to switch to one of the independent distributors, who were able to set their own conditions for taking on new business. This often forced the magazines to change from a [[digest size]] to a larger format, and to become monthly rather than bimonthly or quarterly. Many magazines could not afford to make these changes, both of which required either high circulation or a strong advertising base, and many magazines folded as a result.&lt;ref name=TM_191/&gt;

An example of a company that the change in distributor had a drastic impact on is [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], which was forced to switch distribution to [[Independent News]], owned by [[National Periodical Publications]], owner of Atlas' rival, [[DC Comics]]. Because of this, Atlas was constrained as to its publishing output for the next decade (including the early years of its successor, [[Marvel Comics]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5lHwfKOI2?url=http://twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/02stanroy.html "Stan the Man &amp; Roy the Boy: A Conversation Between Stan Lee and Roy Thomas,"] ''Comic Book Artist'' (2).

'''''Bandhak''''' is a [[Asian American|South Asian American]] film directed by [[Hyder Bilgrami]] and produced by [[Ramzan Lakhani]]. It explores the theme of racism against South Asians in the United States in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th attacks]] through the story of Baldev Singh, an Indian immigrant in [[New York City]] who, facing harassment in his workplace, takes his boss hostage with a toy gun.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/041120/149/2hzwm.html|publisher=Yahoo!

== Critical response ==
''Bandhak'' received media coverage in both the [[United States]] and [[India]]; it was first screened at a California film festival on September 11, 2004, and was brought to India by the Indo-American Art Council.&lt;ref name="TimesOfIndia"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/919424.cms|title=Now a 9/11 film, B'wood ishtyle|date=2004-11-10|accessdate=2007-01-10|last=Datta|first=Jyotirmoy|publisher=Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press release from the distributor Digimax Studio describes it as the first [[Hindi language|Hindi]] film in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Digimax Studio launches Bandhak (the hostage), the first Hindi film in US|url=http://www.digimax.us/site/html/press_release2.html|publisher=Digimax Studio|date=2003-12-23|accessdate=2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; One New Jersey film critic likened it to a South Asian version of [[Do The Right Thing]]. Producer Ramzan Lakhani described his motivation behind the film in an interview with a local [[New Jersey]] newspaper, stating that while second generation South Asian youth were producing many films in the United States, he hoped to target the immigrant first generation, and hence tried to tailor the film to Indian sensibilities, including [[Bollywood]]-style dance numbers and the use of Hindi.&lt;ref name="HNT"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.injersey.com/pulse/story/0,21493,1352512,00.html|title=Hindi film explores post-9/11 immigrant backlash|last=Jordan|first=Chris|date=2005-09-09|accessdate=2007-01-21|publisher=Home News Tribune}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blue Apple Theatre''' is an award-winning inclusive [[theatre]] company based in [[Winchester]], [[England]]. It was founded in 2005 by Jane Jessop to pioneer the inclusion of actors with [[intellectual disabilities]] on mainstream stages.&lt;ref name="Younger Theatre"&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Lewis |url=http://www.ayoungertheatre.com/spotlight-on-blue-apple-theatre/ |title=Spotlight On: Blue Apple Theatre |publisher=A Younger Theatre |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, six Blue Apple actors made history by touring a ground-breaking re-imagining of [[William Shakespeare|William Shakespeare's]] [[Hamlet]] around the South of England.&lt;ref name="BBC Ouch"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/05/actors_with_learning_disabilit.html |title=The Ouch!

In June 2012, Blue Apple Theatre was named as the 1000th winner of the [[Queen's Award for Voluntary Service]]&lt;ref name="QVA Announcement"&gt;[http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_188059 Volunteers honoured in Queen's Award for Voluntary Service : Directgov - Newsroom] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523184642/http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Nl1/Newsroom/DG_188059 |date=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of the great efforts of its voluntary staff.

==History==
Blue Apple was founded in 2005 by [[Jane Jessop]] to provide opportunities for people with a wide range of learning difficulties to participate in high quality theatre and dance opportunities.  Her aim was to enable them to discover and explore their talents on and off stage and to challenge expectations, with no ceiling on the opportunities given to them or on our expectations of them. She was inspired by the experience of her son [[Tommy Jessop]]  who was acting with the [[BBC]]. Over 50 people came to each of the pilot  workshops and Blue Apple has had a waiting list ever since.

Jane Jessop led the company for over ten years during which time Blue Apple won several awards, gained Arts Council funding, developed a film programme and broke through many barriers, enabling Blue Apple's performers to work in a professional environment, bring celebrated performances to mainstream theatres, and attract audiences of several thousand to touring productions. Jane's final project was a tenth birthday performance event on stage at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre in London.

Blue Apple now delivers over 400 drama and dance workshops a year for over 70 members, in addition to two professional theatre shows and one touring production each year. the company attracts audiences from all over England and has become respected as a leading producer of theatre and dance  by performers who have disabilities.

The company's first show was a basic [[Variety show]] called "Born to be Blue". This was such a success it was followed by a fully costumed pantomime "Cinderella and the Wolf" written with the cast by the playwright and film maker [https://www.thetalentmanager.co.uk/talent/23520/william-jessop William] Jessop. The company has created two full-scale productions a year ever since and launched a touring programme.

In 2008 the Apple Core auditioned theatre training group was established, Blue Apple launched its dance programme, made its first film and had a membership of around 50 people with learning disabilities. Blue Apple actors and dancers performed to a standing ovation in London, and in Brighton, Birmingham and around London.  Blue Apple won its first award for changing the way people see and understand learning disability in spring 2009.
 
In Autumn 2009, Blue Apple appointed their first arts consultant Peter Clerke, who in 2012 became the company's first Artistic Director.&lt;ref name="Pete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharts.org.uk/1/artsinscotland/drama/features/archive/profilepeterclerke.aspx |title=Scottish Arts Council - Archive - Profile: Peter Clerke |publisher=Scottisharts.org.uk |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Clerke  worked with the [[playwright]] William Jessop &lt;ref name="William Jessop profile in Ink Pellet magazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inkpellet.co.uk/2012/04/william-jessop/ |title=William Jessop |publisher=Ink Pellet |date= |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; to create various productions including promenade performances of [[A Midsummer Night's Dream]] to mark Blue Apple's fifth anniversary in June 2010,&lt;ref name="MND"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/winchester/8206826.Blue_Apple_tackles_the_Bard/ |title=Blue Apple tackles the Bard (From Hampshire Chronicle) |publisher=[[Hampshirechronicle.co.uk]] |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; an original play called "Captain Miserable and the Book Guardian" for Christmas 2010, a lively [[comic]] adaptation of [[Gogol|Gogol's]] [[The Government Inspector]] for Summer 2011, a groundbreaking touring adaptation of [[Hamlet]] for 2012, an adaptation of [[Théâtre Feydeau|Feydeau]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140423235733/http://blueappletheatre.hampshire.org.uk/hotel.html The Hotel du Paradis] for full company performance in 2013 and adaptations of  [[Much Ado About Nothing]] for both the touring and main company productions in 2014.

Volunteer support has always been vital to the success of the company. The crucial support of nearly 200 volunteers who have supported Blue Apple since its foundation was recognised by the Queen when in 2012 Blue Apple became the 1,000th winner of the Queen’s Award for volunteering.

==Apple Cores==
[[File:BlueAppleCores.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;The Apple Core Actors&lt;/center&gt;]]

In 2008, Blue Apple Theatre introduced an intensive theatre training scheme for auditioned actors and dancers which has evolved into Blue Apple's touring company. The "Apple Core" began by  creating various theatre and dance productions for performance at local and national events such as the [[Winchester Hat Fair]], [[Mencap]] conferences, medical schools and universities and two of the actors performed scenes from Hamlet in the cabinet office as part of the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].

In Autumn 2011, the six Apple Core actors (Four of the six have Downs syndrome) created the company's first major touring production, the hard hitting "Living Without Fear", which addressed the difficult subject of [[disability]] [[hate crime]] as perpetrated towards people with learning disabilities.Living Without Fear toured nationally and was performed to over 4,000 people including MPs and ministers in Parliament and over 600 school children and 800 police personnel. The [[Hampshire Chronicle]] described the play as 'the most powerful production seen in Winchester for many years'.&lt;ref name="Hampshire Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Joseph|title=Living Without Fear|newspaper=The Hampshire Chronicle|date=9/6/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Living Without Fear" had its second tour in March and April 2013.&lt;ref name="Entertainment Focus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainment-focus.com/theatre-section/theatre-news/living-without-fear-to-tour/ |title=Living Without Fear to tour |publisher=Entertainment Focus |date=2013-03-02 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Blue Apple Theatre received funding from the [[Home Office]] for the filmmaker William Jessop to create a film adaptation of the play for and with [[Hampshire Constabulary]].&lt;ref name="Community Action Against Crime Innovation Fund Grants"&gt;{{cite web|author=Home Office |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/community-action-against-crime-innovation-fund-successful-applicants |title=Community action against crime: innovation fund successful applicants - Publications |publisher=GOV.UK |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the Apple Core actors created a radical new touring production of [[Hamlet]] and in 2014 toured [[Much Ado About Nothing]] to theatres across the south of England and at [[RADA]].

==Hamlet==

In 2012, Blue Apple received [[Arts Council England]] funding&lt;ref name="Arts Council England Announcement"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/be-or-not-be-blue-apple-theatres-hamlet-goes-tour/ |title=To Be or Not to Be: Blue Apple Theatre’s Hamlet Goes on Tour |publisher=Arts Council |date=2012-05-01 |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708084519/http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/be-or-not-be-blue-apple-theatres-hamlet-goes-tour/ |archivedate=2013-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for its Core actors to tour a groundbreaking production of [[Hamlet]] to theatres across the South of England, playing at illustrious venues like the [[Minack Theatre]] in [[Cornwall]] and the [[Rose Theatre, Kingston]]. The production received positive reviews in [[The Stage]]&lt;ref name="The Stage Review of Blue Apple's Hamlet"&gt;{{cite web|author=Francesca Morrison |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/36167/hamlet |title=The Stage / Reviews / Hamlet |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date=2012-05-15 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hampshire Chronicle]]. Blue Apple's [https://web.archive.org/web/20160423153452/http://www.blueappletheatre.hampshire.org.uk/hamlet.html Hamlet] was performed to over 3,500 people in all and scenes were  performed by [[Tommy Jessop]], and Lawrie Morris in the cabinet office in 2012 and by [[Tommy Jessop]], and Katy Francis on stage at Shakespeare's Globe Theatre's Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in 2016..

The role of Hamlet was played by the [[Down Syndrome]] TV actor [[Tommy Jessop]], who starred in [[Coming Down the Mountain]] and has appeared in [[Holby City]], [[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]], [[Monroe (TV series)|Monroe]] and [[Doctors (soap opera)|Doctors]]. The other actors were Anna Brisbane, Ros Davies, James Elsworthy, Katy Francis and Lawrie Morris.

At the end of June 2012, the Core actors returned to the main company for three performances of "Hamlet" at the Theatre Royal, Winchester.

The story of Blue Apple's Hamlet is the subject of William Jessop's [[emmy]] nominated BBC 3 feature documentary, "[https://growingupdowns.co.uk/ Growing] Up Down's" &lt;ref name="DFG Winner"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedfg.org/news/details/1003/the-dfg-pitch-winner-announced |title=The DFG Pitch - Winner Announced |publisher=DFG |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2013-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006130117/http://thedfg.org/news/details/1003/the-dfg-pitch-winner-announced |archivedate=2014-10-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Three Growing Up Down's|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03sc49m|website=BBC Three|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Times reviewed it as "William Jessop's fabulous documentary... a triumph for the cast, for BBC Three, and for everyone involved in this life-enhancing project."

==Other work==
As well as producing plays, Blue Apple runs an award-winning dance programme and makes films.

"Perils of Penelope " is a short film made in 2008 by the whole company in the style of early silent movies.

"Freddie's Story" is a 40-minute training DVD  starring [[Tommy Jessop]], which tackles diagnostic overshadowing, gaining consent from someone with a learning disability, communication and care in hospital through dramatized scenes and face to face training by people who have learning disabilities and a hospital consultant. "Freddie's Story" is being used for training medical staff by the [[National Health Service]] in hospitals across Britain.&lt;ref name="Freddie's Story Article"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshirechronicle.co.uk/news/9309647.Blue_Apple_Theatre_s_latest_success/?ref=rss |title=Blue Apple Theatre's latest success (From Hampshire Chronicle) |publisher=Hampshirechronicle.co.uk |date=2011-10-17 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3916">'''Book-packaging''' (or book producing) is a publishing activity in which a publishing company outsources the myriad tasks involved in putting together a book—writing, researching, editing, illustrating, and even printing—to an outside company called a book-packaging company. Once the book-packaging company has produced the book, they then  sell it to the final [[publishing company]].

In this arrangement, the book-packaging company acts as a liaison between a publishing company and the writers, researchers, editors, and printers that design and produce the book. Book packagers thus blend the roles of agent, editor, and publisher.&lt;ref name="Glatzer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutewrite.com/site/book_packaging.htm |author=Glatzer, Jenna |title=Book Packaging: Under-explored Terrain For Freelancers |accessdate=January 14, 2007 |work=Absolute Write |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113015633/http://www.absolutewrite.com/site/book_packaging.htm |archivedate=January 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Book-packaging is common in the [[genre fiction]] market, particularly for books aimed at preteens and teenagers, and in the illustrated non-fiction co-edition market.

==Business model==
Publishing companies use the services of book-packaging companies in cases where the publishing company does not have the in-house resources to handle a project.&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt; There are two main reasons that publishing houses hire a book-packaging company: labor-intensive books (books with many illustrations or photographs, books which require coordinating the input of several authors, or 'novelty' books, such as gardening books that contain seed packages) and series books (e.g., [[Nancy Drew]], [[Sweet Valley High]], [[Goosebumps]], and the [[For Dummies]] series).&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt;

In many cases, the book is first conceived as a [[marketing]] concept, and a writer is then hired to write the book on a [[work for hire]] basis. In some cases, book packaging companies use a [[celebrity]] with a very marketable name as the credited author, while using a professional [[ghostwriter]] to do most of the writing, researching, and editing.

Book-packaging is a common strategy between smaller publishers in different [[sales territory|territorial market]]s where the company that first buys the [[intellectual property]] rights, sells a package to other publishers and gains an immediate return on capital invested. The first publisher will often print sufficient copies for all territories and thereby obtain the maximum quantity discounts on the print run for all.

==Remuneration and credit==
While the book-packaging sector is little-known outside the publishing world, it provides employment to many freelance authors and illustrators, particularly for those willing to work as [[ghostwriter]]s, without credit in the book. Most book packaging companies pay a flat rate for manuscripts ranging from several thousand dollars to $1 per word. However, most book packaging companies do not pay [[royalties]], which means that even if a ghostwriter's novel becomes a bestseller, the writer will not receive additional payment.&lt;ref name="Glatzer" /&gt;

Often, writers or creators working for book-packagers work anonymously as ghostwriters, under the book-packaging company name ("by our staff writers"), or under a [[pen name]].  In some cases, a writer's work will be credited to someone else’s name, such as a [[celebrity]], who is paid to be listed as the credited author as a way of increasing sales.

'''Campeche chair''', also known as a "plantation chair," is a type of lounge chair popular in [[Latin America]], the [[Caribbean]], and the [[Southern United States|American South]]. Its name comes from the [[Campeche]] region of [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatán Peninsula]], which manufactured and exported the chairs in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Great Britain it is called an "X-frame chair," which gives a clue to its structure: two X-shaped sides joined by horizontal rails, with a sling back and seat of leather, cane or wooden slats. Campeches often have attached arms, and sometimes are made into rocking chairs.

[[Thomas Jefferson]] owned at least two "Campeachy" armchairs at [[Monticello]],&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Randolph Trist (Jefferson's granddaughter) to her sister Ellen Randolph Coolidge, June 27, 1825, ''Papers of Thomas Jefferson, Retirement Series Digital Library'', University of Virginia, Charlottesville. Quoted in Gontar, ''Antiques''.&lt;/ref&gt; and had more copied by enslaved woodworker [[John Hemings]].&lt;ref&gt;The gift shop at Monticello sells replicas of a Jefferson "Campeachy."[http://www.monticelloshop.org/111006.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] owned a Mexican-made Campeche armchair at his plantation [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]], which was described as his "favorite seat."&lt;ref&gt;"Madison's Campeche chair returns to Montpelier," ''Montpelier Staff's blog'', 2011.[http://www.montpelier.org/blog/madison%E2%80%99s-campeche-chair-returns-montpelier]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such a [[point group]], for every point (x, y, z) in the [[unit cell]] there is an indistinguishable point (-x, -y, -z). Such point groups are also said to have ''inversion'' symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fu|first1=Liang|last2=Kane|first2=C.|title=Topological insulators with inversion symmetry|journal=Physical Review B|volume=76|issue=4|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.045302|arxiv = cond-mat/0611341 |bibcode = 2007PhRvB..76d5302F }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Point reflection]] is a similar term used in geometry.
Crystals with an inversion center cannot display certain properties, such as the [[piezoelectric effect]].

Point groups lacking an inversion center ('''non-centrosymmetric''') can be ''[[Polar point group|polar]]'', ''[[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'' , both or neither. 

A ''[[Polar point group|polar]]'' [[point group]] is one whose symmetry operations leave more than one common point unmoved. A polar point group has no unique origin because each of those unmoved points can be chosen as one. The unmoved points collectively make one or more unique anisotropic axes. Polar point groups in crystal include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, m, mm2, 3m, 4mm, and 6mm. 

A ''[[Chirality (mathematics)|chiral]]'' (often also called enantiomorphic) [[point group]] is one containing only proper (often called "pure") rotation symmetry. No inversion, reflection, roto-inversion or roto-reflection (i.e., improper rotation) [[symmetry]] exists in such point group. Chiral [[point group]]s in crystal include 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 222, 422, 622, 32, 23, and 432.  [[Chirality (chemistry)|Chiral molecules]] such as [[proteins]] crystallize in chiral [[point group]]s.

Non-centrosymmetric point groups in crystal 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 are both polar and chiral.

Non-centrosymmetric point groups in crystal -4, -42m, -6, -6m2, -43m are neither polar nor chiral. On the other hand, polar and chiral point groups must be non-centrosymmetric.

The '''Chimera of Arezzo''' is regarded as the best example of ancient [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] artwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Mark. “Chimera of Arezzo.” Ancient History Encyclopedia, 13 Jan. 2017, www.ancient.eu/article/1006/chimera-of-arezzo/.&lt;/ref&gt; British art historian, David Ekserdjian, described the sculpture as "one of the most arresting of all animal sculptures and the supreme masterpiece of Etruscan bronze-casting."&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;Dobrzynski, Judith H. “The Imaginary Made Nearly Real.” The Wall Street Journal, Dow Jones &amp; Company, 8 Feb. 2013, www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323539804578264234269625580.&lt;/ref&gt;  Made entirely of bronze and measuring 78.5&amp;nbsp;cm high with a length of 129&amp;nbsp;cm,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/chimaera_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; it was found alongside a small collection of other bronze statues in [[Arezzo]], an ancient Etruscan and Roman city in [[Tuscany]]. The statue was originally part of a larger sculptural group representing a fight between a [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] and the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]]. This sculpture was likely created as a [[votive]] offering to the Etruscan god [[Tinia]].

== History of the Chimera ==
According to [[Greek mythology]] the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] or "she-goat" was a monstrous, fire-breathing hybrid creature of [[Lycia]] in [[Asia Minor]], created by the binding of multiple animal parts to create a singular unnatural creature. As the offspring of [[Typhon]] and [[Echidna]], the Chimera ravaged the lands of Lycia at a disastrous pace.&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''Theogony'' 319-25&lt;/ref&gt; Distressed by the destruction of his lands, the king of Lycia, [[Iobates]], ordered a young warrior named [[Bellerophon]] to slay the dreaded Chimera, also as a favor to a neighboring king, [[Proetus]]. Proteus wanted Bellerophon dead because his wife accused him of ravishing her, and he assumed that the warrior would perish in the attempt to kill the beast. Bellerophon set out on his winged horse, [[Pegasus]], and emerged victorious from his battle, eventually winning not only the hand of Iobates' daughter but also his kingdom. It is this story that led art historians to believe that the Chimera of Arezzo was originally part of a group sculpture that included Bellerophon and Pegasus. Votive offerings for the Gods often depicted mythological stories. A round hole on the left rump of the Chimera might suggest a spot where Bellerophon may have struck the beast with a now-missing spear.&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; The first known literary reference was in Homer's ''Iliad'', and the epic poetry of [[Hesiod]] in the 8th century BCE also mentions the Chimera.&lt;ref&gt;"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009–February 8, 2010". J. Paul Getty Museum. Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
In response to questions of the statue's true meaning, [[Giorgio Vasari|Vasari]] wrote in his ''Reasonings Over the Inventions He Painted in Florence in the Palace of Their Serene Highnesses'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"Yes, sir, because there are the medals of the Duke my lord who came from Rome with a goat's head stuck in the neck of this lion, who as he sees VE, also has the serpent's belly, and we found the queue that was broken between those bronze fragments with many metal figurines that you've seen all, and the wounds that she has touched on show it, and yet the pain that is known in the readiness of the head of this animal ..."&lt;ref&gt;Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli and Mario Torelli, The Art of Classical Antiquity, Etruria-Rome , Turin, Utet, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The tail was not restored until 1785 when the [[Pistoia|Pistoiese]] sculptor [[Francesco Carradori]] (or his teacher, [[Innocenzo Spinazzi]]) fashioned a replacement, incorrectly positioning the serpent to bite the goat's horn. It is much more likely that the snake had to strike out against Bellerophon instead, since biting the head of the goat meant it was biting itself. Inscribed on its right foreleg is an inscription in the ancient Etruscan language. It has been variously deciphered, but most recently it is thought to read TINSCVIL, meaning: "Offering belonging to Tinia",&lt;ref&gt;TLE 663; Bonfante and Bonfante 2002, no. 26 p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that the bronze was a [[votive object]] dedicated to the supreme Etruscan god of day, Tin or Tinia. The original statue is estimated to have been created around 400 BCE.[[File:Chimaira, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Chimera, Nordisk familjebok]] In 1718, the sculpture was transported to the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and later, along with the remaining collection Cosimo I had originally seized, taken to the [[Palazzo della Crocetta]]. Court intellectuals of the time considered the Chimera of Arezzo to be a symbol of the Medici domination of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. Its permanent residence is in the [[National Archaeological Museum (Florence)|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Florence]] where it was placed on brief loan to the [[Getty Villa]] for an exhibition in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The sculpture was probably commissioned by an aristocratic clan or a prosperous community and erected in a religious sanctuary near the ancient Etruscan town of Arezzo, about 50 miles southeast of Florence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chimera was one of a [[hoard]] of bronzes that had been carefully buried for safety sometime in [[classical antiquity]]. A bronze replica now stands near the spot of its original discovery.

=== The Etruscans ===
The  [[Etruscan civilization]] was a wealthy civilization in ancient Italy with roots in the ancient region of [[Etruria]], which existed during the early 8th-6th century BCE and extended over what is now a part of modern [[Tuscany]], western [[Umbria]], and northern [[Lazio]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Etruscans, an introduction", Laurel Taylor, Khan Academy&lt;/ref&gt; The region became a part of the [[Roman Republic]] after the [[Roman-Etruscan Wars]].

Heavily influenced by [[Ancient Greek]] culture, [[Etruscan art]] is characterized by the use of terracotta, [[metalworking]]—especially in bronze—as well as jewelry and [[engraved gems]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Macanamara, Ellen. The Etrustcans, British Museum 1991. Print&lt;/ref&gt; Metal and bronze trinkets from the [[Mediterranean]] rapidly began to appear around Etruria. It is not clear to historians exactly when trading with the Eastern Mediterranean began, however it is clear that both [[Phoenicians]] and Greeks must have been interested in the metal ores of Etruria, causing a rise in popularity of the art trade in these regions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Etruscans were well known for their art throughout the [[Orientalizing Period]] 700-600 BCE, The [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Period]] 600-480 BCE, and the [[Hellenistic Period]] 2nd to 1st century BCE.

=== The discovery ===
Discovered on November 15, 1553 by constructions workers near the San Lorentio gate in Arezzo (ancient [[Arretium]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/english.html#rediscovery|title=The Chimaera of Arezzo (Getty Villa Exhibitions)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture was quickly claimed for the collection of the [[Medici]] [[Grand Duke of Tuscany]], [[Cosimo I]], who placed it publicly in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in the hall of [[Leo X]]. Cosimo also placed the smaller bronzes from the trove in his own ''[[Cabinet (room)|studiolo]]'' at [[Palazzo Pitti]], where "the Duke took great pleasure in cleaning them by himself, with some goldsmith's tools," as [[Benvenuto Cellini]] reported in his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Cellini, Benvenuto, and John Addington Symonds. 1955. The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini. N.Y.: Modern Library.&lt;/ref&gt; On discovery, the statue was missing the snake and its left front and rear paws.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/chimaera/english.html#rediscovery|title=The Chimaera of Arezzo (Getty Villa Exhibitions)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its fragmented state upon discovery, the statue was originally regarded as a lion. Italian painter [[Giorgio Vasari]] tracked down the statue motif by studying Ancient Greek and Roman coins, such as a silver ''stater''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; featuring an image of the Chimera, thus accurately identifying it. Eventually, it was officially identified as being a part of a larger piece illustrating a fight between the Chimera and the Greek hero [[Bellerophon]]. The sculpture was found among other small pieces that served as [[votive]] offerings to the God [[Tinia]]. This sculpture may also have served as an Etruscan religious dedication. After discovery, it began its residence in Florence where it remained until its transportation in 1718 to the [[Uffizi Palace]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"The Chimaera of Arezzo: July 16, 2009–February 8, 2010". J. Paul Getty Museum. "Discovery" Retrieved 21 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1870, the Chimaera of Arezzo has made its home at the National Archaeological Museum in Florence. As the sculpture made its way through the Florence museums, it increasingly attracted the attention of both artists and historians.

== Iconography ==
Typical [[iconography]] of the Chimera myth depicts the warrior [[Bellerophon]] as he confronts the Chimera, or rides atop or alongside [[chimera (mythology)|it]]. This iconography began to appear upon Greek vessels in 600 BCE.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chimera of Arezzo presents a very detailed and complex composition that most likely was meant for display and viewing in the round. The Chimera is clearly expressing pain throughout its body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Its form is contorted, its face and mouth open in outrage as it is struck by Bellerophon. Similar to [[Hellenistic]] sculpture, the Chimera's form and body language express movement as well as the clear tension and power of the beast's musculature and evoke in the viewer a feeling of deep emotional pain and interest in the contemplation of that movement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
[[File:Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 05.JPG|thumb|Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 05]]
[[File:Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 07.JPG|thumb|Chimera d'arezzo, fi, 07]]
Clearly influenced by [[Mediterranean]] myth culture, this bronze work is evidence of the mastery that Etruscan sculptors had not only over the medium but of mythological lore. Art historian A. Maggiani gives details of a clear [[Italiote]] context by pointing out iconographic comparisons from sites in [[Magna Graecia]] such as [[Metaponto]] and [[Kaulonia]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Italiote refers to a pre-Roman empire Greek-speaking population in southern Italy. Magna Graecia refers to the Greek colonies which were established in southern Italy from the 8th century BCE onwards.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With the Italiote context in mind, these trends are a clear indication of the increasing popularity of [[Attic]] or Athens-inspired architecture and sculpture. Ancient Athenians regarded themselves among the highest of society. Their art, religion, and culture was seen as the epitome of Greek achievement. While the ancient Athenians had long since perished by this time, their work and way of life were still regarded with great fascination and there was a desire to emulate it. Historians have generally come to a consensus that the Chimera of Arezzo was produced by [[Italiote]] craftsmen in the last decades of the fifth century BCE or in the beginning of the fourth century BCE. The fact that this sculpture was a votive offering to Tinia is a reminder of the wealth and sophistication of Etruscan elites.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Becker, Jeffery A. “Chimera of Arezzo (Article) | Etruscan.” Khan Academy, www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ancient-art-civilizations/etruscan/a/chimera-of-arezzo&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods and materials ==
In the 3rd millennium BCE ancient foundry workers discovered by trial and error that bronze had distinct advantages over pure [[copper]] for making artistic statuary. [[Bronze]] stays liquid longer when filling a mold due to its lower [[melting point]]. Bronze is a superior metal than copper for sculpture casting because of its higher tensile strength.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Hemingway, Authors: Seán Hemingway Colette. “The Technique of Bronze Statuary in Ancient Greece | Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art.” The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/grbr/hd_grbr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The island of [[Cyprus]] supplied most of the bronze used for artistic purposes throughout the ancient Mediterranean region.

The earliest forms of Greek bronze sculptures were simple, hand-worked sheets of bronze known as ''sphyrelaton'' (literally, “hammer-driven”).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Like modern clay sculpture, these metal sheets could be embellished by hammering the metal over various wooden shapes made with textures that created a desired look or depth. This was later adapted to become the technique known today as [[tracing (art)|tracing]]. By the late Archaic period (ca. 500–480 B.C.) ''sphyrelaton'' lost popularity as [[lost-wax]] casting became the primary form of bronze sculpting. Lost-wax casting of bronze was achieved in three different ways, each with its own desired effects. The first and earliest method was [[solid]] casting, which required a model of the sculpture to be fashioned in solid wax and then carved. The second method was hollow [[lost-wax]] casting, which was created by a direct process. Finally, the third was hollow [[lost-wax]] casting by an indirect process. The model is packed in clay, and then heated in what today would be similar to a [[kiln]] to remove the wax and harden the clay. Then, the mold is inverted and metal poured inside it to create a cast. When cooled, the [[bronze]]-[[Metalsmith|smith]] cracks open the clay model to reveal a solid bronze replica.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

For smaller details, sculptors often made eyes out of glass and painted on body hair, clothing details, and skin color. Lost in antiquity, most historical knowledge of how certain bronze statues would have looked comes from studying surviving Roman [[marble]] copies.

[[Image:009MA Kritios.jpg|thumb|''Kritios Boy''. c. 480 BCE, was the first known statue to use ''contrapposto''.]]
'''''Contrapposto''''' ({{IPA-it|kontrapˈposto}}) is an [[Italian language|Italian]] term that means counterpoise.  It is used in the [[visual arts]] to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance.  It can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another.  It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called ''ponderation''). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the ''engaged'' leg, the relaxed leg is known as the ''free'' leg.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 139. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrapposto is less emphasized than the more sinuous [[S Curve (art)|S Curve]], and creates the illusion of past and future movement.&lt;ref&gt;"Contrapposto". Grove Encyclopedia Of Materials &amp; Techniques In Art: 142–143. October 2008. {{ISBN|9780195313918}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrapposto was an extremely important sculptural development, for its appearance marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The balanced, harmonious pose of the [[Kritios Boy]] suggests a calm and relaxed state of mind, an evenness of temperament that is part of the ideal of man represented. 
[[File:Etruscan Statuette.jpeg|thumb|[[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] statuette, from Italy, 3rd to 1st century BCE, bronze]]
From this point onwards Greek sculptors went on to explore how the body could convey the whole range of human experience, culminating in the desperate anguish and pathos of ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' (1st century CE)  in the Hellenistic period.

==History==

===Classical===
The first known statue to use contrapposto is [[Kritios Boy]], c. 480 BC,&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and J. Fleming, (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 122. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; so called because it was once attributed to the sculptor [[Kritios]]. It is possible, even likely, that earlier bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and [[Kenneth Clark]] called the statue "the first beautiful nude in art".&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, Kenneth. (2010) ''The Nude: A study in ideal form''. New edition. London: [[The Folio Society]], pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is a Greek marble original and not a Roman copy.
 
Prior to the introduction of contrapposto, the statues that dominated ancient Greece were the [[Archaic Greece|archaic]] [[kouros]] (male) and the [[Kore (sculpture)|kore]] (female). Contrapposto has been used since the dawn of classical western sculpture. According to the ''canon'' of the Classical Greek [[Sculpture|Sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] in the 4th century BC, it is one of the most important characteristics of his figurative works and those of his successors, [[Lysippos]], [[Skopas]], etc. The Polykletian statues – for example, [[Discophoros]] (''discus-bearer'') and [[Doryphoros]] (''spear-bearer'') – are idealized athletic young men with the divine sense, and captured in contrapposto. In these works, the pelvis is no longer [[Axial skeleton|axial]] with the [[Kouros|vertical statue as in the archaic style]] of earlier Greek sculpture before ''Kritios Boy''.

Contrapposto can be clearly seen in the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] copies of the statues of [[Hermes]] and [[Heracles]]. A famous example is [[Hermes and the Infant Dionysus|the marble statue]] of Hermes with the infant [[Dionysus]] in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] by [[Praxiteles]]. It can also be seen in the Roman copies of Polyclitus's [[Amazons|Amazon]].

Greek art emphasized humanism along with the human mind and the human body's beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Greek Humanism|url = http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/engl257/Ancient/greek_humanism.htm|website = www.webpages.uidaho.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greek youths trained and competed in athletic contests in the nude. A great contribution to the contrapposto pose was the concept of a canon of proportions, in which mathematical properties are used to create proportions.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Max (2010). "The 'Golden Canon' of book-page construction: proving the proportions geometrically". Journal of Mathematics &amp; The Arts. 4 no. 3: 137–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
Classical contrapposto was revived in the [[Renaissance]] by the Italian artists [[Donatello]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]], followed by [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and other artists of the [[High Renaissance]]. One of the major achievements of the [[Italian Renaissance]] was the re-discovery of contrapposto, although in [[Mannerism]] it became greatly over-used.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Modern times===
The technique continues to be widely employed in sculpture.

The '''Cretto di Burri''' (crack of Burri) or Cretto di Gibellina (crack of Gibellina), also known as "The Great Cretto", is a landscape artwork which undertaken by [[Alberto Burri]] in 1984 and was left in an unfinished state in 1989 (due to lack of funds),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.burricentenario.com/home/iniziative-ed-eventi-del-centenario-di-burri/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gibellina.siciliana.it/pages/cretto.html&lt;/ref&gt; based on the old city of [[Gibellina]]. The original city of Gibellina was completely destroyed in the [[1968 Belice earthquake]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.palinsesti.org/2006/grande-cretto&lt;/ref&gt; Gibellina has since been rebuilt, about 20&amp;nbsp;km from the city's original location.  In 2015 to mark what would have been Burri's one hundredth birthday the work was completed at last.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abitare.it/en/habitat-en/landascape-design-en/2015/11/06/in-gibellina-the-cretto-by-burri-is-finished-after-30-years/?refresh_ce-cp&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is the subject of a short documentary by the Dutch filmmaker Petra Noordkamp which was created as commissioned by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] to be screened at the Alberto Burri retrospective held at the institution from October 9, 2015 until January 6, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://5dutchdaysnyc.org/petra-noordkamp-film-on-il-grande-cretto-di-gibellini/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Van Eyck - The Crucifixion; The Last Judgment.jpg|thumb|500px|[[Jan van Eyck]], ''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych'', c. 1430–40. Oil on canvas, transferred from wood. Each 56.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 19.7&amp;nbsp;cm (22.25&amp;nbsp;in × 7.75&amp;nbsp;in); [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]
 
The '''''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych''''' (or '''''Diptych with Calvary and Last Judgement''''')&lt;ref name="v362"&gt;Vermij et al., 362&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two small painted panels attributed to the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] artist [[Jan van Eyck]], with areas finished by unidentified followers or members of his workshop. This [[diptych]]  is one of the early [[Northern Renaissance]] [[Panel painting|oil on panel]] masterpieces, renowned for its unusually complex and highly detailed [[iconography]], and for the technical skill evident in its completion. It was executed in a miniature format; the panels are just {{convert|56.5|cm|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|19.7|cm|abbr=on}} wide. The diptych was probably commissioned for private devotion.

The left-hand wing depicts the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion.]] It shows Christ's followers grieving in the foreground, soldiers and spectators milling about in the mid-ground and a portrayal of three crucified bodies in the upper-ground. The scene is framed against an azure sky with a view of [[Jerusalem]] in the distance. The right-hand wing portrays scenes associated with the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]]: a hellscape at its base, the resurrected awaiting judgement in the centre-ground, and a representation of [[Christ in Majesty]] flanked by a [[Deesis|Great Deësis]] of saints, [[apostles]], clergy, virgins and nobility in the upper section. Portions of the work contain Greek, Latin and Hebrew inscriptions.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;"[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110000722 The Crucifixion; The Last Judgment]". [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. Retrieved 20 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Gilding|gilt]] frames contain Biblical passages in Latin drawn from the [[Books of the Bible|books]] of [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]], [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. According to a date written in Russian on their reverse, the panels were [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]] supports in 1867.

The earliest surviving mention of the work appears in 1841, when scholars believed the two panels were wings of a lost [[triptych]].&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] acquired the diptych in 1933. At that time, the work was attributed to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]]&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 216&lt;/ref&gt; because key areas formally resembled pages of the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'', which were then believed to be of Hubert's hand.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; On the evidence of technique and the style of dress of the figures, the majority of scholars believe the panels are late works by Jan van Eyck, executed in the early 1430s and finished after his death. Other art historians hold that van Eyck painted the panels around the early 1420s and attribute the weaker passages to a younger van Eyck's relative inexperience.&lt;ref name="B86"&gt;Borchert, 86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B89"&gt;Borchert, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format and technique ==
Along with [[Robert Campin]] and later [[Rogier van der Weyden]], Van Eyck revolutionised the approach towards naturalism and [[Realism (arts)|realism]] in Northern European painting during the early to mid 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 378&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to manipulate oils to give the close detailing that infused his figures with the high degree of realism and complexity of emotion  seen in this diptych.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 163&lt;/ref&gt; He coupled this with a mastery of glaze to create luminous surfaces with a deep perspective—most noticeable in the upper portion of the ''Crucifixion'' panel—which had not been achieved before.&lt;ref name="V70"&gt;Viladesau, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1420s and 1430s, when oil and panel painting were still in their infancy, vertical formats were often used for [[Doom paintings|depictions of the Last Judgement]], because the narrow framing particularly suited a hierarchical presentation of heaven, earth and hell. By contrast, depictions of the [[Crucifixion in the arts|Crucifixion]] were usually presented in a horizontal format. To fit such expansive and highly detailed representations onto two equally small and narrow wings, van Eyck was forced to make a number of innovations, redesigning many elements of the ''Crucifixion'' panel to match the vertical and condensed presentation of the Judgement narrative.&lt;ref name="SM144"&gt;Smith, 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; The result is a panel with the crosses rising high into the sky, an unusually packed crowd scene in the mid-ground, and the moving spectacle of the mourners in the foreground, all rendered in a continuous slope from bottom to top in the style of medieval [[Tapestry|tapestries]]. Art historian [[Otto Pächt]] says it "is the whole world in one painting, an [[Orbis Pictus]]".&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

In the ''Crucifixion'' panel, van Eyck follows the early 14th-century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique.&lt;ref name="l14"&gt;Labuda, 14&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Jeffrey Chipps Smith]], the episodes appear as "simultaneous, not sequential" events.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; Van Eyck condenses key episodes from the gospels into a single composition, each placed so as to draw the viewer's eye upward in a logical sequence.&lt;ref name="l14"/&gt; This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater [[Perspective (graphical)|illusion of depth]] with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; In the ''Crucifixion'' panel, he uses different indicators to show the relative closeness of particular groupings of figures to Jesus. Given the size of the mourners in the foreground relative to the crucified figures, the soldiers and spectators gathered in the mid-ground are far larger than a strict adherence to perspective would allow. In the ''Last Judgement'' the damned are placed in hell in the lower mid-ground while the saints and angels are positioned higher in the upper foreground.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; Pächt writes of this panel that the scene is "assimilated into a single spatial cosmos", with the archangel acting as a divider in the pictorial space between heaven and hell.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

Art historians are unsure as to whether the panels were meant to be a diptych or a triptych.&lt;ref name ="P190"/&gt; They may have formed the outer wings of a triptych, with a since-lost panel representing the [[Adoration of the Magi]] at the centre,&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; or, as the German art historian [[Johann David Passavant|J.D. Passavant]] speculated in 1841, the lost centre panel may have been a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]].&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; It is now thought unlikely that a lost panel could be the postulated original companion to the outer wings; such a coupling would have been very odd to painters of the 1420s and 1430s. It has also been proposed that a central piece was added later, or as Albert Châtelet writes, the central panel may have been stolen.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CA74"&gt;Châtelet, 74&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[Erwin Panofsky]] believed the ''Crucifixion'' and ''Last Judgement'' panels were intended as a diptych. He argued that it would have been unusual for mere outer wings to have been given the "sumptuous treatment" afforded these two panels.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 454&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is reminiscent of the medieval [[reliquary|reliquaries]].&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; Others have observed that triptychs were usually much larger works intended for public display, and they tended towards gilded and heavily inscribed frames; typically only the central panel would have been as lavishly decorated as these panels. Contemporary diptychs, in contrast, were usually produced for private devotion and were typically ungilded.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; There is no documentary evidence for an original central panel, however, and technical examination suggests the two works were intended as wings of a diptych, then an emerging format.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 78&lt;/ref&gt; Pächt believes there is not enough evidence to determine whether a third panel existed.&lt;ref name ="P190"&gt;Pächt, 190–191&lt;/ref&gt;

== The diptych ==

=== ''Crucifixion'' panel ===
The ''Crucifixion'' panel comprises three horizontal planes, each representing different moments from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. The upper third shows the [[crucifixion]] before a view of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]]; the lower two thirds detail the crowds and Jesus' followers at [[Calvary|Golgotha]] (''Place of the Skull'').&lt;ref name="L9"&gt;Labuda, 9&lt;/ref&gt; Located outside the city walls amongst rock tombs and gardens, in the first century Golgotha was Jerusalem's place of execution,&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; and the visible patches of hill highlight the area's "stony, forbidding, and lifeless" nature.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; The atmosphere of bleakness is reinforced by the random figures in the upper ground that scramble for a better view.&lt;ref name="L9" /&gt; The gospels tell of Jesus' followers and relatives, as well as his prosecutors and assorted spectators, attending the crucifixion at Golgotha. In van Eyck's panel the former are represented in the foreground, while the latter, including [[High Priest (Judaism)|High Priests]] and [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple Elders]], are shown in the mid-ground.&lt;ref name="l10"&gt;Labuda, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail Dying Christ.jpg|thumb|Death of Christ on the cross. Typically, a crucifixion victim's legs were broken to hasten death. According to the Gospel of John, when soldiers came to break Jesus' legs, they found him already dead. A soldier pierced his side with a lance; blood and water poured from the wound.&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 129&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The centre foreground shows a group of five mourners, with three other figures set to the right and left. In the center group, [[John the Evangelist]] supports the Virgin [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], surrounded by three women. Mary's [[Swoon of the Virgin|dramatic swoon]] in grief pushes her forward in the pictorial space, and according to Smith, places her "closest to the viewer's presumed position".&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; Dressed in an enveloping blue robe that hides most of her face, she collapses and is caught by John, who supports her by her arms. [[Mary Magdalene]] kneels to the right, dressed in a white-trimmed green robe and red sleeves. Raising her arms aloft, she clenches her fingers in a distraught, agonised manner.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, 16&lt;/ref&gt; She is the only figure from this group shown to look directly at Christ and serves as one of the key painterly devices to direct the viewer's gaze upwards towards the crosses.&lt;ref name="l12"&gt;Labuda, 12&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth and fifth mourners have been identified as prophesying [[sibyls]], and stand to the far left and right of the centre group. The sibyl to the left faces the cross with her back to the viewer while the turbaned mourner on the right faces the group and is either the [[Erythraean Sibyl|Erythraean]] or the [[Cumaean Sibyl|Cumaean]] sibyl,&lt;ref name="l12" /&gt; both of whom are attributed in Christian tradition with warning the occupying Romans of the cult of redemption that would develop around Christ's death and resurrection.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; She has an almost indifferent expression that has been interpreted both as satisfaction at seeing her prophesies realised,&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; and as compassionate contemplation of the other women's grief.&lt;ref name="w146"&gt;Weale, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid-ground shows a crowd scene above the group of mourners, separated by two soldiers who stand between the two groupings. The mourners from the foreground are reflected in the shield carried on the hip of the lance-bearing Roman soldier who leans on the man to his right wearing a red turban. Smith believes this serves to highlight the mourners' emotional and physical separation from the assorted figures gathered in the mid-ground.&lt;ref name="s146"&gt;Smith, 146&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Adam Labuda sees these two figures, positioned full-length between the chief mourners and mid-ground spectators, as a pictorial device that along with the Magdalene's upward gaze draws viewers' eyes upwards through the panel's dramatic sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Labuda, 13&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail Mounted on lookers.jpg|left|thumb|The taunting of the condemned. At the time there were many enemies of the Temple and Jesus was seen by the Jewish hierarchy merely as the charismatic successor to [[John the Baptist]]. Although he became enough of a legitimate threat to be executed, he was ultimately viewed by the elders as just another agitating pseudo-prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Sebag Montefiore, 114–127&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van Eyck's depiction lays particular emphasis on the brutishness and indifference of the crowd witnessing Christ's suffering.&lt;ref name="b192"&gt;Burroughs, 192&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise a mixture of Roman legionaries, judges and various hangers-on arriving to witness the spectacle.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; A number are dressed in rich, brightly coloured clothes, a mixture of oriental and northern European styles,&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; while several are mounted on horseback. Some openly jeer and taunt the condemned, others gape stupefied at "just another" execution,&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; while others talk amongst themselves. The exception is the armoured [[centurion]], seated on a white horse at the extreme right edge of the panel, who looks up at Christ, arms spread wide, head thrown back, at "the very moment of his illumination" in recognition of Christ's divinity.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; The horsemen closely resemble both the ''[[:File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Knights of Christ.jpg|Soldiers of Christ]]'' and ''[[:File:Ghent Altarpiece E - Just Judges by Vanderveken.jpg|Righteous Judges]]'' from the lower inner panels of van Eyck's c. 1432 ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]''. Art historian [[Till-Holger Borchert]] observes that these figures are given "greater dynamism by being seen in rear rather than profile view", and that this vantage point draws the observer's eye upwards towards the mid-ground and the crucifixion.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt;

Van Eyck extends the height of the crosses to an unrealistic degree to allow the crucifixion to dominate the upper third of the panel. Christ faces the viewer directly, while the crosses of the two thieves are set at angles to either side.&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; The thieves are each bound with cords of rope rather than nails.&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt; The body of the thief to the right—the [[Penitent thief|repentant thief]] mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]]—is lifeless. The [[Impenitent thief|"bad" thief]] to his left is dying twisted in pain, and according to art historian [[William Henry James Weale|James W.H. Weale]], depicted as "struggling desperately, but in vain".&lt;ref name="w147"&gt;Weale, 147&lt;/ref&gt; Both men's hands have turned black from a lack of blood flow.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; A placard prepared by Pilate or Roman soldiers placed above Jesus' head reads "[[Jesus, King of the Jews|Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews]]" in Hebrew, Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt;

[[File:14th-century painters - Page from the Très Belles Heures de Notre Dame de Jean de Berry - WGA16012.jpg|280px|thumb|Leaf from the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'', unknown artist, c. 1440–1450. This illustration is often attributed to Jan van Eyck or a member of his workshop.]]
The panel captures the instant of Christ's death,&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt; traditionally the moment after the breaking of the thieves' legs (although this is not depicted). Christ is naked except for a transparent veil, with some of his pubic hair visible.&lt;ref name="V70" /&gt; His hands and feet are nailed to the timber; the blood from the nail holding his feet to the cross stains its wooden base.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt; His arms strain under the weight of his upper body, and in his final agony, his jaw has fallen slack; his mouth is open with his teeth exposed in the grimace of death.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; In the mid-ground, at the base of the cross, [[Saint Longinus|Longinus]], on horseback, wearing a fur-trimmed hat and green tunic, guided by an assistant,&lt;ref name="w146" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps a reference to his blindness in some later accounts.&lt;/ref&gt; stretches to pierce Jesus' side with a [[Holy Lance|lance]],&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; as deep-red blood pours from the wound. To the right of Longinus, a mostly obscured [[Stephaton]] holds high a sponge soaked with vinegar on the tip of a reed.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt;

The first generation of [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painters did not usually pay much attention to landscape backgrounds. They were often included, showing strong influence from the Italian painters, but typically as minor elements of the composition, seen in the far distance and lacking any real observation of nature.&lt;ref name="B188"&gt;Burroughs, 188&lt;/ref&gt; This diptych, however, contains one of the most memorable landscape backgrounds in Northern 15th-century art. The panoramic view of Jerusalem extends upwards in the distance to the mountainous peaked range in the background. The sky, which continues to the upper part of the right hand panel, is rendered in deep blues and lined with [[Cumulus cloud|cumulus]] clouds. These clouds are similar to those in the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' and, as in that work, are included to give depth to and enliven the background skyscape.&lt;ref name="maxj53"&gt;Friedländer, 53&lt;/ref&gt; The sky seems to have just darkened, in keeping with the idea that the panel captures the moment of Jesus' death.&lt;ref name="l10" /&gt; Faint [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] clouds can be seen in the far high-ground, with the presence of the sun is suggested by a shadow falling on the top left area of the panel.&lt;ref name="SM144" /&gt;

=== ''Last Judgement'' panel ===
The right hand wing, as with the ''Crucifixion'' wing, is divided horizontally into three areas. Here they represent, from top to bottom heaven, earth and hell. Heaven contains a traditional [[Deesis|Great Deësis]] with clergy and laity; earth, in the mid-ground, is dominated by the figures of [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]] and a [[Death (personification)|personification of Death]]; while in the lower ground the damned fall into hell, where they are tortured and eaten by beasts.&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 192–195&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the hell passage, art historian Bryson Burroughs writes that "the diabolical inventions of [[Hieronymus Bosch|Bosch]] and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Brueghel]] are children's boggy lands compared to the horrors of the hell [van Eyck] has imagined."&lt;ref&gt;Burroughs, 193&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mm182"&gt;McNamee, 182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych the Fall3.jpg|left|thumb|380px|[[Michael (archangel)|Saint Michael the Archangel]] bestrides the damned, while behind him the resurrected emerge from their graves before a burning city.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;]]
Pächt compares the scene to a medieval [[bestiary]], comprising a "whole fauna of zoomorphic fiends".  Van Eyck's hell is inhabited by demonic monsters whose only visible features are often "their glittering eyes and the white of their fangs".&lt;ref name="P192"&gt;Pächt, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;  The sinners fall head first into their torment, at the mercy of devils taking recognisable forms such as rats, snakes and pigs, as well as a bear and a donkey.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; Daringly, van Eyck shows kings and members of the clergy among those condemned to hell.&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt;

The earth is represented by the narrow area between heaven and hell. The passage shows the resurrection of the dead as the fires of the last day rage. The dead rise from their graves to the left and from the stormy sea to the right.&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; The Archangel Michael stands on death's shoulders,&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; the largest figure in the painting, whose body and wings span the entire pictorial space.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt; Michael wears jewel-studded golden armour and has curly blond hair and multicoloured wings similar to those seen in the [[donor portrait|donor panel]] of van Eyck's 1437 Dresden ''[[Dresden Triptych|Triptych of the Virgin and Child]]''.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt; Michael appears, according to Smith, "like a giant on the earth, whose crust is revealed to be the wings of the skeletal figure of Death. The damned are excreted though Death's bowels into the dark slime of hell."&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; The bat-like death figure, with skull extruding up to earth and skeletal arms and legs reaching down into hell, is the protagonist of the narrative according to Pächt, but death is vanquished by the slim and youthful looking [[archangel]] standing between the horrors of hell and the promise of heaven.&lt;ref name="P192"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Crucifixion Right Detail 1.jpg|thumb|350px|A personification of death spreads its skeletal wings over the fallen and damned, a number of whom can be identified by their headdress as members of the clergy.]]
The upper portion of the panel shows the second coming as recorded in [[The Sheep and the Goats|Matthew 25:31]]: "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory."&lt;ref name="u202"&gt;Underwood, 202&lt;/ref&gt; Christ, who was naked, frail and almost lifeless in the ''Crucifixion'' panel, is now resurrected and [[Christ in Majesty|triumphant in heaven]].&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt; He is dressed in a long red [[cope|mantle]] and is barefoot. His hands and feet are surrounded by circles of yellow light.&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt; The [[Holy Wounds]] are visible on his
palms held open; the puncture mark left by Longinus' spear is visible on his side through the opening in his robe, as are the nail holes on his feet.&lt;ref name="mm181"&gt;McNamee, 181&lt;/ref&gt;

Christ is seated at the centre of a large array of angels, saints and holy elders.&lt;ref name="mm181"/&gt; According to Pächt, in this scene in heaven that "all is sweetness, gentleness and order."&lt;ref&gt;Pächt, 195&lt;/ref&gt; Mary and [[John the Baptist]] kneel in prayer to his immediate right and left. Both have halos and are rendered at a far larger scale than the surrounding figures, over whom they seem to tower. Mary holds her right hand at her breast, while her left is raised as if to ask for mercy for the smaller naked figures sheltered by her cloak, evoking the conventional pose of the [[Virgin of Mercy]]. A choir of virgins gather directly under Christ's feet. They face outwards towards the viewer and sing Christ's praise.&lt;ref name="mm181" /&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck Diptych Detail.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Detail of the [[Christ in Majesty]]. This area is considered to have been painted more broadly and with less skill than the other sections of the panels, and is thus thought by some to have been painted by members of van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Most likely after his death around 1441.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Headed by [[Saint Peter]], the Apostles are dressed in white robes and sit on two facing benches set below Christ and to the right and left of the choir of virgins. Two angels attend to the groups gathered at each side of the benches.&lt;ref&gt;Weale, 147–148&lt;/ref&gt; A further two angels are positioned immediately above Christ. They hold his cross and are dressed in white [[amice]] and [[alb]]s, with the right hand angel wearing an outer blue [[dalmatic]] vestment. They are flanked on either side by angels playing long wind instruments, probably trumpets.&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt; The two angels on either side of Christ bear the [[Arma Christi|symbols of the crucifixion]] already represented on the left hand panel. The angel on the left holds a lance and [[crown of thorns]], the angel on the right a [[Holy Sponge|sponge]] and [[Nail (relic)|nails]].&lt;ref name="mm182" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mm181" /&gt;

Van Eyck was a central influence on [[Petrus Christus]] and the younger painter is thought to have studied the panels while they were still in van Eyck's workshop.&lt;ref name="B89" /&gt;&lt;!--any more detail on this? When, how do we know?--&gt;&lt;!--yes, wait, but not very flattering to Christus, source him as deritive and simplifing--&gt; He made a much larger and adapted paraphrase of the panel in 1452, as part of a monumental altarpiece,  now in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Susan. "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/eyck/hd_eyck.htm Jan van Eyck (ca. 1380/90–1441)]". In ''Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History''. New York: [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], 2000. Retrieved 7 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are significant differences between the two works, the influence of van Eyck on Christus' work is most evident in the vertical, narrow format and in the central figure of Saint Michael, who also divides the scene between heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;Upton, 39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iconography ===
Art historian John Ward highlights the rich and complex [[iconography]] and symbolic meaning van Eyck employed to bring attention to what he saw as the co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. In his paintings, iconographical features are typically subtly woven into the work, as "relatively small, in the background, or in the shadow [details]".&lt;ref name="W11"&gt;Ward, 11&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the imagery is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meanings become apparent. According to Ward, the iconographical elements are commonly positioned "initially to overlook, and eventually to discover".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the ''Last Judgement'' panel, Burroughs notes that "each of its several scenes requires attention for itself alone."&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt; According to Ward, van Eyck forces the viewer to search for the meaning in the iconography, creating a multi-layered surface which rewards the attentive viewer with deeper understanding of both the painting and its symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 13, 32&lt;/ref&gt; Much of van Eyck's iconography intends to convey the idea of "the promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inscriptions ===
Both the frames and pictorial areas of the diptych are heavily inscribed with lettering and phrases in Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Especially in his heavily inscribed, now lost, ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]'' (1428). See Pächt, 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"&gt;Lodewijckx, 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning in a manner similar to the commentaries often seen on the margins of medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.&lt;ref name="s146" /&gt;

In this work, the inscriptions are in Roman capitals or Gothic miniature,&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt; and in some places seem to contain misspellings, making interpretation difficult.&lt;ref name="It"&gt;"Italia 1:3.500.000. Cartina scolastica". Rome: Cartine da banco, 1976. 502&lt;/ref&gt; Its gold-lined frame and Latin inscriptions, with their subtle references to various passages in the two panels, indicate that the donor was wealthy and educated.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; The sides of each frame are lined with inscriptions from the [[Book of Isaiah]] ([[s:Bible_(Bishops%27)/Isaiah#Chapter_53|53]]:6–9, 12), [[Book of Revelation|Revelations]] ([[s:Bible_(Wycliffe)/Apocalips#Chapter_20|20]]:13, 21:3–4) or the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] ([[s:Bible_(Wycliffe)/Deuteronomy#Chapter_32|32]]:23–24).&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In the right hand panel, the wings of the figure of death contain Latin inscriptions on either side; on the left are the words &lt;small&gt;''CHAOS MAGNVM''&lt;/small&gt; ("great chaos"), with &lt;small&gt;''UMBRA MORTIS''&lt;/small&gt; ("shadow of death") inscribed to the right.&lt;ref name="w148"&gt;Weale, 148&lt;/ref&gt; A warning from Matthew 25:41 is written on both sides of death's head and wings, and extends from earth down into the hell section. It reads, ''Ite vos maledicti in ignem eternam'' ("Go, ye cursed, into everlasting fire"). In this way, van Eyck dramatically aligns the biblical extract in diagonal dual beams of light seemingly hurled from the heavens.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; Also in the section are letters reading &lt;small&gt;''ME OBVLIVI''.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt;

In the mid-ground, the Archangel Michael's armour is heavily inscribed with esoteric and often difficult to source phrases.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; Letters on his breast plate read &lt;small&gt;''VINAE(X)''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;ref name="ML403ff"/&gt; while his jewel-encrusted oval [[buckler]] displays the cross and is decorated with Greek script reading &lt;small&gt;''ADORAVI TETGRAMMATHON AGLA''&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt; The meaning of this phrase has not been conclusively identified; some art historians believe it contains misspellings and has been misread.&lt;ref name="It" /&gt; Friedländer transcribed the first word as &lt;small&gt;''ADORAVI''&lt;/small&gt; while the final word &lt;small&gt;''AGLA''&lt;/small&gt; is thought be taken from the first four letters of the Hebrew words for "Thou Art Mighty", and thus may signify God; the word also appears in a floor tile in the ''Ghent Altarpiece''.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;&lt;ref name="maxj53" /&gt; In the upper portion, gilded inscriptions running vertically across the edges of Christ's mantle read &lt;small&gt;''VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI''&lt;/small&gt; ("Come, ye blessed of my father").&lt;ref name="w147" /&gt;

== Attribution and dating ==
Over the years the panels have been attributed to  both Jan and [[Hubert van Eyck]] as well as Petrus Christus. In 1841, Passavant attributed the diptych jointly to Hubert and Jan van Eyck;&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; by 1853, he had revised his opinion and gave attribution exclusively to Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Passavant, 123&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Gustav Waagen]], the first director of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]], attributed them to Petrus Christus in the mid 19th-century, based on the left hand panel's similarity in composition to a 1452 ''Last Judgement'' signed by Christus now in Berlin. This view was rejected in 1887, and they once more became associated with Jan. The panels came into the possession of the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage Gallery]] in 1917, credited to Jan.&lt;ref name="w148" /&gt;
   
Bryson Burroughs, writing for the Metropolitan at the time of their acquisition in 1933, attributed the works to Hubert. Burroughs saw in the panels the hand of an expressive artist, "all nerves and sensibilities",&lt;ref name="B188"/&gt; overcome with sympathy for the plight of the central figures in the panels, but who was nonetheless weak in drawing line. This profile, he believed, was incompatible with the aloof and impassive master craftsman Jan is known to have been.&lt;ref name="B188" /&gt; Yet Burroughs acknowledged there was "no certain documented proof for the attribution [to Hubert]." He admitted his evidence was "limited, inevitably incomplete", and thus "circumstantial and presumptive".&lt;ref name="B184"&gt;Burroughs, 184&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholarship tends to agree Jan painted the panels based on the evidence that they are stylistically closer to Jan than Hubert, who died in 1426; and that Jan, who travelled across the [[Alps]] to Italy that year, painted the mountain range.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

[[File:Petrus Christus - The Last Judgement - WGA04844.jpg|210px|thumb|[[Petrus Christus]]'s ''Last Judgement'' (1452) is a much larger, though more sparse and more easily "read", near-copy of van Eyck's panel. Panofsky commented that "what [Christus] thought difficult to understand, he explained; and what he chose to retain,
he rendered in simple, vernacular language."&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al., 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

The paintings have often been compared to the seven pages of the ''[[Turin-Milan Hours]]'' [[illuminated manuscript]] attributed to the unidentified artist "Hand G", generally thought to have been Jan van Eyck.&lt;ref&gt;"The identification of Hand G with Jan van Eyck is considered very likely nowadays." See Ridderbos et al., 244&lt;/ref&gt; The closeness is seen to lie both in the miniaturist technique and the particular painterly style. The similarity of a Turin drawing of the crucified Christ to the figure in the New York diptych has led some art historians to conclude they were, at least, painted near the same time, during the 1420s and early 1430s. Most believe both the drawing and diptych panel at least originated from a prototype designed by Jan van Eyck.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; Panofsky attributed the New York panels to "Hand G".&lt;ref name="A89"&gt;Ainsworth, 89&lt;/ref&gt; When the ''Turin-Milan Hours'' miniatures were discovered they were at first believed to have been painted before the [[John, Duke of Berry|Duke of Berry]]'s death in 1416, an idea that was quickly rejected with the date extended to sometime in the early 1430s.&lt;ref name="Pächt 190"&gt;Pächt, 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Pächt writes of the diptych that it reflects the "personal style and unique scenic imagination" of "Hand G" (whom he believed to be either Hubert or Jan).&lt;ref name="Pächt 190"/&gt; Until [[Hans Belting]] and Dagmar Eichberger's 1983 ''Jan van Eyck als Erzähler'', academics tended to focus exclusively on the diptych's dating and attribution, with little attention paid to its source influences and iconography.&lt;ref name="L9" /&gt; Borchert estimates a completion of c. 1440, while Paul Durrieu suggests a dating as early as 1413.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; In 1983, Belting and Eichberger suggested a date of c. 1430 based on specific characteristics of the work:  the "birds-eye view" perspective and horizon, the densely packed figures and, especially, a pictorial narrative that moves logically across the areas of the image in the ''Crucifixion'' panel.&lt;ref name="l12" /&gt; Belting and Eichberger believe this style was employed during the early panel works, but was largely abandoned by the 1430s.&lt;ref name="v362" /&gt;

The 1430s dating is supported by the style of the [[underdrawing]], which is consistent with known signed works by van Eyck from that time. In addition, the figures are dressed in clothes fashionable in the 1420s with the exception of one of the possible donors, tentatively identified as [[Margaret of Bavaria]], who is depicted as the sybil standing in the right foreground of the crucifixion panel and wears clothes in style in the early 1430s.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt;

The upper portions of the ''Last Judgement'' panel are generally considered as the work of a weaker painter with a less individual style. It is thought that van Eyck left the panels unfinished with completed underdrawings, and the area was finished by workshop members or by followers after he died.&lt;ref name="B86" /&gt; [[Maryan Ainsworth]] of the Metropolitan takes a different view. She highlights the close relationship known to have existed between contemporary workshops in the Low Countries and France, and speculates that a French miniaturist or [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminator]], perhaps from the workshop of the [[Bedford Master]], travelled to Bruges to assist van Eyck on the right hand panel.&lt;ref name="A89" /&gt;&lt;!--note, as stated this really makes light of her claim, need to develop--&gt;

== Provenance ==
Nothing is known of the work's provenance before the 1840s. Given the panels' diminutive size—which is typical of early diptychs&lt;ref name="b192" /&gt;—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across all areas of the panels.&lt;ref name="B86"/&gt;

Writing in 1841 in the journal ''Kunstblatt'',&lt;ref&gt;In [[Johann Friedrich Cotta]]'s supplement to Morgenblatt.&lt;/ref&gt; Passavant gave an account of how the panels were bought at auction from either a Spanish monastery or convent. The Russian diplomat [[Dmitry Tatishchev]] acquired the panels, possibly from a Spanish convent or monastery near Madrid or [[Burgos]], while living in Spain between 1814 and 1821.&lt;ref name="Met" /&gt; Tatishchev left his pictures to [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar Nicholas I]] in 1845, and they came into the possession of the Hermitage Gallery in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="A70"&gt;Ainsworth, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels were included in the [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings]], which included another important van Eyck work, the 1434–1436 ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]''. They were purchased by Charles Henschel of New York art dealer [[M. Knoedler &amp; Company]]&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein, 172&lt;/ref&gt; for $185,000, significantly less than the asking price of $600,000 when the works were offered in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;The decline in price reflected the general pressure on Russian foreign trade at the time; Soviet art prices were suffering, not helped by the impression that the Russians needed cash. See Williams, 227&lt;/ref&gt; The panels were shipped from Saint Petersburg to the Matthiesen Gallery in Berlin before M. Knoedler &amp; Company sold them on to the Metropolitan in New York that year.&lt;ref name="B184" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4420">'''David Petrovich Shterenberg''' ([[Russian language|Russian]] {{lang|ru|Давид Петрович Штеренберг}}; b. {{OldStyleDate|July 26|1881|July 14}} [[Zhytomyr|Zhitomir]], d. May 1, 1948 [[Moscow]]) was a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born [[Russian people|Russian]] [[Painting|painter]] and [[graphic artist]].

==Life==
Born to a [[Jewish]] family in Zhitomir, [[Ukraine]], Shterenberg studied art in [[Odessa]] and then from 1906-1912 based himself in [[Paris]] where he studied with, amongst others, [[Kees van Dongen]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}
He studied at the [[Académie Vitti]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|ref={{harvid|Vitti, ??-??}}
 |title=Vitti, ??-??|publisher=University of Glasgow|work=The Correspondence of James McNeill Whistler
 |url=http://www.whistler.arts.gla.ac.uk/correspondence/people/biog/?bid=Vitti_1&amp;initial=V|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was influenced by the works of [[Paul Cézanne]] and by [[Cubism]]. 

He made return visits to Russia but did not settle there until after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution of 1917]], when he was supported by his acquaintance [[Lunacharsky]], who was the [[People's Commissar]] responsible for culture. He attended the ''Conference of Authors, Artists and Directors'' on cooperation with the Soviet Government at the [[Smolny]] Palace  in [[Petrograd]] (St.Petersburg) with [[Nathan Altman]] and others . In 1917 -1918 he was a Commissar for Artistic Matters. In 1918 he had an exhibition with the group ''Jewish Society for the Furthering of the Arts'' together with Baranoff-Rossine, Altman, and [[Lissitzky]], in Moscow. From 1918 to 1920 he was the Head of the Department of Fine Arts (IZO) of the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (NARKOMPROS). In 1918 he published his programmatic essay ''Tasks of Contemporary Art'' in the News of the Petrograd Council. 

In 1920 Shterenberg was the Director of the [[People%27s_Commissariat_for_Education#Izo-Narkompros|Department of Fine Arts (IZO)]] at the People's Commissariat for Education. In this rile he organised the funding of the [[Moscow]] based [[Institute of Artistic Culture]] (INKhUK). He explained that "We organised the INKhUK as a cell for the determination of scientific hypotheses on matters of art".&lt;ref name="Gough"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gough|first1=Maria|title=The Artist as Producer: Russian Constructivism in Revolution|date=2005|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520226180|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Artist_as_Producer.html?id=KCJHxeNQuGMC|accessdate=10 February 2018|language=en}}{{rp|23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1920 to 1930 Shterenberg taught at the [[VKhUTEMAS]]. He showed at an exhibition of Jewish artists in Moscow in 1922 which also featured [[Marc Chagall]]. In the same year he wrote an essay for the catalogue of the ''First Russian Art Exhibition'' at the Gallery van Diemen, in [[Berlin]]. However his independent style ceased to find favour with the Soviet authorities and gradually his work was withdrawn from public view. After the 1930s he was forced to work in a more 'realistic' style. By his death in 1948 he was virtually forgotten. He is buried in [[Vagankovo Cemetery]] in Moscow.
 
Shterenberg was deeply conscious of his Jewish roots. He wrote to his wife Nadezhda: 'I have an Oriental blood in my veins, blood of my forebears who wrote the '[[Song of Songs]]', - and there's no better song.'&lt;ref&gt;''Lazarev, (2000), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;'

Today his work is on view in public galleries in Moscow ([[Tretyakov Gallery]] and [[Pushkin Museum]]), [[St. Petersburg]] ([[Russian Museum]]) and [[Ekaterinburg]]. Much is still held in private collections in Russia.

== Family ==
Plunket was born at Kilsaran, near [[Castlebellingham]] in County Louth. Her father [[Thomas Plunket, 2nd Baron Plunket]] (1792–1866), was a junior [[Church of Ireland]] clergyman and later became the [[Bishop of Tuam, Killala and Achonry]]. Her mother Louise Jane Foster (married in 1819) was the daughter of [[John William Foster]] of Fanevalley, County Louth, Member of Parliament for [[Dunleer]],&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage 1970, Plunket also Massereene and Ferrard&lt;/ref&gt; and was related to the [[Earl of Clermont]]. Her grandfather was [[William Plunket, 1st Baron Plunket]], [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. Her first and second cousins included three titled members of the Irish aristocracy. Her eldest sister [[Katherine Plunket]] was known as Ireland's oldest person at 111 years and 327 days.&lt;ref name="trivia-library"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trivia-library.com/b/biography-of-centenarian-katherine-plunket.htm |title=Biography of Centenarian Katherine Plunket |publisher=trivia-library.com |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botanical illustration ==
Plunket travelled Europe with her sister [[Katherine Plunket]] and they made many sketches of flowers in France, Italy, Spain and Germany, and Ireland.&lt;ref name="botanic-garden" /&gt; These were bound in a volume, ''Wild Flowers from Nature'', which was presented in 1903 to the [[Royal College of Science for Ireland|Royal College of Science]], and was later transferred to the Museum of Science and Art in the [[National Museum of Ireland]]. In 1970 it was part of the collections which were transferred to the [[Irish National Botanic Gardens]] at [[Glasnevin]].&lt;ref name="botanic-garden" /&gt;

==Mountaineering ==
Plunket wrote a book about her mountaineering and experiences travelling the [[Alps]] in the 1870s. ''Here and there among the Alps'', published 1875. The book was expressly written for women interested in mountaineering and to show them what was possible for the active healthy woman. It was a rejection of the notion that mountaineering was always a dangerous impossible challenge for women, despite a belief that women were somewhat physically inferior. In fact she encouraged women to pass boundaries. The book describes assents of multiple peaks in [[Switzerland]] undertaken in 1874 although the introduction indicates that this is only one of several years of climbing.&lt;ref name="Alps"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/hereandthereamo00plungoog |title=Here and there among the Alps |author= Frederica Louisa E .

Despite her insistence in the introduction to her book that dangers were over emphasised Plunket herself experienced potentially fatal accidents while climbing.&lt;ref name="Colley2016"/&gt;

Although now reported it was [[Lucy Walker (climber)|Lucy Walker]] who first succeeded in reaching the top, Anne Rathdonnell, The 1st [[John McClintock, 1st Baron Rathdonnell|Lady Rathdonnell]] wrote in her diary in 1879, that Plunket was known as the first woman to the top of the Matterhorn:''"I remember meeting several times in Chester Square the Hon.

'''Hermann Vezin''' (March 2, 1829 – June 12, 1910) was an American actor, teacher of [[elocution]] and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Vezin, Hermann|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=1802|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1802}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and educated at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Life and work==

Vezin was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the son of Charles Henri Vezin, a merchant of French heritage, and his wife Emilie (née Kalinsky). His great-great-grandfather Pierre de Vezin was married to the seventeenth-century French actress [[Marie de Rohan|Marie Charlotte de Châteauneuf]]. [[Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle|Rouget de Lisle]], the composer of the French national anthem, "[[La Marseillaise]]," was one of his distant cousins. After studying law for several years, Vezin graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with an A.B. in 1847 and later a master's degree in 1850.

Despite resistance from his family, Vezin was determined to work as an actor and departed America for the UK shortly after graduation. He made his first appearance at the [[York Theatre Royal]] in St. Leonard's Place, York, England. After playing minor roles in several provincial engagements, he began performing leading characters as Cardinal Richelieu, Sir Edward Mortimer, Claude Melnotte, and Young Norval. He made his London début in 1852 at the [[Princess's Theatre, London|Princess's Theatre]].  On February 21, 1863, at St Peter's Church, Eaton Square, he married the former child actress, English-born Jane Elizabeth Thompson who, appearing as an adult under the name Mrs. Charles Young, had made a reputation as an actress both in Australia and in England. They appeared in many plays with together until her death in 1902. Together they had a son, the silent film actor, Arthur Vezin.
[[Image:Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith - Illustrated London News, November 18, 1876.png|left|thumb|Vezin in the title role of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876)]]
Apart from a brief professional tour of the United States in 1857–58, the majority of Vezin's acting career took place on the English stage.  Though primarily an actor, in 1866 he collaborated with the playwrights [[W. G. Wills]] and [[James Albery]] to write the vaudeville inspired play ''Doctor Davey'' based on the 1842 play ''Le Docteur Robin'' by French writer [[Jules-Martial Regnault de Prémaray|Jules de Prémaray]] in which he also played the title role. The following year he starred as a troubled Scottish poet James Harebell in Wills' ''Man o' Airlie'' (1867) to overwhelmingly positive reviews. Vezin followed up with other successful showings, such as ''The Turn of the Tide'' by [[F. C. Burnand]] (1869), ''Son of the Soil'' (1872); ''As You Like It'' (1875); and [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'', which ran for one hundred and nineteen performances at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] (1876, also a revival in 1884);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} pp. 141–2&lt;/ref&gt; He acted with [[Charles Fechter]], [[Samuel Phelps]], [[Henry Irving]], and in 1878 played Dr. Primrose alongside actress [[Ellen Terry]] in Wills' ''Olivia, Vicar of Wakefield'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;*{{Citation

Sir J. Forbes-Robertson described Vezin in the ''London Post'' as a "bright and dapper little man, who was both "learned and dictatorial on the art of acting." The [[Illustrated London News]] review of Vezin in the title role of ''Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith'' noted that "Mr. Vezin is probably the most intellectual of our actors, and is the very man for creating an original part, such as that of Dan'l Druce" and described one scene as "an acting hit by Mr. Hermann Vezin which literally electrified the house."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', September 16, 1876, p. 275, col. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s favourite actors.&lt;ref name=Stedman86&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; and, besides the aforementioned ''Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith'', he also starred in Gilbert's ''[[Randall's Thumb]]'', (1871),&lt;ref name=Stedman86 /&gt; and played Mousta in an 1882 revival of ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' alongside Gilbert himself as Florian (due to an accident incapacitating Kyrle Bellew).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert, A Classic Victorian &amp; His Theatre|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-816174-3}} pp. 190–91&lt;/ref&gt;

A benefit matinee was held for Vezin at the Haymarket Theatre on March 19, 1896.  For this, [[George Grossmith]] gave a sketch, and play scenes featured [[Gerald du Maurier]], [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] and [[Cyril Maude]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, Simon.  [http://www.c20th.com/GSarchiveother.htm Programme and description of 1896 benefit,] ''Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, a selling exhibition of memorabilia, Archive: Other items''&lt;/ref&gt;  Vezin continued to act, appearing in ''The Happy Life'' in 1897&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B02EED81630E132A25756C0A9649D94669ED7CF "'The Happy Life,' by Louis N.

In his declining years, Vezin appear infrequently on the stage, rather spending most of his time giving lessons to aspiring thespians, including the actors [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], [[Baliol Holloway]] and [[Frank Benson (actor)|Frank Benson]] as well as the actress [[Mary Mannering]]. He also dedicated himself to appearances at recitals and play readings. His last stage role was Old Rowley in Tree's production of playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan's]] [[The School for Scandal]] at [[His Majesty's Theatre, Aberdeen|His Majesty's Theatre]] in Scotland, in April 1909. He had been active on the British stage for nearly sixty years, and had been a resident of London, where he died at his home, 10 Lancaster Place, Strand, on June 12, 1910. His body was cremated at Golders Green and his ashes were scattered.

'''[[Immortality]]''' is a popular subject '''in [[fiction]]''', as it explores humanity's deep-seated fears and comprehension of its own [[Death|mortality]]. Immortal beings and [[species]] abound in fiction, especially [[fantasy]] fiction, and the meaning of "immortal" tends to vary.

Some fictional beings are completely immortal (or very nearly so) in that they are immune to death by injury, disease and age. Sometimes such powerful immortals can only be killed by each other, as is the case with the [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' series. Even if something can't be killed, a common plot device involves putting an immortal being into a slumber or limbo, as is done with [[Morgoth]] in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'' and the Dreaming God of ''[[Pathways Into Darkness]]''. Storytellers often make it a point to give weaknesses to even the most indestructible of beings. For instance, [[Superman]] is supposed to be invulnerable, yet his enemies were able to exploit his now-infamous weakness: [[Kryptonite]]. (See also [[Achilles' heel]].)

Many fictitious species are said to be immortal if they cannot die of old age, even though they can be killed through other means, such as injury. Modern fantasy [[elf|elves]] often exhibit this form of immortality. Other creatures, such as [[vampire]]s and the immortals in the film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'', can only die from [[beheading]]. The classic and stereotypical vampire is typically slain by one of several very specific means, including a [[silver bullet]] (or piercing with other silver weapons), a stake through the heart (perhaps made of consecrated wood), or by exposing them to sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gods-and-monsters.com/how-to-kill-a-vampire.html|title=How To Kill a Vampire - The Only 5 Methods Known To Man|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://vampires.monstrous.com/killing_a_vampire.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythical creatures==
Mythological beings are often used in modern fiction as characters, as a plot device, or even just as "window dressing". Such beings are often either immortal or associated with immortality.

[[Tezuka Osamu]]'s lifework ''[[Phoenix (manga)|Phoenix]]'' (known in [[Japan]] as ''Hi no Tori'') had a [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] whose blood would provide immortality. In various ages, many "heroes" and "heroines" would strive for immortality only to realize that there is something beyond eternal life. In one story titled "Rose Ham" (lit. "Next World Story") the last remaining human male who survived a holocaust, blessed (or cursed) with immortality through the phoenix blood, would create another beginning of life. In his immortal form, he would see a race of slugs, after gaining intelligence, destroy themselves in another holocaust. He would seed the earth with life that would become present day humans, and finally leave the earth to join his lover, who died billions of years ago, in [[heaven]].

In the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] created by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], there is a race of "Fish-Men" known as [[Deep Ones]]. They stop aging after reaching adulthood and can breed with humans to birth offspring with this "eternal youth." This is a [[faustian]] bargain, as after reaching the age of 20, the Deep One Hybrids undergo a transformation from normal humans into Deep Ones. They also lose all concept of humanity and [[morality]] and go to live in the ocean with the Deep Ones and to worship the undersea deity [[Father Dagon]], the Ruler of the Deep Ones and consort to Mother Hydra.

==Negative effects==
Since immortality is seen as a desire of humanity, themes involving immortality often explore the disadvantages as well as the advantages of such a trait. Sometimes immortality is used as a punishment, or a [[curse]] that might be intended to teach a lesson. It is not uncommon to find immortal characters yearning for death. 

In some parts of popular culture, immortality is not all that it is made out to be, possibly causing [[insanity]] and/or significant emotional pain. Much of the time, these things only happen to mortals who gain immortality. Beings born with immortality (such as [[deity|deities]], [[demigod]]s and races with "limited immortality") are usually quite adjusted to their long lives, though some may feel sorrow at the passing of mortal friends, but they still continue on. Some immortals may also watch over mortal relations (either related to or descended from them), occasionally offering help when needed.

In legend, most famously in [[Wagner's]] opera ''[[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|The Flying Dutchman]]'', a ship's captain is cursed with immortality after attempting to sail around the Cape of Good Hope in a terrible storm. He is doomed to sail around the Cape forever.

In [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', [[struldbrug|some of the inhabitants]] of the island of Immortals (near Japan) don't die, but they age and become ill, demented, and a nuisance to themselves and those surrounding them. Swift presents immortality as a curse rather than a blessing. 

In general, a theme seen with many variations, is the notion of an essential world weariness akin to extreme exhaustion for which death is the only relief. This is inescapable when immortality is defined as (half) infinite life. Immortality defined as finite but arbitrarily long per the desire to exist does not, as a definition, suffer this limitation. When a person is tired of life, even death is shut off to them, creating an endless torture.

==Undeath==
The [[undead]] are fictional people who have died and still maintain some aspects of life. In many examples, the undead are immune to aging or even heal at an accelerated rate. [[Dracula]] is one of the most famous examples of the undead.

==Science fiction==
Immortality can be achieved in fiction through scientifically plausible means. [[Extraterrestrial life]] might be immortal or it might be able to give immortality to humans. Immortality is also achieved in many examples by replacing the mortal human body by machines.

==Regeneration==
{{further|Healing factor}}
There are many examples of immortality in fiction where a character is vulnerable to death and injury in the normal way but possesses an extraordinary capacity for recovery.

The long-running British science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' focuses on a character called  [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], a member of the alien [[Time Lord]] race, who can "[[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerate]]" instead of dying or aging; however, rather than simply healing wounds, this results in his entire physical appearance changing when he is fatally wounded or terminally sick, and he is only capable of doing so twelve times before finally dying for good.

==Spiritual==
There are numerous works of fantasy fiction dealing with spiritual immortality in the form of reincarnation or a world of the dead. 

==Fictional immortals==
&lt;!--  Note the lead above; please do not include gods, angels, demons, spirits, ghosts, robots, etc.  Consider using the lists below instead.--&gt;
The list is in chronological order for the first appearance of the fictitious character.
* The [[Wandering Jew]] appears in a series of legends, starting in the 13th century, about a Jewish man who is made immortal in the time of Jesus, and cursed to wander the Earth until the second coming.
* 1706-1710. In [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the title character encounters the human [[struldbrugg]]s on the island of Luggnagg. They are immortal, but continue to age, and are considered legally dead when they turn 80.
* Ashabero, the 2000 year old titular character of [[José Gómez de Arteche]]'s 1875 novel ''[[A Spanish soldier twenty centuries old]]''. Ahsabero is an iberian who has been a soldier since he was born around 50 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books/about/Un_soldado_espa%C3%B1ol_de_veinte_siglos.html?id=GJpAAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Un soldado español de veinte siglos|publisher=Administración de la Revista científico-militar|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ayesha, the 2000-year old titular character of [[H. Rider Haggard]]'s 1886 novel ''[[She: A History of Adventure]]''.
* Dorian Gray, who stays young while his painted portrait ages terribly in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s 1890 novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''.
* Valdar, the hero of ''Valdar the Oft-Born: A Saga of Seven Ages'' (1895) by [[George Griffith]] is immortal by repeated reincarnation.
* Emilia Marty in the 1922 play ''[[The Makropulos Affair]]'', later adapted into [[The Makropulos Affair (opera)|an opera]] by [[Leoš Janáček]], is a 300 year old opera singer on whom a potion of immortal life had been tested when she was a child.
* Anton York (Conquest of Life, ''[[Wonder Stories|Thrilling Wonder Stories]]'' August 1937 by [[Eando Binder]]) Anton York was injected with a chemical formula that would halt his aging until the universe was double its current age. At that point he could presumably produce and drink a second dose, if he so desired. A series of Anton York stories were written which were later collected in the [[anthology]] Anton York, Immortal in 1965.
* Shining Hawk, (''[[The Gnarly Man]]'' June 1939 by [[L. Sprague de Camp]]) A Neanderthal Man over 50,000 years old who is living as a circus artist.
* Robert Hedrock, ''[[The Weapon Shops of Isher]]'' 1941 and ''[[The Weapon Makers]]'' 1943 by [[A. E. van Vogt]]. A man accidentally becomes immortal, and secretly runs an organization that provides exclusively self-defensive weapons to people and runs a parallel justice system.
* Woodrow Wilson Smith, also known as [[Lazarus Long]], ''[[Methuselah's Children]]'' 1941 by [[Robert A. Heinlein]].  A fairly early 'Howard', Smith becomes the Senior of the Howard families, who are named for Ira Howard (founder of a project to extend the human lifespan).  He is mentioned in four other Heinlein novels, most notably [[Time Enough for Love]].
* [[Vandal Savage]] ([[Green Lantern]] vol. 1 #10, Winter 1943) Caveman Vandar Adg was bathed in the radiation of a mysterious meteorite, granting him intellect and immortality. In subsequent years, he claims to have been or advised dozens of world leaders.
* Raimon Fosca, the cursed subject of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s 1946 novel ''[[All Men Are Mortal]]''.
* [[Nero (comic book character)|Nero]] (1947). The main protagonist of [[The Adventures of Nero]] is a regular man. In "De Bronnen van Sing Song Li" ("The Sources of Sing Song Li") (1951) he drinks an elixir which gives him eternal life. In "De Wallabieten" (1968) he drinks a pill which makes people 1.000 year old and in "De Nerobloemen" ("The Nero Flowers") (1978) he drinks another elixir that gives him eternal life. A wizard in "Zongo in de Kongo" ("Zongo in the Kongo") (1970) gives him immortality as well. 
* Gilbert Nash, the hero of [[Wilson Tucker]]'s ''The Time Masters'' (1953, revised 1971) is the present-day name of an immortal alien who has been stranded on Earth for several thousand years - prior aliases include Gilgamesh.
*[[Jadis, the White Witch]] ([[The Magician's Nephew]], [[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]) is an inhabitant of Charn, but is brought in to Narnia. She has survived the destruction of Charn by putting herself in eternal sleep, but then eats a silver apple from the Western Wild, and becomes immortal, but is later killed by Aslan. 
* [[Immortal Man]] ([[Strange Adventures]] #177, June 1965) Gaining immortality from the same meteorite that granted longevity to Vandal Savage, the Immortal Man instantaneously reincarnates when he dies.
* Conrad Nomikos ([[…And Call Me Conrad]], 1966 by [[Roger Zelazny]]. Later expanded to the novel ''This Immortal'').
* [[Ra's al Ghul]] (''[[Batman|Batman #232]]'', 1971) Ra's maintained an unnaturally long life through the use of natural phenomena known as [[Lazarus Pit]]s. Other characters given some measure of immortality by the Lazarus Pit include al Ghul's father [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]], his daughters [[Talia al Ghul]] and [[Nyssa Raatko]], and his agent [[Whisper A'Daire]].
*[[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] (1967), in the British [[Supermarionation]] science fiction television series ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]],'' was turned nearly immortal (the actual term is "virtually indestructible;" the process which makes him so is called "retro-metabolism") after undergoing Mysteronization, from which he either escaped or was released. Captain Black, also in this series, is presumably another Mysteronized immortal; however, he remains under Mysteron control.
*[[Gilgamesh the immortal]] (1969), from the Argentine comic of the same name, was an ancient king turned immortal by advanced technology.
* [[Casca Longinus]] (''[[Casca (series)|Casca: The Eternal Mercenary]],'' 1979) Casca is the Roman soldier who plunges his spear into the side of Jesus on the cross at Golgotha and is cursed to wander the world forever until the two should meet again.
* [[Nathan Young]] (''[[Misfits (TV series)|Misfits]]'') Nathan is given community service where he is caught up in a storm which gave him the power of immortality.

===Lists of immortals===
As noted above, specific characters who as a class tend to be immortal such as [[vampires]] and [[robots]] are not listed individually.  Lists of classes who as a group tend to be possibly immortal include:

* [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves in Middle-earth]], such as [[Elrond|Elrond Half-elven]]. (''[[The Hobbit]]'', 1937, and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''.) Elves are immortal, and [[half-elves]] can choose mortality or [[immortality]].

'''King Mob''' was an [[England|English]] radical group based in [[London]] during the late 1960s/early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/articles/mob-who-shouldnt-really-be-here&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a cultural mutation of the [[Situationist International|Situationists]] and the anarchist group [[UAW/MF]]. It sought to emphasise the cultural anarchy and disorder being ignored in [[UK|Britain]], with the ultimate aim of promoting [[proletarian]] revolution. It derived its name from [[Christopher Hibbert]]'s 1958 book on the [[Gordon Riots]] of June 1780, in which rioters daubed the [[slogan]] "His Majesty King Mob" on the walls of [[Newgate Prison]], after gutting the building.

==Actions==
King Mob appreciated pop culture and distributed its ideas and [[politics|political]] ideas through various posters and through its publication ''King Mob Echo'', which provoked reaction by celebrating killers like [[Jack the Ripper]], [[Mary Bell]] and [[John Christie (murderer)|John Christie]]. One flyer in particular celebrated [[Valerie Solanas]]' 1968 shooting of [[Andy Warhol]] and included a hit-list of [[Yoko Ono]], [[Mick Jagger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Mario Amaya]] (who was also shot by Solanas), [[David Hockney]], [[Mary Quant]], [[Twiggy]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and the ''[[International Times|IT]]'' editor [[Barry Miles]].

The King Mob group allegedly planned a series of audacious actions, including blowing up a waterfall in the [[Lake District]], painting the poet [[Wordsworth]]'s house with the words "[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]] Lives", and hanging peacocks in [[Holland Park]],  London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Sam|date=2013-03-01|title=The Peculiar Romanticism of the English Situationists|url=http://camqtly.oxfordjournals.org/content/42/1/20|journal=The Cambridge Quarterly|language=en|volume=42|issue=1|pages=20–37|doi=10.1093/camqtly/bft010|issn=0008-199X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of the aforementioned plans were executed. An action that was carried out, inspired by the New York-based [[Black Mask (anarchists)|Black Mask]]'s "mill-in at [[Macy's]]", involved King Mob appearing at the [[Selfridges]] store in London, with one member, dressed as [[Father Christmas]], attempting to distribute all of the store's toys to children. Police subsequently forced the children to return the toys. This action involved [[Malcolm McLaren]] who reputedly applied the group's situationist ideas in the promotion of the [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stewarthomesociety.org/ass/punk.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

King Mob was also responsible for attacks on art galleries and for organising a battle between local [[skinhead]]s (whom they considered to be "the working class avant-garde") and [[Greaser (subculture)|greasers]] in central London.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Graffiti==
Graffiti attributed to King Mob was observed in many places particularly in the [[Notting Hill]] area, including, "''I don't believe in nothing - I feel like they ought to burn down the world - just let it burn down baby.''"

The most celebrated graffiti attributed to King Mob was the slogan which was painted along a half-mile section of the wall beside the tube (railway) commuter route into London between [[Ladbroke Grove tube station|Ladbroke Grove]] and [[Westbourne Park tube station]]s in west London:

:"''Same thing day after day- tube - work - dinner - work - tube - armchair - TV - sleep - tube - work - how much more can you take? - one in ten go mad, one in five cracks up.''"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revoltagainstplenty.com/index.php/archive-local/128-a-hidden-history-of-king-mob-posterscartoons.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==
The "Mask of King Mob" can be seen in the background of the comic book ''[[Watchmen]]'', written by [[Alan Moore]]. It is in what appears to be a trophy room of the Minutemen, noticeable during the infamous scene where The Comedian tries to rape the original Silk Specter.

A protagonist in the comic book series ''[[The Invisibles]]'' (authored by [[Grant Morrison]]) is codenamed "[[King Mob (comics)|King Mob]]". The Invisibles is organized anti-hierarchically, and is dedicated to defeating a global conspiracy which deceives and preys upon the world's population. The character "King Mob" describes himself as an anarchist.

Graffiti referencing King Mob appears in season 2 episode 7 of Stranger Things.

'''''La Bella Principessa''''' (English: "The Beautiful Princess"), also known as Portrait of Bianca Sforza, '''''Young Girl in Profile in Renaissance Dress''''' and '''''Portrait of a Young Fiancée''''', is a portrait in coloured chalks and ink, on [[vellum]], of a young lady in fashionable costume and hairstyle of a [[Milan]]ese of the 1490s.&lt;ref name=MK/&gt; Sold for just under [[U.S. Dollars|$]]22,000 at [[auction]] on January 30, 1998 at Christie's Auction in New York City, the portrait was catalogued as early 19th-century German work. In 2007, Peter Silverman, purchased the portrait from a gallery on East 73rd Street, owned by Kate Ganz. Peter Silverman believed that the portrait was possibly from an older period, potentially dating back to the Renaissance period, and some experts have since attributed it to [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. In 2010 one of those experts, [[Martin Kemp (art historian)|Martin Kemp]], made it the subject of his book ''La Bella Principessa: The Story of the New Masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci''.&lt;ref name=study/&gt; According to Pascal Cotte and Martin Kemp, the sheet could have been cut from a Milanese book of which the remainder has long been in [[Warsaw]], which comes from the ''milieu'' of [[Ludovico Sforza]], Leonardo's employer.&lt;ref name="Lumiere"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lumiere-technology.com/discoveries2.html |title=New Leonardo da Vinci Bella Principessa confirmed |publisher=Lumiere-technology.com |date=28 September 2011 |accessdate=2013-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution to Leonardo da Vinci has been disputed.&lt;ref name="G1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/07/12/100712fa_fact_grann?currentPage=all |title=The Mark of a Masterpiece|last=Grann|first=David|authorlink=David Grann|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|volume=LXXXVI|issue= 20|date= July 12–19, 2010|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the ''New Yorker'' published an article about Paul Biro and revealed he had attempted and succeeded to authenticate many fakes knowingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/07/12/the-mark-of-a-masterpiece|title=The Prints in the Paint|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was condemned but "authenticated" ''La Bella Princessa'' and was endorsed by Martin Kemp and Pascal Cotte.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://boowiki.info/art/les-historiens-d-art-britanniques/martin-kemp-historien-d-art.html|title=Martin Kemp (historien d'art)|website=boowiki.info|language=fr|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises the issue of Kemp's credibility and, at least, can lead one to infer that this is not a Leonardo. Some of those who disagree with the attribution to Leonardo believe the portrait is by an early 19th-century German artist imitating the style of the [[Italian Renaissance]], although recent [[radiocarbon dating]] tests show a much earlier date for the vellum. The white lead has been dated to be at least 225 years old. The current owner is Peter Silverman, and the last disclosed offer for the portrait was [[U.S. Dollars|$]]80 million, which was declined by Silverman. The ''Bella Principessa'' remains locked in a vault in a secret Swiss location.&lt;ref name="NOVA Episode"&gt;{{cite AV media | people = | date = January 25, 2012 | title = Mystery of a Masterpiece | medium = Television production | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/mystery-masterpiece.html | access-date = July 15, 2018 | publisher = PBS/WGBH |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the drawing is originally a Leonardo illustration for the present-day Warsaw copy of the ''Sforziad'', its history is the same as that of the book until the drawing was cut out from the volume.&lt;ref&gt;See Katarzyna Wozniak, The Warsaw Sforziad http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/leonardo/#MM&lt;/ref&gt; The book is known to have been rebound at the turn of the 18 and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Katarzyna Wozniak, The Warsaw Sforziad http://www.bbk.ac.uk/hosted/leonardo/#MM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katarzyna Woźniak, La Bella Principessa and the Warsaw Sforziad.

Reflecting the subject of an Italian woman of high nobility, Kemp named the portrait ''La Bella Principessa'', although Sforza ladies were not [[princess]]es.&lt;ref name= MK/&gt;

The first study of the drawing was published by Cristina Geddo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Geddo|first= Cristina|title=Il pastello ritrovato: un nuovo ritratto di Leonardo?|journal= Artes|volume= 14|year= 2008–2009|pages= 63–87|url=http://www.lumiere-technology.com/Artes14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geddo attributes this work to Leonardo based not only on stylistic considerations, extremely high quality and left-handed [[hatching]], but also on the evidence of the combination of black, white and red chalks (the ''[[trois crayons]]'' technique). Leonardo was the first artist in Italy to use pastels, a drawing technique he had learned from the French artist [[Jean Perréal]], whom he met in Milan at the end of the fifteenth century. Leonardo acknowledges his debt to Perréal in the [[Codex Atlanticus]]. Geddo also points out that the "coazzone" of the sitter's hairstyle was fashionable during the same period. Strong support for the attribution has come from Elizabetta Gnignera, the costume historian, in her book ''La Bella Svelata'', which studies a wide range of comparative costumes and hair styles. 

===Expert opinions===

===Analysis===
In 2010, after a two-year study of the picture, Kemp published his findings and conclusions in a book, ''La Bella Principessa: The Story of the New Masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci''.&lt;ref name= MK/&gt; Kemp describes the work as "a portrait of a young lady on the cusp of maturity [which] shows her with the fashionable costume and hairstyle of a Milanese court lady in the 1490s". By process of elimination involving the inner group of young [[House of Sforza|Sforza]] women, Kemp suggested that she is probably Bianca Sforza, the illegitimate (but later legitimized) daughter of [[Ludovico Sforza]] ("Il Moro"), duke of Milan. In 1496, when Bianca was no more than 13, she was married to Galeazzo Sanseverino, captain of the duke's Milanese forces and a patron of Leonardo. Bianca was dead within months of her marriage, having suffered from a stomach complaint (possibly an [[ectopic pregnancy]]). Kemp pointed out that Milanese ladies were often the dedicatees of volumes of poetry on [[vellum]], and that such a portrait of a "beloved lady" would have made a suitable [[title page]] or main illustration for a set of verses produced on the occasion of her marriage or death.&lt;ref name=MK&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kemp | first1 = Martin |last2=Cotte| first2= Pascal| title = La Bella Principessa: The Story of the New Masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci | publisher = [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | location = London | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-1-4447-0626-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical and scientific evidence from multispectral analysis and study of the painting, as described by Kemp,&lt;ref name= MK/&gt; may be summarized as follows:
* The technique of the portrait is black, red and white chalks (''[[trois crayons]]'', a French medium), with pen and ink.
* The drawing and [[hatching]] was carried out entirely by a left-handed artist, as Leonardo is known to have been, although restorations are by a right-hander.
* There are significant [[Pentimento|pentimenti]] throughout.
* The portrait is characterized by particularly subtle details, such as the [[relief]] of the ear hinted at below the hair, and the amber of the sitter's iris.
* There are strong stylistic parallels with the [[Print Room, Windsor|Windsor]] [[silverpoint]] drawing of ''A Woman in Profile'', which, like other head studies by Leonardo, features comparable delicate pentimenti to the profile.
* The members of the Sforza family were always portrayed in profile, whereas Ludovico's mistresses were not.
* The proportions of the head and face reflect the rules that Leonardo articulated in his notebooks.
* The [[Interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] or knotwork ornament in the costume and [[Caul (headgear)|caul]] corresponds to patterns that Leonardo explored in other works and in the logo designs for his ''Academy''. 
* The portrait was executed on vellum—used by him in his illustrations for Luca Pacioli's De divina proportione (1498). We know from his writings that he was interested in the French technique of dry colouring on parchment (vellum). He specifically noted that he should ask the French artist, Jean Perréal, who was in Milan in 1494 and perhaps on other occasions, about the method of colouring in dry chalks.
* The format of the vellum support is that of a {{radic|2}} rectangle, a format used for several of his portraits.
* The vellum sheet was cut from a [[codex]], probably a volume of poetry of the kind presented to mark major events in the Sforza women's lives.
* The vellum bears a fingerprint near the upper left edge, which features a distinctive "island" ridge and closely matches a fingerprint in the unfinished ''St Jerome'' by Leonardo. It also includes a palmprint in the chalk pigment on the neck of the sitter, which is characteristic of Leonardo's technique.
* The green of the sitter's costume was obtained with a simple diffusion of black chalk applied on top of the yellowish tone of the vellum support. (Kemp has subsequently expressed reservations about this evidence.)
* The nuances of the flesh tints were also achieved by exploiting the tone of the vellum and allowing it to show through the transparent media.
* There are noteworthy similarities between this work and the portrait of [[Cecilia Gallerani]], including the handling of the eyes, the modelling of flesh tones using the palm of the hand, the intricacy of the patterns of the knotwork ornament and the treatment of the contours.
* The now somewhat pale original hatching in pen and ink was retouched in ink in a later restoration, which is far less fluid, precise and rhythmic.
* There have been some re-touchings over the years, most extensively in the costume and headdress, but the restoration has not affected the expression and physiognomy of the face to a significant degree, and has not seriously affected the overall impact of the portrait.&lt;ref name= MK/&gt;

===Warsaw copy of the ''Sforziada''===
In 2011, Kemp and Pascal Cotte reported that there was evidence that the drawing had once been part of a copy in the [[National Library of Poland]] in [[Warsaw]] of the ''Sforziada''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://polona.pl/item/1520897/0/] to "turn-the pages" for the Warsaw copy of the ''Sforziada''&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a printed book with hand-illuminated additions containing a long propagandistic poem in praise of the father of Ludovico Sforza, who was Leonardo's patron, recounting the career. The Warsaw copy, printed on vellum with added illumination, was given to Galeazzo Sanseverino, a military commander under Ludovico Sforza, on his marriage to Bianca Sforza in 1496.&lt;ref name=Lumiere /&gt; Kemp and Cotte identified where two sheets were missing from this volume from which they believe the drawing was cut. Kemp and Cotte say that, although "the dimensions and precise locations of the holes in the portrait cannot be obtained with precision", the three holes on the left-hand side of the drawing can be aligned with three of the five stitch holes in the sheets in the book.&lt;ref name=study/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kemp and Cotte believe the difference in the number of holes is due either to the irregular way in which the margin of the page with the drawing has been cut, or to the addition of two intermediate stitches when the book was rebound.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambach"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://artwatch.org.uk/tag/carmen-bambach/|title= Carmen Bambach, Artwatch|website=artwatch.org.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association with the ''Sforziada'' suggests that the drawing is a portrait of Bianca Sforza, who was the daughter of Ludovico Sforza and his mistress Bernardina de Corradis. At the time of the portrait, she was around thirteen years old. Leonardo painted three other portraits associated with the family or court of Ludovico Sforza.

The Polish scholar Bogdan Horodyski in 1954-1956 reached the conclusion that the Warsaw illumination refers to both the deceased dukes Galeazzo Maria and Gian Galeazzo and to the dynastic downfall after the usurpation of Ludovico il Moro.  The reproduction of the unpublished heraldic figure attributed to Antonio Grifo, illuminated in the incunabulum "Comedia" by Dante (Cremonese, Venice 1491), now at Casa di Dante in Rome, shows the original coat of arms and insignia of the family of Galeazzo Sanseverino, and the comparison with those illuminated by Birago is not corresponding. Developing this hypothesis, Carla Glori suggests that Caterina Sforza, the daughter of Galeazzo Maria and half-sister of Gian Galeazzo, was the owner of the Warsaw Sforziad and that she gave it to the family of her deceased half-brother between 1496-1499.&lt;ref&gt;Glori, Carla, [https://www.academia.edu/17531825/The_Illumination_by_Birago_in_the_Sforziad_incunabulum_in_Warsaw_in_defence_of_Horodyski_s_thesis_and_a_new_hypothesis “The Illumination by Birago in the Sforziad incunabulum in Warsaw: in defense of Horodyski's thesis and a new hypothesis”], Academia.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition for Leonardo Attribution==

The ''New Yorker'' article discussed the troubling circumstances in which Kemp attributed this work to Leonardo. But apart from this, strong indications are going against the hypothesis of authenticity, and the attribution to Leonardo has been challenged by a number of scholars who showed interest.&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=E1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="D1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dorment|first= Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/7582591/La-Bella-Principessa-a-100m-Leonardo-or-a-copy.html |title=''La Bella Principessa'': a £100m Leonardo, or a copy?|journal=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the reasons for doubting its authorship are the lack of [[provenance]] prior to the 20th century – unusual given Leonardo's renown dating from his own lifetime, as well as the fame of the purported subject's family&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt; – and the fact that it was on vellum. Only once did Leonardo use vellum and old sheets of it are easily acquired by forgers.&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt; Leonardo scholar Pietro C. Marani discounts the significance of the drawing being made by a left-handed artist, noting that imitators of Leonardo's work have emulated this characteristic in the past.&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt; Marani is also troubled by use of vellum, "monotonous" detail, use of colored pigments in specific areas, firmness of touch and lack of [[craquelure]].&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt; A museum director who wished to remain anonymous believes the drawing is "a screaming 20th-century fake", and finds the damages and repair to the drawing suspicious.&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt; The work was not requested for inclusion in the 2011–12 exhibition at the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in London, which specifically covered Leonardo's period in Milan; [[Nicholas Penny]], director of the [[National Gallery]], said simply "We have not asked to borrow it."&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt;

Carlo Pedretti, who is one of the scholars who attribute this work to Leonardo, has had before make a mistake attributing a painting from the twentieth century to the Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/english/news/lifestyle/arts/2018/01/05/leonardo-expert-pedretti-dies-2_28ae950b-7e37-4bd3-87e4-3b1353f94e2a.html|title=Leonardo expert Pedretti dies (2) - Lifestyle|date=2018-01-05|work=ANSA.it|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Leonardo never represented eyelashes, in his paintings as well as in his drawings.

[[:de:Klaus Albrecht Schröder|Klaus Albrecht Schröder]], director of the [[Albertina, Vienna]], said "No one is convinced it is a Leonardo," and David Ekserdjian, a scholar of 16th-century Italian drawings, wrote that he suspects the work is a "counterfeit".&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt; Neither Carmen Bambach of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], one of the primary scholars of Leonardo's drawings, nor Everett Fahy, her colleague at the Metropolitan, accepts the attribution to Leonardo.&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bambach" /&gt;

Several forensic experts on fingerprints have discounted Biro's conclusions, finding the partial fingerprint taken from the drawing too poorly detailed to offer conclusive evidence.&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt; Biro's description of the print as being "highly comparable" to a known fingerprint of Leonardo's has similarly been discounted by fingerprint examiners as being too vague an assessment to establish authorship.&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt; When asked if he may have been mistaken to suggest that the fingerprint was Leonardo's, Biro answered "It's possible. Yes."&lt;ref name=G1 /&gt;

Noting the lack of mention of dissenting opinion in Kemp's publication, Richard Dorment wrote in the ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Telegraph]]'': "Although purporting to be a work of scholarship, his book has none of the balanced analysis you would expect from such an acclaimed historian. For ''La Bella Principessa'', as he called the girl in the study, is not art history – it is advocacy."&lt;ref name=D1 /&gt;

Kline, an independent art historian and author of ''Leonardo's Holy Child--The Discovery of a Leonardo da Vinci Masterpiece: A Connoisseur's Search for Lost Art in America'', is known for his discovery of “Leonardo's model drawing” of Infant Jesus (which has yet to be examined by, or accepted or rejected, by Leonardo scholars) and for a number of important discoveries of [[Lost artworks|lost art]] by the [[Nazarene Brotherhood]],&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;{{cite news|last=Geary|first= David|title=An Art Explorer Finds the Real Creator of Works|journal=New York Times|date= April 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group of German painters working in Rome during the early 19th century who revived the styles and subjects of the Italian Renaissance.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"/&gt; Kline has proposed one of the Nazarenes, [[Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld]] (1794–1872), as the creator of the drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sharpe|first= Tom. |title=Case Closed on da Vinci Mystery?|journal=The Santa Fe New Mexican|date= September 25, 2010|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/case-closed-on-da-vinci-art-mystery/article_4c31857b-ee41-518b-b60d-044786f9ecd9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evidence, Kline points to a drawing on vellum by Schnorr, ''Half-nude Female'', in the collection of the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]] in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Schnorr von Carolsfeld, Julius-aa Weiblicher Halbakt-a-VELLUM-1 Mannheim.JPG|image of the Mannheim drawing]]&lt;/ref&gt; which he suggests depicts the same model, although older, as portrayed in ''La Bella Principessa.''
 
Comparative material-testing of the vellum supports of the Mannheim Schnorr and ''La Bella Principessa'' were anticipated to occur in the New York federal court lawsuit ''Marchig v. Christie's'', brought in May 2010 by the original owner of ''La Bella Principessa'', who accused Christie's of [[breach of fiduciary duty]], [[negligent misrepresentation]] and other claims. However, the court dismissed the suit on the ground that the claims were brought years too late ([[Statute of Limitations]] and [[Laches (equity)|Laches]]), and thus the merits of the suit were never addressed. The district court decision was upheld on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://casetext.com/case/marchig-v-christies-inc-2 ''Marchig v. Christie's Inc.''], 762 F. Supp. 2d 667 (S.D.N.Y.), ''aff'd in relevant part'', 2011 WL 2685608 (2d Cir. Summary Order July 12, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements with the attribution to Leonardo were made before the discovery of the missing page in the Warsaw Sforziada book. No alternative attribution has been accepted by Kemp or his research group. Kline claims that no comparative scientific analysis has been made of the vellum supports in question: the Warsaw Sforziada book, the Mannheim Schnorr (an alternate attribution), and ''La Bella Principessa,'' although Kemp and Cotte have shown a close match between the vellum of the portrait and the book. Further analysis of the vellum could possibly provide the conclusive evidence that may support or disqualify Leonardo's or Schnorr's authorship.

In November 2015, notorious [[art forger]] [[Shaun Greenhalgh]] claimed that he created the work in 1978, at the age of 20; Greenhalgh said the woman's face is that of a supermarket check-out girl named Alison who worked in Bolton, outside [[Manchester, England|Manchester]].&lt;ref name="Reyburn4Dec"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/arts/international/an-art-world-mystery-worthy-of-leonardo.html|title=An Art World Mystery Worthy of Leonardo|date=December 4, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015|work=The New York Times|first=Scott|last=Reyburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/Arts/article1639169.ece|title=‘It’s not a da Vinci, it’s Sally from the Co-op’ |work=The Sunday Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir ''A Forger's Tale'', written in prison, Greenhalgh claims as a 17 year old to have forged the drawing by obtaining an old piece of vellum from a reused 1587 land deed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Margareta Birgersdotter Grip''' (1538–1586), was a Swedish baroness, writer and landowner. She is known for her writing: she copied letters and documents from the Middle Ages, the originals of which have since been lost, and for her genealogical research. Genealogical works became common among the nobility after her day, and her work is considered the first of the genre in Sweden.

==Life==
She was born to ''[[riksråd]]'' baron Birger Nilsson Grip and Brita Joachimsdotter Brahe. In 1562, she married the noble Erik Månsson [[Natt och Dag]], son of Måns Johansson and [[Barbro Eriksdotter]]. She was thereby the sister-in-law of the lady-in-waiting [[Karin Gyllenstierna]], who were also her neighbor on the estate [[Säby]]. After being widowed shortly after, she managed the estate [[Brokind Castle]] on behalf of her minor son Erik Eriksson Natt och Dag (d. 1566). After the death of her son, she inherited the Bro estate personally. In 1571, she married riksråd [[Sten Axelsson Banér]]. However, she remained the sole manager of the Bro estate.

Traditionally, Margareta Birgersdotter Grip has been named [[Mistress of the Robes]] of Queen [[Karin Månsdotter]] in 1567-1568. However, [[Elin Andersdotter]] is confirmed to have had that position.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Arnell (1951). Karin Månsdotter. Stockholm: Wahlström &amp; Widstrand. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Margareta Grip copied a large amount of documents and letters from the Middle Ages, whose originals have since been lost, and who are therefore important historical documents. She produced a genealogical work, with the intent of vindicating her ancestor, [[Bo Jonsson Grip]], a work she started in 1574. Genealogical research became common among the nobility in the late 16th century, but Grip are regarded as the pioneer of this genre in Sweden. Her work is kept at the [[Trolleholm Castle]] archive.

'''Maria Morris Miller''' (1813-1875) was a Canadian artist from [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]] who is known for her botanical paintings and illustrations. She is also the first professional woman artist in Nova Scotia, recognized in her field during her active career years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/maria-morris-miller/|title=Maria Morris Miller|website=thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with scientists and government officials, garnering her accolades as the "Audubon of Nova Scotian field flowers".&lt;ref name="journals.msvu.ca"&gt;http://journals.msvu.ca/index.php/atlantis/article/viewFile/4155/3399&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Born into a middle class family, Miller's mother Sybilla encouraged her to learn about art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kAS6AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller |title=Social History |volume=30 |page=11 |publisher=University of Ottawa Press |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller studied her craft in Halifax under the tutelage of a visiting British painter named L'Estrange. She also studied with W.H. Jones, a Bostonian who taught at [[Dalhousie College]].&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=UgrrAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQgtMAE&lt;/ref&gt; In 1830, she began offering drawing classes to female students which gave her some financial independence.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=4LW7y8EQQUcC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEITDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Maria%20Morris%20Miller&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=W9DpsO-tjKYC&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQhBMAU&lt;/ref&gt;  The North British Society of Halifax honoured her with the title of "Painter of the Year" in 1836.&lt;ref name =nsgallery&gt;https://artgalleryofnovascotia.ca/maria-morris-miller/&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Nova Scotia's Secretary of Agriculture and botanist, Titus Smith, asked Miller to paint a series of canvasses depicting local wildflowers. He brought her specimens which she quickly had to immortalize, before the plants deteriorated.&lt;ref name="journals.msvu.ca"/&gt; During the mid 1830s, aided by Smith's scientific input, Miller produced a large number of water colour drawings which later ended up in an important Halifax art exhibition in 1848.&lt;ref name=nsgallery/&gt;

Smith provided botanical descriptions for Miller's first catalog of coloured [[lithograph]]s entitled ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia''.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=2OoBMQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEIQTAE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=LRQ1AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjioNLzzJfaAhWE3oMKHVjUCvMQ6AEIWzAJ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=5175&lt;/ref&gt; It was issued in 1840 by a London bookseller and local publisher, with the financial support of the province's [[lieutenant-governor]] [[Sir Colin Campbell]]. Two other sets of lithographs followed in 1853 and 1866. The second publication was also issued as ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia''. The third catalog was entitled ''Wild Flowers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick'' and  was annotated by [[George Lawson (botanist)|George Lawson]], a botanist who founded the Botanical Society of Canada.&lt;ref name=nsgallery/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.google.ca/search?q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA703CA703&amp;tbm=bks&amp;ei=YgrAWuLnGoS9jwTYqKuYDw&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N&amp;biw=907&amp;bih=425&amp;dpr=1.5&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, the first series was reissued with a new title, ''Wild Flowers of British North America''.  With her four catalogs, Miller was able to document 22 native plants, at a time when there was an increasing interest in natural history.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books?id=iv95AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;dq=Maria+Morris+Miller&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjt2qHaz5faAhXs7YMKHZdkCIw4ChDoAQgzMAI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nsgallery"/&gt;

In 1862, Miller participated in an International Exhibition in [[London]], [[England]]. Although her drawings arrived too late to be part of the competition, she received positive reviews in the English press.&lt;ref&gt;https://cwahi.concordia.ca/sources/artists/displayArtist.php?ID_artist=70&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, a copy of her botanical paintings were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Exposition]].

Miller's works are part of the permanent collection at the [[Art Gallery of Nova Scotia]], Atlantic Canada's largest art museum.&lt;ref&gt;https://artgalleryofnovascotia.ca/collection/permanent&lt;/ref&gt; Other paintings and lithographs are owned by The Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History, also located in Halifax. [[Ottawa]]'s [[National Gallery of Canada]] has some of her lithographs as well, belonging to the 1840 and 1853 series.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gallery.ca/collection/artist/maria-morris-miller&lt;/ref&gt;

Also a writer, Miller published a volume of poetry, ''Metrical Musings'', with her sister Catherine in 1856.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=TdsCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR3&amp;lpg=PR3&amp;dq=Metrical+musings+morris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rIyrvATJ0n&amp;sig=aBGe28a9jfg0qyz3waZzIpsuoKQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7i4HTzsXOAhUDRCYKHTqDAP8Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Metrical%20musings%20morris&amp;f=false Metrical Musings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Most records indicate that Maria Morris Miller was born in 1813 in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], the daughter of Captain Guy Morris and Sibylla Amelia Maria Sophia Leggett. Her father, who was a descendent of [[Charles Morris (jurist)|Charles Morris]], died when Maria was a small child. (She may have also been born in 1810 in Country Harbour, Nova Scotia with her mother moving the family to Halifax after her father's death in 1813.) In 1840, Maria Morris Miller married Garret Trafalgar Nelson Miller, the son of [[Garrett Miller (politician)|Garrett Miller]] and Catherine Pernette, who was the daughter of [[Joseph Pernette]]. Maria Morris Miller and her husband had five children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Morris, Maria Frances Ann (Miller) |encyclopedia=Dictionary of Canadian Biography |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio.php?id_nbr=5175 |access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.ca"/&gt; She passed away in Halifax in 1875.

The '''Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault''' is a funerary structure in the main cemetery of [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Constructed in the 1870s, this [[receiving vault]] originally fulfilled the normal purposes of such structures, but it gained prominence as the semipermanent resting place of Marion's most prominent citizen, U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]].

==Construction==
The vault is a [[limestone]] structure with a slate roof; it rests on a concrete [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OHC NRHP|95001415|Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans to build it were formulated as early as 1873, when the [[cemetery association]] voted to make plans for one; funds were insufficient, so the association decided not to build until sufficient money had become available.  Six years later, the cemetery's trustees decided to build a vault, and to design it, they hired [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] architect D.W. Giffs.&lt;ref name=sites&gt;[http://www.marionohiocemetery.com/Historical%20Sites.htm MCA], Marion Cemetery Association, 2009.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the association's reasons for building the vault was the desire to retard a modern form of [[grave robbery]]: the practice of [[body snatching]] was still relatively common, and the association wished to provide a place where bodies could be laid without risk of theft until they had [[Decomposition|decomposed]] so much that they would be useless to body snatchers.  Accordingly, the final design for the vault included iron gates with secure locks.  Other elements of the design included a [[Vault (architecture)|double-arched ceiling]], the creation of [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and related systems, and the placement of fine [[marble]] and [[carpet]] to beautify the structure and retard the harshness of death for decedents' family members at funerals.&lt;ref name=sites /&gt;  The entire structure is built into a hillside.&lt;ref&gt;"Harding Rests in Ivy-Clad Vault in Marion Cemetery".  ''[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]'', 1923-08-11: 1/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardings==
[[Warren G. Harding|Warren Gamaliel Harding]] died in early August 1923 while in office as [[President of the United States]].  The suddenness of his death produced chaos even on a personal level, as funeral services and a burial location must be worked out suddenly, and [[Florence Harding|Mrs. Harding]] was forced to return to Washington, D.C. to wrap up her affairs and to move her possessions out of the White House in order to permit its new occupants, [[Calvin Coolidge|President]] and [[Grace Coolidge|Mrs.]] Coolidge, to move in.  Accordingly, no permanent burial place was employed immediately after his death, and funeral services were held at the Receiving Vault:&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Harding Arrives Back in Washington".  ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' 1923-08-11, 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt; Harding's family already owned burial plots in the cemetery, but a grander destination was planned for the deceased chief executive; in the meantime, soldiers from [[Fort Hayes]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] guarded the vault for six months.&lt;ref&gt;"Harding Laid to Final Rest in Home Town", ''Polk County ''[North Carolina]'' News'', 1923-08-16: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As plans were being made for the construction of a [[Harding Tomb|permanent presidential tomb]] elsewhere in the city, his body remained in the vault, being joined by Mrs. Harding's body after her death in 1924.  The two continued to wait until the practical completion of the memorial in 1927; they were then moved to their permanent burial sites inside the memorial, although four more years passed before it was formally dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hardinghome.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=64 The Harding Memorial], [[Harding Home]], 2010.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Two weeks before Christmas 1995, the Receiving Vault was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], qualifying both because of its architecture and because of the place it had played in the events of 1923.  It is one of two National Register-listed sites in Marion's city cemetery — the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Chapel|chapel]] had been listed nine months before — and one of fourteen such locations throughout [[Marion County, Ohio|Marion County]].  Among these fourteen are Harding's permanent tomb and [[Harding Home|his home]] on Marion's east side.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

[[File:Sacul vase.jpg|thumb|right|Painted Classic Period vase from [[Sacul, El Petén|Sacul]] in Guatemala]]
'''Maya ceramics''' are ceramics produced in the [[Pre-Columbian]] [[Mayan civilization|Maya]] culture of [[Mesoamerica]]. The vessels used different shapes, colors, sizes, and had varied purposes. Vessels for the elite could be painted with very detailed scenes, while utilitarian vessels were undecorated or much simpler. Elite pottery, usually in the form of straight-sided beakers called "vases", used for drinking chocolate, was placed in burials, giving a number of survivals in good condition.  Individual examples include the [[Princeton Vase]] and the [[Fenton Vase]].

Used for a plethora of daily activities, such as the storage of food and beverages, [[ceramics (art)|ceramics]] were also a canvas of commemoration. There were three main types of ceramics used in daily life: bowls, plates, and cylinders. They were often [[monochrome]], meaning that only one type of mineral slip was used.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Polychrome pottery was more complex in nature and therefore more commonly used by the elite. Not only was polychrome pottery used as decoration, it was also used as a form of social currency-- a physical display of status and others' approval.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28632069|title=Painting the Maya universe : royal ceramics of the classic period|last=Dorie.|first=Reents-Budet,|date=1994|publisher=Duke University Press in association with Duke University Museum of Art|others=Ball, Joseph W., Duke University. Museum of Art., Jay I. Kislak Reference Collection (Library of Congress)|isbn=9780822314387|location=Durham|oclc=28632069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed, various features were added to ceramics to go beyond the fundamental needs of vessels; For example pellets were put in larger bowls to not only serve as something to hold food, but would also become instruments used in the same feasts.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mayac/hd_mayac.htm|title=Ancient Maya Painted Ceramics {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Doyle|first=Author: James|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence has been found that suggests ceramics were used for industrial purposes. The discovery of highly uniform ceramic cylinders along with tools used in the production of salt indicate that the ceramics were used to mass produce salt from brine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Mark|last2=McKillop|first2=Heather|date=Spring 2014|title=Fuelling the Ancient Maya Salt Industry|url=|journal=Economic Botany|volume=68|issue=1|pages=96–108|doi=10.1007/s12231-014-9263-x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decoration==
The utilitarians ware of the common people usually had simple decoration that reflected its use. For example, cylindrical bowls used for cacao drinks often had the plant species ''Q. guatemalteca'' depicted on them because that flower was used to enhance the flavor of the cacao drink.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zidar, C. &amp; Elisens, W. Econ Bot|first=|date=June 2009|title=Sacred Giants: Depiction of Bombacoideae on Maya Ceramics in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s12231-009-9079-2|journal=Economic Botany|volume=63|pages=119–129|via=|doi=10.1007/s12231-009-9079-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs often included rituals, supernatural figures or common day practices. Rulers were often depicted next to deities and shown to be equal, or nearly equal, in power and status as them. Other pots functioned more as storytelling devices, with glyphs from the [[Maya script]] that likely were guides for songs or other ritualistic texts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For many potters, decoration and imagery was more important than the structure of each vessel.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cylindrical vases and plates were popular because they maximized the surface area for storytelling through imagery on each piece. There was more evolution in pictorial representations than shapes. As the complexity of painting increased, vessel shapes remained fairly simple.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Ceramics in society ==
Maya ceramics are made from two main types of materials that relate to their social structure, [[limestone]] and volcanic ash. Most of the land around the Mayans was limestone, which is where [[calcite]] comes from. These were mainly made as gifts and given to make local alliances, and these vessels are found in a more localized area. Whereas the ones made from volcanic ash are more widespread because they were thought to be given as gifts from the upper class to make very large alliances, through the Maya trade systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The production and exchange of moulded-carved ceramics and the ‘Maya Collapse|last=Ting|first=Carmen|publisher=Journal of Archaeological Science|year=2015|isbn=|location=Mo S&amp;T Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ceramics play a big role in society during the [[Maya Classic Period]], when the Maya elite used ceramics not only to give gifts to foreign dignitaries, but they were also used in feasts during the Classic Period. Specialized pottery was made for the graves of nobles. Not anyone could make this pottery as it was very important they knew about the Maya history, mythology, and more. On these ceramics, intricate scenes were depicted which showed the palace life of the elite. On each ceramic piece near the rim, its contents would be listed out, a type of beverage for a vase or food for a plate, then who it belonged to was written next. Since these ceramics were traded and gifted, many end up in differing environments. Specialists mainly pay attention to the writing, drawings, and heiroglyphs, since they were different for the different people and cultures they were made by.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What Can We Learn From a Maya Vase?|last=Reents-Budet|first=Dorie|publisher=Archaeological Institute of America|year=2003|isbn=|location=Mo S&amp;T Library|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the everyday use more simple ware was made, generally of only one color, and would be produced in large quantities for the general public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Specialization, Exchange and Complex Societies|last=Brumfiel|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=|location=Google Books|pages=78-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production techniques ==
[[Image:Mayanvase.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Maya vase depicting a costumed noble; burial offering. Late classical period (600-900 CE). [[Copán]], [[Honduras]].]]

The Maya had specific techniques to create, inscribe, paint, and design [[pottery]]. To begin creating a ceramic vessel the Maya had to locate the proper resources for [[clay]] and [[temper (mineral)|temper]]. The present-day [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Maya, who currently live in [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]] and southern [[Mexico]] still create wonderful ceramics. [[Prudence M. Rice]] provides a look at what the current Guatemalan Maya use today for clay.  Highland Guatemala has a rich geological history comprised mainly from a [[volcano|volcanic]] past. The [[metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] and [[igneous]] rock, as well as the sand and ash from the pumice areas provide many types of tempering.  In the area, there are a range of clays that create varied colors and strengths when fired.  Today's Maya locate their clays in the exposed [[river]] systems of the highland valleys.  It is hypothesized that the ancient people obtained their clay by the same method as today's Maya. The clays are located in exposed river systems of the highland valleys.  Most likely, due to the climatic similarities over the last millennia it is likely that these same deposits or similar ones could have been used in early times. 

Once the [[clay]] and temper were collected, pottery creation began. The maker would take the clay and mix it with the temper (the rock pieces, ash, or sand). Temper served as a strengthening device for the pottery. Once worked into a proper consistency, the shape of the piece was created.
	
A [[potter's wheel]] was not used in creating this pottery.  Instead, they used coil and slab techniques. The coil method most likely involved the formation of clay into long coiled pieces that were wound into a vessel.  The coils were then smoothed together to create walls. The slab method used square slabs of clay to create boxes or types of additions like feet or lids for vessels. Once the pot was formed into the shape, then it would have been set to dry until it was leather hard. Then, the pot was painted, inscribed, or slipped. The last step was the firing of the vessel. Kilns were used to fire the vessels, and they were normally found outside in the open air. Unlike many modern kilns, they were fired by wood, charcoal, or even grass. 

Like the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], the Maya created clay slips from a mixture of clays and [[mineral]]s. The clay slips were then used to decorate the pottery. By the fourth century, a broad range of colors including yellow, purple, red, and orange were being made. However, some Mayan painters refrained from using many colors and used only black, red, and occasionally cream. This series of ceramics is termed the "[[Codex]]-style", it being similar to the style of the Pre-Columbian [[book]]s.

From the 5th century onwards, post-firing [[stucco]] was adopted from [[Teotihuacan]]. By preparing a thin [[quicklime]], the Maya added mineral pigments that would dissolve and create rich blues and greens that added to their artistic culture. Many times this post-fire stucco technique was mixed with painting and incising. Incising is carving deeply or lightly into partially dried clay to create fine detailed designs. This technique was mostly popular during the Early Classic Period.

==Development chronology==
[[File:Incense Burner with Face and Side Flanges, Classic Mayan, highland Guatemala - San Diego Museum of Man - DSC06837.JPG|thumb|[[Incense Burner]] with face and side flanges, [[Classic Mayan]], highland [[Guatemala]], [[San Diego Museum of Man]].]]
The Maya were a diverse people whose culture has developed through the centuries.  As they developed, so did their pottery.  Archaeologists have found stages of commonality between types of ceramics, and these phases coincide with the Mayan timeline.

Middle Preclassic (900/800-250 BC) Late Preclassic (250 BC- AD 250) Early Mayan ceramics stemmed from a past that began even years before the Maya became a group. Originally, the early Maya used [[gourd]]s cut into useful shapes to create vessels to carry liquids and foodstuffs. These portable and durable gourds made excellent containers. The first ceramics closely resembled gourds and many were decorated with rocker stamps and simple slips. During the Late Preclassic period, many of the ceramics took on appendages of tetrapod mammiform supports. These supports were four legs underneath the pot holding it up. Tetrapods are relatively rare in the Maya Lowlands- even in the Peten where they were first described.  Characteristic cream-on-red stripes colored these unique vessels. 

The pottery of the Maya Early Classic dated from AD 250 to 550. The Maya soon began using polychrome slip paint, meaning they used many different colors to decorate the pots. This method of decoration became almost homogeneous for Mayan potters, thus signaling the beginning of the Classic Period.  Polychrome pottery was a luxury item not commonly available to the general population.  Most Early Classic Ceramics were monochrome types.  Figural Polychromes were an elite prerogative, probably produced by and for other elites.  The Classic Period of the Maya provided beautiful ceramics in many forms. The lidded basal flange bowl was a new style of potter to add to the already growing repertoire.  This type vessel usually had a knob on top in the form of an animal or human head, while the painted body of the animal or human spreads across the pot. Many of these pots also had mammiform supports, or legs. These unique vessels are usually found in great condition signaling a ritual function.  The reason many are in good condition is their frequent use as burial goods.  As such, they are often the target of looters who cut deep trenches through many Maya buildings in search of a marketable vessel.

The '''New England Conservatory of Music''' ('''NEC''') in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], is the oldest independent [[school of music]] in the United States, and it is widely recognized as one of the country's most distinguished music schools. NEC is especially known for its [[string instrument|strings]], [[piano]], [[woodwinds]], and [[brass]] departments, and its prestigious [[chamber music]] program.&lt;ref name=necold/&gt;

The conservatory, located on [[Huntington Avenue|Huntington Avenue of the Arts]] near [[Boston Symphony Hall]], is home each year to 750 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate studies along with 1400 more in its ''Preparatory School'' as well as the ''School of Continuing Education''. At the collegiate level, NEC offers the [[Bachelor of Music]], [[Master of Music]], and [[Doctor of Musical Arts]], as well as the Undergraduate Diploma, Graduate Diploma, and Artist Diploma. Also offered are five-year joint double-degree programs with [[Harvard University]] and [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref name=prog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://necmusic.edu/apply-nec/degree-programs|title=Programs of Study|work=New England Conservatory|accessdate=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220084620/http://necmusic.edu/apply-nec/degree-programs|archivedate=February 20, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEC is the only music school in the United States designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] and it is a pending [[Boston Landmark]]. Its primary concert hall, [[Jordan Hall]], hosts approximately 1,000 concerts each year.&lt;ref name=nhlp/&gt;

==Early history==

[[File:Eben Tourjee 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.50|Eben Tourjée]]
In June 1853, Eben Tourjée, at the time a nineteen-year-old music teacher from Providence, Rhode Island, made his first attempt to found a music conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts. He met with a group of Boston's most influential musical leaders to discuss a school based on the conservatories of Europe. The group included [[John Sullivan Dwight]], an influential music critic, Dr. J. Baxter Upham, president of the Harvard Musical Association, and [[Oliver Ditson]], a prominent music publisher. The group ultimately rejected Tourjée's plans, arguing that it was a poor idea to open a conservatory amidst the nation's political and economic uncertainty that would lead up to the [[American Civil War]].

Tourjée made his next attempt in December 1866, when he again met with a group of Boston's top musicians and music patrons. Among Upham, Ditson, and Dwight at this meeting were [[Carl Zerrahn]], a popular Boston conductor, and [[Charles Callahan Perkins|Charles Perkins]], a prominent arts patron. In the thirteen-year interim, Tourjee had founded three music schools in Rhode Island, and this time was able to win over his audience. The men agreed to help Tourjee, and The New England Conservatory officially opened on February 18, 1867. It consisted of seven rooms rented above Music Hall off Tremont Street in downtown Boston. In 1870 it moved to the former St. James Hotel in Franklin Square in the South End.

==Campus==
[[File:Huntington Ave Boston.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
The NEC campus consists of three buildings on both sides of Gainsborough Street, between St. Botolph Street and [[Huntington Avenue]], one block from [[Symphony Hall, Boston|Symphony Hall]]. The Jordan Hall Building, whose main entrance is at 30 Gainsborough Street, is NEC's main building, home to Jordan Hall, Williams Hall, Brown Hall, the Keller Room, the Isabelle Firestone Audio Library, the Performance Library, professor studios/offices, and practice rooms. The second building, at 33 Gainsborough, is the Residence Hall, a coed dormitory which also houses the Harriet M. Spaulding Library and the "Bistro 33" dining center. The St. Botolph Building, at 241 St. Botolph street, contains Pierce Hall, a computer laboratory, the electronic music studio, and the majority of the school's classrooms and administrative offices.

===Jordan Hall===
{{Main article|Jordan Hall}}
[[File:Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra in Jordan Hall.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Greater Boston Youth Symphony Orchestras|Boston Youth Symphony Orchestra]] performing in Jordan Hall.]]
[[Jordan Hall]] is NEC's central performing space. Opened in 1903, Jordan Hall was the gift of New England Conservatory trustee Eben D. Jordan the 2nd, a member of the family that founded the [[Jordan Marsh]] retail stores and himself an amateur musician. In 1901, Jordan donated land for NEC's main building, while also offering to fund a concert hall with a gift of $120,000.

The dedication concert of Jordan Hall, performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, took place on October 20, 1903. Newspaper accounts deemed the hall "unequaled the world over," and ''The Boston Globe'' reported that it was "a place of entertainment that European musicians who were present that evening say excels in beauty anything of the kind they ever saw."&lt;ref name=hh/&gt;

A major renovation project was completed in 1995. The renovated hall won the 1996 Massachusetts Historical Commission Preservation Award, the Victorian Society in America's Preservation Commendation, the 1996 Boston Preservation Alliance Award, the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America Award of Merit, and the Illuminating Engineering Society 1996 Lumen Award.

==Academics==
Admission to NEC is based primarily on a competitive live audition. The conservatory offers degrees in orchestral instruments, conducting, piano, jazz studies, contemporary improvisation, opera and voice (performance and pedagogy), composition, music history, and [[music theory]].

The conservatory has served as a training ground for orchestral players to fill the ranks of the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], much as the [[Curtis Institute]] serves as a training ground for the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], although composers, pianists, and singers are offered courses of study as well.

===Preparatory School===
New England Conservatory's Preparatory School is an open-enrollment institution for pre-college students. The preparatory school offers music classes and private instruction for young musicians, and fosters over 35 small and large ensembles. Students enrolled in the Preparatory School may participate in the Certificate Program, allowing students to achieve their optimum performance skills, competence in music theory, and a knowledge of the literature that includes choral, orchestral, and chamber music, as well as solo repertoire.

NEC Prep is home to one of the world's leading youth orchestras, the highly selective Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (YPO) as well as the NEC Youth Chorale who have performed for prominent world figures including the Pope at the Vatican in the past years. The Youth Philharmonic Orchestra headed by [[David Loebel]] is arguably the most selective group at the school. The Preparatory School also houses the Massachusetts Youth Wind Ensemble (MYWE), a highly selective touring wind ensemble open to advanced high school woodwind, brass, and percussion players directed by Michael Mucci. The Preparatory Jazz program offers a Jazz Certificate that focuses on ensemble performance, the primary expression of jazz, supported by private lessons and a comprehensive group of courses covering jazz skills. Jazz ensembles range in size from small groups (combos) to the Youth Jazz Orchestra.

===School of Continuing Education===
New England Conservatory's School of Continuing Education allows members of the surrounding community to experience the benefits of New England Conservatory's world class instruction, offering classes, lessons, and ensemble opportunities to musicians of any background. At NEC's School of Continuing Education members can participate in chamber, jazz, and vocal ensembles, an opera studio, an adult chorale, a klezmer band, and a community gospel choir. In addition, NEC's School of Continuing Education offers classes in several fields including music history, music theory, and Alexander technique, many of which are instructed by members of the New England Conservatory college faculty.

==Partnerships==
NEC is co-founder and educational partner of ''[[From the Top]]'', a weekly radio program that celebrates outstanding young classical musicians from the entire country. With its broadcast home in Jordan Hall, the show is now carried by [[National Public Radio]] and is heard on 250 stations throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=ftt/&gt;

The conservatory offers five-year joint double-degree programs with [[Harvard University]] and [[Tufts University]] and cross-registration with Tufts, [[Northeastern University]], and [[Simmons College (Massachusetts)|Simmons College]].&lt;ref name=courses/&gt;

NEC is the founding institution of [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia Fraternity]] and [[Kappa Gamma Psi]] Performing Arts Fraternity.

:''See [[List of New England Conservatory people#Past and present teachers|New England Conservatory past and present teachers]] for notable members of the faculty.''

==Nomenclature==
Although the institution is properly known as New England Conservatory, both the National Historic Landmark and the National Register of Historic Places nominations call out "New England Conservatory of Music" as the name of the historic designation.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhlnom/&gt; Also, despite the statement on the subject's web site,&lt;ref name=necff/&gt; there is only one listing for each program, which covers the whole main building, including Jordan Hall, and no separate listing for Jordan Hall.&lt;ref name=malist/&gt;

'''Norman Adams''' (October 3, 1933 in Walla Walla, Washington – July 4, 2014) was an American commercial artist and illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fred Adams Oct. 3, 1933 — July 4, 2014|url=http://union-bulletin.com/news/2014/jul/07/fred-adams/|accessdate=18 September 2015|agency=union-bulletin|date=7 July 2014}}  {{dead link|date=April 2016}}(not available in wayback machine due to robots.txt)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mantle Fielding's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Opitz, Editor|first=Glenn B.|title=Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of american Painters, Sculptors &amp; Engravers|year=1987|publisher=Apollo Book|location=Poughkeepsie, NY|isbn=0-938290-04-5|page=1047}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Norman began to draw and paint when he was still a child. He collected pictures from every type of magazine and book he could find and then found ways of improving them. He was especially captivated by the ''[[trompe l'oeil]]'' realism of artists like [[William Harnett]], [[John F. Peto]] and [[John Haberle]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

He studied art at the Los Angeles Art Center School in the early 1950s.  While he was in Los Angeles he spent months painting a portfolio in which he used his ''trompe l'oeil'' [[realism (arts)|realism]] to convince the managers of the largest illustration agencies in NY that he could do what no other artist/illustrator could. The three largest agencies in NY wanted to hire him. He chose to work for the Charles E Cooper Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmanart.org/html/charles_e__cooper_studio.html |title=CEC |publisher=Atmanart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Norman was working in NY he met his idol Robert Fawcett at a [[Society of Illustrators]] exhibition.
 
Like most established Illustrators at the time Norman Adams considered [[Robert Fawcett]] to be: "The Illustrator's Illustrator."  When Norman Adams finally met Robert Fawcett, he, Fawcett, was so impressed with Adams' paintings that he considered Norman to be a Babe Ruth of Illustration, perhaps because Norman worked for the "New York Yankees" of Illustration at the time: the "preeminent" Charles E Cooper Studio.

Another more obvious reason Fawcett might have referred to Norman as Cooper's Babe Ruth was his versatility. When Norman was working for Cooper only Don Crowley could paint realistically enough to be versatile. All of Cooper's other Illustrators, like Murray Tinkelman, Coby Whitmore, James Bama … were too specialized to be versatile. Not only were they specialized but they were specialized for so long that they would not do jobs outside their “specialty.”

What separated Norman's paintings from others was the “trompe l'oeil” detail he routinely put into his paintings. It was this extra detail that made his paintings stand out, especially to professions like Cooper and Fawcett.

Illustrators took for granted that it was a waste of time to put detail into their originals that would be lost in the published reproduction. Norman also knew this, but what he did not take for granted: although much of the “trompe l'oeil” detail he put into his originals would be lost in reproduction, it was this detail that  would get him new jobs that other illustrators would not get. It was all these additional jobs that made him Cooper's “Babe Ruth.”

Norman Adams' illustrations included works for [[Reader's Digest]], [[Boys' Life]], [[Harper's Magazine|Harpers]],  [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]], [[TV Guide]], [[Saturday Evening Post]], [[True Magazine]], [[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]], [[Sports Afield]], [[Field and Stream]], [[Business Week]], [[Cabela's]], Medical Economics, and other paperback covers. He also authored a textbook now in its 30th Edition, ''Drawing Animals''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Animals-Anniversary-Norman-Adams/dp/0823013669 |title=Drawing Animals: 30th Anniversary Edition: Norman Adams, Joe Singer: 9780823013661: Amazon.com: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the magazines started to fail the Charles E Cooper Studio had to downscale. This prompted Norman Adams to join an elite group of illustrators at Artists Associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmanart.org/html/artists_associates.html |title=ArtistAssoc |publisher=Atmanart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 Lenox hired him to do a very limited edition Lenox Collection of 12 unique plates that were released in 1982 called ''The American Wildlife Plates by Norman Adams.'' In the mid-1980s Norman Adams was given an opportunity to paint for the 1988 Minnesota Wildlife Art Show. His work was a life-sized Golden Eagle in a Grand Canyon setting. For years he sold his wildlife and animal paintings in [http://www.trailsidegalleries.com/ galleries] in Scottsdale, Arizona,  and Jackson Hole, Wyoming.

[[File:James Tissot - Portsmouth Dockyard.jpg|thumb|400px|James Tissot, ''Portsmouth Dockyard'', 1877, Tate Gallery ]]

'''''Portsmouth Dockyard''''' is an 1877 oil painting by French artist [[James Tissot]]. It is a reworking of his 1987 painting ''On The Thames'', which also depicts a man and two women in a boat. It measures {{convert|15.0|x|21.5|in|cm}}.

The painting depicts three people sitting in a rowing boat among the towering naval vessels in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]], with another rowing boat crewed by naval personnel passing in the background before the bows of two old-fashioned [[square rigged]] [[ship of the line|ships of the line]].  In the background is a modern [[ironclad warship]].  In the centre is a man wearing the uniform of a sergeant in a [[Scottish regiment#Highland Regiments|Highland Regiment]], with [[red coat (military uniform)|redcoat]], [[kilt]], and [[feather bonnet]].  He sits with his legs crossed, and his hands clasped around one bare knee.  He is turning away from the unhappy woman to his left - in cream dress and tartan shawl or blanket, and her [[parasol]] up - and towards the smiling woman to his right - in white and black striped dress, with shawl over her arm and parasol furled.  

This 1877 painting is a reworking of Tissot's 1876 painting ''On The Thames'', which depicts a man and two women reclining lazily aboard a boat moving through crowded shipping on the [[River Thames]].  ''On The Thames'' was shown at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1876 but it was poorly received, with critics questioning the sexual morality of the subjects: one critic described it as "wilfully vulgar", and another disparagingly as "more French than English".  Tissot's less ambiguous 1877 reworking of the subject in ''Portsmouth Dockyard'' was more favourably received, but the story remains unclear.  Perhaps there is some flirtation between the man and the woman to the left; perhaps the second woman a chaperone, or a sister.

The painting was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in 1877 under the title ''Portsmouth Dockyard''.  The same year, Tissot made a [[drypoint]] copy of the painting, which was reproduced as an [[etching]] in two editions of around 100 prints each, measuring {{convert|9.75|x|13.75|in}}, under the French title ''Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance'' (literally, "Between the two my heart swings"; sometimes translated as "How happy I could be with either").  An etching of the drypoint reproduction was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2013 for £1,125, described as a work on "the theme of comic rivalry in the affairs of the heart", and one was sold at [[Bonhams]] in 2018 for $937.

The painting was bought by the Lancashire corn merchant Henry Jump, and descended through his family.  It was sold at [[Christie's]] in 1937 under the title ''Divided Attention'', bought by [[Leicester Galleries]] for 58 guineas, and exhibited at Leicester Galleries under the title ''Entre les Deux mon Coeur balance'' (the title of Tissot's drypoint and etching of the same subject).   The painting was sold to Sir [[Hugh Walpole]], who left it to the [[Tate Gallery]] on his death in 1941.   The Tate first exhibited it in 1942 under the title ''How happy could he be with either'', later returning to the original title ''Portsmouth Dockyard''.  It remains in the collection of the Tate.

'''José Rafael Moneo Vallés''' (born 9 May 1937) is a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[architect]]. He won the [[Pritzker Prize]] for architecture in 1996 and the [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] [[Royal Gold Medal]] in 2003. 

==Life and career==
Born in [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]], [[Spain]], Moneo studied at the [[ETSAM]], [[Technical University of Madrid]] (UPM) from which he received his architectural degree in 1961. From the [[Davis Museum and Cultural Center|Davis Art Museum]] at [[Wellesley College]] in [[Massachusetts]] and the [[Audrey Jones Beck]] [[Audrey Jones Beck Building|Building]] (an expansion of the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]]). Moneo also designed the [[Chace Center]], a new building for the [[Rhode Island School of Design]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm ''Campus Initiatives: The Chace Center''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525140112/http://www.risd.edu/campus_initiatives_risd.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, the Northwest Corner Building (formerly the Interdepartmental Science Building) at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] first opened. Moneo's most recent work is [[Peretsman-Scully Hall]] and the [[Princeton Neuroscience Institute]], which houses the psychology and neuroscience departments at [[Princeton University]] and opened in December 2013.

In 2012, he was awarded with 2012 [[Prince of Asturias Awards|Prince of Asturias Award]] for the Arts. According to the jury, Moneo is ''a Spanish architect of universal scope whose work enriches urban spaces with an architecture that is serene and meticulous. An acknowledged master in both the academic and professional field, Moneo leaves his own mark on each of his creations, at the same time as combining aesthetics with functionality, especially in the airy interiors that act as impeccable settings for great works of culture and the spirit.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fpa.es/en/awards/2012/rafael-moneo-1/jury/ ''Minutes of the Jury for the 2012 Prince of Asturias Award for the Arts. ''].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">'''Reconstructed clothing''' is used or [[vintage clothing]] that has been [[fashion design|redesigned]] and [[sewing|resewn]] into a new garment.&lt;ref name="pdi"&gt;De la Paz, Gino.  "If It's Worth It, Then Rework It."  Philippine Daily Inquirer (November 13, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Reconstructed [[clothing]] was [[Fashion trends|trendy]] in the [[2000s in fashion|mid-2000s]].&lt;ref name="pdi"/&gt;  The book ''Generation T'' (2006), which gave instructions for "108 Ways to Transform a [[T-Shirt]]", was one example of this trend.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolay, Megan.  Generation T: 108 Ways to Transform a T-Shirt. Workman Publishing Company, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book included instructions for how to make [[halter top]]s, [[A-line skirt]]s, and string [[bikini]]s out of T-shirts. In 2008, Nicolay released another book entitled: ''Generation T-Beyond Fashion 120 More Ways to Transform Your T's''. This book had a bigger variety of projects including ones for children, men, and even pets. 

In March 2006, the DIY group Compai released their first DIY clothing reconstruction book, ''99 Ways to Cut, Sew, Trim, and Tie Your T-shirt Into Something Fabulous!'' After this book's release, Compai went on to release three more books about reconstructing jeans, sweaters and scarves.

Reconstructed clothing is appealing because it allows the designer to "stamp [their ideas] into an existing piece...and come up with a totally different piece" and because it makes the wearer's clothing unique.&lt;ref name="pdi"/&gt;

The '''Scottish book sculptures''' are a group of book sculptures that were contrived to be "found" in Scotland between 2011 and 2013. The sculptures are on topics mostly concerning Scottish literature and poetry, and are made out of old books by an anonymous female paper sculptor.

The initial group of book sculptures was a group of ten elaborate sculptures that were left around various cultural locations in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, between March and November 2011, as gifts to the cultural institutions and people of the city.&lt;ref name=GdnDec11&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh book sculptures turn the page |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/dec/01/edinburgh-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of the artist is unknown, although notes with some of the sculptures referred to the artist as 'she'.  The sculptures were made from old books and were accompanied by gift labels which praised literacy and the love of words, and argued against library and other arts funding cuts.  An eleventh sculpture was presented to author [[Ian Rankin]], whose works featured prominently in many of the other sculptures. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were toured through Scotland in an exhibition in late 2012.&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh's mysterious book sculptures go on tour |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/scotland-blog/2012/jul/31/scotland-poetry-book-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Robyn|last=Marsack|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptor was then commissioned to produce five more book sculptures to be hidden in secret locations around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, which commenced in November 2012. Despite the commission, the artist has maintained her anonymity.

The sculptor also made another gift sculpture in December 2012, which she anonymously presented to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], already the previous recipient of two of her earlier works.

In May 2013 a new sculpture, featuring three eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdbox, was left in the Scottish Poetry library; this was followed by three baby birds in a nest, left at Leith Library. 
In 2014 a flutter or swarm of butterflies from an open book sculpture was left in aid of the [[Macmillan Cancer Support|Macmillan charity]]. This sculpture was bought privately but is intending to tour for a not-for-profit basis in 2015.

==2011 Edinburgh sculptures==
These are listed in the order of their discovery. In the first ten cases, the person who deposited the sculptures was not noticed, and some of the sculptures were found several days after they had been put in place.  The eleventh was a gift to author [[Ian Rankin]].

===First sculpture===
The first sculpture was found on Tuesday 2 March 2011 on a table in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]].&lt;ref name=GdnMar11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery 'poetree' is a symbol of library love Anonymous reader leaves a delicate gift to the Scottish Poetry Library |url=https://www.theguardian.com/edinburgh/2011/mar/03/edinburgh-scottish-poetry-library-tree-gift-mystery|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprised a tree with intricately fashioned branches and leaves, standing on a thick leather-bound old book.  At the base of the tree was a paper egg, broken in half and with the inside lined with gold, in which were a scatter of individual words, which could be put together to make "A Trace of Wings", a poem by [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]].&lt;ref name=CS&gt;{{cite news|title=Mysterious paper sculptures |url=http://thisiscentralstation.com/featured/mysterious-paper-sculptures/|work=Central Stn|first=Chris|last=Scott|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was accompanied by a tag, addressed to @byleaveswelive, the name of the Library's Twitter account.  "By leaves we live" is a [[Patrick Geddes]] quote about the idea that you reap what you sow.

The note on the tag read: "It started with your name [https://twitter.com/byleaveswelive @byleaveswelive] and became a tree.… … We know that a library is so much more than a building full of books… a book is so much more than pages full of words.… This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. a gesture (poetic maybe?)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The sculpture was nicknamed the "poetree" by the staff at the Library, and despite national publicity, the identity of its maker remained unknown.&lt;ref name=GdnMar11/&gt;

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found in late June 2011&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; at the [[National Library of Scotland]], a "delicately crafted"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt; gramophone and a coffin fashioned from a copy of Edinburgh-based author [[Ian Rankin]]'s book ''[[Exit Music]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/natlibscot @natlibscot] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. (&amp; against their exit)".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
Later on in June 2011 a third sculpture was anonymously deposited, this time at the box office of the [[Edinburgh Filmhouse]].&lt;ref name=GdnJune11&gt;{{cite news|title=Real-life Ian Rankin mystery of 'reverse heist' sculptures Series of intricate paper artworks linked to Rebus author's work left around Edinburgh|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/30/real-life-ian-rankin-mystery-sculptures|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Alison|last=Flood|date=30 June 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This one comprised "a complex scene in a paper cinema; punters arrayed on seats watching men and horses coming alive from the screen and charging outwards."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;  One of the audience had Ian Rankin's face, and was holding a bottle of [[Caledonian Brewery|Deuchars IPA]].&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/filmhouse @filmhouse] – A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas….. and all things *magic*".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; A quote from [[Francis Ford Coppola]], "I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated" was pasted onto the sculpture.&lt;ref name=GdnJune11/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found on a windowsill at the [[Scottish Storytelling Centre]].  As it lay in a part of the building that does not have much footfall, it may have lain undiscovered at the location for a while, and so its place in the gift chain is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Scotland&gt;{{cite news|title=Edinburgh’s mysterious book sculptures to go on display|url=http://www.scotland.org/features/edinburghs-mysterious-book-sculptures-to-go-on-display|work=Scotland|date=August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It comprises a dragon hatching from an egg on a nest of feathers.  It is made from a copy of Ian Rankin's book, ''[[Knots and Crosses]]''.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/scotstorycentre @scotstorycentre] – A gift in support of libraries, books, works, ideas….. Once upon a time there was a book and in the book was a nest and in the nest was an egg and in the egg was a dragon and in the dragon was a story….."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]].  The fifth sculpture was left on one of the signing tables in the festival bookshop.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=GdnAug11&gt;{{cite news|title=Mystery sculptures appear at Edinburgh book festival |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2011/aug/24/edinburgh-book-festival-sculptures?CMP=twt_gu|newspaper=The Guardian|first=Michael|last=MacLeod|date=24 August 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It comprised a tea tray bearing a cup of tea on a cake stand, a cupcake, a used teabag and a (real) old book. The teabag was filled with cut out letters, on the tag of which were the words "by leaves we live" (the Twitter name of the Scottish Poetry Library account referenced in the first sculpture). On the top of the tea in the teacup was a spiral swirl of words which read "Nothing beats a nice cup of tea (or coffee) and a really good BOOK", and on the tray next to the cupcake: "except maybe a cake as well".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edbookfest @edbookfest] 'A gift' This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…… &amp; festivals xx".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Sixth sculpture===
The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]]. The sixth sculpture was secreted about the [[City of Literature|Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature]] information stand in the entrance tent.&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;  It shows a man sitting under a tree.  It is made from an [[Everyman's Library]] edition of ''[[The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner]]'' by [[James Hogg]].&lt;ref name=GdnAug11/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "To [https://twitter.com/edincityoflit @edincityoflit] 'A gift' LOST (albeit in a good book) This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. “No infant has the power of deciding….. by what circumstances (they) shall be surrounded.. [[Robert Owen]]".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Seventh sculpture===
The seventh sculpture was found on 30 August 2011 on a bookshelf at [[Central Library, Edinburgh|Edinburgh Central Lending Library]].  It comprises a magnifying glass on a stand on top of a (real) old book.  Some words on the book are also shown in the lens of the magnifying glass: "When I go in I want it bright, I want to catch whatever is there in full sight".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For Central Library 'A Gift' [https://twitter.com/Edinburgh_CC @Edinburgh_CC] This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas…. Libraries are expansive".  The word 'expensive' has had the E crossed out and replaced with an A. The tag also notes, "Words on book – [[Edwin Morgan (poet)|Edwin Morgan]]".

===Eighth sculpture===
The eighth sculpture was found on 23 November 2011&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite news|title=Final chapter in book sculpture mystery revealed|url=http://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/news/article/723/final_chapter_in_book_sculpture_mystery_revealed|work=Edinburgh Council|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], where the first sculpture was found in March 2011. The staff were first alerted to its presence by a note which the sculptor had left in the guest book: "Hopefully next time I’ll be able to linger longer – I’ve left a little something for you near Women’s Anthologies X. In support of Libraries, Books, Words and Ideas…."&lt;ref name=CS/&gt; The sculpture was found on a bookshelf. The sculpture comprised two parts: an elaborate cap made of a wing of finely cut paper feathers, and a pair of gloves with 'bumblebee' stripes.

The note accompanying the sculptures was written on both sides. It described the inspiration for the sculptures, a quote from the poem "Gifts"&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; by Scottish poet [[Norman MacCaig]]:  "To @ByLeavesWeLive....... The gifts 'Gloves of bee's fur, cap of the Wren's Wings.......' Norman McCaig .... maybe sometimes impossible things... In support of Libraries, Books, Words Ideas...." and "10/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

A longer note accompanying the piece made clear that this sculpture was the last in a series of ten sculptures:

"It's important that a story is not too long ……does not become tedious ……. 'You need to know when to end a story,' she thought. Often a good story ends where it begins. This would mean a return to the Poetry Library. The very place where she had left the first of the ten. Back to those who had loved that little tree, and so encouraged her to try again …….and again. Some had wondered who it was, leaving these small strange objects. Some even thought it was a ‘he’! ……. As if!  Others looked among Book Artists, rather good ones actually…….  But they would never find her there. For though she does make things, this was the first time she had dissected books and had used them simply because they seemed fitting…. Most however chose not to know….. which was the point really. The gift, the place to sit, to look, to wonder, to dream….. of the impossible maybe…….  
A tiny gesture in support of the special places…. So, here, she will end this story, in a special place … A Poetry Library …. where they are well used to 'anon.' But before exiting …a few mentions. There could be more, because we have all colluded to make this work……. Just a few though. 
* the twitter community who in some strange way gave rise to the idea in the first place
* [https://twitter.com/chrisdonia @chrisdonia] who gave the story a place, a shape and some great pictures
* and not least [https://twitter.com/beathhigh @Beathhigh] whose books and reputation have been shamelessly utilised in the making of a mystery …….
…… But hold on. Someone’s left behind a pair of gloves and a cap……….?
Cheers Edinburgh It’s been fun! X"&lt;ref name=GdnDec11/&gt;&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The revelation that this was the tenth sculpture caused some concern, as only eight were known of at this point.  It was feared that the other two might have been lost or stolen or even simply thrown away by someone who didn’t realise what they had found.

===Ninth sculpture===
The ninth sculpture was found on 24 November 2011 at the [[National Museum of Scotland]], where it had been placed on the plinth under a stag skeleton.  It comprised a [[tyrannosaurus rex]] bursting out of a copy of [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]''. Small human figures with weapons were amongst the shredded leaves of the book.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For [https://twitter.com/ntlmuseumsscot @NtlMuseumsScot] A Gift Your friends at @edbookfest suggested you might like this. …. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas and those places that house our treasures……". and "9/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Tenth sculpture===
This sculpture was the eighth in the gift chain, but was the last to be found, on 24 November 2011.  It was found at the [[Writers' Museum]] in Edinburgh, on top of the donations box in the [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] room.  It comprises a moonlit street scene, and is fashioned from a copy of Ian Rankin's second Rebus novel, ''[[Hide and Seek (Ian Rankin novel)|Hide and Seek]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;&lt;ref name=EC/&gt;  It bore the words "commingled out of Good and evil", which is a quote from Stevenson's ''[[Jekyll and Hyde]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "[https://twitter.com/curatoremg @CuratorEMG] A Gift 'The stories are in the stones' Ian Rankin In support of Libraries, Books, Words, Ideas …… and Writers." and "8/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Eleventh sculpture===
Although the artists had said that the series comprised ten sculptures, on 25 November 2011 an eleventh was delivered to the Edinburgh Bookshop, an independent booksellers, addressed to Ian Rankin.

The sculpture comprises two skeletons sitting on a coffin lid; the open coffin is cut out of a (real) old book.  The skeletons are drinking and smoking, and listening to a record on a portable record player. The record sleeve reads "The Impossible Dead/Ian Rankin/Some Secrets Never Die" and the coffin lid reads "R.I.P. 13/10/11".  13 October 2011 was the publishing date of Rankin's novel ''[[The Impossible Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

The note accompanying the sculpture read: "For @Beathhigh A Gift "… something in us never dies" ([[Robert Burns|R. Burns]] 1790) In support of those who turn ideas into words, words into books …… &amp; of course books into libraries." and "11/10".&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

@Beathhigh is Ian Rankin's Twitter account name.

==Reaction==
The sculptures, and the mystery over the identity of their creator, made local, then national and international news.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12&gt;{{cite news|title=Gifted: The Edinburgh Book Sculptures on Tour 2012|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/gifted-edinburgh-book-sculptures-tour-2012|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=31 July 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of December 2012, the identity of the creator has still not been revealed.

The ten Edinburgh sculptures were brought together in December 2011 for a one night private exhibition at the [[Scottish Parliament]].&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt;

The Edinburgh sculptures were sent on a small 'mini tour' of Scotland between 17 August and 8 December 2012, appearing at Aberdeen Central Library, Dundee Central Library, [[Wigtown Book Festival]], Mitchell Library, Glasgow, [[Dunfermline Carnegie Library]] and the Scottish Poetry Library.&lt;ref name=Scotland/&gt; In the book ''giftED''&lt;ref name=Birlinn&gt;{{cite news|title=GiftED II? - The Literary Banksy Strikes Again|url=http://birlinnbooks.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/gifted-ii-literary-banksy-strikes-again.html|work=Birlinn Books|date=16 August 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was published in time for the tour, the sculptor wrote that at the heart of the project was "a woman, who had been a girl, whose life would have been less rich had she been unable to wander freely into libraries, art galleries and museums. A woman who, now all grown, still wants access to these places and yes, wants them for her children...".&lt;ref name=GdnJuly12/&gt; The photographs in the book are by Chris Scott.

In July 2012 it was reported that a documentary about the sculptures, featuring Ian Rankin and [[Rory Bremner]], is being made.&lt;ref name=SPLJuly12/&gt;

After the tour concluded the original ten sculptures were sent back to their original locations with the bespoke plinths made for the exhibition with the intention that they continue to be accessible to the public.

==2012: Flowers==
In August 2012 the sculptor left fifty paper flower sculptures around the site of the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]], each with the [[Oscar Wilde]] quote "… freedom, books, flowers and the moon" and on the reverse "A Gift For You" and a limited edition number of /50.&lt;ref name=Birlinn/&gt;

==2012: Five Book Week Scotland sculptures==
In November 2012 it was announced that the sculptor had been approached via an anonymous email account and had agreed to make five more sculptures that were to be hidden around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, and that the finders would be given another small sculpture as a prize. Online clues to their whereabouts were released, one a day between 26 and 30 November 2012. Each sculpture was found on the day the clue was released; the person to reach it first each day received a paper sculpture trophy in the shape of a teacup, themed on the book and reading "A winning cop and a good book - the perfect combination" on the top.

===First sculpture===
The first was found on 26 November 2012 at [[Glasgow School of Art]]. It is a book sculpture inspired by [[Alasdair Gray]]'s classic novel ''[[Lanark: A Life in Four Books]]''.&lt;ref name=BBCDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=New chapter for mystery book sculptures|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-20466495|work=BBC|date=26 November 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finder's prize was a sculpture of a small teacup with elements of the ''Lanark'' theme.&lt;ref name=SBT&gt;{{cite news|title=Book Sculptures: The Full Set|url=http://www.scottishbooktrust.com/book-sculptures-the-full-set|work=Scottish Book Trust|accessdate=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Lanark'' sculpture is now displayed next to the Glasgow School of Art shop during opening hours.

===Second sculpture===
The second sculpture was found at the [[Robert Burns Birthplace Museum]] in [[Alloway]], and the sculpture was based on the Robert Burns poem "[[Tam o' Shanter (poem)|Tam O' Shanter]]" - which is set in Alloway. The finder's prize was a teacup featuring a horse's tail, a reference to the poem. The sculpture is on display at the Museum.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Third sculpture===
The third sculpture was found at the ''Am Politician'' pub on the [[Eriskay|Isle of Eriskay]], where the nine pupils of the Eriskay Primary School found the sculpture based on the [[Compton Mackenzie]] novel ''[[Whisky Galore (novel)|Whisky Galore]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a bottle labelled 'whisky galore' on the top. The sculpture is on display at the pub.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fourth sculpture===
The fourth sculpture was found at [[J M Barrie]]'s birthplace in [[Kirriemuir]], and was based on ''[[Peter Pan]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a hook-tipped spout.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

===Fifth sculpture===
The fifth sculpture was found at the [[Scottish Seabird Centre]], [[North Berwick]], and was based on [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]’s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. The finder's prize was a teacup with a palm tree on the top.&lt;ref name=SBT/&gt;

==2012: Another gift==
In November 2012 a third sculpture was given to the [[Scottish Poetry Library]], with the instructions that the box in which it was held was not to be opened until 7 December 2012 - the last day of the exhibition of the original ten. Built upon a copy of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s poetry collection [[A Child's Garden of Verses]] it featured a girl sitting under a tree, wearing a crown and reading a book, while the facing page shows Stevenson's poem, "To My Mother".

In the tree are the words, "You in a garden green" and "With me were king and"; on the girl's crown is the word "Queen". On the trunk of the tree are the words, "Were hunter, soldier, tar" and the inside of the small book reads, "And all the thousand things that children are". Some bunting dangling from the tree read "But time, which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind." These are all lines from Stevenson's poem, "To Willie And Henrietta".

The note accompanying the sculpture read: " .... For the Love of Books.   Every ending marks a new beginning."&lt;ref name=SPLDec12&gt;{{cite news|title=Day Seven of the SPL advent calendar - The final book sculpture|url=http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/connect/blog/day-seven-spl-advent-calendar-final-book-sculpture|work=Scottish Poetry Library|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013: Preparing to fly==
In May 2013 a new sculpture was left in the Scottish Poetry library. This comprises three blue paper eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdhouse; the nest is on a platform with threads that allow it to be lifted out - the [https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisdonia/8958718010/ instructions] that came with it say, "Nest can sit at bottom, hang midway or be outside birdbox - it's yours now!" The box has images and text on either side with gold leaf in places.
The eggs are threaded together with slips of paper which read, "Preparing to start", "Sleeping in the woods" and "Life's little things"; the eggs have the words, "nest-egg", "new moon" and "great ovation" stuck to them. The tag reads simply, "Preparing to Fly 1/3  In support of libraries, words, book, ideas ........ x".

In June 2013 [[Leith Library]] received a sculpture of three baby birds in a nest, addressed both to the library itself ([https://twitter.com/leithlibrary @leithlibrary]) and to their Reader in Residence Emily Dodd ([https://twitter.com/auntyemily @auntyemily]), only the second time one of the sculptures has been addressed to a person.  Included with the book sculpture was a quote from A.A.Milne "It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'what about lunch?'.  In support of libraries, books, words, ideas. Preparing to Fly 2/3".

==2014: Butterflies On The Move==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
As part of the Macmillan Art Exhibition called 'Inspired' held in Bonhams, Edinburgh, an intricate work of butterflies emerging from a book was delivered, anonymously. This book sculpture was auctioned to raise funds for this charity{{which?|date=October 2017}}. It was bought by the Mackenzie family{{clarify|date=October 2017}} of Edinburgh, who decided to tour this 'Butterflies' sculpture on a not-for-profit basis so that a wider audience could see it. The idea was that the generosity of the artist and the story should continue to inspire others, especially youngsters and those that had not yet been able to experience the 'book sculpture library tour' in Edinburgh. The Butterflies sculpture visited the following locations: The War Poets library, Edinburgh Napier University; BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay; Killin library, Killin; John Gray Library, East Lothian; Kirkwall library, Orkney; Glasgow Museum's Resource Centre, South Nitshill, Glasgow; Abbotsford House, Borders; Crighton  Library, Dumfries; Aberdeen Central Library, Aberdeen. The sculpture's tour finished in the Scottish Parliament and was commented upon by [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSP]]s and the First Minister. A 'time for reflection' parliamentary speech was given by Dr Colin Mackenzie, thanking the artist for her generosity and inspiration. 

During the tour the artist offered to collaborate with members of the public who sent in their own paper butterflies.

==Interview==
In January 2015 the artist gave an email interview to the BBC, in which she hinted that more sculptures were to come: "What makes you think 'Butterflies' is my most recent sculpture?".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-30697553&lt;/ref&gt;

==The final curtain==

In March 2015 the artist announced that the time had come "to draw time on the project". The last sculpture would be a collaboration with the public. A request was made for the public to make their own butterflies before 31 July 2015. These butterflies would be made into a final sculpture.

== 2016: The Butterfly Tree and Lost Child==
The final paper sculpture was a collaboration with the general public in response to the Butterfly On The Move Tour. Butterflies flew in from all over the world and from all different age groups of contributors. The resulting sculpture was a 6'6' high tree with butterflies as 'leaves'. The tree was supported by a 'lost child'. The sculpture appeared at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August, 2016. A hand illustrated book was left with the sculpture. It tells the fictional story of the Butterfly Tree and how it reached out and comforted the Lost Child.
The artist intends to remain unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">'''Tactile graphics''', including '''tactile pictures''', '''tactile diagrams''', '''tactile maps''', and '''tactile graphs''', are images that use raised surfaces so that a [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] person can feel them. They are used to convey non-textual information such as maps, paintings, graphs and diagrams.

Tactile graphics can be seen as a subset of [[accessible image]]s. Images can be made accessible to the visually impaired in various ways, such as verbal description, sound, or [[haptic perception|haptic]] (tactual) feedback.
One of the most common uses for tactile graphics is the production of tactile maps.

==Tactile maps==
[[File:Disability5 200.jpg|thumb|Paper tactile map]]
The types and forms of tactile maps began with the oldest and most rudimentary or a mixed media format. This tactile map is produced by simply attaching objects to a substrate to represent different items or symbols. More recent tactile maps are produced by computers through different means such as an ink-jet printers.

'''Thermoform''' is one of the most common methods of producing tactile maps. This process is also known as [[vacuum forming]]. Thermoform maps or plans are created from a process where a sheet of plastic is heated and vacuumed on top of a model or master. The master can be made from many substances, although certain materials are more durable than others. Since this process involves creating a mold, it is somewhat time consuming.

'''Swell paper''' has a special coating of heat-reactive chemicals. Microcapsules of alcohol implanted in the paper fracture when exposed to heat and make the surface of the paper inflate. Placing black ink on the paper prior to a heat process provides control over the raised surface areas. This type of map is not as robust as the Thermoform map, but can be produced with less effort and expense.

'''Modified [[Braille embosser]]s''' can also be used to produce tactile paper maps.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Don. et al. 2005. The design and manufacture of tactile maps using an ink-jet process. Journal of Engineering Design. Vol. 16, no. 6. December. pp. 525–544. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink-jet tactile maps''' are made by layering a specially designed ink. Each layer is cured by UV irradiation before the next layer is added. This technology is an offshoot of other industries, such as circuit board manufacturing and biomedical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kafeel., McCallum, Don., &amp; Sheldon, Derek F. 2005. Multiphase Micro-Drop Interaction In Ink-jet Printing of 3D Structures for Tactile Maps. Modern Physics Letters B. Nos. 28&amp;29 pp. 1699–1702. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The substrate for tactile maps is a very important attribute, since different materials can enhance or reduce legibility and durability. Several types of substrates can be used to produce a tactile map. These include rough and smooth plastic, rough and smooth paper, microcapsule paper, Braillon, and aluminum. Many factors should be considered when choosing a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]; these include but are not limited to function, durability, and portability.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactile map variables:''' Just as [[Jacques Bertin]] retinal variables help determine how visual maps are produced; tactile maps have a formula as well. Although researchers have not standardized tactile map variables, these nine are usually included depending on the ''substrate'': vibration, flutter, pressure, temperature, size, shape, texture/grain, orientation, and elevation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, A.L. 2002 Feeling it out : the use of haptic visualization for exploratory geographic visualization. Cartographic Perspectives, 39. pp. 12–29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typical tactile elevations:''' Thermoformed maps usually have an elevation of at least 1mm. Swell Paper averages 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and braille embossers have a range from 0.25–1&amp;nbsp;mm. Ink-jet printers can be controlled to vary elevation as needed. A (2009) study conducted by Sandra Jehoel tested various height levels and estimated that preferred tactile elevations fall between 40 and 80 micrometres depending on the substrate background, shape of the object and smoothness of lines. Symbols such as a triangle, square and a circle should have a minimum base line length of 6.4, 5.0 and 5.5&amp;nbsp;mm respectively for proper recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio tactile maps''' or [[graphic tablet]]s are interactive devices. Electronic tactile talking touch pad instruments use [[Macromedia Flash]] software with audio files to convey information to the blind or visually impaired user. As the user’s finger engages a feature or symbol a recording provides information about the object, symbol or area. For example, the sound of splashing water can be used for areas such as rivers or oceans. This format has great potential for transmitting information over the Internet which can be downloaded to a computer or hand-held device.&lt;ref&gt;Siekierska, Eva., Muller, Anita. 2003. Tactile and Audio-tactile Maps within the Canadian Government On-Line Program. The Cartography Journal. Vol 40, 3. pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A great deal of hardware already exists that can be used by the blind or visually impaired to interact with computer screen graphics. A vibrating mouse or other force feedback devices can be adapted to turn any visual software generated map into a hybrid tactile map. The interactive signal to a device can be varied when crossing a boundary or symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Golledge, Reginald G, Rice Matthew., &amp; Jacobson Denial R. 2005. A Commentary on the use of Touch for Accessing On-Screen Spatial Representations: The Process of Experiencing Haptic Maps and Graphics. The Professional Geographer. 57, 3 pp. 339–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zoom maps''' are a recently developed tactile map. These maps are designed specifically for those who can read braille and have had no previous interaction with tactile maps. The term zoom is comparable to a zoom-able visual [[wikt: raster|raster]] internet map. A country is divided into regions on the first map then the next zoomed map will have a breakdown of the regions and so forth until a city level is reached. These successive maps rely on a dependable texture as the map zoom progresses. This produces a familiarity as one zooms from the proceeding map. This is achieved in many instances with line orientation, area and consistent shape. The Braille text on the map is placed next to a rectangular textured legend for area identification.&lt;ref&gt;Yayla, Lisa. 2009. Huseby Zoom Maps: A design Methodology for Tactile Graphics. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. May. pp. 270–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Angelus''''' (''L'Angélus'') is an [[oil painting]] by French painter [[Jean-François Millet]], completed between 1857 and 1859.

The painting depicts two peasants bowing in a field over a basket of potatoes to say a prayer, the [[Angelus]], that together with the ringing of the bell from the church on the horizon marks the end of a day's work.&lt;ref name="Gamb"/&gt;

Millet was commissioned by the American would-be painter and art collector [[Thomas Gold Appleton]], who never came to collect it. The painting is famous today for driving the prices for artworks of the [[Barbizon school]] up to record amounts in the late 19th century.

==History==
Millet said: "The idea for The Angelus came to me because I remembered that my grandmother, hearing the church bell ringing while we were working in the fields, always made us stop work to say the Angelus prayer for the poor departed".&lt;ref name=musee&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=339 ''L'Angelus'', Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt; Completed between 1857 and 1859, it is an oil painting on canvas. When Appleton failed to take possession, Millet added a steeple and changed the initial title of the work, ''Prayer for the Potato Crop'', to ''The Angelus''.

It depicts two peasants during the potato harvest in [[Barbizon]], with a view of the church tower of [[Chailly-en-Bière]]. At their feet is a small basket of potatoes, and around them a cart and a pitchfork. Various interpretations of the relationship between the two peasants have been made, such as colleagues at work, husband and wife pair, or (as Gambetta interpreted it) farmer and maidservant. An 1889 sales catalogue described them simply as "a young peasant and his companion". Millet sold ''The Angelus'' after his ''[[The Gleaners]]'' was sold at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] in 1857. About half the size, it brought him less than half the amount he sold ''The Gleaners'' for. ''The Angelus'' was eventually shown the year before Millet's death in [[Brussels]] in 1874, where it was greatly admired by [[Léon Gambetta]].&lt;ref name="Gamb"&gt;Foley, Susan.  [http://www.h-france.net/rude/rudevoliv/FoleyVol4.pdf "A Great and Noble Painting": Léon Gambetta and the Visual Arts in the French Third Republic] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF format]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much later, [[Salvador Dalí]] saw a print of this painting in his school and insisted that this was a funeral scene, not a prayer ritual and that the couple were portrayed praying and mourning over their dead infant. Although this was an unpopular view, at his insistence the Louvre X-rayed the painting, showing a small painted-over geometric shape strikingly similar to a coffin by the basket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americamagazine.org/content/all-things/angelus-work Schneider, Nathan. "The Angelus at Work", ''America'', March 24, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; It seems possible that Millet originally painted a burial – perhaps a rural version of Courbet's famous painting ''A Burial at Ornans'' (1850) – but then converted it to a recitation of the Angelus, complete with a visible church bell tower.

==Commentary==
At first, the painting was interpreted as a political statement, with Millet viewed as a socialist in solidarity with the workers.
While the painting expresses a profound sense of religious devotion, and became one of the most widely reproduced religious paintings of the 19th century, with prints displayed by thousands of devout householders across France, Millet painted it from a sense of nostalgia rather than from any strong religious feeling. According to Karine Huguenaud, "There is, however, no religious message to the painting: Millet was simply concerned with portraying a ritualised moment of meditation taking place as the dusk rolls in."&lt;ref name=Huguenaud&gt;[http://www.napoleon.org/en/history-of-the-two-empires/paintings/the-angelus/ Huguenaud, Karine. ''The Angelus'', April 2010, Napoleon.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 Belgian minister Jules Van Praët exchanged it for Millet’s ''Bergère avec son troupeau'' (Shepherd and his flock) and commented dryly, “What can I say? It is clearly a masterpiece, but faced with these two peasants, whose work is interrupted by prayer, everyone thinks they can hear the nearby church bell tolling, and in the end, the constant ringing just became tiresome”.&lt;ref name=Huguenaud/&gt; 

==Provenance==
The painting triggered a rush of patriotic fervour when the Louvre tried to buy it in 1889, and  was vandalized by a madman in 1932.&lt;ref name=musee/&gt; 
 
With reference to the [[Musée d'Orsay]], the provenance of the work is as follows; although (until updated) some events are missing, such as the Brussels show in 1874:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/notice.html?no_cache=1&amp;nnumid=000345&amp;cHash=e2e2221b05 record for nr.

==Legacy==
A month after the Secretan sale, ''The Gleaners'' was sold for 300,000 francs, and the contrast between the auction prices of Millet's paintings on the art market and the value of Millet's estate for his surviving family led to the ''[[droit de suite]]'' ([[French language|French]] for "right to follow"), a French law that compensates artists or their heirs when artworks are resold. 

The imagery of ''The Angelus'' with peasants praying was a popular sentimental 19th-century religious subject.  Generations later, [[Salvador Dalí]] had seen a reproduction of it on the wall of his childhood school and claimed to have been spooked by the painting. He felt the basket looked like the coffin of a child and the woman looked like a [[praying mantis]]. He was inspired to create his [[Paranoiac-critical method|paranoiac-critical]] paintings ''The Architectural Angelus of Millet'' and ''[[Gala Dalí|Gala]] and the Angelus of Millet Preceding the Imminent Arrival of the Conical Anamorphoses'' in 1933. These were followed two years later by a similar pair of paintings which included a partial reproduction of Millet's ''The Angelus'', called ''The Angelus of Gala'' and ''Archaeological Reminiscence of Millet's Angelus''. In 1938, he published a book ''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet''.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Mythe tragique de l'Angélus de Millet'', by Jean-Jacques Pauvert with plates by Salvador Dalí, 1963, {{ISBN|2844854184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Atalantis''''' (full title: ''Secret Memoirs and Manners of Several Persons of Quality, of both Sexes, From The New Atalantis'') was an influential political [[satire]] by [[Delarivier Manley]] published at the start of the 18th century. In it a parallel is drawn between exploitation of females and political deception of the public.

==Sexualising politics==
''The New Atalantis'' appeared in 1709, the first volume in May and the second in October. The novel was initially suppressed on the grounds of its [[scandal]]ous nature and Manley was arrested and tried, but it was immediately popular and went into seven editions over the following decade. As a political satire on the behaviour of prominent members of the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig party]], it won the approval of the [[Tories (British political party)|Tory]] literary faction, among them [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], [[Richard Steele]] and [[Jonathan Swift]]. There is also a reference to its enduring popularity in Alexander Pope's ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'' (Canto III.165).

In the immediate background, and influencing the choice of title, was Sir Francis Bacon's novel ''[[New Atlantis]]'' (1627). In contrast to its altruistic [[Utopian and dystopian fiction|utopianism]], Manley reveals a hypocritical dystopia. There was also Thomas Heyrick's long verse satire, ''The New Atlantis'' (1687), attacking the defence of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] as espoused by the Tory Party during the [[James II of England|Stuart succession crisis]] of a previous reign. In this case the show of virtue by their Whig opponents is revealed as a sham. 

But the work also played its part in the attack on the current political favourite of the Whigs, [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough]], whose wife [[Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough|Sarah]] was an influential attendant on [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Sarah had already served as the target of Manley's earlier satire,''The Secret History of Queen Zarah and the Zarazians'' (1705). Now ''The New Atalantis'' was timed to embarrass the Whig party in the coming parliamentary session and was to help the Tories into power in 1710.&lt;ref&gt;Soňa Nováková&lt;/ref&gt;  The relationship between the queen and Sarah Churchill was damaged as a result.

[[File:Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough by Jervas.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Sarah Churchill, the Whig heroine]]
The story concerns the return to earth of the goddess of Justice, [[Astraea (mythology)|Astrea]], to gather the information about private and public behaviour necessary for the proper moral education of a prince in her charge. Astrea encounters her mother Virtue, dressed in rags and little regarded, and the two benefit from their power of invisibility to make their observations, guided by the earthy Lady Intelligence. Together they encounter a succession of scenes displaying public and personal corruption, broken lives, ruined virgins, orgies, seductions, and rapes. The narrative employs the framing device of a conversation between the three allegorical female narrators, who observe, report and reflect upon the patterns of life on the remote Mediterranean island which is the scene of their investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/secretmemoirsman00manl#page/n5/mode/2up Archived online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reader's sexual titillation is assisted by the amassing of sensual details in an atmosphere of luxurious accessories, perfumed in the sub-tropical heat, as in the description of the bedroom of Germanicus. Through the windows the scent of jasmine “blew in with a gentle fragrancy. Tuberoses set in pretty gilt and china pots were placed advantageously upon stands; the curtains of the bed drawn back to the canopy, made of yellow velvet, embroidered with white bugles the panels of the chamber looking-glass. Upon the bed were strewed, with a lavish profuseness, plenty of orange and lemon flowers. And to complete the scene, the young Germanicus in a dress and posture not very decent to describe” beguiled the sight of the Duchess who enters and joins him on the bed.

A feminist critic observes that one aspect of the satire addresses the invisibility of women in the masculine world of politics and their consequent ability to influence situations through the power of gossip. The author is thus commenting on her own procedures in order to underline the points she makes. A parallel is also implied in the novel between seduction of the helpless in the sexual arena and deception of the public in the political sphere. Feminine marginalisation is made the image of the general public's political marginalisation.&lt;ref&gt;Soňa Nováková&lt;/ref&gt;  

Supposed details of the author's personal history appeared integrated in the Atalantic world with the story of "Delia" in Volume two, and this was followed up by her autobiographical ''Adventures of Rivella'' (1714). Two volumes published in 1710, ''The Memoirs of Europe'', were (in the early 18th century) often referred to as volumes three and four of the ''Atalantis'', although they did not share the fictional setting.

'''''The Tuner''''' ({{lang-ru|Настройщик}}, ''Nastroyshchik'') is a 2004 [[Ukraine]]/[[Russia]] mix film of art house grotesque and a sting comedy. At the heart of [[Kira Muratova]]’s film is her characteristic and enduring love of predation—predation for its own sake. The film offers a complex assessment of the human subject, civilization, and the creative act. It premiered at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in September 2004.

The stars of the film include famous Russian actors such as [[Alla Demidova]], [[Renata Litvinova]], [[Nina Ruslanova]], and [[Georgi Deliyev]]. Directed by [[Kira Muratova]], author of sixteen films over forty-two years, best known in the West for her political rehabilitation during the perestroika period and the un-shelving of her so-called provincial melodramas, ''Brief Encounters'' (Korotkie vstrechi, 1967/1987) and ''Long Farewells'' (Dolgie provody, 1971/1987).

==Plot summary==
A former nurse, Liuba, seeking marriage through newspaper personal ads, is bilked by a stranger whom she mistakes for her new date.  Liuba’s elderly, well-to-do girlfriend, Anna Sergeevna is defrauded in a different fashion: having placed a newspaper ad for a piano tuner, she is entrapped by Andrei, who is not only an excellent tuner and musician, but also a reasonably good petty thief and scam artist.  Andrei and his current lover, Lina, attempting to further secure the women’s trust by returning Liuba’s money, which had been scammed yet again by a second potential husband cum con-artist, place their own fake personal ad in a newspaper so as to locate the suspect.  Having returned Liuba’s stolen money, Andrei finally swindles both Liuba and Anna Sergeevna through an elaborate bank forgery scheme—in a word, a portrait of normal human nature à la Muratova.

==Awards==
* [[Nika Award]] 2004 for best actress [[Alla Demidova]], best director [[Kira Muratova]] and best Supporting Actress [[Nina Ruslanova]]

'''Touchstone Theatre''' is a professional theatre company in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], founded in 1976 by a group of [[University of British Columbia]] theatre graduates. Touchstone's focus is on the development and production of Canadian works.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touchstonetheatre.com/mandate-history/ |title=Company History|date= |publisher=Touchstone Theatre |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Artistic Director is [[Katrina Dunn]], who has served in that position since 1997.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canadiantheatre.com/dict.pl?term=Touchstone%20Theatre |title=Touchstone Theatre |date=  |publisher= Canadian Theatre Encyclopedia |accessdate=2011-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Artistic Directors are Ian Fenwick, Gordon McCall, John Cooper and Roy Surette.&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheatreBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrebc.org/press/newsletr/fall2005.pdf |title=Significant Anniversary Seasons! |date=Fall 2005 |publisher= Theatre BC|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Touchstone Theatre's stated mandate is that it "''develops and presents professional theatrical productions. We explore the contemporary Canadian play through content and form. We stimulate public interest in Canadian cultural perspectives.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=touchstonetheatre.com/mandate-history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NextStage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thenextstage.wordpress.com/2008/02/29/this-one-goes-to-eleven-katrina-dunn/ |title=This One Goes to Eleven: Katrina Dunn |date= 2008-02-29 |publisher= The Next Stage |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fulfillment of its mandate, much of Touchstone's activities have fallen into one of three categories: it mounts premiere productions of plays by British Columbian playwrights; it mounts second productions of important plays that premiered in other areas of Canada; and it produces works developed within the company. Touchstone has helped launch and develop the careers of numerous playwrights and actors. Touchstone, with the Playwrights Theatre Centre, also fosters the creation of new works through its "Flying Start" initiative (previously the "Playwright in Residence" program).&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt; Under the program, Touchstone spends two years working with a playwright to develop a play through workshops and [[dramaturgy]] to production.&lt;ref name="NextStage"/&gt;

Since 2011, in partnership with the [[Arts Club Theatre Company]], Touchstone produces the "In Tune Conference", which supports new Canadian musicals in a national event which takes place every two years.

==History==

As of its 40th anniversary in the 2015-2016 season, Touchstone will have produced 36 World Premiers and works by 42 Canadian playwrights. Touchstone has helped launch and develop the careers of numerous playwrights and actors.

At the start of the 1997-1998 season, Katrina Dunn succeeded Roy Surette as Artistic Director. Dunn created the "Playwright in Residence" program, which has resulted in many plays, including [[Kevin Kerr (actor)|Kevin Kerr]]'s [[Governor General's Awards]]-winning ''Unity (1918)''.  In 2010, the Touchstone program focussed on female Canadian playwrights.&lt;ref name="GeorgiaStraight"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/article-330069/vancouver/touchstone-theatres-katrina-dunn-feted-being-femalefriendly |title=Touchstone Theatre's Katrina Dunn feted for being female-friendly |date=2010-06-21 |publisher=[[The Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Touchstone partnered with Rumble Productions to found the [[PuSh International Performing Arts Festival]], a [[performing arts]] festival held every January in Vancouver, BC.&lt;ref name=TouchstoneHistory/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cdn Theatre Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pushfestival.ca/about-the-festival/about-the-festival/ |title=PuSh - About the Festival |date= |publisher=PuSh Festival |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While deploying site specific collaborative art practice of allowing more than 1000 employees of the office building, to participate in the experience of painting in the initial phase, the artist conceptualised the creation as a public art project.&lt;ref name=TOI&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-13/people/28308156_1_paint-mural-employees&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ht&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/artandculture/Three-fold-story/Article1-490407.aspx{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menhem|first1=Chantal|title=Art and The Ancient Secrets of the Tree of Life|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/art-and-the-ancient-secrets-of-the-tree-of-life/|publisher=Mozaico|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation of methodology==
The methodology of creation was the first-of-its-kind simultaneous use of four different art practices engaging in conceptual, site specific, collaborative, and performance art.  Gupta allowed  the 3500 employees at the site, the experience of putting their brush strokes, while on their job, in the initial half of the project. As a part of his performance art, he executed a series of roles while teaching and motivating employees. At the same time, the artist engaged the employees in his practice of team-building exercise through art while creating a five floor high artwork.
                                                    
In the second half of the project, the colours and strokes were taken as raw stock for creating the composition. He proceeded with the three-month [[performance art]] alone; live in front of 3500 employees and almost as many visitors at the site (the campus) to evolve a storyline. Keeping in mind the visibility of the staircase all over the campus through a 60&amp;nbsp;ft high glass facade, the site specific intervention amalgamated the background wall and the front face of the staircase perspectives of five floors into a single canvas merging surrounding sides and roof within one composition.

==Performance art marathon==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Performance art marathon by Manav Gupta.jpg|thumb|Performance art marathon by Manav Gupta]] --&gt;
The other notable feature of the invention was a marathon performance by the artist working non stop on his creation for three months except for few hours of rest and sleep at night.

==Concept ==

When commissioned by [[Bharti Airtel]] Ltd to create a “staircase artwork”  at their headquarters, the artist brought forth his idea born out of a decade and a half practice of public art projects to a radical reorientation towards introducing a unique sustainable development process in [[corporate]] entity, thus establishing that the art can contribute to the business environment as well, by refreshing the intangible quality of its soft power among employees.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== The evolving storyline==
A philosophical perspective was highlighted in the artist's statement while addressing the translation of his sustainable development ideology in his site specific intervention. 
{{cquote|As an artist my endeavor was to bring in the spirituality of higher consciousness within a business environment. Hence the ''burgeoning'' Tree of Life spreads growth and vibrancy in the ever evolving '''''five elements of [[nature]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mittal-unveils-5storey-high-mural-at-airtel-centre/650710/&lt;/ref&gt; Each element depicted on respective floor beginning from earth to water to air, space and fire mingle with one another to create symbolism of an ever growing state of energy in the [[universe]].
The compositions on each floor symbolize the evolving human needs that bind and grow into the next higher stage of consciousness.
Beginning with sustenance and fun depicted on the second floor, to love and bonding, [[Festival|celebration]] and [[procreation]] on the third floor represented by the [[Adam and Eve]] formed out of the intertwined branches, the peacock and the non limiting horizon of the sea behind. It then grows to higher needs as the floors progress upwards into the signature umbilical cords of human existence on the fourth floor from where it rises to the “gaze” a reflection of one‘s introspection on the fifth level - the window to the soul and only then the larger cosmic “glow” emanating from the sixth floor sinks in to drive home the awareness that one begins to have with the experience of life itself.
I see the organization as a symbolism of the above.
Hence the creation shaped from an ever evolving stage where I let the employees experience [[color]] and form and learn the [[joy]] of creation while I absorbed what the organization stood for through its employees by letting them paint and pour on my canvas.
I then transformed  all multifarious hues, shapes, colors and idioms into a composite [[mega (prefix)|mega]] [[canvas]] that spoke one language as a work of [[art]] for me to create the above story-line. }}

An '''unsigned artist''', '''unsigned band''' or '''independent artist''' is a [[musician]] or [[musical group]] not under a [[contract]] with a [[record label]]. The terms are used in the [[music industry]] as a [[marketing]] technique. Bands that release their own material on self-published CDs can also be considered unsigned bands. Often unsigned bands primarily exist to perform at concerts.

In more recent years, the Internet has helped promote the music of unsigned bands. Artists often post their music as [[MP3]]s on websites such as [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], [[Myspace]], [[PureVolume]], [[GarageBand.com]] and [[SoundClick]].

In 2016, the [[Unsigned Music Awards]] was established in the UK as the first ever televised international awards ceremony to champion artists without the backing of a record label.

UK unsigned bands and musicians are able to use such services as [[The Unsigned Guide]] and to gather music industry contact names, phone numbers, websites and social media links, as well as information on how to get signed or market music independently.

Song pitching websites, such as [[TAXI (A&amp;R)|TAXI]] allow unsigned musicians to see which record labels (and other music companies) are currently seeking new music.

Further, companies like [[Sentric Music]] and the royalty payment service offered by [[Last.fm]] can help in generating income streams for unsigned bands.

==History and current scene==
Many unsigned artists used to sell their music and music-related merchandise without the financial support of a record label, while often seeking a recording contract through the recording of [[Demo (music)|demo]]s. Recently, the Internet has helped promote independent artistic material. Artists tend to post their music on websites such as [[MySpace]], and [[ILike]], and sometimes have their music played on podcast shows like [[Kooba Radio]].  In recent times, artists such as [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Radiohead]], who once had major label record deals, have started to release their music independently.

Various musicians remain independent in their beginning of their music career but later on get a [[record deal]] and continue as a signed musician.  But this concept changed when major artists such as [[The Eagles]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]] became independent and parted their ways with record labels such as [[Interscope]].

Many services are offered to independent musicians like [[Cdbaby]], [[Feiyr]], [[Nimbit]] and [[Tunecore]] by which the artists can retain the copyrights of their songs and also deliver their music to various stores including [[iTunes Store]], [[Amazon MP3]], [[Napster]], [[Spotify]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;

== Internet promotion ==

Internet promotion has been the key for some bands for getting popular. Bands like the [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Owl City]], and solo artists like [[Lily Allen]] have gained popularity through Myspace, although the [[Arctic Monkeys]] did not even know what MySpace was, and claimed that fans made it for them.

Unsigned bands have become more popular with Internet users and have been able to break into the mainstream charts. They are now finding many resources across the Internet to promote, market, and sell their music almost free of charge.

Unsigned charts are now being promoted on almost all the underground music sites and has seen many of the domain owners spending large amounts of money on developing these charts to bring bands to them. A number of these are now additionally registered with the [[top 40|official charts]].

Blog sites have become popular, as they regularly feature reviews or interviews with unsigned artists. Other blog sites have offered helpful guidance and resources for new unsigned artists. Similar to bloggers, music curators including podcasts, DJs, and Youtube channels are all dedicated to finding quality new songs from unsigned artists for online audiences to discover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pushpowerpromo.com/submit-music-to-these-places|title=Submit Music To These Places {{!}} Push Power Promo|website=www.pushpowerpromo.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music promotion site, Feature.fm, has emerged to allow artists to promote their music natively directly inside music streaming services.

==Record labels==
Major record company [[Universal Music]] entered into a joint venture with Tunecore to distribute albums online on major stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/07/universaltunecore-deal-opens-major-doors-for-indie-artists.ars|title=Universal/TuneCore deal opens major doors for indie artists|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The record labels which entered into venture are [[Interscope]](Interscope Digital Distribution), [[Universal Motown]] (Unimo Digital Distribution), [[Island Def Jam]] (IDJ FirstLook) and [[Universal Republic]] (Republic Digital Distribution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://musiciancoaching.com/music-business/digital-distribution-music-2/|title=Digital music distribution {{!}} Music Consultant|website=musiciancoaching.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Island Def Jam Music Group partnered with Tunecore to launch IDJ Firstlook, a new web portal that provides unsigned artists with potential access to such coveted major label services as worldwide distribution and marketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/66788/idj-firstlook-debuts|title=IDJ FirstLook Debuts|work=All Access|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent vanity record labels===
Artists can also create their own record labels and sell their music under the label's imprint as well. Services such as [[Nimbit]] gives facilities for independent musicians to release their music independently as well as under a record label create by artist itself. Other efforts made in this field include [[Magnatune]], an independent record label based in [[Berkeley, California]], [[United States]].

== Notable unsigned artists ==
Notable artists who have never been signed to a record label include [[Chance the Rapper]], [[Noname (rapper)]] and [[David Choi]].

'''Yazılıkaya''' ([[Turkish language|Turkish]]; ''inscribed rock'') was a sanctuary of [[Hattusa]], the capital city of the [[Hittite Empire]], today in the [[Çorum Province]], [[Turkey]].  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]], and these are generally regarded as the most important group. 
[[File:Yazilikaya B Thudalija.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rock carving in Chamber B depicting god Sharruma and King Tudhaliya dated to around 1250 - 1220 BC.]]

This was a holy site for the [[Hittites]], located within walking distance of the gates of the city of [[Hattusa]]. It had two main chambers formed inside a group of rock outcrops. Access to the roofless chambers were controlled by gateway and building structures built right in front of them, however only the foundations of those structures survived today. Most impressive today are the [[rock relief]]s of Chambers A and B portraying the gods of the Hittite pantheon. One of the uses of the sanctuary may have involved the New Year's celebrations ceremonies. It was in use at least since late 16th century BCE, but most of the rock carvings date to the reign of the Hittite kings [[Tudhaliya IV]] and [[Suppiluliuma II]] in the late 13th century BCE, when the site underwent a significant restoration.
[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Chamber B relief with the twelve gods of the underworld.]]

The most impressive is Chamber A, which contains rock-cut relief of 64 deities in procession. The left wall shows a procession of male deities, wearing the traditional kilts, pointed shoes and horned hats. Mountain gods are also shown with scaled skirts to symbolise the rocky mountains. The right wall shows a procession of female deities wearing crowns and long skirts. The only exception to this divide is the goddess of love and war, [[Shaushka]] (Mesopotamian goddess [[Ishtar]]/[[Inanna]]) who is shown on the male procession with two female attendants. This is likely to be because of her male attributes as the goddess of war. The processions lead to a central scene of the supreme couple of the pantheon: the storm-god [[Teshub]] and the sun-goddess [[Hebat]]. Teshub stands on two mountain gods whilst Hebat stands on a panther. Behind Hebat are shown their son [[Sharruma]], daughter [[Alanzu]] and a granddaughter.

The smaller and narrower Chamber B has fewer but larger and better preserved reliefs. It may have served as a mortuary mausoleum or memorial for the Hittite king Tudhaliya IV.

It is intriguing to note how the Hittite practise of assimilating other cultures' gods into their own pantheon is in evidence at Yazilikaya. The Mesopotamian god of wisdom, Ea ([[Enki]]) is shown in the male procession and the god Teshub was a [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] god who was syncretized with the Hittite storm-god. Hebat's original consort was changed into her and Teshub's son (Sharruma) and she was later syncretized with the Hattic sun-goddess of [[Arinna]]. It is believed that the wife of the Hittite king Hattusili III, [[Puduhepa]], who was the daughter of a Hurrian priestess, also played a role in the increasing Hurrian influence on Hittite cult.
