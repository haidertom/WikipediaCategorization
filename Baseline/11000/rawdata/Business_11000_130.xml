The '''2007 Chinese slave scandal''' ({{zh|s=山西黑砖窑案|t=山西黑磚窯案|p=Shānxī Hēi Zhuān Yáo àn|l=Shanxi Black Brick Kiln incident}}) was a series of [[forced labour]] cases in [[Shanxi]], China. Thousands of [[Chinese people]] including many children had been forced to work as [[slave]]s in illegal [[brickyard]]s, and were tortured by the owners of the brickyards. As of June 2007, approximately 550 people have been rescued from such situations.

==Background==
Shanxi is located in the [[Loess Plateau]] in northern China which is known for its rich [[clay]] deposits which are easier and cheaper to mine than coal. Through corrupt relationships with officials, slave "bosses" opened illegal brickyards. Due to a scarcity of labor in Shanxi, some factories outsourced production to middlemen who recruited workers from other provinces, making huge profits for the bosses. For example, in one notorious case, it was reported that Wang Bingbing, the son of Wang Dongyi, a secretary of a local CCP branch, was the owner of a brickyard located in [[Hongdong]] County, [[Linfen]].&lt;ref name="brickyard" /&gt; The owner outsourced the brickyard to Heng Tinghan, who was from [[Henan]]. The brickyard produces 10,000 bricks per day. The market price for 10,000 bricks is about 2,000 to 3,000 [[Renminbi|yuan]]; the owner, however, paid only 360 yuan to Heng per 10,000 bricks produced.  Wang Bingbing and Heng Tinghan, along with three other employees, including Heng's son, were later charged with a variety of crimes including murder, illegal detention, and forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/asia/article2607405.ece|title = Brickyard slavery trial opens in China|last = |first = |date = July 5, 2007|work = The Times Asia|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of illegal brickyards was first reported to authorities in 1998. On 1 May, Chen Jianjiao, a representative of the Shanxi People's Congress, received a telephone call from a laborer who had escaped from an illegal brickyard. The escaped man also wrote to the chairman of the Shanxi People's Congress. As a result, slave rescue operations were carried out by provincial government authorities without notifying local officials. Over 150 slaves, three of them child laborers, were freed from these illegal brickyards.  Chen Jianjiao himself was responsible for helping to free hundreds of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://english.cri.cn/2946/2007/06/21/198@240690.htm|title = China Strikes at Root of Brick Kiln Slavery Scandal|last = |first = |date = 2007-06-21|work = CRI English|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been continuing reports of cruelty committed at these illegal brickyards since 2004. On 7 May 2007, Henan TV Metro Channel reported the case of five minors around sixteen years old who had disappeared from the environs of [[Zhengzhou]] Railway Station. Having heard of earlier instances of [[child labor]]ers being kidnapped for brickyards in Shanxi, their parents suspected their children might be found there. Two months later these five were among fifty minors from Henan who were found at an illegal brickyard. [[Human traffickers]] had sold them to brickyards for 500 Yuan each.  Later in 2011, it was found that the practice had not abated, as disabled men in Zhengzhou were still being kidnapped and forced to labor in the brickyards.  The scandal was only uncovered following an undercover investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://world.time.com/2011/09/08/another-slavery-scandal-uncovered-in-central-china/|title = Another Slavery Scandal Uncovered in Central China|last = Ramzy|first = Austin|date = Sep 8, 2011|work = Time Magazine Online|accessdate = 2014-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May, reporters from Henan Television, accompanied by two parents, visited the sites of some illegal brickyards in Shanxi undercover. Reporters later visited many illegal brickyards in [[Yuncheng, Shanxi|Yuncheng]] and [[Jincheng]]. The conditions they found were clearly those of slavery.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Concealed camera revealed that the local police refused to take action to rescue the slaves. Later the reporters were allowed into the illegal brickyards with the company of the local police. Concealed camera showed the police keeping them from rescuing children who were not from Henan which showed obvious local government protection for the illegal brickyards.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ykc6wr2y4Ug&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working conditions==
The brickyard owners had purchased laborers from human traffickers to use as slaves. Many of the slaves were sold for CNY300 to CNY400 including delivery. The slaves included children as young as eight years old&lt;ref name="mac"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minesandcommunities.org/article.php?a=7315|title=Mines and Communities: From bloodstained mine-shafts to brickyard slavery, blind faith in Deng Xiaoping theory is the real|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and teenagers. Moreover, brickyard owners hired guards and [[wolfdog]]s to watch their slaves. These slaves were forced to work over sixteen hours every day and any mistakes were punished by brutal torture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tiger Head, Snake Tails: China today, how it got there and why it has to change|last = Fenby|first = Jonathan|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster UK|year = 2012|isbn = 0857200887|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teenager who was rescued from an illegal brickyard said that, during his slavery, he had been taken to another brickyard by his boss to watch another slave being fed to a meat grinder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigation==
As the scandal received immediate media attention, it also caught the eyes of the country's major leaders, including President [[Hu Jintao]] and Premier [[Wen Jiabao]]. Governor [[Yu Youjun]] of Shanxi province offered an unprecedented self-criticism, took responsibility, and tendered his resignation on 30 August. He was replaced by [[Meng Xuenong]], an official who had been sacked as Beijing mayor after the SARS outbreak.&lt;ref name="scmp1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chow Chung-yan| title=Official sacked over Sars fiasco vows to do better in Shanxi| journal=South China Morning Post| date=5 September 2007| pages=A01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2007, 570 people in [[Shanxi]] and [[Henan]] were freed by the Chinese government.&lt;ref name="brickyard"&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Convictions in China slave trial |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6902459.stm |work= |publisher=BBC |date=17 July 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of those rescued, sixty-nine of them were children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zhu |last=Zhe |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=More than 460 rescued from brickyard slavery |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/15/content_894802.htm |work= |publisher=''China Daily'' |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=4 January 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080107111729/http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-06/15/content_894802.htm| archivedate= 7 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, the Chinese government assembled a force of 35,000 police to check northern Chinese brickyards for slaves, sent dozens of brickyard supervisors to prison, punished ninety-five low level officials in Shanxi province for dereliction of duty, and sacked twenty-four. One brickyard foreman, Heng Tinghan, was sentenced to life in prison, and an employee of his, Zhao Tanbing, earned the death penalty for killing a mentally handicapped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missionandjustice.org/china-strikes-back-at-brickyard-slavery-china-workers/|title=Mission &amp; Justice - Blog Archive - China strikes back at brickyard slavery|accessdate=20 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; slave.&lt;ref name="brickyard"/&gt;  However, no senior officials were held accountable.&lt;ref name="mac" /&gt;

A group of lawyers from Guangdong created the "Blue Ribbon Campaign" on the internet to promote awareness of the situation of children who are kidnapped and taken to these brickyards.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Wider practice of slavery in China==
Although over 500 slaves were rescued in 2007, the practice has never been stopped. In May 2012, 8 people aged between 12 and 22 were reported as missing, with 6 missing within the previous 12 months near Xinyun Cold Storage, Jincheng Town, Yunnan Province. Seven of the eight families reported their missing children to the police. The police only responded to one report and went to inspect the site once. The 8 missing are suspected to have been sold to illegal brickyards.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Abraham Asscher''' (19 September 1880 – 2 May 1950) was a [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] businessman from Amsterdam, a politician, and a leader of his community who attained notoriety for his role during the [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)#German occupation|German occupation of the Netherlands]] (1940–1945).

==Early career==
Asscher’s grandfather founded the Asscher Diamond Company (now the [[Royal Asscher Diamond Company]]) in 1854, but it was Abraham and his brother Joseph who built its international fame. In 1907 the brothers opened a new factory at 127 Tolstraat in Amsterdam and soon they received a request from King [[Edward VII of Great Britain]] to cleave the legendary [[Cullinan Diamond]], the largest rough gem-quality diamond ever found.

==Public service==
Asscher translated his growing success in business into political and community involvement. In 1917, he took up a seat on the Provincial Council of North Holland for the ''[[Liberale Staatspartij]]'' (Liberal State Party). And in the 1930s, he became a leader and spokesman of the Dutch Jewish community. He served as the President of the nation’s central Jewish organization, the ''Nederlandsch-Israëlitsch Kerkgenootschap'' (Dutch Jewish Congregation).

Therefore, when in 1933 Jewish refugees began to flee in numbers to the Netherlands from the Nazi regime in Germany, it was Asscher, along with Professor {{Ill|David Cohen (historian)|lt=David Cohen|nl|David Cohen}}, who established (with government cooperation) the ''{{Ill|Comité voor Bijzondere Joodsche Belangen|nl}}'' (Committee for Special Jewish Affairs - CBJB). An offshoot of the CBJB, the ''Comité voor Joodsche Vluchtelingen'' ([[Committee for Jewish Refugees (Netherlands)|Committee for Jewish Refugees]] - CJV), was formed to provide direct service to the refugees. The CJV provided advice and, as needed, financial support to the refugees, and worked to facilitate the emigration of refugees away from continental Europe. David Cohen was the chair of the CJV for most of its eight years of existence. Both of these committees were dissolved by Germany in 1941, and their responsibilities transferred to a Jewish Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dan |last=Michman |title=The Committee for Jewish Refugees in Holland, 1933-1940 |work=Yad Vashem Studies |volume=XIV |location=Jerusalem |date=1981 |pages=205–232}} No online access.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Jewish Council==
It was in this context (see [[Netherlands in World War II]]) that the Nazi occupiers later, on February 12, 1941, ordered Asscher and Cohen to head up a new {{Interlanguage link multi|Joodse Raad voor Amsterdam|nl|Joodse Raad voor Amsterdam|de|Judenrat Amsterdam}}; the only example of a [[Judenrat|Jewish Council]] in the German occupations of Western Europe. The first meeting was held at the Asscher Brothers headquarters in Tolstraat. The ''Joodse Raad'' had to mediate the occupation government’s orders to the Dutch Jewish community and, beginning in July 1942, to help organize the selection of Jewish deportees from the Netherlands to the work camps.

In September 1943, most of the remaining staff of the ''Joodse Raad'', including Asscher were deported. Asscher, like most deported Dutch Jews, initially went to the [[Westerbork transit camp|Westerbork]] camp in the Drenthe province in the east of the country. From there, the Nazis transported him to [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] concentration camp.

==Postwar==
Asscher survived his imprisonment at Bergen-Belsen and returned to Amsterdam after the conclusion of the war. Aside from historian {{Interlanguage link multi|David Cohen (historian)|nl|David Cohen|de|David Cohen (Historiker)|lt=David Cohen}}, who also survived [[Theresienstadt]] concentration camp, all other members of the Jewish Council perished, including the Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam [[Lodewijk Sarlouis]].  The Dutch government instituted investigations against Asscher and his colleague David Cohen into charges of collaboration. A ''Joodsche Eereraad'' (Jewish Council of Honor or Community Tribunal) was also established to investigate wartime collaboration charges on behalf of the Jewish community. It was particularly concerned with activity after August 15, 1942; a point from which, according to the accusers' post-war perspective, it was considered obvious that the ''Joodse Raad'' was assisting in a mass-murder of Dutch Jews in German-occupied Poland’s Nazi extermination camps.  However, what was obvious to either Jews or non-Jews in the Netherlands at the time is a matter of considerable historical controversy. The Nazi occupiers went to great lengths to conceal the fate of deported Jews from the Dutch population, including Dutch Jews and the Joodse Raad.

In 1947 the Council of Honor ruled to exclude Asscher and Cohen from ever holding public office in the Dutch Jewish Community. By then, Asscher—deeply wounded by what he saw as unjust charges leveled against him—had left the Community. When Asscher died in 1950 in accordance with his wishes he was not buried in a Jewish cemetery, but instead at the [[Zorgvlied (cemetery)|Zorgvlied cemetery]].  However, in the same year, due to constant protests and appeals, the Jewish community tribunal after reconsidering the charges reversed and annulled its decree to exclude both Asscher and Cohen from official posts in the Jewish community, exonerating them completely.  The Dutch government, taking its cue from the Jewish community, dropped all charges of its own the year following.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibid., p. 270, also Jozeph Michman, "The Controversy Surrounding the Jewish Council of Amsterdam," in ''Patterns of Jewish Leadership in Nazi Europe, 1933-1945''; Proceedings of the Third Yad Vashem International Historical Conference, edited by Y. Gutman and C. J. Haft, (Jerusalem, 1979), pp. 235-258, summarized in Idem, "Asscher, Abraham," in ''The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust'', edited by Yisrael Gutman (New York: Macmillan, 1990), Vol. 1: pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt;  Abraham Asscher has been officially exonerated of all charges, even if it came too late for him to know about it.

==Legacy==
The actions of Asscher and the ''Joodse Raad'' during the German occupation were and are a controversial topic. Hans Knoop, in his history of the ''Joodse Raad'', came to this conclusion:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“They issued deportation notices and urged the Jews in ''Het Joodsche Weekblad'' to obey these summons to the letter…Cohen declared after the war that ‘thanks to our efforts no Jew suffered from hunger in occupied Holland.’ That is the case. But thanks to Asscher and Cohen the deportation of the Jews in the Netherlands achieved a greater measure of perfection and efficiency than anywhere else in occupied Europe.”&lt;ref&gt;As quoted in: {{cite book |last1=Dwork |first1=Deborah |first2=Robert-Jan |last2=van Pelt |chapter=The Netherlands |editor1-last=Wyman |editor1-first=David S. |title=The World Reacts to the Holocaust |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |date=1996 |page=59 |isbn=9780801849695 |oclc=34514061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Of course, such accusations benefit from a hindsight that the leaders of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands did not have.  [[Jacob Presser]]’s groundbreaking history of the Holocaust in the Netherlands, ''Ondergang'' (lit. ''Destruction''; published in English as ''The Destruction of Dutch Jews'', or ''Ashes in the Wind: The Destruction of Dutch Jews''), also criticized Asscher and Cohen, while balancing this with a defense of their good intentions and courageous attempts within the realities of their own perceived situation, to lessen Nazi measures. Presser stated firmly that: "No one has accused the two Presidents and the Jewish Council" of being collaborators in the strict sense of being "corrupt and immoral willing tools" of the Nazis, much less as partisans for them, as were the Dutch Nazis, Quislings, Petains and Francos, but the accusations after the war rather were about the degree to which they as victims had naively or mistakenly, despite their best efforts to preserve as much as they could, conceded too much to Nazi pressures to collect together and help to transport the Jewish community to unknown destinations in "the East."&lt;ref&gt;Presser, p. 271; for a strong criticism of Presser's account of the Jewish leaders as conceding too much to their critics and not putting enough weight on the leaders' courageous attempts to resist Nazi measures, see the review of Presser's book by Henriette Boas in ''Commentary Magazine'', January, 1970.  Also see Dwork and Van Pelt, pp. 62-64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Presser, acknowledging that they sought to preserve as many as possible of the Jewish community by haggling numbers deported down as far as possible, even adds,"The Jewish Council played for time.  Was that wrong?  ... Even the most unselfish people would surely have hesitated to shelter and hide Jews if they had known that their self-sacrifice would drag out over so many long years.  And it has been said that had the war in fact ended in 1942 the Jewish community would have built a monument to Asscher and Cohen, as the brave and resourceful leaders by whose hands Dutch Jewry was saved."&lt;ref&gt;Presser, pp. 272-273.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leni Yahil]], in her ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry'', writes sympathetically of them: "While Visser's opposition to cooperation [of any kind whatsoever] with the Germans bespoke a political orientation," (he had led a rival Jewish "Coordination Committee" that the Nazis had disbanded, which had urged that the Jewish community resist any cooperation with the Nazis and only address itself to the Dutch government, which, according to Yahil "ignored the fact that the heads of the Dutch administration were now carrying out orders issued by the Germans"), "Asscher and especially Cohen invoked the humanitarian principle and believed it was necessary to negotiate with the Germans in order to mitigate the suffering of the Jews through intercession on their behalf.  Thus, they essentially held to the approach that had been employed prior to the war to obtain aid for the refugees, except that now they were tending to the Jewish community as a whole."  &lt;ref&gt;[[Leni Yahil]], ''The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 227; Yahil has clarified further, in her "Methods of Persecution: A Comparison of the 'Final Solution' in Holland and Denmark," ''Scripta Hiereosolymtana'' (Jerusalem) 23 (1972), 279-300, the restraints and real pressures limiting the options of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, the company that Asscher and his brother had brought to international fame and prominence was awarded the Royal title by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands; it is now known as ''Koninklijke Asscher Diamant Maatschappij'' (Royal Asscher Diamond Company). Abraham’s grandson, Edward Asscher, is the current President of the Company.
His great-grandson [[Lodewijk Asscher]] is the current Dutch Minister of Social Affairs and Employment.

'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of land and breeding of [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s to provide [[food]], [[fiber]], [[medicinal plants]] and other products to sustain and enhance life.&lt;ref name="Office1999"&gt;{{cite book |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |page=77 |accessdate=13 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722061757/http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all |quote=defined agriculture as 'all forms of activities connected with growing, harvesting and primary processing of all types of crops, with the breeding, raising and caring for animals, and with tending gardens and nurseries'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that enabled people to live in cities. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years; people gathered wild grains at least 105,000 years ago and began to plant them around 11,500 years ago before they became domesticated. Pigs, sheep, and cattle were domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Crops originate from at least 11 regions of the world. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has in the past century come to dominate agricultural output, though about 2 billion people worldwide still depend on [[subsistence agriculture]].

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological and environmental  damage. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and environmental damage through contributions to [[global warming]], depletion of [[aquifer]]s, [[deforestation]], [[antibiotic resistance]], and [[growth hormone]]s in [[industrial meat production|industrially produced meat]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are widely used, although they are banned in several countries.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s (such as [[natural rubber|rubber]]). Classes of foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]], [[milk]], [[edible mushroom|fungi]] and [[eggs as food|eggs]]. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the number of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and scope==

The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', "field", which in its turn came from [[Greek language|Greek]] αγρός, and ''cultūra'', "[[Tillage|cultivation]]" or "growing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=14 |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories |editor=Chantrell, Glynnis |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-19-863121-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=36 |pages=563–595 |date=December 2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |author1=Mueller, Ulrich G. |author2=Gerardo, Nicole M. |author3=Aanen, Duur K. |author4=Six, Diana L. |author5=Schultz, Ted R. |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to "produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services".&lt;ref name=Maine /&gt; Thus defined, it includes [[arable farming]], [[horticulture]], [[animal husbandry]], and [[forestry]], but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |title=Definition of Agriculture |publisher=State of Maine |accessdate=6 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323075557/http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html |archivedate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer]] to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing [[sedentism]]; examples are the [[Natufian culture]] in the [[Levant]], and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, G. C.

In Eurasia, the [[Sumer]]ians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in [[pictograph]]s around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC.

[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|left|[[Reindeer]] herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples.]]

[[Pastoralism]] involves managing domesticated animals. In [[nomadic pastoralism]], herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blench | first=Roger | title=Pastoralists in the new millennium | publisher=FAO | date=2001 | pages=11–12 | url=http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201000745/http://www.odi.org.uk/work/projects/pdn/eps.pdf | archivedate=1 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[shifting cultivation]], a small area of a forest is cleared by cutting down all the trees and the area is burned. The land is then used for growing crops for several years. When the soil becomes less fertile, the area is then abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Shifting cultivation |url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |publisher=[[Survival International]] |accessdate=28 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829015112/http://www.survivalinternational.org/about/swidden |archivedate=29 August 2016| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waters, Tony |title=The Persistence of Subsistence Agriculture: life beneath the level of the marketplace |publisher=Lexington Books |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the typical subsistence [[farmer]] is equivalent to a smallholder, then there are an estimated 2.5 billion such farmers in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's [[arable land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=&lt;!--no byline--&gt; |date=7 March 2018 |title=Chinese project offers a brighter farming future |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02742-3 |department=Editorial |journal=Nature |volume=555 |issue=7695 |page=141 |doi=10.1038/d41586-018-02742-3 |pmid=29517037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[intensive farming]], the crops are cultivated to maximise profit, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs.

In the past century, agriculture has been characterized by increased productivity, the substitution of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor, water pollution, and farm subsidies. In recent years there has been a backlash against the [[environmental awareness|environmental effects]] of conventional agriculture, resulting in the [[organic farming|organic]], [[Regenerative agriculture|regenerative]], and [[sustainable agriculture]] movements.&lt;ref name="motherjones1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The World Bank |year=1995 |url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3970311122936 |title=Overcoming agricultural pollution of water: the challenge of integrating agricultural and environmental policies in the European Union, Volume 1 |accessdate=15 April 2013 |author=Scheierling, Susanne M. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605112426/http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000009265_3970311122936 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major forces behind this movement has been the [[European Union]], which first certified [[organic food]] in 1991 and began reform of its [[Common Agricultural Policy]] (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=European Commission |year=2003 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm |title=CAP Reform |accessdate=15 April 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017124251/http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capreform/index_en.htm |archivedate=17 October 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as [[Decoupling and re-coupling|decoupling]].

"Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability". pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.&lt;ref name="CS"/&gt;

[[File:Intercropping coconut n Tagetes erecta.jpg|thumb|[[Intercropping]] of [[coconut]] and [[Tagetes erecta|Mexican marigold]]]]

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name="PCP APS" /&gt; [[Multiple cropping]], in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt;

Important categories of food crops include [[cereal]]s, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt; [[Natural fiber]]s include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profiles of 15 of the world's major plant and animal fibres|url=http://www.fao.org/natural-fibres-2009/about/15-natural-fibres/en/|publisher=FAO|accessdate=26 March 2018|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific crops are cultivated in distinct [[growing region]]s throughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based on [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] estimates.&lt;ref name="FAO"/&gt;

Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]), and for work and transport.&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock&gt;{{cite book |author=Clutton-Brock, Juliet |title=A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgL-EbbB8a0C&amp;pg=PR1 |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-63495-3 |pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Working animal]]s, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, llamas, alpacas, [[donkey]]s, and [[dog]]s, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Falvey | first=John Lindsay | authorlink=Lindsay Falvey | year=1985 | title=Introduction to Working Animals | isbn=978-1-86252-992-2 | location=Melbourne, Australia | publisher=MPW Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name="FAO lps"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sere, C. |author2=Steinfeld, H. |author3=Groeneweld, J. |year=1995 |url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends |publisher=U.N.

Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects |author=Thornton, Philip K. |doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134 |pmid=20713389 |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |date=27 September 2010 |volume=365 |issue=1554 |pages=2853–2867 |doi-access=free |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002017/http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full |archivedate=4 March 2016 |df=dmy-all|pmc=2935116 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers |journal=Time |author=Stier, Ken |date=19 September 2007|deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907071708/http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – Globaldiv |author=Ajmone-Marsan, P. |journal=Animal Genetics |date=May 2010 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x |pmid=20500752 |volume=41 |issue=supplement S1 |pages=1–5 |url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170803140941/https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/148417 |archivedate=3 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Broiler house.jpg|thumb|Raising [[chicken]]s intensively for meat in a broiler house]]

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name="FAO lps" /&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP /&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee |date=23 April 2002 |accessdate=6 April 2013 |publisher=European Union |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502123053/http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production practices===
[[File:Fendt Tractor Ripping up Kulin.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tillage|Tilling]] an arable field]]
{{see|Tillage|Crop rotation|Irrigation}}

Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name="Soil"&gt;Brady, N. C.; Weil, R. R. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCP Tillage"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Land Preparation and Farm Energy" pp. 318–338 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pest control includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, intercropping, [[compost]]ing, avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name="PCP Pest"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production" pp. 240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, [[green manure]], compost and [[mineral]]s.&lt;ref name="PCP Soil"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Soil and Land" pp. 165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [[fallow]] period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or [[Manure spreader|by spreading]] either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.&lt;ref name="CS nutrient"&gt;Chrispeels, M. J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. "Nutrition from the Soil" pp. 187–218 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soil nutrient"&gt;Brady, N. C.; Weil, R.

[[File:PivotWithDrops.JPG|thumb|A [[center pivot irrigation]] system]]

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name="CS" /&gt; Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name="PCP Water"&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. "Plants and Soil Water" pp. 211–239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

According to a report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.&lt;ref name=ifpri&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |author=International Food Policy Research Institute |title=Food Security in a World of Growing Natural Resource Scarcity |year=2014 |publisher=CropLife International |accessdate=1 July 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305043943/http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity |archivedate=5 March 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Payment for ecosystem services]] is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tacconi | first1=L. | year=2012 | title=Redefining payments for environmental services | journal=Ecological Economics | volume=73 | issue=1| pages=29–36 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crop alteration and biotechnology==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Wheat selection k10183-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Wheat]] cultivar tolerant of high [[salinity]] (left) compared with non-tolerant variety]]

Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004 |publisher=Colorado State University |accessdate=11 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121061931/http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |archivedate=21 January 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stadler |first=L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating "high-yielding varieties". For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ruttan |first=Vernon W. |title=Biotechnology and Agriculture: A Skeptical Perspective |journal=AgBioForum |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=54–60 |date=December 1999 |url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521021149/http://www.agbioforum.org/v2n1/v2n1a10-ruttan.pdf |archivedate=21 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassman |first=K. |title=Ecological intensification of cereal production systems: The Challenge of increasing crop yield potential and precision agriculture |journal=Proceedings of a National Academy of Sciences Colloquium, Irvine, California |date=5 December 1998 |url=http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |accessdate=11 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024001804/http://www.lsc.psu.edu/nas/Speakers/Cassman%20manuscript.html |archivedate=24 October 2007 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat=60&amp;nbsp;pounds (lb) ≈ 27.215&amp;nbsp;kg. 1 bushel of maize=56&amp;nbsp;pounds ≈ 25.401&amp;nbsp;kg&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]].

===Effects and costs===
Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pretty |year=2000 |title=An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal=Agricultural Systems |volume=65 |issue=2 |pages=113–136 |doi=10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1=J. |display-authors=1 |last2=Brett |first2=C. |last3=Gee |first3=D. |last4=Hine |first4=R.

Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005 /&gt;

Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removing [[hedge]]s, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. These and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richards |first1=A. J. |title=Does Low Biodiversity Resulting from Modern Agricultural Practice Affect Crop Pollination and Yield? |journal=Annals of Botany |date=2001 |volume=88 |pages=165–172 |doi=10.1006/anbo.2001.146 |url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/880165.pdf |accessdate=10 July 2018 |doi-broken-date=2018-11-03&lt;!--odd case, it's printed in the article but doesn't work--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production. It found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production |author=International Resource Panel |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme |year=2010 |accessdate=7 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224061455/http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |archivedate=24 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that "[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs.&lt;ref name="unep.org"&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, https://www.unenvironment.org/search/node?keys=Towards+a+Green+Economy%3A+Pathways+to+Sustainable+Development+and+Poverty+Eradication&lt;/ref&gt; "On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011–2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020)."&lt;ref name="unep.org" /&gt;
===Livestock issues===
[[File:Biogas.jpg|thumb|Farmyard [[anaerobic digester]] converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into [[biogas]] fuel.]]

A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said "Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate=28 March 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related [[nitrous oxide]] (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced [[methane]] (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the [[ammonia]] emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving [[deforestation]]; in the Amazon basin 70% of [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|previously forested area]] is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name="LEAD"&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].

[[File:TerracesBuffers.JPG|thumb|upright|Terraces, [[conservation tillage]] and conservation buffers reduce [[soil erosion]] and [[water pollution]] on this farm in Iowa.]]

Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Boelee, E. |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/ |title=Ecosystems for water and food security |year=2011 |publisher=IWMI/UNEP |accessdate=24 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523025920/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Topics/Ecosystems/ |archivedate=23 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Molden, D. |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |title=Opinion: The Water Deficit |publisher=''The Scientist'' |accessdate=23 August 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113125654/http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/news_room/pdf/The-scientist_com-Opinion_The%20Water_Deficit.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sexton, R.

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[Subsidy|subsidies]], tariffs and other measures.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities? |author1=Lloyd, Peter J. |author2=Croser, Johanna L. |author3=Anderson, Kym |website=Policy Research Working Paper #4864 |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |date=March 2009 |pages=2–3 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605125346/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions, [[exchange rate policy|exchange rate policies]] and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers? |author1=Anderson, Kym |author2=Valenzuela, Ernesto  |website=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901 |date=April 2006 |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=16 April 2013 |pages=1–2 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605145451/https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref name=LloydCroserAnderson2013/&gt; Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |title=America's $24bn subsidy damages developing world cotton farmers |author=Kinnock, Glenys |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=16 April 2013 |newspaper=The Guardian |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906122834/http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/24/american-cotton-subsidies-illegal-obama-must-act |archivedate=6 September 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives.

It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, [[plant pathology]], crop modelling, soil science, [[entomology]], production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation, [[waste management]], and [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name="Bosso 2015"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bosso | first=Thelma | title=Agricultural Science | publisher=Callisto Reference | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-63239-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boucher 2018"&gt;{{cite book | last=Boucher | first=Jude | title=Agricultural Science and Management | publisher=Callisto Reference  | year=2018 | isbn=978-1-63239-965-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when [[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] conducted experiments on the use of [[gypsum]] (hydrated [[calcium sulphate]]) as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="JB 1840"&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel.

[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |page=13 |title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia |journal=Sustainable Agriculture and Food Policy in the 21st Century: Challenges and Solutions |date=October 2010 |accessdate=22 April 2013 |author1=Hogan, Lindsay |author2=Morris, Paul |url=http://coserve.com.au/PDF/VirtualMeeting/ABARE-Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://europa.eu/european-union/topics/agriculture_en |title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming |publisher=European Union |accessdate=8 May 2018 |date=2016-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy |author=Ikerd, John |journal=Small Farm Today Magazine |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807024012/http://faculty.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20(9-10).htm |archivedate=7 August 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |author=Jowit, Juliette |date=22 September 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AMIBA logo.JPG|thumb|AMIBA logo]]
The '''American Independent Business Alliance''' ('''AMIBA''') is a non-profit organization that represents the interests of local [[independent business]]es, helps communities develop strong local economies through nurturing local entrepreneurs, and promotes citizen engagement in local economic development. AMIBA helps communities to: launch and successfully operate "buy local" campaigns; facilitate group purchasing and marketing among local businesses, and; other programs to support community enterprise.

Many of these communities form [[Independent Business Alliance]]s to strengthen and sustain community-based businesses while strengthening local economies and preventing chains and other remotely controlled businesses from driving out locals.

==Local independent businesses==

AMIBA defines a local independent business as:
*Private, employee, community, or cooperative ownership
*At least 50% owned by area residents
*Full decision-making authority for the business lies with its local owner(s)
*A limited number and geographic range of business locations (determined by local affiliates based on their circumstances)

==Independent Business Alliance==
The term '''Independent Business Alliance''' refers to local affiliates of the AMIBA. According to AMIBA's website, "An IBA is a coalition of locally-owned independent businesses, citizens and community organizations united to support home town businesses in a community or geographic region...The AMIBA aims to help seed, support and network these alliances." 

The first Independent Business Alliance (IBA) originated in [[Boulder, Colorado]] in 1998 and developed the model that has been advanced by more than 85 local IBAs affiliated with the AMIBA in the United States and Canada. Their organizing model also has been emulated by dozens of other groups. Independent Business Alliances exist in communities ranging from 1,800 to several million residents, covering 36 states. Collectively, these IBAs represent about 24,000 independent businesses.

The name Independent Business Alliance is a trademark of the AMIBA that applies specifically and exclusively to its affiliates (no other organization can include "Independent Business Alliance" in its name), though affiliates are not obliged to use the name.

==History==
The organization was incorporated in 2001 by Jeff Milchen and Jennifer Rockne, who previously led the [[Boulder Independent Business Alliance]] (in Colorado), the first such alliance in the U.S. The AMIBA is a 501c(3) educational organization based in Bozeman, Montana.

AMIBA often supports positions that contrast with other national business organizations such as the [[U.S. Chamber of Commerce]], that advance policies favoring large or global corporations. For example, AMIBA argues for keeping corporations out of electioneering activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiba.net/news/2011-media/corporation-pro-business |title=Granting Corporations Bill of Rights Protections Is Not "Pro-business" |publisher=AMIBA |date=January 11, 2012 |accessdate=August 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209121128/http://www.amiba.net/news/2011-media/corporation-pro-business |archivedate=February 9, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Board of directors==
The organization is directed by a six-member board of leaders or initiators of local Independent Business Alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amiba.net/about/people|title=People of AMIBA|publisher=AMIBA|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belfast City Centre''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]].

The city centre was originally centred on the Donegall Street area. Donegall Street is now mainly a business area, but with expanding residential and entertainment development as part of the [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]] scheme - St. Anne's, Belfast's [[Church of Ireland|Anglican]] cathedral is located here. The [[Roman Catholic]] cathedral [[St. Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St. Peter's]] is located a little to the west of the city centre.

Two of Belfast's three main newspapers - ''[[Belfast Telegraph|The Belfast Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Irish News|The Irish News]]'' are also located nearby. ''[[The News Letter]]'', which claims to be the oldest continually published [[English language]] daily newspaper still in existence, was originally located in the area at 55 Donegall Street, [[1972 Donegall Street bombing|site of a massive]] [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[carbomb]] in March 1972, in which seven people died and 148 were injured.

The city centre is now centred on [[Donegall Square]] (location of the [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]]), Donegall Place, [[Royal Avenue]], Castle Junction, High Street and surrounding streets and alleys.

==Redevelopment==
[[File:Victoria Square completed.jpg|left|thumb|250px|[[Victoria Square, Belfast|Victoria Square]] completed in March 2008]]
Over the past decade the city Centre has seen expansive redevelopment. The [[Laganside Corporation|Laganside Development]] includes the landmark [[Waterfront Hall]], [[British Telecommunications|BT]] Tower, [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton Hotel]], [[Odyssey (Belfast)|Odyssey Complex]] and various riverside apartment complexes.

The [https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231152/http://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/gasworks/ Gasworks Business Park] is owned by [[Belfast City Council]] and managed by the Councils Estates Management Unit. The site contains commercial offices, [[call centre]]s, small business units, housing, cafés &amp; restaurants, the [[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel]] and an award winning public landscaped park. The Gasworks has been internationally recognised as a key example of [[Brownfield land|brownfield]] regeneration in [[Europe]] and has won numerous awards in relation to all aspects of its development. The initial phase is now almost complete and the City Council are currently preparing a master plan in preparation for the commencement of Phase II development.

[[Victoria Square, Belfast|Victoria Square]] is a commercial, residential and leisure development in Belfast developed and built by [[Multi Development UK]] UK over 6 years. At approx 800,000&amp;nbsp;ft² (75,000m²) and costing £400m it is the biggest and one of the most expensive property developments ever undertaken in Northern Ireland. It opened on March 6, 2008. Its anchor tenant at nearly 200,000&amp;nbsp;ft² (18,581m²) is the largest [[House of Fraser]] that the retailer has opened in the UK (as opposed to taken over).

In March 2006, the government gave the go-ahead for a £300m regeneration of a run-down part of Belfast city centre, in the [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]], which could create up to 2,000 jobs. Plans include a new shopping centre, anchored by a department store. The project will not be completed until 2011. It is estimated that 1,000 people will help build the development and 2,000 will be employed there.

The creation of BOB came as a direct result of the Vancouver Agreement&lt;ref name="vancouveragreement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050316205956/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/TheAgreement.htm|archive-date=2005-03-16|dead-url=yes|title=TheAgreement|accessdate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an urban development initiative between the governments of Canada, British Columbia, and the City of Vancouver. BOB's role as defined by the agreement is to promote business development, offer mentoring and employment training as well as administering a loans program to inner-city small businesses.&lt;ref name="vancouveragreement2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/EconomicDevelopment.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051125000156/http://www.vancouveragreement.ca/EconomicDevelopment.htm|archive-date=2005-11-25|dead-url=yes|title=EconomicDevelopment|accessdate=2014-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time since its creation the organization has developed from being seen largely as an employment agency into being recognized as a credible and reliable source for a variety of information on the DTES. Separating itself from the legacy or failures of PEACH, the economic development and job creation organization that BOB was created to replace and distinguishing itself as a separate and unique entity has been a challenge to the organization. While some of the people and resources from PEACH were transferred to BOB the organization was created as a comprehensive new service to address the needs of business and employment. Fast Track to Employment (FTE)another organization active in the DTES has remained its own agency working in tandem with BOB. With a mandate to create employment opportunities by working with employers and residents FTE operates within the BOB offices as an affiliated or sister charitable organization sharing the same board of directors as BOB.

BOB as an organization has made efforts in the media to clarify its role in the DTES while addressing a diverse range of policy and planning issues relevant to Vancouver's inner-city such as STIR (Short Term Incentives for Rental Housing)&lt;ref&gt;Stir is a step in the right direction, Shirley Chan, ''Vancouver Sun'', 2009 https://vancouversun.com/opinion/STIR+step+right+direction/2373405/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; homelessness and economic development&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Levitz, Hope and despair in Vancouver's Eastside, ''The Canadian Press, CTV'', Monday December 28, 2009 http://www.ctvolympics.ca/news-centre/newsid=23996.html&lt;/ref&gt; and industry clustering&lt;ref&gt;Clustering in Action, Robert Matas, ''Globe and Mail'', December 18, 2009 http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20091218.escenic_1406276/BNStory/National/&lt;/ref&gt; Though becoming more widely recognized in 2008 and 2009 the organization has struggled to overcome obscurity concerning its past and present work.

Directly related to its support of clustering in Vancouver's inner-city, BOB has also been noted for its co-working space&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw |first=Gillian |url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/techsense/archive/2009/12/18/vancouver-s-downtown-eastside-gets-innovative-cowork-space.aspx |title=Vancouver's Downtown Eastside gets innovative coworking space - Digital Life |publisher=Communities.canada.com |date=2009-12-18 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Gillian |url=https://vancouversun.com/shared+workspace+opens+Vancouver+inner+city/2366408/story.html |title=New shared workspace opens in Vancouver's inner city |publisher=Vancouversun.com |date=2009-12-21 |accessdate=2010-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531062700/http://www.vancouversun.com/shared%2Bworkspace%2Bopens%2BVancouver%2Binner%2Bcity/2366408/story.html |archivedate=May 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; made available for bloggers, independent media/social media, as well as independent contractors and consultants working in Vancouver's DTES.(Downtown Eastside) The BOB co-working space is also utilized as an art gallery and presentation space and is an official host gallery of the 2010 Winter Olympics' Cultural Olympiad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/cultural-festivals-and-events/event-listings/trimpin--sheng-high_131960nR.html |title=Trimpin: Sheng High - Event Listings : Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics |publisher=Vancouver2010.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has also been noted for placing focus on social enterprise in the inner-city and was instrumental in the support and creation of the SOLEFood Inner City Farm Project along with Seann Dory of United We Can, and local property owners Gudy and Pal Sahota.&lt;ref name="kelowna"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kelowna.com/2009/10/31/new-community-garden-takes-root-in-the-downtown-eastside/|title=Kelowna News, Weather, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Classifieds, Real Estate &amp; More &amp;#124; Kelowna.com|publisher=kelowna.com|accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christabel Shaler |url=http://www.vancouverobserver.com/blogs/comfortvschange/2009/11/01/solefood-inner-city-farm-source-food-and-jobs-vancouvers-dowtown |title=SOLEfood Inner City Farm: A Source of Food and Jobs for Vancouver's Dowtown Eastside &amp;#124; The Vancouver Observer - News, Culture, Sports, Blogs in Vancouver, BC |publisher=The Vancouver Observer |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=85e2e05a-d62c-4f0a-8ecd-f7071f9a045d |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BOB and the Millennium CBA (Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village)==

BOB was involved in the creation of Vancouver's first [[Community Benefits Agreement]] centred on the construction of the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village.&lt;ref name="vancouver1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/pdf/CBAFactsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328052745/http://vancouver.ca/olympicvillage/PDF/CBAFactsheet.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While this development has been criticized for going over-budget&lt;ref&gt;Olympic village $130&amp;nbsp;million over budget: audit, Miro Cernetig,''Vancouver Sun'', October 6, 2009 https://vancouversun.com/business/Vancouver+Olympic+Village+million+over+budget+report/2072466/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; the CBA may potentially serve as a valuable example of the emerging potential between investors, developers and social enterprise in urban planning. The CBA was a collective effort between the City of Vancouver, BOB, [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games|VANOC]] and Millennium Development Corporation focusing on job creation for local residents and encouraging direct procurement of goods and services from the Downtown Eastside as per the needs of the Olympic Village development.&lt;ref name="vancouver1"/&gt; Other major partners included Bell, [[VanCity Credit Union]], the [[Province of British Columbia]] and the Federal Government (as represented through the Vancouver agreement)as well as the Canadian Housing and Mortgage Corporation and the Vancouver Regional Construction Association.

==Criticism of BOB==

BOB has been the recipient of criticism from both activists who view the organization as a potential agent of gentrification and from other individuals active in the DTES. The organization has made efforts to clarify its role in the DTES in response to these criticisms.&lt;ref name="canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=eecc5d8e-977f-43d6-b31b-1b406fc20f9d |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEACH (Partners for Economic and Community Health) having been proven largely ineffective in its approach was dismantled and its funding halted. BOB, though supporting a different development model and with different roles has also been viewed by some in Vancouver's DTES as not serving its primary purpose or being effective enough in job creation.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/story.html?id=cda5b861-4837-487f-b5da-852f4d282cca |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kim Kerr, executive director for the [[Downtown Eastside Residents Association]] and Vancouver employment councilor Ruth Meta are examples of vocal critics.&lt;ref name="canada1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="canada2"/&gt; Meta and BOB CEO Shirley Chan both commented on BOB's role and work in the DTES through a series of articles in the Vancouver Courier in 2009&lt;ref name="canada1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/vancouvercourier/news/letters/story.html?id=87989020-6e69-4926-b944-cf4a0bdef158 |title=Sitemap - Vancouver Courier |publisher=.canada.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is rumored that Meta reconciled with BOB after this exchange.

'''Christa Muth''' (born November 24, 1949) is a German systems scientist, management professor and management consultant. She spent most of her life in [[Switzerland]] and is notable for emphasizing the importance of the intangible aspects in organizations and in business strategies. She coined the term “[[Human Systems Engineering]]” and gave it to a Master of Advanced Studies Program she developed at the [[HES-SO]] (University of Applied Sciences Western Switzerland). After she handed over the direction of this program to a successor, she developed a new area of interest in the field of “societal innovation”.

Muth is a [[trans woman]] and activist for the [[transgender]] community. She was born a boy and lived and published under the names Christophe Muth, Christoph Muth and Chris Muth until she was 58. She transitioned high-speed in less than 6 months and in the public eye with an exemplary support of her employer, her students, her colleagues and her clients.

== Early life and education ==
Muth was born in [[Rheydt]] / [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], a borough of [[Mönchengladbach]] in a family of textile industrials. Their Lutheran faith led the family of her maternal grandfather to refuse the membership in the Nazi NSDAP Party, which endangered her family and brought several troubles during the era of the Third Reich. After the end of World War II in 1945, the strict religious attitude paid off: 15 years of booming success and wealth in part due to business with the Allied forces which privileged partners who had not been Nazis. In 1960, when it was clear that the German textile industry would get into heavy troubles under the pressure of Asiatic competition, Muth’s mother dropped her job and withdrew out of this branch. She moved with her second husband to the [[Lausanne]] area. Hence, Muth was educated in the French and later in the Italian speaking area of Switzerland. She gained her diploma for access to university in [[Bellinzona]]. She studied Economic History and Sociology at the [[Geneva University]] where she had the opportunity to work and share ideas with intellectuals like [[Edgar Morin]], [[Jean Ziegler]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Paolo Freire]]. Muth earned her Ph.D. in 1991 at the Swiss Campus of La Jolla University, San Diego, where she attended lectures with [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Henri Laborit]]. Her doctoral thesis (in German) was about private and public academic education (Erfolg und Marketing von Privatuniversitäten).

== Professional experience in the post ’68 context ==
In the post ’68 movement, Muth opted for a politically liberal attitude promoting alternative businesses rather than violent confrontation with the system. In her view, these businesses had the advantage to develop an in depth understanding of the realities and constraints in management rather than judging and condemn. She initiated several businesses or assisted interested groups in the launch. The condition for her participation was always a participative or better self-governed management model ([[Workers' self-management|autogestion]]). The objectives of the initiatives in which she participated invariably focused on sustainability, empowerment and creating jobs for those who were in trouble finding appropriate work in line with their values.
Despite her values and intentions, Muth was harshly criticized because of her management style which was perceived by some as pseudo-democratic and authoritarian.
Some of the businesses she started made it to survive until today, the most notable and where she had a leading role as founder-manager for 6 years is probably Voyages APN in Geneva, originally a travel agency and coach transport company in the legal form of a cooperative. Ten years after her departure from this company the staff took over the company, discarded the form of the cooperative and instated private ownership.

== Development of management and strategy concepts ==
Later, Muth was active in technology valorization, M&amp;A, succession management and organization development. In 20 years of consulting for public and private organizations of every size and any kind, she has often accepted high risk assignments when the survival of the organization was at stake. She initiated and managed several turnarounds in organisational cultures and mostly privileged working on the intangible factors to resolve critical situations, such as communication, motivation, teamwork, corporate culture. Most of the time, her approach proved to be the right one if compared with approaches based exclusively on structures, facts and figures. Muth has provided consultancy to major companies at a high hierarchical level in Switzerland and Europe, like UBS, Swiss Re, CS, Swisscom, and Electrolux.
From a methodological point of view, Muth was strongly influenced by Systems thinking ([[Frederic Vester]]&lt;ref&gt;Vester F., Ausfahrt Zukunft, Heyne Verlag 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Grier Miller]]&lt;ref&gt;Miller J.G., Living Systems, McGraw-Hill 1978&lt;/ref&gt;), the model of the triune brain ([[Paul D. MacLean]]),  Existential Analysis ([[Viktor Frankl]])&lt;ref&gt;Frankl V., Der Mensch auf der Suche nach Sinn, Klett Verlag 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and by the sociological research carried out by [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi]].&lt;ref&gt;Csikszentmihalyi M., Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience, Harper and Row 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
In her role as main researcher and developer for the Leonardo 3.4.5 methodology she condensed this knowledge into a tool intended to help organizations to master complexity and to assess organizational strategies in relation with mental patterns of management teams. This methodology was developed as a Eureka project with the participation of research teams in Switzerland, UK, Italy, Germany and France.
From 2003 to 2009, Muth was President of the Association of the Swiss Printing Industry. At this time she committed herself to reorient the printing industry to Sustainable Development providing the branch with analysis and concepts for survival in the context of globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Bedeutet Globalisierung Krieg gegen die Schweizer Druckindustrie ?, in Druckmarkt 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Die graphische Industrie muss agiler werden - das gilt auch für ihre Verbände, in Viscom-Zeitschrift 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth. C., Eine Zukunft für die schweizer Druckindustrie, in Druckmarkt 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Der nächste Schauplatz rasanter Verändeungen, in Druckmarkt no. 33 and 34 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Das gewisse Unbehagen im Bildungswesen betrifft auch die grafische Industrie, in Druckmarkt 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Druckindustrie und Publishing 3.0 : Disharmonien in der Zukunftsmusik, in Publisher – Schweizer Fachzeitschrift für Publishing und Digitaldruck 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Association became leader in industrial sustainability policies (CO2 free printing), refusing the alibi of compensation certificates.

== Contributions to the changes in the Swiss universities system ==
In 1993, Muth was hired as a consultant to [http://www.esig.ch/ esig+] (Ecole Suisse d’Ingénieurs de l’Industrie Graphique et de l’emballage – Swiss College of Engineering for the Printing and Packaging Industry). The School had the ambition to become the first College at University level to achieve an ISO 9001 quality certification. To do so a turnaround in the organization culture and in the teaching methods was necessary. Hence her blend of knowledge in [[neuroscience]], learning biology, psychology, systems sciences and organization development was the perfect match. During the quality certification, esig+ became the main model for [[:de:Rolf Dubs|Rolf Dubs]] who was at this time the mentor of the Swiss Confederation for the development of the Universities of Applied Sciences. Muth was asked for extensive input about her futuristic vision of teaching and leading academic institutions. She participated as a member of the esig+ management staff in the whole process of development in [[:de:Rolf Dubs|Rolf Dubs]]’ work group.
Muth strongly advocated to include soft skills and social competence in academic curricula and to transform the teaching methods and relations between faculty and students accordingly. Many innovations in the academic context, like the possibility to do diploma or master thesis’ in groups are due to her determination to challenge and oppose academic traditions.
In 2000, esig+ was merged into [[HEIG-VD]] as department [[:fr:Comem+|Comem+]] (Communications Engineering Management) and Muth was asked to package the type of knowledge she used for the turnaround of esig+ in order to make it transmissible and teachable in a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

== Human Systems Engineering ==
In 1999 Muth received the assignment from the university to create a Master Program for extended education focused on intangible factors in organizations.  She coined the term [[Human Systems Engineering]] and set up the first conceptual lineaments of the iter studiorum. Later, Prof. Marie-France Bourdais joined her to design, to promote the final version of the program and to run it with the first cohorts of students. HSE became quite popular and received a warm welcome from business and financial press.&lt;ref&gt;Bloch E. Entreprises: gros protentiels pour les biens intangibles, in AGEFI 04.07.2005,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baillod G., Le secret des processus humains, in Bilan, 1-2005&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was enriched with several specialization courses. After directing HSE until 2008, Muth organized her succession before her transition and handed the direction to her colleague Prof. Marie-France Bourdais.

== Transition ==
Muth was aware of her [[gender dysphoria]] since her earliest childhood and attempted several times to transition without success; rigid values in her social, professional and family context, shame and fear prevented a coming out. Well informed psychological help was not available at this time, practitioners just felt uneasy being confronted with this type of request. As a first attempt to transition at the age of 32 Muth lived 4 months as a woman, but this attempt failed as she felt that her passing was not sufficient and there was no support nor perspective for a professional life as a trans woman.
After a long period of bedridden sickness at the age of 57, she realized that there was no escape from facing her fate if she wanted to survive.  In the meantime, an informed community had established on the Internet where she found the necessary information about how to handle her case, about knowledgeable practitioners and experienced surgeons. From the final decision to surgery only one year lapsed. Muth had her surgery with Dr. Preecha Tiewtranon in Bangkok before her social and professional coming out, which she did 4 months later. The whole process took place under the public eye, as Muth went on lecturing and facing her professional responsibilities.

During her transition, Muth has been followed with the camera by Laurence Périgaud, a member of the Anthropology Institute of the University of Neuchâtel. Her documentary film was selected for the Swiss international festival Visions du réel. « Between Two Spirit - Becoming a Woman at Sixty » shows a successful transition as search of freedom and individuation as Jung intended it.

Since her transition, Muth takes an active part in the debate around transgender issues&lt;ref&gt;Muth C., Die Krankenkasse als Kostentreiberin, in Hausarzt Praxis 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and is an active member of the TGNS (TransGender Network Switzerland).

== Societal Innovation ==
After her transition, Muth developed a new area of academic interest in societal innovation, arguing that too many ideas about how to solve societal issues are just discarded or forgotten because of conservative mindsets in business and politics. Hence she started the “Houses of ... Initiative”, intended to illuminate societal problems and demonstrate their solutions. On this basis she was asked to join the committee of the Project 2020 of Alliance F, the Central Swiss Women’s Association.
In the field of societal innovation, Muth has issued three thesis’:&lt;ref&gt;Dorier R, Muth C., Comment utiliser la complexité - Outils, attitudes et compétences à développer, jobindex media ag, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* All business which fulfills three conditions (big business, well-documented knowledge taught in universities and well-established know-how documented sufficiently in quality systems) will leave the industrialized countries for the emerging countries.
* The future of the presently industrialized countries depends on their innovation capacity and skills for managing complexity.
* A de-globalization will take place sooner or later, depending on the capability of entire branches to switch to sustainability and to impose the respective rules and procedures as compulsory standards.

Presently, at the [[HEIG-VD]], Muth teaches these topics, works as adviser for politicians, writes and is active in research.

== Home life ==
Muth lives as single in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]], a thermal resort in the Canton [[Vaud]].

'''Claus Josef Riedel''' (19 February 1925 – 17 March 2004) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]] glassmaker, businessman, professor of chemistry, and [[chemical engineer]]. He was the 9th-generation owner of [[Riedel (glass manufacturer)|Riedel Crystal]], an Austrian glassware manufacturer that was established in 1756. Riedel is best known for creating and producing grape variety-specific glassware designed to enhance types of wines based on specific properties of individual grape varieties. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed, and is credited with first discovering the concept of variety-specificity in glassware, developing variety-specific glassware shapes and bringing these glasses to the consumer market. Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winespectator.com/webfeature/show/id/Claus-Riedel-Wineglass-Innovator-Dies-at-79_21942], Claus Riedel, Wineglass Innovator, Dies at 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Claus Riedel was born in Polaun, now part of [[Kořenov]], [[Bohemia]] (present-day [[Czech Republic]]), to Walter Riedel, a glassmaker, and Claudia Prollius Riedel. Claus Riedel was drafted by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] in [[World War II]], where he fought Italian partisans in [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]]. In March 1945 he was captured by American forces and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp near [[Pisa, Italy]] for ten months. In January 1946, while being returned to Germany for repatriation, Riedel escaped by jumping from a train entering [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/24/world/claus-josef-riedel-crystal-maker-who-suited-glass-to-wine-is-dead-at-79.html], Claus Josef Riedel, Crystal Maker Who Suited Glass to Wine, Is Dead at 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riedel remained in Austria, finding a job with glassmaker [[Daniel Swarovski]], who had once been an apprentice to Riedel’s great-grandfather Josef Riedel. He also enrolled in the [[University of Innsbruck]] in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], where he studied chemistry. After graduating, he spent five years working various jobs throughout Europe. In 1955 he was contacted by The [[Austrian People’s Party]] Prime Minister, Reinhard Kamitz, who invited him to take over the bankrupt Tiroler Glashütte glassware factory.

==Restarting the Riedel company==
Walter Riedel had been employed during World War II by the Germans to blow vacuum tubes for electronic equipment. In that capacity he had been captured by the conquering Russian army in 1945, and taken to the USSR as a prisoner of war. After ten years he was released, and  found his way to Austria, where he joined Claus. With assistance from Swarovski, the two Riedels were able to reopen the glassware factory by 1957, turning it into today’s Riedel Glass Factory in [[Kufstein]], Austria. Prior to World War II, the factory had produced heavy industrial glass, but upon reopening, Claus Riedel changed its focus to fine hand-made glass. Claus Riedel served as President and Chief Executive Officer of Riedel Crystal from 1957 until 1994, when he turned the reins over to his son [[Georg Josef Riedel]], who later was succeeded by his son [[Maximilian Riedel]], who is the current President and CEO of Riedel Crystal.

==Design Innovations==
As a glassmaker, Riedel was interested primarily in function over appearance, and broke away from the traditional richly cut, heavy and thick glass designs of the time. He spent 16 years studying the physics of wine delivery to the mouth and taste buds and experimenting with different glass configurations, matching them with wines of different regions, grape origin and age to create stemware that would match and complement specific wines and spirits. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed.

From these experiments, Riedel created the Burgundy Grand Cru glass in 1958, made to enhance the flavors and aromas of the Pinot Noir and Nebbiolo grape variety, specifically for Burgundy, Barolo, and Barbaresco wines. This creation was first exhibited at the World Exhibition in Brussels, Expo 58 (The Brussels Worlds Fair), where it received a Gold Medal for its creative and striking design. It was acquired by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York for the museum’s permanent collection.

In 1961, Riedel Crystal introduced the first full line of wine glasses created for different wines. Riedel perfected these variety-specific wine glasses in 1973 with the introduction of his most notable glass collection, the Sommeliers Series, the world’s first gourmet glasses.

==Awards and nominations==
Claus Riedel was honored with 28 design prizes and awards for his creations. Notable honors include:
*1958:  World Exhibition, [[Expo 58]], [[Brussels]] – Gold Medal
*1958: [[Museum of Modern Art]], Burgundy Grand Cru glass selected for permanent collection 
*1959: Sommeliers Series Burgundy Grand Cru glass awarded Most Beautiful Glass in the World, [[Corning Museum of Glass]]
*1960: La Triennale di Milano, Silver Medal 
*1966: American Institute of Interior Designers Award

'''Fritz Kaiser''' (born 22 March 1955 in [[Mauren]], [[Liechtenstein]]) is a wealth management entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist from the Principality of Liechtenstein. He is married to Birgit and has four children. He is co-founder and executive chairman of [[Kaiser Partner]], a wealth management firm that provides [[family office]] and wealth management services to private wealth owners and their advisors. Kaiser is an advocate for responsible wealth management and is well known for his innovation in this field. Specifically, in 2011, he won the [[Spear’s Magazine]] "Wealth Management Innovator of the Year" award for the successful instigation and development of the [[‘Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility’]] (LDF), a vehicle which promotes tax compliance by assisting UK taxpayers in the declaration of previously untaxed assets. He also co-founded the [[Mentor Foundation]], a leading international NGO voice of drug abuse prevention.

==Personal life==
Fritz Kaiser is married and has four children. In 1976 he represented Liechtenstein in Judo at the Montreal Olympics and he has retained an interest in sport throughout his life.&lt;ref name="Sports-Reference.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/fritz-kaiser-1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017135553/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ka/fritz-kaiser-1.html |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df=dmy }}, Sports-reference.com, Athlete Finder. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is co-founder and trustee of the Mentor Foundation, a drug-prevention organization for children launched 1994 at the United Nations General Assembly in Geneva. The Foundation’s current patron is Queen Silvia of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mentorfoundation.org/people.php?id=23], Mentor Foundation. Retrieved 9 February.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fritz Kaiser is a member of the [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF). He is also an avid collector of Chinese Contemporary Art and has established the virtual museum "88 Mocca – The Museum of Chinese Contemporary Art on the web".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artzinechina.com/display.php?a=516], Artzinechina.com, Collector  Q&amp;A. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Fritz Kaiser completed a commerce degree (Handelsakademie) in Feldkirch, Austria and began his business career in 1977 at [[Präsidial-Anstalt]], one of the leading trust firms in Liechtenstein. In 1982 he established his own business, the [[Fritz Kaiser Group]] (FKG), providing wealth management services to private wealth owners, entrepreneurs and internationally famous personalities from the worlds of sport and art. Kaiser continued to pursue this interest in financial services through his purchase of the [[Diners Club]] credit card business in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. He served as a member of the Diners Club International Strategic Council at its licensor [[Citibank]], who he sold the company to in 1999. 
In 1995, Fritz Kaiser became co-owner of the Swiss Formula One racing team [[Sauber]], of which he was chairman from 1997-1999. During his F1 partnership time he successfully secured a contract with Red Bull in 1995, negotiated the Malaysian petroleum company [[PETRONAS]] as the main sponsor and engineering joint venture partner and developed the engine partnership with Ferrari. In 1999 he sold his share in the team to his partners, Peter Sauber and Dietrich Mateschitz (from [[Red Bull]])."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns02204.html], 'Kaiser Leaves Sauber', www.grandprix.com. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In more recent years, Kaiser has worked to promote the cause of responsible wealth management with Kaiser Partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaiserpartner.com/], Kaiser Partner Media Center. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in Kaiser Partner===
Kaiser Partner, the international wealth management firm of which Fritz Kaiser is currently Executive Chairman, is founded on the principle of responsibility in wealth management. Kaiser Partner comprises several companies which provide integrated wealth management solutions including private banking, fund administration, financial advisory, family office, trust and asset management services. 
At the heart of the services offered by Kaiser Partner is Fritz Kaiser’s belief that it is the duty of wealth management firms to help families and their advisors responsibly grow and preserve private wealth. To support this mantra, Kaiser Partner runs a Responsible Investing blog which discusses global developments relating to sustainable and ethical investing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://responsible-investing-blog.com/?lang=en], Responsible Investing Blog, Kaiserpartner.com. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private Wealth Council===
Kaiser Partner is also affiliated with the [[Private Wealth Council]] which was founded by Fritz Kaiser during the Annual Meeting of the [[World Economic Forum]] 2004 in [[Davos]]. It is an independent, international forum bringing together private wealth owners, experts and thought leaders from across the world to address issues pertaining to the responsible use of private wealth. Since 2008, the Private Wealth Council has published the findings of its work in its international publication Responsible Wealth Review.
In the first issue, Al Gore, the former US Vice-President who now champions environmental issues, laid out nine drivers of global change which influence responsible wealth ownership. In an [[e-Financial News]] article from 2009, Kaiser commented that ‘If you understand the drivers of change and navigate on the right side of change then you have a better chance of being a successful long-term investor rather than just another gambler in the market’.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efinancialnews.com/story/2009-02-24/fritz-kaiser-responsible-wealth-crusader], 'Fritz Kaiser Responsible Wealth Crusader', Efinancialnews.com. Retrieved 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in the Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility==
Well known for his commitment to compliance and responsibility, in 2008 Fritz Kaiser was invited to join the Liechtenstein Governments' Advisory board for the initiative "Futuro" to help set the direction for the future of the Liechtenstein financial centre. He headed the Liechtenstein task force to develop a solution for the financial centre in collaboration with The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the outcome of which was a unique pledge of transparency to the OECD, called the Liechtenstein Declaration. 
With many clients in the global offshore markets struggling to find fair solutions for untaxed funds, Kaiser instigated a solution with the UK government known as the [[Liechtenstein disclosure facility|Liechtenstein Disclosure Facility (LDF)]]. This agreement would assist UK citizens with non-declared assets in their disclosure, making them HMRC compliant for a minimum penalty. This was clearly an attractive offering for those with offshore accounts, but its success could not have been predicted. UK taxpayers recognized that this was a non-discriminatory solution which could facilitate long-term wealth preservation and compliance.     
It was for this work that Fritz Kaiser and his colleague, former [[Baker &amp; McKenzie]] lawyer Philip Marcovici, won the [[Spear’s Magazine]] Award for ‘Wealth Management Innovator of the Year 2011’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spearswms.com/wm-awards/27972/spears-wealth-management-awards-2011-winners.thtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301042010/http://www.spearswms.com/wm-awards/27972/spears-wealth-management-awards-2011-winners.thtml |archivedate=1 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}, 'Spears Wealth Management Awards 2011 Winners', spearswms.com.

Kent is credited with introducing the first luxury photographic African Safari &lt;ref&gt;Wiese, [http://robbreport.com/luxury-travel/Icons--Innovations-Abercrombie--Kent-Adventure-to-Go '''Icons and Innovations'''] "Robb Report" January 1st, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 1962. Geoffrey Kent has been appointed the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Kenya to Monaco.

==Early life==

Geoffrey Kent was born while his parents, Colonel John and Valerie Kent, were on safari in [[Zambia]].

Kent attended the [http://www.mccrow.org.uk/eastafrica/duke%20of%20york%20school/Duke%20of%20York%20School.htm Duke of York School] in '''Nairobi''', which produced many of [[Kenya]]'s business and science leaders.

After attending the [[Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst]], Kent saw service in countries such as Bahrain, Kuwait, and Malta. Kent's distinguished armed forces career was cut relatively short as a result of hearing damage from years spent in heavy tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=741464&amp;privcapId=6636820&amp;previousCapId=408612&amp;previousTitle=RWE%20AG '''Geoffrey J.W. Kent Profile'''] "Bloomberg website", updated April 15th, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===Abercrombie &amp; Kent===

While serving in the British Army, he joined his parents in founding [[Abercrombie &amp; Kent]]. Being influenced by his time in the British Military, Kent repositioned the safari experience as a "hunt with a camera, not with a gun"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.departures.com/travel/adventure/abercrombie-and-kent-last-hunt, '''Abercrombie and Kent: The Last Hunt''', "departures.com", 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and introduced the first mobile tented safari's with refrigeration that made it possible to have fresh meat, fruit, vegetables and ice in the bush.&lt;ref&gt;Dragun, N.

By 1967, Kent's parents retired and it was after his parents retirement that he transformed [[Abercrombie &amp; Kent]] into a luxury travel service &lt;ref&gt;Olmstead, L.[https://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2013/07/22/6-best-bespoke-tour-operators/, '''Forbes 6 Best Tour Operators'''], "Forbes.com", 2013&lt;/ref&gt; that provided luxury safari camps and lodges.

[[File:Sir George Gough Arbuthnot.jpg|right|thumb|Sir George Arbuthnot]]
'''Sir George Gough Arbuthnot''' (28 August 1848 &amp;ndash; 3 May 1929) was a businessman and civic leader in [[British India]].

Arbuthnot, the son of Archibald Francis Arbuthnot (son of [[Sir William Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet]]) and Gertrude Sophia Gough was six times a member of the [[Madras Legislative Council]]. He was seven times made chairman of the Madras [[Chamber of Commerce]], several times President of the board of directors of the [[Bank of Madras]], and in 1900 became chairman of the Famine Relief Fund. Grandson of a [[Baronet]], he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] on 10 December 1901 for services to the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Marlborough House, December 10, 1901.|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/27389/pages/8979|accessdate=14 May 2011|newspaper=The London Gazette|date=20 December 1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stock|first=Elliot|title=The Genealogical magazine|year=1904|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LIJPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA86&amp;lpg=PA86&amp;dq=December+10+1901+%22George+Gough+Arbuthnot%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bHyvbXE-bf&amp;sig=6E_FJeRVGDGqO8VuSOy1dVhRyHM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_HLOTa_5CtSz0QH4g7D1DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=December%2010%201901%20%22George%20Gough%20Arbuthnot%22&amp;f=false|volume=7|accessdate=14 May 2011|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became partner of [[Arbuthnot &amp; Co]] of Madras 1871 and was senior [[partnership|partner]] in the firm at the time of its spectacular crash in 1906, as a result of which he was sentenced to 18 months rigorous imprisonment. The charges against him were (1)  Cheating in respect  of  a  fixed  deposit  in  the  name  of  the Rajah  Krishna  Badahur;  (2)  breach  of  trust  respecting  the  Madras  Equitable  Assurance  Society;  and  (3)  breach  of  trust  in  misappropriating  the  funds  of  Arbuthnot's  Industrials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5095478]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 1873, Arbuthnot married Isabella Albinia Boyle, daughter of Richard Cavendish Boyle, the son of the [[Edmund Boyle, 8th Earl of Cork|8th Earl of Cork]]. They had two daughters.

Most nations favour attracting [[inward investment|inward foreign investment]], and support outward foreign investment only passively. The People's Republic of China, however, attaches importance to both inward and outward foreign investment.

==Causes==
* The People's Republic of China has amassed huge amounts of [[foreign reserves]], thus putting upward pressure on the foreign [[exchange rate]] of [[renminbi]], the [[Chinese currency]].  Indeed, there have been much demand from the international community for the PRC to [[Floating currency|float its currency]].  In order to deflate that demand, the PRC seeks to employ its foreign reserves by acquiring assets overseas.
* The PRC is opening up the [[domestic market]] in [[mainland China]] as a result of its [[open door policy]], which is further accelerated by its commitments when entering the [[World Trade Organization]]. Therefore, the PRC can foresee that world class competitors are now competing for business in the Chinese market, and so the PRC is seeking to equip the domestic firms and their management with international experience so that they can take the competition to the [[domestic market|home markets]] of the foreign nations and so that they can compete better at mainland China's own domestic market.

==History==
The Go Out Policy (also referred to as the Going Global Strategy) was an effort initiated in 1999 by the Chinese government to promote Chinese investments abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.cn/node_11140/2006-03/15/content_227686.htm 更好地实施“走出去”战略] 2006年03月15日&lt;/ref&gt; The Government, together with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade ([[CCPIT]]), has introduced several schemes to assist domestic companies in developing a global strategy to exploit opportunities in the expanding local and international markets.

The programs launched so far by the Chinese Government have these goals in mind: 
#increase Chinese Direct Foreign Investment (FDI)
#pursue product [[Diversification (marketing strategy)|diversification]]
#improve the level and quality of the projects
#expand financial channels with respect to the national market
#promote [[brand recognition]] of Chinese companies in EU and US markets

Since the launching of the Going out Strategy, interest in overseas investing by Chinese companies has increased significantly especially among [[State Owned Enterprises]].  Statistics indicate that Chinese direct foreign investments rose from US$3 billion in 1991 to US$35 billion in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200401/07/eng20040107_132003.shtml UN report: China becoming major investor abroad] January 07, 2004 [[People's Daily]] Online&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was underscored in 2007, when Chinese FDI reached US$92 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-04/17/content_6624488.htm China's direct investments abroad top $92b by 2007] 2008-04-17 [[Xinhua]]&lt;/ref&gt; This boost in foreign investment can also be attributed to the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Government]]'s ability and commitment to create the right environment for foreign investment; and China's huge production capacity, coupled with low labor costs. With a dynamic economy, and a strong business-friendly culture, the outlook for Chinese companies will continue to be positive.

As part of its efforts to restructure state-owned enterprises, the Chinese government has established the [[SASAC]] (State-Owned Asset Supervision Administration Commission), which develops China's equity exchange market, while supporting Chinese foreign investments. SASAC's responsibilities include:
#supervision and evaluation of state-owned enterprises
#oversight of state-owned assets
#recruiting of top executive talent
#drafting of laws, administrative rules and regulations that promote increased development of [[corporate law]] in China
#coordination of local state-owned assets as prescribed by law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sasac.gov.cn/n2963340/n2963393/2965120.html Main Functions and Responsibilities of SASAC]&lt;/ref&gt;
The SASAC operates through several equity exchanges such as [[CBEX]] ([[China Beijing Equity Exchange]]), which is the largest and most prestigious in terms of trading volume. It is headquartered in the heart of [[Beijing financial district]]. Presently, CBEX has established three international platforms in Italy, Japan and the United States of America. The Italian [[CMEX]] ([[China Milan Equity Exchange]]), created in 2007, is CBEX's first international partner, operating as a liaison to facilitate the penetration of Chinese companies into the Italian and European markets and of European companies in China. Following the trend of the Go out policy, some of the most prominent Chinese professional institutions are expanding their business on the international markets. [[King &amp; Wood Mallesons]], the largest Law Firm in China with more than 800 lawyers and lobbyists, opened branches in various cities of the [[United States]] and [[Japan]], while [[Grandall Legal Group]] (one of the most prominent Chinese Law Firms, with a staff of more than 600 professionals) through its International Department has established a European hub called the “China-Europe Legal Group” to assist Chinese companies in legal and lobbying work operating and expanding in Europe. [[Carone &amp; Partners]] is a member law firm of the “China-Europe Legal Group” in Italy.

==Recent examples of the Go out policy==

The following list of M&amp;A transactions performed by Chinese companies overseas are just some of the most notable examples of the successful implementation of the Go out policy:

* June 2009: Proposed purchase of [[Hummer]] by [[Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company]]
* February 2009: [[Chinalco]] injected $19.5bn cash into the Australian mining company [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]], increasing its stake from 9 per cent to 18 per cent
* February 2009: Minmetals unveiled a friendly A$2.6bn ($1.7bn) takeover offer for the Australian Oz Mineral
* September 2008: Zoomlion, controlled by the [[Hunan]] provincial government, bought a 60% stake in Compagnia Italiana Forme Acciaio, the Italian construction equipment &amp; machinery company, with full takeover possible 3 years later&lt;ref name="Shu-Ching Jean"&gt;{{cite news

Since reforming, they have released three more albums, the most recent being ''[[Luciferian Towers]]'' in September 2017.

The band has gained a dedicated [[cult following]] and remains very influential in the [[post-rock]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thekey.xpn.org/2013/09/16/just-announced-post-rock-cult-faves-godspeed-you-black-emperor-headlining-union-transfer/ |title=Just Announced: Post-rock cult faves Godspeed You!

The band is also known for their song "[[East Hastings (song)|East Hastings]]" from the 1997 album ''[[F♯ A♯ ∞]]'', which was used in the film ''[[28 Days Later]]'' in an edited version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Danny Boyle’s Greatest Hits: From 'Trainspotting' to the 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/danny-boyle-s-greatest-hits-20130404/john-murphy-in-the-house-in-a-heartbeat-28-days-later-2002-0146858|work=[[Rolling Stone]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "East Hastings" does not appear on the ''[[28 Days Later: The Soundtrack Album]]'' because the rights to the song could not be obtained.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/nov/10/features.review27|title=Get used to the limelight|accessdate=February 15, 2009|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|author=Empire, Kitty|work=Guardian.co.uk | location=London | date=November 10, 2002|authorlink=Kitty Empire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Godspeed You! Black Emperor was formed in 1994 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], by [[Efrim Menuck]] ([[Electric guitar|guitar]]), [[Mike Moya]] (guitar), and [[Mauro Pezzente]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]).&lt;ref name="Wire"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire.html|title=Interview in The Wire|year=1998|author=David Keenan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band took its name from ''[[God Speed You! Black Emperor]]'', a 1976 Japanese [[black-and-white]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] by director [[Mitsuo Yanagimachi]], which follows the exploits of a [[Bōsōzoku|Japanese biker gang]], the Black Emperors.&lt;ref name="Wire"/&gt; The band initially assembled after being offered a supporting act for another local band named Steak 72.&lt;ref name="wire2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire2.html|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! interview with ''The Wire''|accessdate=February 24, 2009|year=2000|author=Keenan, David|work=brainwashed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the trio performed live on a few separate occasions, before ultimately deciding to produce an album. The cassette, ''[[All Lights Fucked on the Hairy Amp Drooling]]'', was self-released in December 1994 and limited to thirty-three copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cstrecords.com/html/allfucked.html|title=Godspeed&amp;nbsp;– ''All Lights Fucked'' Cassette|accessdate=December 17, 2006|publisher=Constellation Records|year=2000|author=Constellation Records|work=Godspeed Releases |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304001438/http://www.cstrecords.com/html/allfucked.html |archivedate=March 4, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the limited release of the cassette, the band quickly expanded and continued to perform live periodically. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: "It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they would sort of join up."&lt;ref name="brainwashed1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/interviews/amazeine.htm|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor interview with ''aMAZEzine!''|accessdate=February 14, 2009|year=1998|author=St-Jacques, Marie-Douche|work=aMAZEzine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short order, the group's numbers ebbed and flowed. Local musicians would often join the band for a handful of performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of ''[[F♯ A♯ ∞]]''.&lt;ref name="brainwashed1"/&gt;  After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and [[David Bryant (musician)|David Bryant]] on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively.  Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on [[HṚṢṬA]], being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of [[Fly Pan Am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You !

Although various members of the band are often pinned down as [[anarchism|anarchists]], for a rather long time no one in the band explicitly subscribed to this label;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.expressnightout.com/2008/05/allusions_of_grandeur_thee_silver_mt_zio/ |title=Allusions of Grandeur: Thee Silver Mt. Zion |publisher=Expressnightout.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, as of 2014, Menuck was calling himself an anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubsam|first=Rob|url=http://therumpus.net/2014/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-efrim-menuck/|title=The Rumpus Interview with Efrim Menuck|publisher=The Rumpus|accessdate=May 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, there is a strong political component to the band's music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Mark|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/|title="Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!" Review|publisher=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[liner notes]] to ''Yanqui U.X.O.'' describe the song "09-15-00" as "[[Ariel Sharon]] surrounded by 1,000 [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli soldiers]] marching on [[al-Aqsa Mosque|al-Haram Ash-Sharif]] &amp; provoking another [[Second Intifada|Intifada]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You!

Members of the group have formed a number of [[side project]]s, including [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra &amp; Tra-La-La Band]], [[Fly Pan Am]], [[HṚṢṬA]], [[Esmerine]], and [[Set Fire to Flames]].

The band released the CD versions of its first two albums and EP on the [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]] record label, and released the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s through Constellation Records. All editions of their subsequent studio material have been released through Constellation.

In 2004, long-time guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig left the band on amicable terms to devote more time to [[Fly Pan Am]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former Godspeed You!

The group was once misconstrued as being a band of terrorists.&lt;ref name="cstimages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst_images/gybeimages_web.jpg |title=Godspeed You!

She quickly passed a note to another customer asking them to call the police. When the local police appeared, the group was held until it could be questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some photos it had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence.  After [[background check]]s were run, the ensemble was released from custody and continued on its way to its next show in Saint Louis,  [[Columbia, MO|MO]]. [[Efrim Menuck]] later spoke to the crowd during their appearance in Missouri about what happened to them and speculated that their origin was a motive for being released quickly ("It's a good thing we're nice white kids from Canada").&lt;ref name="2003-03-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-03-16.shn|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at Mississippi Nights (2003-03-16)|accessdate=December 24, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was mentioned in [[Michael Moore]]'s book ''[[Dude, Where's My Country?]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Noteworthy Facts You May Not Know About Godspeed You!

In 2010, the band reported it was reuniting for an [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music event in the UK as well as further US dates. Mike Moya re-joined the band for the reunion, while original cellist Norsola Johnson declined to participate. The band played a full North American and European tour in 2011, and more dates in the UK including an appearance at the ATP '[[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|I'll Be Your Mirror]]' music festival in London.

In 2011, in an interview with Voir, band member Bruce Cawdron announced that the band was working on new material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laveaux|first=Oliver|title=Godspeed prépare un nouveau disque|url=http://www.voir.ca/blogs/nouvelles_musique/archive/2011/05/27/godspeed-pr-233-pare-un-nouveau-disque.aspx|work=Voir Magazine|publisher=Voir|accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 28, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago.  On March 15, 2012, it was announced that the band would be performing at the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festival in New York.&lt;ref name="atpibym2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012.php |title=I'll Be Your Mirror USA 2012 curated by Greg Dulli &amp; ATP - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |date= |accessdate=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drummer Timothy Herzog began touring with the band upon the departure of Bruce Cawdron.

In 2013, the band won the [[Polaris Music Prize]], but it criticized the cost of the ceremony during the time of austerity, stating, "Maybe the next celebration should happen in a cruddier hall, without the corporate banners and culture overlords."&lt;ref name="Polaris"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24231672 |title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor criticise Polaris prize |accessdate=September 25, 2013|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2015, Godspeed You! Black Emperor released its fifth album, ''[[Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress]]''.&lt;ref name=cst111&gt;{{cite web|title=GY!BE - 'Asunder, Sweet And Other Distress' - Constellation Records|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst111/|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 22, 2017, the group released its sixth album, ''[[Luciferian Towers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Luciferian Towers"|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst126/|website=Constellation Records|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Live concerts==
Film loop projections are an important aspect of the group's live show, explained by [[Efrim Menuck]] as "[putting] the whole into context".&lt;ref name="oorinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/oor.html|title=Interview with Godspeed You Black Emperor!|accessdate=December 24, 2006|publisher=OOR|year=2001|author=Visser, Menno|work=OOR Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the band is taper-friendly—that is, it allows audience members to record its live performances—fans often release new material before the band makes an official recording.&lt;ref name="archive1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-05-14.shnf|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at L'Olympic (2003-05-14)|accessdate=December 17, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shnf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band toured Australia/New Zealand for the first time in February 2013, including a performance at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival in Melbourne on February 16.

The band toured China for the first time in April 2013, giving performances in Shanghai and Beijing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor China Tour|url=http://www.spli-t.com/gybe/en/|website=Spli-t|date=April 1, 2013|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revisited China in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godspeed You!

The band supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on its [[Twenty Thirteen Tour|Tension tour]] in October 2013, starting at the [[TD Garden]] in [[Boston]] on October 11.&lt;ref name="nintour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/51053-nine-inch-nails-announce-massive-tour-with-godspeed-you-black-emperor/|title=Nine Inch Nails Announce Massive Tour With Godspeed You! Black Emperor|accessdate=June 6, 2013|publisher=Pitchfork|year=2013|author=Minsker, Evan|work=Pitchfork}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a break for much of 2014 the band embarked on a busy schedule of concert and festival dates across North America, Europe and around the world during 2015 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/godspeed-you-black-emperor-63d69a73.html|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor Concert Setlists|website=setlist.fm|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new songs were previewed in many of the shows picking up the fan titles "Buildings" and "Railroads" from the projections that accompanied them. The band also lent live performances of some of their older and current tracks to a revival of the 2005 work "monumental", by Canadian dance troupe, [[Holy Body Tattoo]] during 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bam.org/dance/2016/monumental|title=monumental|website=BAM.org|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''In Good Company''''' is a 2004 American comedy-drama film written and directed by [[Paul Weitz (filmmaker)|Paul Weitz]], and starring [[Dennis Quaid]], [[Topher Grace]], and [[Scarlett Johansson]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web|title=In Good Company (2004) |work=The New York Times |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/305232/In-Good-Company/overview |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is about a middle-aged advertising executive whose company is bought out by a large international corporation leaving him with a new boss who is nearly half his age. His life is further complicated when his boss takes a romantic interest in his daughter.

==Plot==
Dan Foreman ([[Dennis Quaid]]) is a 51-year-old advertising executive and head of sales for ''Sports America'', a major sports magazine. Happily married with two daughters, Dan faces a life-changing event when his magazine is bought out by Globecom, an international corporation that promotes the corporate concept of "synergy". After he is forced to fire several of his longtime colleagues, Dan is demoted and becomes the "wingman" of his new boss, Carter Duryea ([[Topher Grace]]), a 26-year-old business school prodigy. While Dan develops clients through handshake deals and relationships, Carter champions the corporate creed of synergy, cross-promoting the magazine with the cell phone division and "Krispity Krunch", a snack food also owned by Globecom.

Dan and Carter are both facing challenges in their personal lives. Dan is supporting two daughters—16-year-old Jana ([[Zena Grey]]) and 18-year-old Alex ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) who is preparing to enter college—and learns that his wife is pregnant with their third child. Meanwhile, Carter is dumped by his adulterous, narcissistic wife of seven months and focuses all of his energy on work. With Dan facing the financial realities of taking out a second [[mortgage]], to cover his daughter's college education costs, and a new child, and with Carter needing Dan's practical, real-life experience in the field of advertising, the two form an uneasy friendship.

Carter, who has been struggling with loneliness following the breakup of his marriage, invites himself to dinner at Dan's house, where he meets Dan's daughter, Alex, and the two quickly form an attraction. Their initial friendship allows Carter to forget his loneliness, and Alex, who is now attending New York University, is able to escape her own loneliness and boredom. In the coming days, Carter and Alex spend time together and become romantically involved. Fearful of offending her father, they keep their relationship a secret for the time being.

Their friendship, however, takes a turn for the worse when Dan discovers that Carter and Alex have been seeing each other, approaches them in a restaurant, and punches his boss in the face. The confrontation with her father convinces Alex to break up with Carter who is heartbroken. Soon after, Globecom CEO Teddy K visits the sales office and during a grand speech to all the employees on synergy and other similar corporate business strategies, he is questioned by Dan and shrugs him off. Carter's boss, Mark Steckle, tells Carter to fire Dan. Carter refuses, claiming that losing Dan will cost them a major advertising contract. Steckle gives them 24 hours to seal the contract or be fired. Dan has developed a long term relationship with the client, and Carter gives way to Dan's personal approach. The strategy works, and they conclude a deal.

Following another corporate shakeup, ''Sports America'' is sold off, Carter is let go, and Dan returns to his former position as head of sales. Having developed fatherly feelings toward Carter, Dan offers him a position in his new department as his "wingman", but Carter refuses, admitting he needs to take some time off and examine what he really wants to do in his life. On his way out of the building, Carter runs into Alex, and they exchange pleasantries. Dan's wife gives birth to a girl. He calls Carter (who is jogging outdoors for the first time and feels like a new man) with the news.

The '''International Association for Quantitative Finance''' (IAQF), formerly the '''International Association of Financial Engineers''' (IAFE), is a non-profit professional society dedicated to fostering the fields of [[Mathematical finance|quantitative finance]] and [[financial engineering]]. The IAQF hosts several panel discussions throughout the year to discuss the issues that affect the industry from both academic and professional angles. Since it was established in 1992, the IAQF has expanded its reach to host events in [[San Francisco]], [[Toronto]], [[Boston]], and [[London]].

==Fischer Black Memorial Foundation==
The educational arm of the IAQF is the [[Fischer Black]] Memorial Foundation (FBMF). While the IAQF focuses on the profession of financial engineering, the FBMF aims to expose students to the financial engineering field and help them work towards a career in the industry. Financial engineering is often underrepresented on university campuses and the FBMF tries to bridge the gap between academia and the professional world. The main tool of the FBMF is the very successful "How I Became a Quant" event series that bring professionals to college campuses to tell students about their experiences getting into the field. The FBMF also co-hosts (along with [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics|SIAM]] and [[New York University]]) an annual [[career fair]] that draws students from all over the country to meet with the premier hiring companies in the industry. This is one of the only career fairs that is specifically for financial engineering and it is hugely popular with both the students and companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaqf.org/fischer-black-memorial-foundation |title=Fischer Black Memorial Foundation (FBMF) |publisher=International Association for Quantitative Finance |accessdate=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

The IAQF is known for the quality of its events and the prestige of the panelists who present. Often, these events are evening panels with 3–4 speakers; both practitioners and academics typically sit on these panels. Much of the information presented at these events is available afterward on the IAQF website.

Every year, the IAQF honors one member of the financial engineering world with its Financial Engineer of the Year (FEOY) award. The winner is selected through an exhaustive nomination and voting process and the list of former winners illustrates the high standards that the nominees must meet. Former FEOY recipients continue to serve the IAQF as Senior Fellows and include such notable names as [[Myron Scholes]], [[Robert C. Merton|Robert Merton]], [[William F. Sharpe|William Sharpe]], and [[Jonathan E. Ingersoll|Jonathan Ingersoll]].

The winner of the FEOY is celebrated at an annual Gala-dinner hosted by the IAQF and traditionally held at the United Nations building in New York City. This event is attended by many of the most distinguished members of the field and is one of the most important evenings on the IAQF calendar.

The IAQF hosts an annual conference in the late spring, which is an all day event which includes some of the biggest names in the industry. The schedule consists of 2–3 panels and a keynote speech by the previous year’s Financial Engineer of the Year, all of which circle around one common theme.

==Board of directors==
The IAQF is currently presided over by a 15-member Board of Directors. The members of the Board come from many different backgrounds and include many influential names in the industry. This diverse group controls the biggest decisions of the IAQF and helps ensure that the organization is fulfilling its mission towards the growth of financial engineering.

==Committees==
The IAQF comprises six committees: the Credit Risk, Education, Investor Risk, Liquidity Risk, Operational Risk, and Technology Committees each focus on a narrow view of [[financial engineering]]. Doing so enables the IAQF to stay up-to-date on advancements from all over the industry as well as organize well-developed, specific topics at each of their events, which are typically presented by one of the committees.

'''Izaak Enschedé''' (16 April 1681, [[Haarlem]] &amp;ndash; 1 May 1761, Haarlem) was the founder of the printing company Royal [[Joh. Enschedé]] in 1703.&lt;ref name="NNBW"&gt;Zuidema, [http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=4&amp;page=293&amp;size=800&amp;accessor=accessor_index Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek] p.572 (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the son of Johannes Enschda (baptised 18 July 1642, Groningen &amp;ndash; 4 October 1706, Haarlem) and Elisabeth Jansdochter van den Berg (27 April 1632, Haarlem &amp;ndash; 18 July 1723, Haarlem).

On 29 October 1702 in Haarlem he married Beeltje van der Lucht (22 January 1677, Haarlem &amp;ndash; 8 March 1756, Haarlem), daughter of Barend Stevenzoon van der Lucht en Jozijntje Marchant.&lt;ref&gt;Het huis Enschedé, 1703-1953, Joh.Enschedé en zonen, Haarlem, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

Until then Enschedé worked for the [[Opregte Haarlemsche Courant]] that was owned by the heirs of [[Vincent Casteleyn]].&lt;ref name="NNBW"/&gt; Together with his son [[Johannes Enschedé (1708-1780)|Johannes]], they  bought the newspaper in 1737, the same year they were named city publisher by the council of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="NNBW"/&gt; The family business went well and they took over the typesetting business of the Amsterdam publisher Hendrik Floris Wetstein in 1743, which had fonts designed by the punchcutter [[Joan Michaël Fleischman]].&lt;ref name="NNBW"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2521">'''James Frost''' (1780?-1840?) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[cement]] manufacturer who invented processes that led to the eventual development of [[Portland cement]].

== Biography ==

Frost was born in [[Finchley]], [[Middlesex]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis A J, ''The Cement Industry 1796-1914'', David &amp; Charles, 1977, {{ISBN|0-7153-7386-2}}, pp61''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;  He set up a plant making [[Roman cement]] at [[Harwich]] in 1807, supplying it for government work.  He began experimenting with formulations for "artificial" cements that would provide a cheaper alternative to Roman cement.  He appears to have produced a prototype cement at Harwich in 1810.  However, it was not until 1822 that he was granted a patent for what he called "British Cement".  In October 1825, he leased land at [[Swanscombe]], [[Kent]], and set up a plant to manufacture both Roman cement and the new product.

The key innovation in his work was the "wet" grinding of raw materials, which became fundamental to the early development of Portland cement.  He ground the soft local [[chalk]] together with alluvial [[clay]] from the [[River Medway|Medway]] estuary and added water in a [[Rawmill#Wet rawmills|washmill]] to produce a thin slurry from which coarse particles could be removed by settling.  The fine, homogenous mixture of chalk and clay particles was dried to a stiff plastic consistency before being burned in a [[cement kiln|kiln]].  He thus emulated the natural process of sedimentary formation of a [[marl]].  

[[Charles Pasley]] communicated frequently with Frost, and gave a detailed description of his techniques&lt;ref&gt;Pasley C W, ''Observations on Lime, Calcareous Cements etc'', 1838, appendices 14-16&lt;/ref&gt; based on a visit to Swanscombe in December 1828.  In 1832, he sold the Swanscombe plant to John Bazely White's, and migrated to [[New York City]], where he set up as a [[civil engineer]].  He contributed several papers on calcareous cements to the Journal of the [[Franklin Institute]].

His Swanscombe plant became in the 1840s, under the management of [[Isaac Charles Johnson|I C Johnson]], the second plant to make true Portland cement, and subsequently the "mother" plant of [[Blue Circle Industries]].  It closed in 1990, after 165 years of continuous operation.

'''Jarek Kolář''' (born '''Jaroslav Kolář'''; November 8, 1977)&lt;ref name="register"&gt;Commercial register at justice.cz, identification number (IČ) 25513648, PTERODON, s.r.o., the Articles (in Czech ''společenská smlouva'') were signed on 17 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; is a Czech [[game design|video game designer]].

In the early 1990s he enjoyed playing [[LucasArts adventure games]], especially ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure|Indy III]]'' and ''[[The Secret of Monkey Island|Monkey Island I]]''.&lt;ref name="excalibur"&gt;Haquel P. Tickwa, ''Na hraní už nemáme čas'', Excalibur 36, page 6 (interview with Petr Vlček and Jaroslav Kolář)&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at the secondary school ''Gymnázium Slovanské náměstí'' in [[Brno]], he met programmer Petr Vlček and they together created a parody of ''Monkey Island'' where [[Guybrush Threepwood|Guybrush]] ([[Transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] as Gájbraš) had to escape from an island inhabited by [[donkey]]s.&lt;ref name="beginnings"&gt;Petr Ticháček, ''[http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/clanky/jarek-kolar-o-pocatcich-cz-herni-sceny-d8t-/clanek.A000620_jarekkolarzacatky_bw.idn Jarek Kolář o počátcích CZ herní scény]'', 21. June 2000, bonusweb.idnes.cz (interview with Jarek Kolář)&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent was LeGek, a brother of [[LeChuck]] (with reference to the book ''[[Chuk and Gek]]'' by [[Arkady Gaidar]] about the adventures of brothers Chuk and Gek in "the great and happy country named [[Soviet Union]]", a compulsory reading for school children in communist [[Czechoslovakia]]).&lt;ref&gt;A. Gajdar, ''Čuk a Gek : Mimočítanková četba pro školy všeobec. vzdělávací'', translated to Czech language by Olga Ptáčková-Macháčková, 9th edition, SPN Praha 1979 (the book, written shortly after Stalin's [[Great Purge]], ends with the following sentence: "And they all new and understood that they have to be honest, work a lot, truly love and protect the great and happy country named Soviet Union")&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kyklop.blokuje.cz/196540-ohlednuti-i-8211-ze-ctenarskeho-denniku.php (sample excerpt from so called "Readers Diary" rated by the schoolteacher)&lt;/ref&gt;

Petr Vlček at the time only had an [[Atari 8-bit family|8-bit Atari 800]] and therefore developed the game editor and engine at school.&lt;ref name="excalibur" /&gt; Jarek drew the locations and wrote the plot.&lt;ref name="excalibur" /&gt; While on a school trip to [[Polička]], Jarek decided to skip a lunch with his classmates and instead went to find the [[panelák]] where entrepreneur Petr Vochozka lived at the time.&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt; Two weeks later, Vochozka saw their demo and agreed to produce and distribute the game.&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt; ''The Secret of Donkey Island'', released in June 1994 after two years of development,  is considered the first Czech commercially successful [[point-and-click]] graphical adventure.&lt;ref&gt;Petr Ticháček, ''[http://plnehry.idnes.cz/adventury/tajemstvi-osliho-ostrova-prvni-cz-hra-dhp-/clanek.A000618_054606_bw-plneHry-adventury_bw.idn Tajemství Oslího ostrova - první CZ hra]'', plnehry.idnes.cz, 20. June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The sales were supported by an enthusiastic review written by Petr Vochozka for Czech game magazine ''Excalibur''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/pc/clanky/ceske-adventury-dil-1-0ri-/clanek.A000125_ceskeadventury1_bw.idn. České adventury - díl 1]'', bonusweb.idnes.cz&lt;/ref&gt; In the following months Petr Vlček and Jarek Kolář created an adventure game called ''Seven Days and Seven Nights'', based on a story about a [[promiscuity|womanizer]] written by Petr Vochozka for a semi-developed [[Amiga]] game.&lt;ref&gt;Zdeněk Polách, Petr Ticháček, ''[http://bonusweb.idnes.cz/clanky/jarek-kolar-rekapituluje-7-dni-a-7-noci-dsy-/tisk.A000219_jarekkolar_bw.idn Jarek Kolář rekapituluje 7 dní a 7 nocí]'', BonusWeb.cz, (interview with Jarek Kolář)&lt;/ref&gt;

After working for a while for German game development companies, Jarek Kolář and programmer Michal Janáček founded the company [[Pterodon (company)|PTERODON, s.r.o.]] in October 1997.&lt;ref name="register" /&gt; In May 1998 they started development of a new 3D game, released in 2000 as ''[[Flying Heroes]]''. Thanks to Petr Vochozka, who in 1997 founded with Jan Kudera [[Illusion Softworks]],&lt;ref&gt;Commercial register at justice.cz, identification number (IČ) 25347004 (till 2002 Jan Kudera held most of his stake in Illusion Softworks via his company Cash Reform Group, s.r.o.)&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Hidden &amp; Dangerous]]'' was successfully released in 1999, and was followed by ''[[Flying Heroes]]'' in 2000.  Both were distributed by [[Take-Two Interactive]].

Pterodon closely cooperated with Illusion Softworks; their teams shared one [[open plan|open space]] in an administrative building in Brno.&lt;ref&gt;Pavel Pospíšil, ''Rozhovor s Illusion Softworks'', Computer, 25. January 2000 (interview with Petr Vochozka)&lt;/ref&gt; Jarek was lead designer of the [[tactical shooter|tactical]] first-person shooter [[Vietcong (video game)|Vietcong]], released by Pterodon/IS in 2003. One of the last released games Jarek contributed to is ''[[Mafia II]]'' (senior gameplay producer).&lt;ref&gt;2K Games, ''Mafia II'' manual&lt;/ref&gt;

Kolář later joined newly formed Hangar 13 and contributed to [[Mafia III]] until he returned to the Czech Republic and joined [[Bohemia Interactive]] where he currently works on a new game. He also worked on a story for [[Dead Effect]] and [[Dead Effect 2]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2706">'''Juan Luis Bosch Gutierrez''' (born 1952) was  born in [[Guatemala]].  He is Co-President and Board Member of Corporación Multi Inversiones (CMI), a large agro-industrial conglomerate which, according to an article in El Diario de Hoy, is one of the largest circulating newspapers in El Salvador, and one of the biggest corporations in Central America. Founded in 1920, CMI now has near 30,000 employees, operating in 13 countries with seven divisions: poultry and pork; Pollo Campero and other fast food restaurants; flour mills, pasta and cookie production; construction; renwable power generation and financial services.

Mr. Bosch is listed as a past president of the Committee of Agriculture, Commerce, Industry and Finance Association (CACIF), on the CACIF website, and is also  listed as a past president of the Industry Chamber (Cámara de Industria de Guatemala) on the Industry Chamber’s website.  He is a Member of the [[Council of the Americas]], an organization of some of the largest blue chip companies in the U.S. and whose stated goal is to promote free trade, democracy and open markets throughout the  Americas.  Mr. Bosch sits on the Board of Directors of the Juan Bautista Gutierrez Foundation (Fundación Juan Bautista Gutierrez).  This Foundation has supported several community projects such as “Help Those Who Help,” which according to ''[[Siglo Veintiuno]]'', one of the leading [[newspapers in Guatemala]], provides funds to projects for the needy.  Mr. Bosch’s participation in efforts to improve public education is evidenced through his membership on the Board of the [[Universidad del Valle de Guatemala]] Foundation, which supports educational programs in Guatemala to improve the quality of life of the Guatemalan population through education.  He supports the initiative “Plan Visión de País,” an inter-institutional effort to create a long term  development plan for the country of Guatemala.

'''Lee Jae-yong''' ({{lang|ko|이재용}}; born 23 June 1968), known professionally in the West as '''Jay Y. Lee''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/south-korea-court-denies-arrest-of-samsung-heir-jay-y-lee|title=A Chinese Court Rejects Arrest of Samsung Heir Jay Y. Lee|date=2017-01-18|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|access-date=2017-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[South Korea]]n business magnate and the [[vice chairman]] of [[Samsung Group]], serving as de facto head. He is the eldest child and only son of [[Hong Ra-hee]] and [[Lee Kun-hee]], Chairman of [[Samsung]], and is widely considered to be his father's future successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38997370|title=Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong arrested in South Korea|date=2017-02-17|publisher=BBC News|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is referred to as the "Crown Prince of Samsung" by the South Korean media, and speaks Korean, English and Japanese.&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-samsungs-crown-prince-in-focus-as-father-hospitalized-2014-13|title=All Eyes Are On Samsung's 'Crown Prince'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee is estimated to be worth US$7.9 billion, making him the third wealthiest person in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jay-y-lee/|title=Jay Y. Lee|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Lee was named the world's 35th most powerful person and the most powerful Korean by [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People]] along with his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/#tab:overall|title=The World's Most Powerful People}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Jae-yong was born in Seoul, South Korea to [[Lee Kun-hee]]. He received his [[B.A.]] in East Asian history from [[Seoul National University]],&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-lee-newsmaker-idUSBRE8B40A220121205|title=Jay Lee, Samsung's unassuming heir apparent|date=5 December 2016|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] from [[Keio University]]. He attended [[Harvard Business School]] for about five years in pursuit of a [[Doctor of Business Administration]] degree, but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lee  |first1=Jungah  |last2=Clenfield |first2= Jason |date=26 August 2014|title=Samsung Low-Profile Heir Poised to Succeed Father Seen as a God |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-08-26/samsung-low-profile-heir-poised-to-succeed-father-seen-as-god- |publisher=[[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at Samsung==
Jae-yong started working for [[Samsung]] in 1991. He began serving as Vice President of Strategic Planning and then as "Chief Customer Officer", a management position created exclusively for Lee. His prospects for future company leadership dimmed when his father Kun-hee stepped down as Chairman due to [[tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://go.bloomberg.com/tech-blog/2012-12-05-how-samsung-is-developing-its-next-generation-leader/|title=Technology - Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, however, his succession prospects revived when Lee became the [[Chief Operating Officer]] of [[Samsung Electronics]]. Since December 2012, he has been [[Vice Chairman]] of Samsung. He is one of the main shareholders of Samsung's financial services subsidiary, owning 11 percent of [[Samsung SDS]].&lt;ref name="businessinsider.com"/&gt;

=== Court Appearances  ===
In January 2017, Lee was accused "of bribery, embezzlement and perjury" by the South Korean prosecutor's office,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/business/21715037-investors-have-stayed-cool-despite-probe-samsung-lee-jae-yong-dodges-arrest-charges|title=Lee Jae-yong dodges arrest on charges of bribery|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after an investigation, he was arrested on February 16, 2017. On August 25, 2017 Lee was sentenced to 5 years in prison after being found guilty of corruption. The appeals court suspended his sentence on February 5, 2018 and reduced it to 2.5 years, releasing him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/5/16972818/samsung-ceo-wins-bribery-appeal|title=Samsung heir Lee Jae-yong released from prison on appeal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The arrest of Jay Y. Lee was largely prompted by the investigation of the [[2016 South Korean political scandal|Choi Soon-sil scandal]], that could be traced back to the shift of the father-to-son ownership of Samsung in 2014. His involvement in bribery with the then-South Korean President was first brought to the table by an arrest warrant issued by the South Korea prosecutor's office in January, which led to his arrest in mid-February.{{cn|date=April 2017}} On January 12, 2017, the special prosecutor's office said it would decide "soon" whether to seek an [[arrest warrant]] for Lee. He was questioned for more than 22 hours for suspicion of illegal activities including [[bribery]] in a scandal that consumed president [[Park Geun-hye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Korea prosecutor to decide 'soon' whether to seek arrest warrant for Samsung's Lee|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-politics-samsung-group-war-idUSKBN14X07C?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews|accessdate=13 January 2017|agency=Reuters|date=13 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James_L._Hulett.jpg|thumb]]
'''Sir James Liege Hulett''' (17 May 1838 – 1928) was a [[magnate|sugar magnate]], politician and [[philanthropist]] in [[Colony of Natal]], [[South Africa]]. Hulett founded what would become [[Tongaat Hulett Sugar]] in 1892. The [[JSE Securities Exchange]]-listed company is today a multi-billion [[South African rand|rand]] corporation.

==Career==
James Liege Hulett was originally from [[Kent]], and arrived in Durban at the end of May 1857, aboard the Lady Shelbourne with 20 pounds and an offer of a position with a chemist Mr. Burgess, a friend of his father. In 1860 he advertised for a farm in the Nonoti area and successfully leased an area of 600 acres, which he called Kearsney. He experimented with maize, sweet potatoes, chillies, arrowroot and coffee and also established a trading store. Soon Liege Hulett commanded a flourishing business, which enabled him to purchase several farms in the area. It was at Kearsney that he established a thriving tea estate, which was the foundation of the company Sir J.L. Hulett &amp; Sons. This was also the start of his sugar empire.

Liege Hulett took the name of his estate from an old village and medieval manor not far from Dover in Kent, England. The name Kearsney derives from the French "Cressoniere" meaning a place where watercress is grown. The double-storied Kearsney house with a small turret projecting above the roof level was erected on the highest point of the estate and built on the farm. He created at Kearsney a place of peace and harmony which inspired others to improve and beautify their own estates.

Kearsney House was a well made and designed mansion with large, furnished reception rooms and 22 bedrooms. The home held an ever open door to passing travellers and on Sundays there would be great family gatherings after morning service. There was a big staff of Indian servants. Liege Hulett was loved and respected by his Indian and African employees. When tea production ceased on Kearsney, the ornamental trees protecting the tea gardens were replaced with sugar cane. Sir Liege imported many varieties of seeds and plants of a wide range of fruits – guavas, cloves, mangoes, apples etc., citrus of all kinds and planted orchards near Kearsney House.

During the period 1868 to 1887 the eight children of Liege Hulett and Mary Balcomb were all born at Kearsney. The boys became expert craftsmen and helped to build the Kearsney homestead, while the girls helped in the house with sewing and other domestic chores. During the Bhambatha rebellion the pioneers of Natal lived under difficult and often dangerous conditions; neighbours were few and far between. Kearsney was only nine miles from the Zulu border and in 1879 when war broke out, there was considerable alarm at Kearsney. The Zulu impies raided within 15 miles of the home, carrying off and killing the cattle of friendly natives. Kearsney residence was fortified by means of a stockade and became the centre of resistance against the expected Zulu attack. One day the alarm was given that the Zulus had crossed the river. All the neighbours, their children and their servants flocked into the laager, which remained in a state of siege, but was never attacked.

Sir Leige Hulett was a cabinet minister in a number of Natal Governments and was the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in 1902 when he led the Natal delegation to the [[Coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra|coronation]] of King [[Edward VII]]. He was knighted for his services to the Colony in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804| }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27479 |date=3 October 1902|page=6273}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Liege then moved to Durban and Kearsney House remained vacant until 1921.

Another legacy of Sir Liege's is his founding of [[Kearsney College]] in 1921, a now world-famous [[private school]] for boys. Sir Liege cherished the idea of establishing a boys' school for Methodist ministers and their sons and those of the families of the free churches. He considered Kearsney House to be ideally suited for this purpose. On 29 November 1920 a contract was signed with the Wesleyan Church for the use of Kearsney House as a school. This was the birth of Kearsney College and remains a living memorial to Sir Liege. The school opened with 11 boys. Kearsney College remained at the Kearsney Estate until June 1939 when it moved to its present site at Botha's Hill between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. The decision to move the school was based on the reluctance of parents to send their sons to a school on the north coast that suffered many cases of malaria in the 1930s, although none were reported at Kearsney.

The house then became known as St. Lukes Home of Healing, which was home to mentally and physically challenged patients. In November 2004, Kearsney House was bought by Paul and Erica Kalil of Kloof, who have made it their ongoing challenge to renovate and restore the home to its former glory.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13091">'''R-phrases''' (short for '''risk phrases''') are defined in Annex III of [[European Union]] [[Directive 67/548/EEC]]: ''Nature of special risks attributed to dangerous substances and preparations''. The list was consolidated and republished in Directive 2001/59/EC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32001L0059:EN:HTML|title=EUR-Lex - 32001L0059 - EN|work=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; where translations into other EU languages may be found.

These risk phrases are used internationally, not just in Europe, and there is an ongoing effort towards complete international harmonization using the [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals]] (GHS) which now generally replaces these risk phrases.

'''Louis Joseph Coralie''' (1912–1967) was the first [[Mauritius|Mauritian]] to be involved in the [[Mauritian politics]]. He was born in 1912 in [[Mauritius]].

He participated in the 1953 Mauritius Legislative Council elections&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://electoral.govmu.org/English/electionresult/nasselec/Documents/1953%20Elections.pdf |title=1953 Elections |date=August 23, 1953 |publisher=govmu.org |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1954, Louis Joseph Coralie founded the political newspaper ''[[L'Epee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |date=1953 |title=Report on Mauritius - Great Britain Commonwealth Office |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BUIVAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Louis+Joseph+Coralie&amp;dq=Louis+Joseph+Coralie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwA2oVChMI-ruRxs6qyAIVR5-ACh1CAQdX |publisher=H. M. Stationery |page=194 |accessdate=October 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper bought its support to a prolonged anti-[[Hindu]] campaign in Mauritius between 1954 and 1962. Joseph Coralie has brought his contribution in the Mauritius politics and was an ally of the Mauritian Party led by [[Jules Koenig]]. On 25 April 1956, Coralie was found guilty of [[slander]] and was ordered to pay a considerable fine to Teeluckparsad Callychurn, director of the Mauritius Post Office.

In 1958, Louis Joseph Coralie invented an 'electric' [[riding crop]]. Coralie, a member of the Mauritius Turf Club, was later arrested and imprisoned for using the electric riding crop in order to win races. Coralie was also wanted for conspiracy, but managed to evade prosecution. He was married to Marie Eliane Choyen with whom he had five children. Louis Joseph Coralie died in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1967.

'''Marketing performance measurement''' ('''MPM'''), or marketing performance management, is the systematic management of marketing resources and processes to achieve the measurable gain in return on investment and efficiency while maintaining quality in customer experience.&lt;ref&gt;Edited from American Marketing Association, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Marketing performance management is a central facet of the marketing operations function within [[marketing]] departments.

Marketing performance management relies on a set of measurable performance standards, a pointed focus on outcomes, and clear lines of accountability (i.e. roles and consequences). Measurement  management is based on six success factors: 1) alignment, 2) accountability, 3) analytics, 4) automation, 5) alliances, and 6) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Marketers Not Providing Info C-Level Execs Need for Strategic Thinking, Marketing Performance Management Study, VisionEdge Marketing with Forrester, Demand Metric and ITSMA, 2001-2015, http://www.cmo.com.au/article/462886/marketers_providing_info_c-level_execs_need_strategic_thinking/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alignment==
Alignment of marketing activities and investments to business outcomes occurs when a marketing organization establishes a direct connection between marketing activities, investments and business outcomes.

Alignment begins with customer insights, to ensure that the marketing performance management approach will be rewarded by the marketplace.  Alignment with enterprise objectives ensures that marketing efforts are in sync with what the company is striving to achieve. Enterprise goals can be cascaded to the business unit level and then to the department level to maintain consistency and drive synergy both horizontally and vertically. Marketing objectives that are developed this way can be cascaded to all of the marketing sub-functions for alignment.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Science Institute, 2005, http://www.msi.org/reports/aligning-the-organization-with-the-market/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accountability==
Accountability is the monitoring and measurement of the achievement a person, group, or organization makes to deliver specific, defined results relating to the enterprise’s objectives. This requires selecting the right metrics, integrating performance targets, and producing actionable reports 

Accountability includes making a commitment to a particular action, accepting responsibility for completing that action and then disclosing the level of performance  against your commitment. Accountability requires commitments, metrics, and consequences (positive and negative).

===Metrics===
Measurable performance standards are called metrics, which are the cornerstone of accountability. They   encompass Activity, Output, Operational, and Outcome categories: {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

* "Activity metrics" relate to the number of things done in a process, such as the number of new blog posts or the number of events.
* "Output metrics" relate to the result of a process, such as website traffic, media mentions, or event participants.
* "Operational metrics" relate to the efficiency and effectiveness of a process, such as [[Cost per lead]], revenue per customer, revenue per sales representative, cost per customer, or leads per sales representative.
* "Outcome metrics" relate to the consequences of a process’ outcomes, such as revenue, profit, win rate, pipeline contribution, the share of preference, the share of wallet, or the share of the market.

Each firm should design a simple dashboard with a small set of appropriate metrics, some of which are usually industry-specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruni|first1=Attilio|last2=Cassia|first2=Fabio|last3=Magno|first3=Francesca|title=Marketing performance measurement in hotels, travel agencies and tour operators: a study of current practices|journal=Current Issues in Tourism|date=23 December 2014|volume=20|issue=4|pages=339–345|doi=10.1080/13683500.2014.982521}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20–25
metrics may be sufficient for effective marketing performance management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atkinson|first1=Helen|last2=Brander Brown|first2=Jackie|title=Rethinking performance measures: assessing progress in UK hotels|journal=International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management|date=June 2001|volume=13|issue=3|pages=128–136|doi=10.1108/09596110110388918}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After ensuring the metrics, the marketer should calculate the ROI. ROI is calculated using two primary metrics: the cost to do something, and the outcomes generated as a result. For marketing ROI, the tricky part is determining what constitutes the outcomes and what is your true cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Peppers |first1=Don |last2=Rogers |first2=Martha |title=Return on Customer – How Marketing Actually Creates Value |journal=Marketing Review St. Gallen |date=2011 |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=14 19 |doi=10.1007/s11621-011-0031-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
To manage causes and effects, managers identify Leading Indicators and Lagging Indicators: {{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

* "Leading indicators" are metrics that a manager can monitor before stakeholders see results. They are in-process metrics and process-input metrics that serve as warning signals of output, operational, and outcome metrics.  Within a workflow diagram, the questions represented by a diamond are typical sources of leading indicators. They indicate whether there will be re-work, scrap, waste, or delays in what the process is meant to achieve. They are actionable and predictive. By monitoring leading indicators, managers can intervene to attain higher performance.
* "Lagging indicators" are metrics that a manager’s stakeholders see. They are post-process metrics (i.e. output, operational, or outcome metrics). Lagging indicators are important for seeing the big picture, but they are not actionable in and of themselves.

===Reporting===
Marketing performance can be reported in a wide variety of formats (verbal, pictorial, graphic, tabular, text, dashboard), which are used for accountability and decision-making. Ideally, reports revisit past commitments or forecasts, to enable learning and refinements for future performance.

Dashboards are particularly important in marketing performance management, visually displaying multiple metrics on a single screen or page. This allows managers to monitor performance at a glance, and to be alerted when performance varies significantly above or below expected levels. Ideally, dashboards show the relationships between leading and lagging indicators. This can empower people at every managerial level.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Accountability Standards Board, http://www.themasb.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytics==
Analytics seeks to identify patterns in data by organizing it and applying mathematical and statistical tests.  This fosters fact-based, data-driven customer, product, market and performance decisions and develops models to support scenario analysis and predict potential outcomes.

Marketing analytics is used to create models to understand, monitor, and predict customer behavior, such as likelihood to defect or predisposition to purchase. It can help managers quantify performance, make and optimize channel and mix decisions, or understand the impact of a campaign on a sales list. 

Analytical technologies can help marketers quickly synthesize data from various sources. Analytics convert data to actionable information and models that guide strategic investments and decisions that drive marketing performance.&lt;ref&gt;How CMOs Can Get CFOs on Their Side, Harvard Business Review, 2013, https://hbr.org/2013/11/how-cmos-can-get-cfos-on-their-side/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automation==
Automation of marketing processes reduces manual labor, errors, and inconsistency. It enables timely, personalized messaging to customers, prospects, and other stakeholders.

Automation provides infrastructure for marketing performance management. It spans marketing resource management, campaign automation, business intelligence, data management, reporting platforms, and scenario analysis tools.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Technology Landscape, Chiefmartec, 2015, http://chiefmartec.com/2015/01/marketing-technology-landscape-supergraphic-2015/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alliances==
Alliances are arrangements between companies to create additional value together. Distributors, resellers, marketing agencies, and other companies may co-develop, co-promote, and/or co-deliver various parts of the [[marketing mix]] (product, price, promotion, placement).

Marketing performance management requires information transparency, clear roles, and smooth handoffs between alliance members, both externally and internally. A spirit of alliance among the work groups across the marketing organization, and with other support functions and business units shapes the ecosystem that nurtures or hinders marketing performance. Collaboration cross-functionally is essential to marketing efficiency and effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Top Challenges that Face Marketers, MarCom Central, 2014, http://marcom.com/top-challenges-opportunities-that-face-marketers/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment==
Assessment is the evaluation of strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in marketing performance management. Assessment is typically conducted by benchmarking other organizations or comparing performance to a standard. Ideally, assessment is supported by a culture of genuine concern, dedication, and willingness among management and employees to continually improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;Open Standards Benchmarking for Sales and Marketing, APQC, https://www.apqc.org/content/open-standards-benchmarking-sales-and-marketing&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first part of the 21st century, he has opened his cheque book in an attempt to bring his hometown rugby team to prominence. His signings of international stars such as past Toulon players [[George Gregan]], [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]], [[Sonny Bill Williams]] and [[Tana Umaga]], plus current stars [[Steffon Armitage]], [[Juan Martín Fernández Lobbe]], [[Matt Giteau]], [[Drew Mitchell]], [[Mathieu Bastareaud]], [[Bakkies Botha]] and [[Jonny Wilkinson]],  have led British rugby commentator [[Martin Gillingham]] to call Toulon a "band of galacticos" (an obvious reference to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid's]] [[galácticos|galáctico]] policy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |title=Top 14: Toulon are the Galacticos of the rugby world |first=Martin |last=Gillingham |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331061211/http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/03/27/top-14-toulon-are-the-galacticos-of-the-rugby-world/ |archivedate=2012-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His time at the helm of Toulon has not been without controversy. Most notably, he drew a 130-day dressing room and pitchside ban from Top 14 organizer [[National Rugby League (France)|LNR]] for the following outburst after a narrow Toulon loss to [[ASM Clermont Auvergne|Clermont]] in January 2012:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2011-12/rugby/story/165300.html |title=The perfect finale |first=Martin |last=Gillingham |publisher=''ESPN Scrum'' |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"I had my first refereeing sodomy in the [[2009–10 Top 14 season|[2010]]] semi-final against Clermont. I've just had my second tonight. It appeared to hurt the first time but it was just as bad this time. We will review the images not on [[YouTube]] but on [[YouPorn]]."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nonetheless, his tenure has seen tremendous commercial success for the club. ESPN rugby journalist Ian Moriarty remarked during the [[2012–13 Top 14 season|2012–13 season]],&lt;blockquote&gt;Boudjellal claimed earlier this season that the financial performance of the club meant he no longer needed to put his own cash in. Whatever you think about his penchant for throwing verbal grenades in the media from time to time, his management from a commercial point of view has been impressive. Toulon have increased their turnover by 500% during his tenure, allowing the club to spend right up to the limit of the salary cap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2012-13/rugby/story/183943.html |title=Wilko and Toulon target rare double |first=Ian |last=Moriarty |work=ESPN Scrum |date=2013-05-30 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cartoon from [[Punch (magazine)|Punch Magazine]] Vol. 152, June 27, 1917]]

An '''overdraft''' occurs when money is withdrawn from a [[bank]] account and the available [[balance (accounting)|balance]] goes below zero. In this situation the account is said to be "'''overdrawn'''". If there is a prior agreement with the account provider for an overdraft, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, then [[Interest (finance)|interest]] is normally charged at the agreed rate. If the negative balance exceeds the agreed terms, then [[bank charges|additional fees]] may be charged and higher interest rates may apply.

==History==
The first overdraft facility was set up in 1728 by the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]. The merchant William Hogg was having problems in balancing his books and was able to come to an agreement with the newly established bank that allowed him to withdraw money from his empty account to pay his debts before he received his payments. He was thus the first recipient of cash credit from a [[bank]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/#.UneWvFMqvp0 |title=A short history of overdrafts |publisher=eccount money |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105155745/http://www.eccount.com/financial-news/a-short-history-of-overdrafts/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within decades, the advantages of this system, both for customers and banks, became apparent, and banks across the [[United Kingdom]] adopted this innovation.

With the onset of [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]], new businesses needed an easy form of credit to jump-start their activities, without having to take out loans on securities they didn't necessarily have. The importance of this new financial innovation was recognized by the philosopher [[David Hume]] who described it in one of his essays as 'one of the most ingenious ideas that has been executed in commerce'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbs.com/about/history-100/serving-our-customers/worlds-first-overdraft-authorisation-1728.html |title=World's first overdraft authorisation, 1728 |publisher=Royal Bank of Scotland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921062352/http://www.rbs.com/about/history-100/serving-our-customers/worlds-first-overdraft-authorisation-1728.html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for overdrafts==
Overdrafts occur for a variety of reasons. These may include:
*'''Intentional loan''' – The account holder finds themselves short of money and knowingly makes an insufficient-funds debit. They accept the associated fees and cover the overdraft with their next deposit.
*'''Failure to maintain an accurate account register''' – The account holder doesn't accurately account for activity on their account and overspends through negligence.
*'''ATM overdraft''' – Banks or ATMs may allow cash withdrawals despite insufficient availability of funds. The account holder may or may not be aware of this fact at the time of the withdrawal. If the ATM is unable to communicate with the cardholder's bank, it may automatically authorize a withdrawal based on limits preset by the [[interbank network|authorizing network]].
*'''Temporary deposit hold''' – A deposit made to the account can be placed on hold by the bank. This may be due to [[Regulation CC]] (which governs the placement of holds on deposited checks) or due to individual bank policies. The funds may not be immediately available and lead to overdraft fees.
*'''Unexpected electronic withdrawals''' – At some point in the past the account holder may have authorized electronic withdrawals by a business. This could occur in good faith of both parties if the electronic withdrawal in question is made legally possible by terms of the [[contract]], such as the initiation of a recurring service following a free trial period. The debit could also have been made as a result of a wage garnishment, an offset claim for a taxing agency or a credit account or overdraft with another account with the same bank, or a direct-deposit chargeback in order to recover an overpayment.
*'''Merchant error''' – A merchant may improperly debit a customer's account due to human error. For example, a customer may authorize a $5.00 purchase which may post to the account for $500.00. The customer has the option to recover these funds through [[chargeback]] to the merchant.
*'''Chargeback to merchant''' – A merchant account could receive a [[chargeback]] because of making an improper credit or [[debit card]] charge to a customer or a customer making an unauthorized credit or debit card charge to someone else's account in order to "pay" for goods services from the merchant. It is possible for the chargeback and associated fee to cause an overdraft or leave insufficient funds to cover a subsequent withdrawal or debit from the merchant's account that received the chargeback.
*'''[[Authorization hold]]s''' – When a customer makes a purchase using their debit card without using their PIN, the transaction is treated as a credit transaction. The funds are placed on hold in the customer's account reducing the customer's available balance. However, the merchant doesn't receive the funds until they processes the transaction batch for the period during which the customer's purchase was made. Banks do not hold these funds indefinitely, and so the bank may release the hold before the merchant collects the funds thus making these funds available again. If the customer spends these funds, then barring an interim deposit the account will overdraw when the merchant collects for the original purchase.
*'''[[Bank charge|Bank fee]]s''' – The bank charges a fee unexpected to the account holder, creating a negative balance or leaving insufficient funds for a subsequent debit from the same account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bank fees that overdraw teen's account have mom seeing red: Daniel Ganziano went from having $4.85 to owing more than $200 |last=Yates |first=Jon |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/problemsolver/ct-biz-1208-problem-ganziano-20111208,0,7226121.column |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111093422/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-12-08/business/ct-biz-1208-problem-ganziano-20111208_1_overdraft-fee-tcf-bank-bank-account |archivedate=11 January 2012 |date=8 December 2011 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''{{visible anchor|Playing the float}}''' – The account holder makes a debit while insufficient funds are present in the account believing he will be able to deposit sufficient funds before the debit clears. While many cases of playing the float are done with honest intentions, the time involved in the cheque's clearing and the difference in the processing of debits and credits are exploited by those committing [[check kiting]].
*'''Returned check deposit''' – The account holder deposits a cheque or money order and the deposited item is returned due to [[non-sufficient funds]], a closed account, or being discovered to be counterfeit, stolen, altered, or forged. As a result of the cheque chargeback and associated fee, an overdraft results or a subsequent debit which was reliant on such funds causes one. This could be due to a deposited item that is known to be bad, or the customer could be a victim of a bad cheque or a [[Advance fee fraud#Fake checks and check cashing scams|counterfeit check scam]]. If the resulting overdraft is too large or cannot be covered in a short period of time, the bank could sue or even press criminal charges.
*'''Intentional Fraud''' – An ATM deposit with misrepresented funds is made or a cheque or money order known to be bad is deposited (see above) by the account holder, and enough money is debited before the fraud is discovered to result in an overdraft once the chargeback is made. The fraud could be perpetrated against one's own account, another person's account, or an account set up in another person's name by an [[Identity theft|identity thief]].
*'''Bank error''' – A cheque debit may post for an improper amount due to human or computer error, so an amount much larger than the maker intended may be removed from the account. Some bank errors can work to the account holder's detriment, but others could work to their benefit.
*'''Victimization''' – The account may have been a target of identity theft. This could occur as the result of demand-draft, ATM-card, or debit-card fraud, [[skimming (credit card fraud)|skimming]], cheque forgery, an "account takeover," or [[phishing]]. The criminal act could cause an overdraft or cause a subsequent debit to cause one. The money or cheques from an ATM deposit could also have been stolen or the envelope lost or stolen, in which case the victim is often denied a remedy.
*'''Intraday overdraft''' – A [[debit]] occurs in the customer’s account resulting in an overdraft which is then covered by a credit that posts to the account during the same [[business day]]. Whether this actually results in overdraft fees depends on the deposit-account holder agreement of the particular bank.
*'''Merchant overdraft''' – An unsecured overdraft offered by financial institutions to a merchant, and the amount overdrawn is within the authorized overdraft limit, which is usually of very high value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Merchant overdraft | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US20070219900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

===Overdrafts in the UK===
Banks in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] normally offer an overdraft facility free of charge, subject to a pre-arranged limit (formerly known as an authorized overdraft limit). Interest, fees or both would normally be charged if the facility is used but accounts may have an interest-free buffer of a few tens of Pounds or a higher deliberate feature of a few hundred Pounds interest free.

When a transaction would exceed the previously agreed overdraft limit the bank can choose either to decline the transaction or to accept it as an informal request for an increase, formerly often known as an unauthorized overdraft. Charges and interest rates for informal increases will often exceed those for a formal request. There is also normally a fee per declined transaction, often subject to monthly caps. Usually, the bank sends out a letter informing the customer of the charge and requesting that the account be operated within its limits from that point onwards or informing the customer of their new limit. In a BBC ''Whistleblower'' programme on the practice, it was noted that the actual cost to the bank was less than two pounds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Accounts exist with overdraft protection facilities which guarantee that the bank will not allow an informal overdraft and which may have lower charges for refusing transactions, protecting the customer from the interest and charges which would be incurred if an overdraft was granted. Accounts for those under eighteen years old will not normally permit an overdraft to be created.

====Amount of fees====
No major UK bank has completely dropped informal overdraft charges. Some, however, offer a "buffer zone", where customers will not be charged if they are over their limit by less than a certain amount. Other banks tend to charge fees regardless of the amount of the level of the overdraft, which is seen by some as unfair. In response to criticism, [[Lloyds Banking Group]] changed its fee structure; rather than a single monthly fee for an unauthorized overdraft, they now charge per day. They also allow a 'grace period' where you can pay money in before 2:30pm (Mon – Fri) before any items are returned or any bank charges incurred (with exception from standing orders which debit at beginning of working day). Lloyds TSB allows their customers, if they have gone into an unplanned overdraft on a Friday for example, to pay money in before 10am on Monday morning and the daily fees for the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) to be waived. This, however, does need to be cleared funds. [[Alliance &amp; Leicester]] formerly had a buffer zone facility (marketed as a "last few pounds" feature of their account), but this has been withdrawn.

In general, the fee charged for an informal request is between twenty-five and thirty pounds, along with an increased rate of debit interest. The charges for cheques and Direct Debits which are refused (or "bounced") due to insufficient funds are usually the same as or slightly less than the general overdraft fees, and can be charged on top of them. A situation which has provoked much controversy is the bank declining a cheque/Direct Debit, levying a fee which takes the customer overdrawn and then charging them for going overdrawn. However, some banks, like [[Halifax (United Kingdom bank)|Halifax]], have a "no fees on fees" policy whereby an account that goes overdrawn solely because of an unpaid item fee will not be charged an additional fee.

====Legal status and controversy====
{{See also|UK default charges controversy}}

In 2006 the [[Office of Fair Trading]] issued a statement which concluded that credit card issuers were levying penalty charges when customers exceeded their maximum spend limit and / or made late payments to their accounts. In the statement, the OFT recommended that credit card issuers set such fees at a maximum of £12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4940250.stm | work=BBC News | title=Your reporter: Unauthorised overdraft fees | date=May 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the statement, the OFT opined that the fees charged by credit card issuers were analogous to unauthorized overdraft fees charged by banks. Many customers who incurred unauthorized overdraft fees used this statement as a springboard to sue their banks in order to recover the fees.

The Supreme Court in 2009 held that the OFT statement was not binding for current (checking) accounts and largely resolved the matter in favor of the banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/faq/bank-charges.html|title=complaints about bank charges|publisher=Financial Ombudsman Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

===Consumer reporting and account denial ===
In the United States some consumer reporting agencies such as ChexSystems, Early Warning Services, and TeleCheck track how people manage their checking accounts. Banks use the agencies to screen checking account applicants. Those with low debit scores are denied checking accounts because a bank can not afford an account to be overdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html|title=SHORT CUTS; Balancing A Checkbook Isn't Calculus. It's Harder.|first=Alina|last=Tugend|date=24 June 2006|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/16/pf/bank-account-history/index.html|title=Bank customers - you're being tracked|first=Blake|last=Ellis|date=16 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2012/07/16/pf/CFPB-credit-reporting/index.htm|title=CFPB to supervise credit reporting agencies|first=Blake|last=Ellis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overdraft protection in the US===
Overdraft protection is a [[financial service]] offered by [[bank|banking institutions]] primarily in the [[United States]]. Overdraft or courtesy pay program protection pays items presented to a customer's account when sufficient funds are not present to cover the amount of the withdrawal. Overdraft protection can cover [[Automated Teller Machine|ATM]] withdrawals, purchases made with a debit card, electronic transfers, and checks. In the case of non-preauthorized items such as checks, or [[Automated Clearing House|ACH]] withdrawals, overdraft protection allows for these items to be paid as opposed to being returned unpaid, or ''bouncing''. However, ATM withdrawals and purchases made with a debit or check card are considered [[Authorization hold|preauthorized]] and must be paid by the bank when presented, even if this causes an overdraft.

====Ad hoc coverage====
Traditionally, the manager of a bank would look at the bank's list of overdrafts each day. If the manager saw that a favored customer had incurred an overdraft, they had the discretion to pay the overdraft for the customer. Banks traditionally did not charge for this ad hoc coverage. However, it was fully discretionary, and so could not be depended on. With the advent of large-scale interstate branch banking, traditional ad hoc coverage has practically disappeared.

The one exception to this is so-called "force pay" lists. At the beginning of each business day, branch managers often still get a computerized list of items that are pending rejection, only for accounts held in their specific branch, city or state. Generally, if a customer is able to come into the branch with cash or make a transfer to cover the amount of the item pending rejection, the manager can "force pay" the item. In addition, if there are extenuating circumstances or the item in question is from an account held by a regular customer, the manager may take a risk by paying the item, but this is increasingly uncommon. Banks have a cut-off time when this action must take place by, as after that time, the item automatically switches from "pending rejection" to "rejected," and no further action may be taken.

====Overdraft lines of credit====
This form of overdraft protection is a contractual relationship in which the bank promises to pay overdrafts up to a certain dollar limit. A consumer who wants an overdraft line of credit must complete and sign an application, after which the bank checks the consumer's credit and approves or denies the application. These lines of credit are loans and must comply with the [[Truth in Lending Act]]. As with linked accounts, banks typically charge a nominal fee per overdraft, and also charge interest on the outstanding balance. Some banks charge a small monthly fee regardless of whether the line of credit is used. This form of overdraft protection is available to consumers who meet the creditworthiness criteria established by the bank for such accounts. Once the line of credit is established, the available credit may be visible as part of the customer's available balance.

====Linked accounts====
Also referred to as "Overdraft Transfer Protection", a checking account can be linked to another account, such as a savings account, credit card, or line of credit. Once the link is established, when an item is presented to the checking account that would result in an overdraft, funds are transferred from the linked account to cover the overdraft. A nominal fee is usually charged for each overdraft transfer, and if the linked account is a credit card or other line of credit, the consumer may be required to pay interest under the terms of that account.

The main difference between linked accounts and an overdraft line of credit is that an overdraft line of credit is typically only usable for overdraft protection. Separate accounts that are linked for overdraft protection are independent accounts in their own right.

====Bounce protection plans====
A more recent product being offered by some banks is called "bounce protection".

Smaller banks offer plans administered by third party companies which help the banks gain additional fee income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nclc.org/issues/overdraft-loans.html|title=Overdraft Loans - Issues - NCLC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Larger banks tend not to offer bounce protection plans, but instead process overdrafts as disclosed in their account terms and conditions.

In either case, the bank may choose to cover overdrawn items at their discretion and charge an overdraft fee, the amount of which may or may not be disclosed. As opposed to traditional ad hoc coverage, this decision to pay or not pay overdrawn items is automated and based on objective criteria such as the customer's average balance, the overdraft history of the account, the number of accounts the customer holds with the bank, and the length of time those accounts have been open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/htfeddis071107.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080710083821/http://www.house.gov/apps/list/hearing/financialsvcs_dem/htfeddis071107.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bank does not promise to pay the overdraft even if the automated criteria are met.

Bounce protection plans have some superficial similarities to overdraft lines of credit and ad hoc coverage of overdrafts, but tend to operate under different rules. Like an overdraft line of credit, the balance of the bounce protection plan may be viewable as part of the customer's available balance, yet the bank reserves the right to refuse payment of an overdrawn item, as with traditional ad hoc coverage. Banks typically charge a one-time fee for each overdraft paid. A bank may also charge a recurring daily fee for each day during which the account has a negative balance.

Critics argue that because funds are advanced to a consumer and repayment is expected, that bounce protection is a type of loan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.uspirg.org/consumer/archives/2007/07/bounce_protecti.html U.S. PIRG Consumer Blog: Bounce protection loans/debit cards under committee microscope&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120144100/http://static.uspirg.org/consumer/archives/2007/07/bounce_protecti.html |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because banks are not contractually obligated to cover the overdrafts, "bounce protection" is not regulated by the [[Truth in Lending Act]], which prohibits certain deceptive advertisements and requires disclosure of the terms of loans. Historically, bounce protection could be added to a consumer's account without his or her permission or knowledge.

===Transaction processing order===
An area of controversy with regards to overdraft fees is the order in which a bank posts transactions to a customer's account. This is controversial because largest to smallest processing tends to maximize overdraft occurrences on a customer's account. This situation can arise when the account holder makes a number of small debits for which there are sufficient funds in the account at the time of purchase. Later, the account holder makes a large debit that overdraws the account (either accidentally or intentionally). If all of the items present for payment to the account on the same day, and the bank processes the largest transaction first, multiple overdrafts can result. Another problem for the consumer can occur when a large deposit and a larger debit occur on the same day; for example, a customer with $700 in their account who deposits a $600 paycheck and later pays an $800 rent check on the same day will be charged an overdraft fee, despite having more than enough money in their account to cover the check.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

The "biggest check first" policy is common among large U.S. banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/banking/2006-11-19-bank-usat_x.htm|title=Banks' check-clearing policies could leave you with overdrafts - USATODAY.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banks argue that this is done to prevent a customer's most important transactions (such as a rent or mortgage check, or utility payment) from being returned unpaid, despite some such transactions being guaranteed. Consumers have attempted to litigate to prevent this practice, arguing that banks use "biggest check first" to manipulate the order of transactions to artificially trigger more overdraft fees to collect. Banks in the United States are mostly regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, a Federal agency, which has formally approved of the practice; the practice has recently been challenged, however, under numerous individual state deceptive practice laws.&lt;ref&gt;[Scott J. Kreppein, Dissent of Man Law Blog, "Potential Tide Turning Victory in The Battle Against Illegal Non-Sufficient Fund and Overdraft Fees: Bank of America Settles Closson Class Action," http://kreppein.blogspot.com/2009/02/california-class-action-against-bank-of.html] [See also Kreppein, Dissent of Man Law Blog, "The UK Takes Steps to Curb Illegal Overdraft Fees, But US Efforts Have Not Been So Well Received," http://kreppein.blogspot.com/2007/08/uk-takes-steps-to-curb-illegal.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In class action, U.S. Bank Corporation entered into a $55 million settlement agreement on January 16, 2014 over the practice of reordering transactions (highest-lowest) in posting debit card transactions to customer accounts and the alleged effect the posting order had on the number of overdraft fees charged to account holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbankoverdraftsettlement.com|title=Rust Consulting - US Bank Overdraft Settlement &gt; mainpage &gt; Home|first=Rust Consulting - US Bank Overdraft|last=Settlement|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bank deposit agreements usually provide that the bank may clear transactions in any order, at the bank's discretion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.bankofamerica.com/efulfillment/documents/05-11-2000ED.20060701.pdf Bank of America Deposit Agreement] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928005935/https://www1.bankofamerica.com/efulfillment/documents/05-11-2000ED.20060701.pdf |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opt-in regulation===
In July, 2010 the Federal Reserve adopted regulations (revisions to Regulation E) which prohibited overdraft fees resulting from one time debit card and ATM transactions unless the bank customer had [[opt-in|opted into]] overdraft protection. Consumers who opt into overdraft programs pay more than seven times as much in overdraft and NSF fees, averaging almost $260 a year, based on a recent report from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/overdraft-fees-what-banks-charge/|title=Overdraft Fees: What Banks Charge - NerdWallet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by [[Moebs Services]] released in February, 2011 showed that as many as 90% of customers had chosen overdraft protection resulting in the projection that United States banks would post record profits from overdraft fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Americans choosing to pay overdraft fees|first=Suzanne |last=Kapner |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/5eb4cc72-3f9b-11e0-a1ba-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3pEI8TPGP|newspaper=The Financial Times |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternatives to overdraft protection===
[[Fintech]] innovations have led to viable alternatives to overdraft fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/121114/top-checking-accounts-no-overdraft-fees.asp|title=Top Checking Accounts With No Overdraft Fees|first=Brianna|last=McGurran|date=11 December 2014|publisher=Investopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Dollar''', also known as '''Captain Robert Dollar''' (1844–1932) was a Scots-American industrialist born in [[Bainsford]], [[Falkirk]], Scotland. The title "Captain" was honorary and he was called the "Grand Old Man of the Pacific". Both were bestowed after his entry into the shipping industry. Dollar became a [[lumber baron]], [[Business magnate|shipping magnate]], philanthropist; he was also a [[Freemason]].  His biography and an extensive introduction by him is contained within the book, ''Men Who Are Making the West 1923''.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, B.C.  ''Men Who are Making the West 1923,'' B.C. Forbes Publishing Co., 1923. pp. 16-29, 185-203&lt;/ref&gt;

California Governor [[James Rolph, Jr.]] said at the time of his death, "Robert Dollar has done more in his lifetime to spread the American flag on the high seas than any man in this country."  He made the cover of ''Time'' magazine on 19 March 1928, with several writings concerning his business', and was given a long obituary in the 23 May 1932, issue.

== Childhood ==
He was born on 20 March 1844, to William Dollar and Mary Melville. He was the oldest of three boys that included brothers John and James. His mother died in 1853, and Robert dropped out of school and worked in a machine shop and then as an errand boy for a lumber shipping company to help support the family. After the death of Robert's mother, his father married a servant girl named Mary Easton, and in 1857 they had a daughter, also named Mary.  Shortly afterwards, the family emigrated to Canada.  Robert began working at a lumber camp as a cook's helper when he was 14 years old, and later found work in a barrel [[stave (wood)|stave]] factory. He learned French, and worked his way up to doing the camp accounting.

In 1861, Robert held his first real job as a logger. He had the task of driving the logs down the river to the mill. There were no roads so all travel was by water. Logging took place some distance from the mill, so running the logs could take about three months. In 1866, Robert began to keep a diary, which he continued until 1918; thus, he was able to write his memoirs in later years and tell the vivid tales of logging in Canada. For example, "The first three or four days I couldn't 'keep my feet' and spent more time in the water than out of it. But experience is the best teacher and I soon learned to stay on top of the logs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinhistory.org/article_RobertDollar1.html Robert Dollar childhood]- Reviewed and modified 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt; Dollar worked in logging camps in the forests of Canada and the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="Romig"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Romig | first = Walter  | year = 1986 | title = Michigan Place Names | origyear= 1973 | publisher=Wayne State University Press | location = Detroit, Michigan | isbn = 0-8143-1838-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falkirkculturalcenter.org/dollars.html "The Dollars at Falkirk"], Falkirk Cultural Center- Reviewed 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Robert met Margaret S. Proudfoot in a Presbyterian Church, and they were married in 1874. This was during the time after he sustained a loss in his timber venture, was heavily in debt, and determined to pay off his share, which was $2500. For their honeymoon, he took his new bride, along with 18 men, to [[Bracebridge, Ontario]], to establish a lumber camp. Robert and Margaret were close companions, and Margaret accompanied her husband on most of his world trips. She told her granddaughters, "When you get married, never let your husband know he can get along without you."  Robert once stated, "My real success began with my wedding day."  According to one source:&lt;ref name="marinhistory.org"&gt;[http://www.marinhistory.org/article_RobertDollar3.html children]- Reviewed and modified 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;She was a quiet person, but very determined to keep up with Robert's adventures. She took an airplane ride over Shanghai in 1927. Commenting on his constant search for new challenges, Margaret said, "Sometimes I think in the modern world of marvels, he will never be satisfied until he is the skipper of a round trip to Mars.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Children ===
The Dollars had four children: Alexander Melville and Robert Stanley were born in Bracebridge. The timber was playing out, so in 1885 the family moved to [[Marquette, Michigan]], where Mary Grace and John Harold were born.&lt;ref name="marinhistory.org"/&gt;

== Lumber baron ==
[[File:Robert Dollar on TIME Magazine, March 19, 1928.jpg|thumb|Robert Dollar on the cover of TIME Magazine, 19 March 1928]]
At age 22, Robert took over running a camp as Director of the English and American Lumber Company. His first venture into the lumber industry began when he bought a lumber camp, but it failed. This did not deter him, and, apparently learning from his mistakes, he bought other camps that were successful. He bought camps and timberland in Canada, then in the upper peninsula of [[Michigan]] and finally in [[Northern California]].

[[File:Steamer ROBERT DOLLAR and crew departing for Nome, Seattle, ca 1900 (PEISER 128).jpeg|thumb|Departure of the steamer ''Robert Dollar'' from Seattle for [[Nome, Alaska]] ca. 1900]]
In 1888, the family moved to [[San Rafael, California]], and Robert bought timberland and logging camps in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]], a mill and lumber business at [[Usal Creek#History|Usal]] in [[Mendocino, California|Mendocino county]], and other places such as [[Oregon]] and as far north as [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.falkirkculturalcenter.org/dollars.html] -Falkirk Cultural Center&lt;/ref&gt; Among his purchases was timberland known as "Dollar's Meeker tract." This section still had [[redwood]] trees. A portion of this tract, located on the Russian River, was sold to the Bohemian Club of San Francisco and is now the [[Bohemian Grove]].

In 1906, Robert bought a Victorian style home in San Rafael and named it "Falkirk," after his birthplace in Scotland. He lived there until his death. He left the estate to his family and it was purchased by the community in 1975 for $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinhistory.org/article_RobertDollar4.html Falkirk]- Reviewed 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt; The name Falkirk was retained as the '''''Falkirk Cultural Center'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://events.marinij.com/san-rafael-ca/venues/show/8113-falkirk-cultural-center Falkirk Cultural Center]- Reviewed and modified 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shipping magnate ==
In 1895, he acquired his first vessel, a single steam schooner called ''Newsboy'', to move his lumber from the [[Pacific Northwest]] to markets down the coast. Thus began his entry into the shipping industry that included lumber, commodities, mail, and passengers. In the process he became a San Francisco shipping magnate who entered the lumber trade in Canada. In 1903, Robert and his three sons incorporated their interests into the Robert Dollar Company. In 1910, Dollar built an 11-story office building in San Francisco, headquarters of the Dollar Steamship Company, which was expanded in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.311californiastreet.com/history.htm Dollar building]- Reviewed and modified 2016-01-02&lt;/ref&gt; During the inter-war years, his freighters plied the Pacific and were a common sight from Canada to [[Guangzhou|Canton]], San Francisco to Shanghai, and [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] to Tokyo.&lt;ref&gt;Dollar, Robert.  ''One Hundred Thirty Years of Steam Navigation: A History of the Merchant Ship,'' Schwabacher Frey Co., San Francisco, 1931.{{Page needed|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, the purchase of seven "president" ships owned by the U.S. Government allowed Dollar, at the age of 80, to pioneer his successful round-the-world passenger service. Pacific Mails, a U.S. company going back to the 1850s with the Panama-California and trans-Pacific routes, was taken over by Dollar in 1925 that added 8 more ships, and he also signed a contract with [[W.R. Grace and Company|Grace Steamship Company]].&lt;ref&gt;"Business &amp; Finance: Anniversary" and cover picture, ''Time'' magazine, March 19, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Captain Dollar Speaks," ''Time'' magazine, May 23, 1932.&lt;/ref&gt;

The death of the founder in 1932, coupled with the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Pacific War]], headed the company into bankruptcy. The incoming Roosevelt administration removed the critical US mail contracts from the Dollar line.  The Dollar family were prominent Republicans, in 1930 they had named one of their newest liners the President Hoover, and thus drew the ire of incoming administration.  In 1937, under the control of Robert Dollar's sons, Dollar Lines was bankrupt. Back taxes could not be paid and in an agreement, forced by the Roosevelt administration, Stanley Dollar turned 93% of the voting common stock over to the Maritime Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,78 9190,00.html End of the Dollar Line]- Reviewed and modified 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Stanley Dollar filed a lawsuit to recover ownership of the line. The battle raged until 1950 when the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Stanley Dollar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,813915-1,00.html#ixzz10MJrDOW8] -Stanley Dollar wins&lt;/ref&gt; The government had other plans and did not return the company. There was a cash settlement as 7% was retained by Stanley. In 1952, a group of investors, led by Ralph K. Davies, purchased the company for $18,000,000.  Its name was shortened to APL in 1988.  In 1997, APL merged with Singapore-based [[Neptune Orient Lines|NOL]], and as of 2006, 68% of NOL was owned by [[Temasek Holdings]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/company/151/000127767/ APL]- Reviewed and modified 2016-06-02&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
After Captain Dollar turned eighty, the newspaper reporters began to ask him when he planned to retire. He replied:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It would have been nothing short of a crime for me to have retired when I reached the age of sixty, because I have accomplished far more the last twenty years of my life than I did before I reached my sixtieth birthday ... I was put in this world for a purpose and that was not to loaf and spend my time in so-called pleasure ... I was eighty years old when I thought out the practicability of starting a passenger steamship line of eight steamers to run around the world in one direction ... I hope to continue working to my last day on earth and wake up the next morning in the other world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dollar did continue to work until his final days.

Robert Dollar expressed ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this world all we leave behind us that is worth anything is that we can be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, and that we can say that we left the world just a little better than we found it.

'''Robert Morris Morgenthau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔr|ɡ|ən|θ|ɔː}} {{respell|MORG|ən-thaw}}; born July 31, 1919) is an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]]. From 1975 until his retirement in 2009, he was the [[District Attorney]] for [[New York County]], the borough of [[Manhattan]], having previously served as [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]] throughout much of the 1960s on the appointment of [[John F. Kennedy]]. At retirement, Morgenthau was the longest-serving district attorney in the history of the [[State of New York]], although William V. Grady of [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] surpassed this record at the midway point of his ninth term on January 1, 2018.

==Early life==
Morgenthau was born in 1919 in New York City into a prominent [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] family that had emigrated from [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] in 1866. He is the son of [[Elinor Morgenthau|Elinor (née Fatman)]] and long-time [[Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]] His maternal great grandfather was [[Mayer Lehman]], a co-founder of [[Lehman Brothers]]. His grandfather, [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]], was [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States Ambassador]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] during [[World War I]]. Before going into diplomatic service, Henry Morgenthau, Sr., had made a fortune in [[real estate]], and then became a strong financial backer of President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. His paternal grandmother was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau testimony to Senate Judiciary Committee, July 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; From his earliest days, the Morgenthau family was well-connected politically. The family home was near [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|Springwood Estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]], and he grew up knowing Roosevelt.

After graduating from the [[New Lincoln School]], [[Deerfield Academy]], and [[Amherst College]], he enlisted in the [[United States Navy]], serving for four and a half years during World War II. He attained the final rank of [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|lieutenant commander]], and served as the executive officer of both the [[USS Lansdale (DD-426)|USS ''Lansdale'']] and the [[USS Harry F. Bauer (DM-26)|USS ''Harry F. Bauer'']]. Naval records indicate heroic action during the Battle of Iwo Jima - the Bauer was attacked by thirteen suicide bombers, and survived a torpedo and dive bomber attack (both failed to detonate). &lt;ref&gt;https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/h/harry-f-bauer-dm-26.html&lt;/ref&gt; He saw action in both the Mediterranean and Pacific theaters, mostly aboard [[destroyer]]s.&lt;ref name=jvl&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/RobertMorgenthau.html Robert Morgenthau] from the [[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau graduated from [[Yale Law School]] in 1948, and joined the New York law firm of [[Patterson, Belknap &amp; Webb]], becoming a partner in 1954.

==Career==

===U.S. Attorney===
In 1961, after 12 years of practicing [[corporate law]], Morgenthau accepted an appointment from President [[John F. Kennedy]] as [[United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York]]. In [[New York state election, 1962|1962]], he was the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nominee for [[Governor of New York]], and resigned his federal office. After his defeat by the incumbent Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]], Morgenthau was reappointed U.S. Attorney and served for the remainder of the Kennedy and [[Lyndon Johnson|Johnson]] administrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nypdconfidential.com/columns/2008/081201.html Aborn For Manhattan DA or Morgenthau Forever?], ''NYPD Confidential'' (December 1, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; As a United States Attorney, Morgenthau established a special unit to investigate [[securities fraud]] and prosecuted highly publicized bribery cases against city officials and IRS attorneys and accountants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

In January 1969, following the election of President [[Richard M. Nixon]], Morgenthau remained in office, and for months resisted increasingly public pressures from the Nixon Administration to resign. He retained support from New York's liberal Republican U.S. Senators [[Jacob K. Javits]] and [[Charles Goodell]]. Morgenthau and his supporters claimed that replacing him would disrupt his work on vital cases, and that Nixon might be seeking to prevent Morgenthau from pursuing investigations that would prove embarrassing to the President or his friends. Nonetheless, Morgenthau's position became increasingly untenable. While well-regarded, he was after all a Democrat thought to harbor political aspirations; thus, Morgenthau's insistence on remaining in office seemed increasingly unreasonable to even some who initially had thought the Nixon administration should not show him the door so quickly. He was eventually forced out of office at the end of 1969,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Perez-Pena, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEFDA1738F930A35751C1A964958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/U/United%20States%20Attorneys U.S. Attorney Leaving Post In Manhattan] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (December 3, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and succeeded as U.S. Attorney by Republican [[Whitney North Seymour, Jr.]]

===Return to politics===
Afterwards, Morgenthau served briefly in the reformist administration of Mayor [[John V. Lindsay]] as a deputy mayor, before resigning to seek the Democratic nomination for governor in [[New York state election, 1970|1970]]. Morgenthau was less successful in raising funds and developing support than were two other candidates, [[Arthur Goldberg]] and [[Howard J. Samuels|Howard Samuels]], and within weeks, he withdrew from the race. Goldberg won the nomination, and was subsequently defeated by Rockefeller.&lt;ref&gt;David L. Stebenne, ''Arthur J. Goldberg, New Deal Liberal'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 375-378. {{ISBN|0-19-507105-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===District Attorney of New York County===
Morgenthau returned to private life until 1974, when he was elected to the office of District Attorney of New York County. This was a special election caused by the death of [[Frank Hogan]], who had served as DA for more than 30 years. Morgenthau defeated Hogan's interim successor, [[Richard Kuh]]. He was elected to a full term in 1977, and was re-elected seven times. He was not opposed in a general election from 1985 to 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29435444/ MSNBC report on Morgenthau]&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau was subjected to criticism in the press for his conduct in the wake of a major police corruption scandal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/25/nyregion/koch-pledges-inquiry-on-arrests-by-transit-police.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Richard | last=Levine | title=Koch Pledges Inquiry on Arrests by Transit Police | date=November 25, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight men who were falsely arrested by transit police officers in the scandal that shook the department were awarded more than $1 million in damages by a federal judge. One plaintiff, Ronald Yeadon, was a police officer. He was arrested twice while off duty and accused of sexually abusing a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/12/opinion/the-even-sadder-new-york-police-saga.html | work=The New York Times | first1=Richard | last1=Emery | title=The Even Sadder New York Police Saga | date=December 12, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau retained a national profile while serving in what was technically a local office, in part because of his dogged pursuit of [[white-collar crime]]. According to [[Gary Naftalis]], a prominent Manhattan defense attorney who had been an assistant to Morgenthau in the 1960s, Morgenthau believed that prosecuting "crime in the suites" was every bit as important as prosecuting "crime in the streets".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Kevin. [https://www.usatoday.com/money/covers/2002-06-24-morgenthau.htm Feared D.A. relishes taking down hotshots]. [[USA Today]], 2002-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau announced in 2005, aged 85, that he would run for a ninth full term as district attorney. For the first time in decades, he encountered a vigorous primary opponent - former state court judge [[Leslie Crocker Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Gray]], [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/columns/intelligencer/15008/ Morgenthau Gets Witchy About Leslie Crocker Snyder], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' (November 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Eaton, [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/nyregion/metrocampaigns/09morgy.html Snyder Faults Morgenthau on Drug Laws],
''[[The New York Times]]'' (September 9, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;
Snyder won the endorsement of the ''[[New York Times]]'', which, like virtually all of the city's establishment, had long been supportive of Morgenthau.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E7DB1631F933A0575BC0A9639C8B63 When to End an Era], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (August 30, 2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgenthau won the Democratic primary with 59% of the vote, to Snyder's 41%. In the general election, he was once again the candidate for all political parties in the election, having been nominated by the Democrats, Republicans, and the [[Working Families Party]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.judicialaccountability.org/articles/judgessnyderandda.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Morgenthau won re-election with more than 99% of the vote.

===Retirement===
On February 27, 2009, Morgenthau announced that he would not seek re-election in 2009, saying: "I never expected to be here this long ... [R]ecently, I figured that I'd served 25 years beyond the normal retirement age."&lt;ref&gt;Karen Freifeld, [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ah2vfA7BieNI Morgenthau, Manhattan Prosecutor Since 1961, Won't Run Again], ''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]'' (February 29, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newsday.com/services/newspaper/printedition/saturday/news/ny-nymorg286052675feb28,0,6367166.story&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]], a prosecutor under Morgenthau and the son of former President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] [[Cyrus Vance]]. Morgenthau officially endorsed Vance on June 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26vance.html | title = Manhattan District Attorney Endorses a Candidate to Succeed Him | first = John | last = Elingon | date = June 25, 2009 | work = [[New York Times|NYTimes.com]] | accessdate = 2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vance went on to win the primary election on September 15, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/cy_vance_wins_manhattan_da_race_klECEXoy4qLaf20XLBx4iO | work=New York Post | title=Cy Vance wins Manhattan DA race | first=Clemente | last=Lisi | date=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the subsequent general election on November 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statement and Return Report for Certification General Election 2009 – 11/03/2009 New York County – All Parties and Independent Bodies – District Attorney – New York|url=http://vote.nyc.ny.us/downloads/pdf/results/2009/General/4.13NewYorkDistrictAttorneyRecap.pdf|website=vote.nyc.ny.us|publisher=Board Elections in the City of New York|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2010, Morgenthau joined the law firm [[Wachtell|Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wcax.com/Global/story.asp?S=11850679&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/law/2010/01/20/morganthau-90-lands-at-hard-charging-wachtell-lipton/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Morgenthau, 90, Lands at Hard-Charging Wachtell Lipton | first=Ashby | last=Jones | date=January 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bank was seized by federal regulators shortly before Morgenthau indicted it for what he described as "the largest bank fraud in world financial history".&lt;ref name="FalseProfits"&gt;Peter Truell, Larry Gurwin, False Profits.

==Television character==
The character of District Attorney [[Adam Schiff (Law &amp; Order)|Adam Schiff]] (played by actor [[Steven Hill]]), the New York district attorney in the long-running TV series ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', was loosely based on Morgenthau. Morgenthau reportedly was a fan of the character.&lt;ref name=jvl/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kolker, [http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/newyork/features/9546/index1.html Happy 85th Birthday, Bob Morgenthau], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'' (July 19, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations==
Morgenthau's other principal civic activities were the [[Police Athletic League of New York City]], which he served since 1962, first as president and then chairman, and the [[Museum of Jewish Heritage]], of which he was chairman.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Award==
In 2005, Morgenthau received [[The Hundred Year Association of New York]]'s Gold Medal "in recognition of outstanding contributions to the City of New York".

==Overview==
As of March 2017, ''[[Forbes]]'' estimated his net worth at US$2.3 billion. In 2018, he was removed from its list of billionaires, as it was no longer clear what assets he owned.&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web|title=Saleh Kamel|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/saleh-kamel/|website=Forbes|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleh Kamel is the founder and chairman of [[Dallah Al-Baraka|Dallah Albaraka]], a multi-national holding company with investments including the financial, banking, healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, transportation, and operations and maintenance sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallah.com/corporate/23|title=Dallah Albaraka Holding Co.|website=www.dallah.com|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He is Chairman of the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce and Industry as well as the Islamic Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jef.org.sa/?q=node/725|title=Shiekh Saleh Kamel  {{!}} Jeddah Economic Forum|website=www.jef.org.sa|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kamel has been called "the father of contemporary Islamic finance", receiving Malaysia's Royal Award for Islamic Finance in November 2010. He is currently involved in efforts to significantly expand trade among member states of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation countries. Kamel is heavily involved in the promotion of Jeddah as a leading international port and hub for global commerce. In his capacity as chairman of DBHC and the JCC, he has led numerous projects to promote the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as a regional economic force . Kamel has stated that his vision is to combine the efforts of his DBHC and the Chamber of commerce with ongoing mega-infrastructure projects such as King Abdullah Port, the Economic City, the new railways, and the King Abdullah International Airport to catalyze domestic business across the Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/11/prweb4727694.htm|title=Malaysia Honours Shaikh Saleh Abdullah Kamel|website=PRWeb|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/saudi-arabia-2014/just-the-start/interview|title=Just The Start|website=The Business Year|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his capacity as one of Saudi Arabia's leading businessmen, Kamel continues to actively promote philanthropy. In an interview with Arab News in 2012, Kamel  estimated the total value of Islamic zakat in the Kingdom at SR 1 trillion. "Such a huge amount could be used to solve many economic and social problems in the country." He said that people should pay zakat for real estate properties that have been offered for sale. "We Muslims should understand the economic wisdom behind the system if we collect and use zakat properly for it can bring about substantial improvement in our economic conditions. If we had collected zakat from real estate property we would not have faced housing or land problems."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabnews.com/columns/saleh-kamel-founder-dallah-albaraka|title=Saleh Kamel: Founder of Dallah Albaraka|date=2013-01-04|website=Arab News|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled discussing this matter with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. "I can tell you," he said that Islamic economics offers solutions for world problems." Referring to global economic crises he said they would not have occurred if we had implemented an Islamic Hadith by Muhammad which says, "Do not sell what you do not own or possess." In 2010, his son, CEO of [[Dallah Al-Baraka|DHBC,]] donated $10 million to Yale University to establish the Abdallah S. Kamel Center for the Study of Islamic Law and Civilization at Yale Law School &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.yale.edu/centers-workshops/abdallah-kamel|title=Abdallah S.

A '''tax lien'''  is a  [[lien]] imposed by law upon a property to secure the payment of taxes. A tax lien may be imposed for delinquent [[tax]]es owed on [[real property]] or [[personal property]], or as a result of failure to pay income taxes or other taxes.

==Federal tax lien in the United States==
In the United States, a federal tax lien may arise in connection with any kind of federal tax, including but not limited to [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]], [[gift tax]], or [[Inheritance tax|estate tax]].

===Federal tax lien basics===
[[Internal Revenue Code]] section 6321 provides:

::Sec. 6321. LIEN FOR TAXES.

::If any person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the same after demand, the amount (including any interest, additional amount, addition to tax, or assessable penalty, together with any costs that may accrue in addition thereto) shall be a lien in favor of the United States upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belong to such person.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6321}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal Revenue Code section 6322 provides:

::Sec. 6322. PERIOD OF Tax Lien

::Unless another date is specifically fixed by law, the lien imposed by section 6321 shall arise at the time the assessment is made and shall continue until the liability for the amount so assessed (or a judgment against the taxpayer arising out of such liability) is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "assessment" refers to the statutory assessment made by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) under {{usc|26|6201}} (that is, the formal recording of the tax in the official books and records at the office of the Secretary of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]]&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). Generally, the "person liable to pay any tax" described in section 6321 must pay the tax within ten days of the written ''notice and demand''.&lt;ref&gt;See 26 C.F.R. section 601.103(a).&lt;/ref&gt; If the taxpayer fails to pay the tax within the ten-day period, the tax lien arises automatically (i.e., by operation of law), and is ''effective retroactively to (i.e., arises at) the date of the assessment'', even though the ten-day period necessarily expires after the assessment date.

Under the doctrine of ''[[Glass City Bank v. United States]]'',&lt;ref&gt;326 U.S. 265 (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; the tax lien applies not only to property and rights to property owned by the taxpayer at the time of the assessment, but also to [[after-acquired property]] (i.e., to any property owned by the taxpayer during the life of the lien).

The statute of limitations under which a federal tax lien may become "unenforceable by reason of lapse of time" is found at {{usc|26|6502}}. For taxes assessed on or after November 6, 1990, the lien generally becomes unenforceable ten years after the date of assessment. For taxes assessed on or before November 5, 1990, a prior version of section 6502 provides for a limitations period of six years after the date of assessment. Various exceptions may extend the time periods.

===Perfection of federal tax liens against third parties (the Notice of Federal Tax Lien)===
A federal tax lien arising by law as described above is valid against the taxpayer without any further action by the government.

The general rule is that where two or more creditors have competing liens against the same property, the creditor whose lien was perfected at the earlier time takes priority over the creditor whose lien was perfected at a later time (there are exceptions to this rule). Thus, if the government (which is treated as a "''creditor''" with respect to unpaid taxes) properly files a Notice of Federal Tax Lien (NFTL) before another creditor can perfect its own lien, the tax lien will often take priority over the other lien.

To "perfect" the tax lien (to create a priority right) against persons other than the taxpayer (such as competing creditors), the government generally must file the NFTL&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6323}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the records of the county or state where the property is located, with the rules varying from state to state. At the time the notice is filed, public notice is deemed to have been given to the third parties (especially the taxpayer's other creditors, etc.) that the Internal Revenue Service has a claim against all property owned by the taxpayer as of the assessment date (which is generally prior to the date the NFTL is filed), and to all property acquired by the taxpayer after the assessment date (as noted above, the lien attaches to all of a taxpayer's property such as homes, land and vehicles and to all of a taxpayer's rights to property such as promissory notes or accounts receivable). Although the federal tax lien is effective against the taxpayer on the assessment date, the ''priority'' right against third party creditors arises at a later time: the date the NFTL is filed. The form and content of the notice of federal tax lien is governed only by federal law, regardless of any requirements of state or local law.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Constit., art. VI, cl. 2; And this: "The form and content of the notice referred to in subsection (a) shall be prescribed by the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate]. Such notice shall be valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien" (see {{usc|26|6323(f)(3)}}). And, from the U.S. Treasury regulations: "(d) [. . . ] (1) In general. —The notice referred to in §301.6323(a)-1 shall be filed on Form 668, 'Notice of Federal Tax Lien under Internal Revenue Laws'. Such notice is valid notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the form or content of a notice of lien. For example, omission from the notice of lien of a description of the property subject to the lien does not affect the validity thereof even though State law may require that the notice contain a description of the property subject to the lien." See 26 C.F.R. sec. 301.6323(f)-1(d)(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

::The NFTL is merely a device which gives notice to interested parties of the existence of the federal tax lien. Thus, the NFTL's function is to perfect and obtain priority for the federal tax lien. The filing or refiling of the NFTL has no effect on the expiration date of collection statute of limitations provided in [Internal Revenue Code] §6502. Accordingly, even if the NFTL is refiled, if no event extends the collection statute of limitations, the IRS cannot take any further administrative collection action. Conversely, the IRS's failure to refile the NFTL does not affect the existence of an otherwise valid underlying federal tax lien, i.e., the underlying lien remains valid but loses its priority.&lt;ref&gt;Steven R. Mather, J.D., CPA &amp; Paul H. Weisman, J.D., ''Federal Tax Collection Procedure – Liens, Levies, Suits and Third Party Liability'', U.S. Income Portfolios, Vol. 637 (1st ed. 2012), Bloomberg BNA.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent liens taking priority over previously filed federal tax liens===
In certain cases, the lien of another creditor (or the interest of an owner) may take priority over a federal tax lien even if the NFTL was filed before the other creditor's lien was perfected (or before the owner's interest was acquired). Some examples include the liens of certain purchasers of securities, liens on certain motor vehicles, and the interest held by a retail purchaser of certain personal property.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|26|6323(b)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal law also allows a state—if the state legislature so elects by statute—to enjoy a higher priority than the federal tax lien with respect to certain state tax liens on property where the related tax is based on the ''value of that property''. For example, the lien based on the annual real estate property tax in Texas takes priority over the federal tax lien, even where an NFTL for the federal lien was recorded prior to the time the Texas tax lien arose,&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6323(b)(6)}} and Tex. Tax Code sections 32.04 and 32.05(b).&lt;/ref&gt; and even though no notice of the Texas tax lien is required to be filed or recorded at all.

===Certificate of release of federal tax lien===
In order to have the record of a lien released a taxpayer must obtain a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the IRS will not issue a certificate of release of lien until the tax has either been paid in full or the IRS no longer has a legal interest in collecting the tax. The IRS has standardized procedures for lien releases, discharges and subordination. In situations that qualify for the removal of a lien, the IRS will generally remove the lien within 30 days and the taxpayer may receive a copy of the Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien. The current form of the Notice of Federal Tax Lien utilized by the IRS contains a provision that provides that the NFTL is released by its own terms at the conclusion of the statute of limitations period described above provided that the NFTL has not been refiled by the date indicated on the form. The effect of this provision is that the NFTL operates as a Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien on the day after the date indicated in the form by its own terms.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===The difference between a federal tax lien and an administrative levy===
The creation of a tax lien, and the subsequent issuance of a Notice of Federal Tax Lien, should not be confused with the issuance of a Notice of Intent to Levy under {{usc|26|6331(d)}}, or with the actual act of levy under {{usc|26|6331(a)}}. The term "levy" in this narrow technical sense denotes an ''administrative action'' by the Internal Revenue Service (i.e., without going to court) to seize property to satisfy a tax liability. The levy "includes the power of [[distraint]] and seizure ''by any means''.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|7701(a)(21)}} and {{usc|26|6331(b)}} (italics added).&lt;/ref&gt; The general rule is that no court permission is required for the IRS to execute a section 6331 levy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''United States v. Rodgers'', 461 U.S. 677, 103 S. Ct. 2132, 83-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 9374 (1983) (''dicta''); see also ''Brian v. Gugin'', 853 F. Supp. 358, 94-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,278 (D. Idaho 1994), ''aff'd'', 95-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) paragr. 50,067 (9th Cir. 1995). The IRS may, however, be required to obtain court permission in the case of bankruptcy; see {{usc|11|362}}. Also, an IRS levy on a principal residence must be approved in writing by a federal district court judge or magistrate. See Internal Revenue Code sections 6334(a)(13)(B) and 6334(e)(1). Section 6334 also provides that certain assets are not subject to an IRS levy, such as certain wearing apparel, fuel, furniture and household effects, certain books and tools of trade of the taxpayer's profession, undelivered mail, the portion of salary, wages, etc., needed to support minor children, and certain other assets.&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the federal tax lien is the government's statutory right that encumbers property to secure the ultimate payment of a tax. The notice of levy is an IRS notice that the IRS intends to seize property in the near future. The levy is the actual act of seizure of the property.

In general, a Notice of Intent to Levy must be issued by the IRS at least thirty days prior to the actual levy. Thus, while a Notice of Federal Tax Lien generally is issued ''after'' the tax lien arises, a Notice of Intent to Levy (sometimes misleadingly called simply a "notice of levy") generally must be issued ''before'' the actual levy is made.

Also, while the federal tax lien applies to all property and rights to property of the taxpayer, the power to levy is subject to certain restrictions. That is, certain property covered by the lien may be ''exempt'' from an administrative levy&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6334}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (property covered by the lien that is exempt from administrative levy may, however, be taken by the IRS if the IRS obtains a court judgment).

A detailed discussion of the administrative levy, and the related Notice, is beyond the scope of this article.

In connection with federal taxes in the United States, the term "levy" also has a separate, more general sense of "imposed." That is, when a tax law is enacted by the Congress, the tax is said to be "imposed" or "levied."

===The effect of an offer in compromise on the tax lien===
A properly submitted [[offer in compromise]] does not affect a tax lien, which remains effective until the offer is accepted and the offered amount is fully paid. Once the compromised amount is paid, the taxpayer should request removal of the lien.

==County level tax liens in the United States==
{{further information|Tax sale}}
In the United States, a tax lien may be placed on a house or any other real property on which property tax is due (such as an empty tract of land, a boat dock, or even a parking place).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wickedlocalhomes.com/homes/real-estate/2015/04/tax-lien-sales-tips-for-leveraging-a-home-buying-opportunity/|title=Real Estate - Wicked Local|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each county has varying rules and regulations regarding what tax is due, and when it is due. The related forms may be tax lien certificates or tax deed certificates.

===Tax lien certificates===
Tax lien certificates are issued immediately upon the failure of the property owner to pay. These forms describe a lien on the property. The liens are generally in first position over every other encumbrance on the property, including liens secured by loans against the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedthomas.com/faq/|title=FAQ - Tax Lien Certificates - TedThomas.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax lien states are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and Wyoming. The District of Columbia is also a tax lien jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/states-allow-sale-tax-lien-certificates-58547.html|title=What States Allow the Sale of Tax Lien Certificates?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax deeds===
Tax deeds are issued after the owner of the property has failed to pay the taxes. Tax deeds are issued in connection with auctions in which the property is sold outright. The starting bid is often only for the back taxes owed, although the situation may vary from one county to another.

Tax deed states are Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reiclub.com/forums/index.php?topic=45764.0|title=List of Tax Certificate &amp; Tax Deed States -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax lien investing===
Tax liens and tax deeds can be purchased by an individual investor.

In the case of tax liens, interest can be earned. If the property is redeemed then the investor would recover invested money, plus interest due after the lien was purchased. If the property is not redeemed, the deed holder or lien holder has first position to own the property after any other taxes or fees are due.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleverdude.com/content/tax-lien-investing-in-the-united-states-how-hard-work-reaps-major-rewards/|title=Tax Lien Investing in the United States: How Hard Work Reaps Major...|first=|last=James|date=17 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Partnership for Excellence''' (formerly the ''Ohio Partnership for Excellence'') is a [[nonprofit organization]] that administers a state-level award program for performance excellence in Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. The award is based on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence], which are developed and maintained by the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/about/index.cfm Baldrige Performance Excellence Program], a program of the [https://www.nist.gov/index.html National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)].
__TOC__

==History==
The Ohio Partnership for Excellence was incorporated as a 501c(3) nonprofit organization in 1998 to provide state level Baldrige assessment services and resources for interested organizations. In 2011, it was renamed The Partnership for Excellence (TPE) to reflect regional expansion that includes the states of Indiana and West Virginia.&lt;ref name="regional expansion"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_07-28-11_Program_for_IN_&amp;_WV.htm Ohio Partnership for Excellence to Expand Programs to Indiana &amp; West Virginia], July 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first award cycle was completed in 1999-2000.

In January 2008, Dr. Elaine D. Edgar was appointed to Executive Director.&lt;ref name="New Director 2008"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_01-01-08_new_director.htm Announcement of a new Executive Director for the Ohio Partnership for Excellence], January 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After retirement from the role in March 2011, she was replaced by Colonel Alfred C. Faber, Jr. who was appointed to the position of President/CEO.&lt;ref name="New Director 2011"&gt;[http://www.thepartnershipforexcellence.org/html/press_releases/press_release_03-01-11_new_president-CEO.htm New OPE President / CEO Announced], March 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Baldrige Community==
*TPE is a member of the [http://www.baldrigepe.org/alliance/ Alliance for Performance Excellence] – a national network of state and local Baldrige-based awards programs.
*TPE Awards are based on the most recent Criteria for Performance Excellence – updated by the Baldrige Performance Excellence Program every two years.
*Starting in 2012, unless certain conditions are met, organizations from Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia are eligible to apply for the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award only if they have been awarded TPE's ''Governor's Award of Excellence'' in the previous five years.&lt;ref name="New Eligibility Q&amp;A 2012"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Q-A_2012_Changes_to_Baldrige_Award_Eligibility.pdf Q&amp;A: 2012 Changes to Baldrige Award Eligibility], December 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eligibility Rules"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/award_application.cfm Baldrige Award Application Forms webpage], retrieved March 27, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
TPE is a membership organization composed of interested individuals and organizations throughout Ohio, Indiana, and West Virginia. TPE collects annual membership dues for the January to December membership year.

==Board of Examiners==
TPE's Board of Examiners is composed of volunteer individuals who successfully complete annual training on the [https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/criteria.cfm Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence]. Advisors and examiners used during the awards process are drawn from the Board of Examiners.

==Product/Service==
TPE’s main product is a feedback report to the partnering organizations that successfully complete the award process. The report contains strengths as well as opportunities for improvement (OFI) derived from both the submitted application and a site visit. This is a distinct difference from the national Baldrige Award process&lt;ref name="Baldrige Application Form"&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/baldrige/publications/upload/Baldrige_Award_Application_Forms.pdf Baldrige Award Application Form], page 2&lt;/ref&gt; where only organizations with highly graded applications are granted a site visit.

TPE also provides Baldrige-related educational services such as conferences, seminars, and direct partnering with individuals and organizations.

==TPE Awards Process==
TPE provides three options for organizations wanting to improve their organizational performance:

===Advising===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to review the Criteria for Performance Excellence and assist in developing a 5-page Organizational Profile. After review of the organizational profile, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Spirit" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Partnering===
One or two advisors from TPE Board of Examiners meet with the leadership team of the partnering organization to develop a 25-page application addressing the Baldrige Criteria for Performance Excellence at the "overall" level. After review of this application, TPE provides the organization with a list of strengths and opportunities for improvement. Upon successful completion of this process, the organization receives a "Pioneer" recognition award at TPE's annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.

===Examining===
This is the traditional 50-page application assessment mirroring the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award's assessment cycle. Organizations participating in this option submit an ''Intent to Apply'' in October before the application due date in December each year. TPE assigns a team of 7 members from the Board of Examiners to review (independently and then by consensus) the application before a 3-day site visit is conducted. TPE then provides the organization with a list of strength and opportunities for improvement. Based on the recommendations of the examiners, TPE's Board of Trustees recognizes each organization with a Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum Award at the annual ''Quest for Success'' conference.
:*Platinum Level - Also called the ''Governor's Award for Excellence''
:*Gold Level - Also called the ''Achievement of Excellence'' Award
:*Silver Level - Also called the ''Commitment to Excellence'' Award
:*Bronze Level - Also called the ''Pledge to Excellence'' Award
:*In 2007, TPE also recognized two organizations with the ''Executive Director's Special Distinction'' award.

==Past ''Platinum Level - Governor's Award for Excellence'' Award Recipients==
Note:
*The Partnership for Excellence does not necessarily recognize an organization at the Platinum level every year. Awards may have been given at the Gold, Silver, or Bronze Levels only (not listed here).

'''Theofanis Tombras''' ({{lang-el|Θεοφάνης Τόμπρας}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''Theophanes Tompras'', [[Orthographic transcription|transcr.]] ''Theofanis Tombras'' or ''Tobras''), 1932 - 8 January 1996)&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"&gt;Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Hellenic Army|Greek Army]] officer (colonel of [[Military communications|signals]]) who ended up as deputy governor of [[OTE|Hellenic Telecommunications Organization S.A (OTE)]] (1981–1984) and finally governor and general manager of OTE (1984–1989). During his tenure, OTE became the highest-revenue [[state-owned enterprise]] in Greece. He also oversaw the completion of its large  complex in [[Marousi]] and the relocation of its operations there.

He was also engaged in other businesses, and became a manufacturer, with fruit processing facilities in [[Argolis]].

==Life==
Theofanis Tombras was born in 1932 in [[Merbaka]] (Agia Trias) in Argolis.&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"&gt;Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[Hellenic Military Academy]] and joined the Signal Corps. In the 1960s, as a captain, he served in the predecessor agency to the [[Hellenic National Intelligence Service]] and was accused of being a member of the clandestine [[Apostasia of 1965#The ASPIDA scandal|ASPIDA]] organization, an accusation of which he was eventually absolved, as he was of accusations of wiretapping the telephone conversations of political opponents of [[Andreas Papandreou]].&lt;ref&gt;Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996, «Πέθανε ο Τόμπρας»&lt;/ref&gt;

He took part in the resistance to the [[Greek military junta]]. After the electoral victory of [[PASOK]] in October 1981, he was made a deputy governor of OTE; later in February 1984, he became its governor. After amendments to its [[articles of organization]] in 1987, his title was changed to general director.

Under his direction, a signal effort began in the area of telephone modernization, and when it was recognized by his rivals&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"&gt;Αυριανή, 9/1/1996&lt;/ref&gt; even while they pointed out a certain concern for the reputation of the organization, they were considerably pleased by the reasoning behind the work being done.&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"/&gt; However, at certain times he was accused of high-handedness. He took the law into his own hands, to the detriment of the first president of OTE [[Tasos Mandelis]], when he summoned the Governing Board of OTE and had a loaded pistol placed on the boardroom table,&lt;ref name="kathnedos7138"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Kathimerini]]|author=Vasilis Nedos|title=Ο 20ετής «εναγκαλισμός» Siemens - ΟΤΕ|trans-title=The 20-year "embrace" of Siemens-OTE|language=el|publication-place=Athens|publication-date=13 July 2008|url=http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_1_13/07/2008_277586}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although he arranged for armed bodyguards who were not police (as is often the case for plain-clothes bodyguards in Greece), they themselves were of dubious origin.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt; The display of force was viewed at the time as a [[publicity stunt]] designed to [[bullying|intimidate]] [[journalists]]&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |last=Quinn |first=Patrick |date=May 23, 1989 |title= Former Minister Accused, Senior Official Jailed In Financial Scandal|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Former-Minister-Accused-Senior-Official-Jailed-In-Financial-Scandal/id-4f56ec99e0832b5f644b58c715b7d00d|newspaper=[[Associated Press]] Archives|location=Athens |access-date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He maintained a public friendship with the prime minister [[Andreas Papandreou]], had a slight connection to well-known billionaire [[Sokratis Kokkalis]],&lt;ref name="kathnedos7138"/&gt; and with the reporters [[Nikos Kakaounakis]] (editor of the newspaper ''To Kalami'') and Makis Kouris (editor of the ''[[Avriani]]''). Indeed, ''To Kalami'' had published on numerous occasions transcripts of cassettes that contained personal conversations of [[Constantine Karamanlis]], and the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party had denounced Tombras as the source of those cassettes.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

==1989==
Tombras was cast out of the general directorship of OTE on 2 July 1989, that is, the same day that a new cabinet under [[Tzannis Tzannetakis]] came to power.

After the return of the PASOK government in the summer of 1989, Tombras was accused of making deposits totaling to a then-[[Greek drachma]] equivalent of $12.5 million [[US dollar|USD]] in OTE money in the [[Bank of Crete (1980–1999)|Bank of Crete]] at below-market interest to help shore up the bank's finances,&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt; allegedly part of a scheme known as the [[Andreas Papandreou#.22Koskotas scandal.22.2C trial and return to power|Koskotas Scandal]]. Subsequently  he was accused of illegal telephone wiretapping of the political opponents of PASOK. On the first charge he was acquitted, and on the second he did not arrive in court because the parliament dismissed the prosecution after the acquittal of Andreas Papandreou in the Koskotas affair and the dramatic change in the political climate in January 1992.&lt;ref name="Αυριανή, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

==Death==
Tombras spent the last years of his life in his native Argolis, where he engaged in the fruit-processing trade, which he had originally entered in 1982.&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt; For all that, he remained active in the affairs of PASOK, especially in view of the succession of Andreas Papandreou in late 1995, where he supported [[Gerasimos Arsenis]].&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt; He died of cardiac arrest on 8 January 1996; at the same time Andreas Papandreou was ill and being treated at the Onaseio Cardiac Centre.&lt;ref name="Ελεύθερος Τύπος, 9/1/1996"/&gt; His funeral was attended by then-Speaker of the [[Parliament of Greece]] [[Apostolos Kaklamanis]]; then-[[Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection|Minister of Public Order]] [[Sifis Valirakis]]; then-Director of the [[National Intelligence Service (Greece)|Greek National Intelligence Service]], Admiral [[Leonidas Vasilikopoulos]]; PASOK parliamentarians and party members, and [[Sokratis Kokkalis]].&lt;ref name="Ελευθεροτυπία, 9/1/1996"/&gt;

'''Vagit Yusufovich Alekperov''' ({{lang-az|Vahid Yusuf oğlu Ələkbərov}}, {{lang-ru|Вагит Юсуфович Алекперов}}; born 1 September 1950) is an Azerbaijani and Russian businessman, the president of the leading Russian oil company [[LUKOIL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vagit Yu. Alekperov, President of OAO LUKOIL|url=http://www.lukoil.com/back/gallery__image__list_6_5did_243_.html|access-date=2015-08-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906145212/http://www.lukoil.com/back/gallery__image__list_6_5did_243_.html|archive-date=2015-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018 he is rated by [[Forbes (magazine)|''Forbes'' magazine]] as the sixth richest person in Russia with a net worth of $17.2 billion and the 74th richest person in the world.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/vagit-alekperov |title=Vagit Alekperov|work=Forbes|accessdate=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Alekperov was born in [[Baku]], one of the earliest centers of the international petroleum industry. His father, who died when Vagit was a boy, worked in the oilfields all his life and inspired Alekperov to follow in his footsteps. Alekperov's father was an [[Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijani]] Muslim and his mother, [[Russian Orthodox]]. Alekperov is religious, but does not define himself as either Muslim or Orthodox.&lt;ref name=petermaass.com&gt;{{cite news|last=Maass|first=Peter|title=The Triumph of the Quiet Tycoon|url=http://www.petermaass.com/articles/the_triumph_of_the_quiet_tycoon/|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|date=2 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eighteen when he landed his first job in the industry.

Alekperov graduated in 1974 from [[Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute]]. As a student he also worked as a drilling operator in [[Kaspmorneft]], a [[Caspian sea|Caspian]] regional production company.

After graduation, he continued to work there, and by 1979 he had advanced from engineer to deputy head of a production unit. He had to work in extreme conditions on [[oil platform]]s. On one occasion, an explosion on his rig threw him into the stormy [[Caspian sea]], and he had to swim for his life.

Alekperov moved to Western [[Siberia]] in 1979 and worked at ''[[Surgutneftegaz]]'' between 1979 and 1985, earning his reputation as an industry expert. He was ascending positions and by 1985 became first deputy general director of [[Bashneft]] production company. In 1987, he became general director of the newly created production company ''Kogalymneftegaz''.

In 1990, Alekperov was appointed deputy minister of the Oil and Gas Industry of the [[Soviet Union]] and became the youngest deputy energy minister in Soviet history. At that time, Alekperov promoted the establishment of vertically integrated state-owned energy companies, which would bring together the wide range of organizations in the energy sector that were, at the time, reporting to different Soviet bureaucratic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vagit Y. Alekperov 1950— Biography|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/A-E/Alekperov-Vagit-Y-1950.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As deputy minister of the oil and gas industry of the Soviet Union, Alekperov was engaged in the formation of the first vertically integrated state-owned energy company, ''Langepas-Uray-Kogalymneft'', which was established in late 1991 as a subsidiary of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy. In April 1993, ''Langepas-Uray-Kogalymneft'' became [[LUKoil]] Oil Company, with Alekperov as its president.

Alekperov has remained president of ''LUKoil'' since that time. Employing more than 100,000 people, today ''LUKoil'' is among the world's most powerful{{clarify|date=February 2018}} oil companies, with reserves second only to [[ExxonMobil]].

''LUKoil'' was the first Russian company to acquire an American company. In November 2000, ''LUKoil'' acquired [[Getty Oil|Getty Petroleum Marketing]] and its 1,300 gas stations in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lukoilamericas.com/rebranding.htm |title=Lukoil Americas Corporation website |access-date=2007-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315211511/http://www.lukoilamericas.com/rebranding.htm |archive-date=2007-03-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many other [[Russian oligarch]]s, Alekperov has also moved into banking and media. In May 2006 Alekperov was one of the two main owners of [[IFD Kapital Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Teagarden |first=Michael |title=Lukoil Executives Alekperov and Fedun Own Russia's IFD Kapital |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2006-03-01/lukoil-executives-alekperov-and-fedun-own-russia-s-ifd-kapital.html |accessdate=11 April 2014 |agency=Bloomberg News |date=1 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141839/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2006-03-01/lukoil-executives-alekperov-and-fedun-own-russia-s-ifd-kapital.html |archivedate=13 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Alekperov is married to Larisa Victorovna Alekperova and has a son Yusuf born in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Вагит Юсуфович Алекперов. Биографическая справка|url=http://ria.ru/economy/20090312/164556722.html|accessdate=20 March 2014|publisher=РИА Новости|date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
