A '''Business and Computing''' is a [[double degree|dual degree]] program offered jointly by some computing and business schools. The program generally lasts four-five years instead of seven-eight years to complete separate the two degrees and results in the candidate earning both a [[Bachelor of Business]] degree and a [[Bachelor of Computing]] degree.  Graduating Business and Computing students may choose to work on computing/technical matter, or enter the business world, or even enjoy the gray area between business and computing fields such as IT security officer, IT consultant, etc. Even though a majority of Business and Computing graduate from a single university, there are people who earn these degrees from different universities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5629">{{About|the concept of the [[Sovereign state|state]] in a capitalist system|variants of capitalism based on state-owned business|state capitalism|}}
{{Capitalism |Related}}

The '''capitalist state''' is the [[state (polity)|state]], its functions, and the form of organization it takes within [[capitalist]] socioeconomic systems.&lt;ref name="Recent theories of the capitalist State, 1977"&gt;''Recent theories of the capitalist State'', by Jessop, Bob. 1977. Soviet Studies, pp. 353-373, vol. 1, no. 4, Jan. 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is often used interchangeably with the concept of the "modern state"; however there are many differences in sociological characteristics among capitalist states, despite their common functions.&lt;ref name = "Morishima 1976, 1"&gt;Morishima, Michio (1976). [https://books.google.com/books?id=aC45AAAAIAAJ ''The Economic Theory of Modern Society''.] New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-21088-7}}. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary functions of the capitalist state are to provide a legal framework and infrastructural framework that is conducive to [[business]] enterprise and the [[accumulation of capital]]. Different normative theories exist on the necessary and appropriate function of the state in a capitalist economy, with proponents of [[Laissez-faire|laissez-faire]] favoring a state limited to the provision of public goods and safeguarding private property rights, while proponents of interventionism stress the importance of regulation, intervention and economic stabilization in providing the framework for the accumulation of capital and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Comparative Economic Transformations: Mainland China, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Taiwan|author=Yu-Shan Wu|year=1995|publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=8|quote=In laissez-faire capitalism, the state restricts itself to providing public goods and services that the economy cannot generate by itself and to safeguarding private ownership and the smooth operation of the self-regulating market.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Karl Marx]] the capitalist state is understood to be a reflection of the economic base, with its chief function reflecting the needs of the capitalist economy. This involves creating the legal and infrastructural framework - the superstructure - that facilitates capitalism, as well as balancing the needs of the various classes to ensure the perpetuation of capitalism. This often involves attempts to safeguard state policy from being used to benefit specific capitalists or firms at the expense of the bourgeoisie as a whole. [[Karl Marx]] hence described the function of the executive of a capitalist state as "nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie". Specifically, in Marx's view, the capitalist state necessarily exists to serve the interests of capitalists (referred to as "the bourgeoisie"), not as a defect but as a necessary feature of capitalism. Thus thinkers in the Marxist tradition often refer to the capitalist state as the ''Dictatorship of the bourgeoisie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Graeme Duncan |title= Democracy and the Capitalist state |publisher= Cambridge University Press |date=March 1989 |isbn= 9780521280624|page = 85|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[Instrumental Marxism|Instrumental Marxist]] tradition stress the role of policymakers and political elites sharing a common business or class background, leading to their decisions reflecting their class interest. This is differentiated from more contemporary notions of state capture by specific business interests for the benefit of those specific businesses and not the ruling class or capitalist system as a whole, which is variously referred to as [[crony capitalism]] or "[[Corporatocracy]]".

==Career==
Before joining the Curtis Publishing Company, Parlin acted as a schoolteacher in the state of Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of qualitative research methods in marketing |last=W. Belk |first=Russell |authorlink= |year=2006 |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location= |isbn= |page=5 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wikcliAq_SMC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BvIcTbTgGI6osQOc_MiiAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he was hired by the Curtis Publishing Company in a job that had no clearly defined title, as the work he was doing had not previously been done.&lt;ref&gt;Nair, S.E., ''Market Research: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., Himalaya Publishing House, 2014, &lt;Online: www.himpub.com/documents/Chapter873.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Parlin came up with the name "commercial research" for his work, which would later end up being changed to market research. The company had just bought out the magazine, [[Country Gentleman]], but the owner of the company, [[Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis]], had little knowledge about agriculture. Since much of the advertising in the ''Country Gentleman'' magazine was purchased by the agriculturalists, Parlin began researching agriculture in general. After six months of interviews with a number of people in the industry, he completed a 460-page survey that "revealed unsuspected facts about where agricultural tools were made, to whom they were sold, when, and where."&lt;ref name="Americans"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Americans, the democratic experience |last=Joseph Boorstin |first=Daniel |authorlink= |year=1974 |publisher=Random House, Inc |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RicRyr47FMgC&amp;pg=PT218&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_OUcTePmBpS8sAOZqpXxCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this, Parlin carried out a study on "the market for almost everything in the nation's one hundred largest cities," which involved 1,121 interviews across the nation, compiling all of the fuindings in order to draw conclusions about the workings of the national market. His "pioneer report", ''Department Store Lines'', was released in 1912 and it focused on the distinctions between convenience goods and shopping goods and how the marketer should focus on selling primarily shopping goods in order to obtain the highest profits.&lt;ref name="Americans" /&gt;

In 1914, Parlin released a five-volume study titled ''Automobiles''. It focused on the future of the automobile age and "collected facts on manufacturing and distribution, on the influence of women on automobile purchase". The study predicted correctly that the number of grades and makes would be reduced in the future and it "envisaged the dimensions and even the shape of the automobile market." This information resulted in an increase in advertising by automobile manufacturers, in order to obtain customers faster than their competitors in the burgeoning market for automobiles.&lt;ref name="Americans" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Technology as magic: the triumph of the irrational |last=Stivers |first=Richard |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location= |isbn= |page=88 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gO12jZ_m9LYC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0PccTb70JomosAOMhOGyAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwCDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely due to Parlin's success, other commercial organisations began creating Departments of Commercial Research including: [[United States Rubber Company]] in 1915 and [[Swift and Company]] in 1916. Foreseeing a need for "standardized definitions and common measures" after the release of Parlin's studies, the [[Audit Bureau of Circulations (North America)|Audit Bureau of Circulations]] was formed in 1914 in order to regulate publisher's claims for newspaper and magazine circulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The SAGE handbook of marketing theory |last=Maclaran |first=Pauline |authorlink= |author2=Tadajewski, Mark |author3=Stern, Barbara |author4= Saren, Michael  |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |location= |isbn= |page=76 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyCnacSPg0oC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=k_UcTYuDGpK6sQOVitWjAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwATgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, Parlin went on to found the "first commercial research company" with [[Donald M. Hobart]], backed by the Curtis Publishing Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Computer-aided marketing and selling: information asset management |last=Shaw |first=Robert |authorlink= |year=1991 |publisher=Robert Shaw |location= |isbn= |page=80 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8MAEjyztR4C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22Charles+Coolidge+Parlin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BvIcTbTgGI6osQOc_MiiAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Charles%20Coolidge%20Parlin%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; called [[National Analysts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=James Playsted Wood |date=January 1962 |title=Donald M.

==Legacy==
The ''Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award'' was established in 1945 by "the Philadelphia Chapter of the AMA and The Wharton School in association with the Curtis Publishing Company to honor persons who have made outstanding contributions to the field of marketing research." It is meant to act as a memorial to Parlin, due to his creation of the field of market research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://themarketingfoundation.org/parlin.html |title=Charles Coolidge Parlin Marketing Research Award |author= |work= |publisher=[[American Marketing Association]] |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chryss Goulandris, Lady O'Reilly''' (born 27 June 1950), also known as Christina or Chryssanthie, is one of the richest women associated with [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and holds both USA and Greek citizenship.  For many years, she owned a major horse breeding operation located in Ireland, France and other countries and was Chairperson of the [[Irish National Stud]] for over a decade. She is the wife of former media and industrial magnate [[Tony O'Reilly]], and is heavily involved with [[The Ireland Funds]].

==Life==
She was born in the United States to John [[Goulandris]], a wealthy member of a [[Greek shipping|Greek family of ship owners]] and operators, and Maria [[Lemos]], from another Greek shipping dynasty. The family lived at the time in the [[Savoy Palace Hotel]], with homes also in Greece, Connecticut, Switzerland and the Bahamas.

She grew up primarily in America (on [[Fifth Avenue, New York]]), with holidays spent in Greece, chiefly on the family's ancestral home island, [[Andros]]. Her father died when she was three, and her only brother, Peter, recently born.

She studied French civilisation and art history at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris, then returned to New York, working in the family offices, her business activities ranging from silver futures trading to horse breeding.&lt;ref name="2001 interview"&gt;London, UK: ''The Racing Post'', 15 July 2001, Michael Clower, "Lady O'Reilly Interview: Rebel line flies the flag for O'Reilly's worldwide empire"&lt;/ref&gt;

She met Tony O'Reilly briefly, with her brother, in [[Manhattan]] in 1989, at the [[The Pierre|Pierre Hotel]], his usual base when staying in New York; he was in New York seeking funding for [[Waterford Wedgwood]]. They next met in 1990, after O'Reilly invited her to the ''Heinz 57'' race in Dublin that year (she knew Ireland because of horse racing and breeding and was already considering buying a stud farm there), and a relationship developed, with the two becoming a couple in [[Lyford Cay]] the following Easter.

On September 14, 1991, they were married in the [[Bahamas]], Goulandris's first marriage and O'Reilly's second. At the time, O'Reilly was said to be worth around $520 million and Goulandris $450 million, though some reports{{Which|date=June 2011}} said the latter was worth more than the former.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In 1996, Tony O'Reilly bid $2.6 million for the {{convert|40|carat|g}} diamond engagement ring of [[Jacqueline Onassis]], to give as a gift to Goulandris, who had known the Onassis family, and she, with some [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] executives, made a naming gift in her husband's honor in 1999 with the [[O'Reilly Theater]] in [[Pittsburgh]].

==Homes==
Goulandris shares a range of residences with her husband.  Although not tax resident in Ireland, one of her main homes is [[Castlemartin House and Estate]] near [[Kilcullen]], [[County Kildare]], which includes a horse stud facility and a Charolais cattle breeding operation.  She managed the restoration of the Georgian house's upper floor and roof.  Her official main residence is a house in the closed executive development of [[Lyford Cay]] near Nassau, the [[Bahamas]]; othera are a  complex on the southern coast of Ireland at Shorecliffe, [[Glandore]], [[County Cork]], and a Georgian townhouse on Fitzwilliam Square, [[Dublin]], and a chateau in [[Deauville]], France.  She also owns property in New York.

==Horse breeding==
Goulandris owns, breeds, trains and races horses under a number of house names, including at least ''Castlemartin Stud'' (shared with her husband), ''Petra Bloodstock Agency'', ''Skymarc Farm''.  Castlemartin Stud is situated on the estate around one of her principal homes, with operations in multiple countries, and her horses are trained in Ireland, England, Normandy in France and in the USA at a stud called Matagorda, with many trainers employed across the various locations.

Two of her uncles were involved in racing, one, George, winning the English Oaks in 1962 and another, Constantin, owning the La Louviere Stud in France.  She bought her first racing horse, a yearling filly, in 1976, and in 1978, following her uncle Constantin's death, took over La Louviere Stud.

At the end of October 2006, she had around 100 horses in training, and 128 brood mares.  Her operations have a policy of selling male foals, and one of those sold was Helissio who won the 1996 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, while one retained was European champion miler in 1991.  In all, she has bred 11 Group 1 winners, including two wins at Royal Ascot.

===National Stud===
In 1993, Goulandris was appointed to the board of the Irish National Stud by the Minister for Agriculture, and in early June 1998, she was made its chairperson by Joe Walsh, in succession to David Shubotham,&lt;ref&gt;London, UK: The Racing Post, "O'Reilly in Chair"&lt;/ref&gt; a post she continues to hold.

==Wealth==
Estimates of her personal wealth have varied greatly, but have exceeded 400 million USD since the early 1990s.  In June 2004, it was reported that she would be a major beneficiary of the sale of a family-owned unit of land in New York, assembled in the 1970s at a cost of about 25 million USD, for around 400 million USD&lt;ref&gt;London, UK: The Times, June 7, 2004, Finance, "Talking Points" – par. 2, "Talk of the Day"&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005, her personal wealth was estimated at 442 million UK pounds.&lt;ref name="RichList05"&gt;London, UK: The Sunday Times, April 3, 2005: Colm Murphy, 'The Rich List 2005: Ireland's richest 250'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
In June 1994, she was appointed a non-executive director of [[Waterford Wedgwood]] plc, with special responsibility for organizing commemorative events for the bicentenary of the death of [[Josiah Wedgwood]].&lt;ref&gt;London, UK: The Independent, June 18, 1994, Alison Eadie, "Job in china for Mrs O'Reilly"&lt;/ref&gt;  She resigned this role in January 2009. She was a director of the Wedgwood Museum Trust until June 2007 and is now an honorary member.

She has been Chairperson of the [[O'Reilly Foundation]] since its establishment, was invited by family friend [[Paul Newman]] to be first Chairperson of the [[Barrettstown Castle]] ''Hole in the Wall Club''.

===The Ireland Funds===
Goulandris has been involved with [[The Ireland Funds]] for many years, especially with the annual Pittsburgh fundraising dinner.  She is the ''President d'Honneur'' of the Ireland Fund of France, and funded since 1993 the ''bourse Chryss O'Reilly de l'Ireland Fund de France'', a 2000 euro per annum scholarship for eight universities in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

'''Chung Ju-yung''' or '''Jung Joo-young''' (November 25, 1915 – March 21, 2001), was a South Korean entrepreneur, businessman and the founder of [[Hyundai]] Groups of [[South Korea]]. Raised as the eldest son of a poor Korean farmer, he eventually became one of the world's richest men. Chung's business ventures were able to successfully endure through the difficult times of the Japanese occupation of Korea and later through the [[Korean War]] of the 1950's. Chung explained his success in his statement, "Conviction creates indomitable efforts. This is the key to (true) miracles.... Man's potential is limitless." &lt;ref&gt;Made in Korea: Chung Ju Yung and the Rise of Hyundai.  By Richard M. Steers.  Pg. 1. 1998. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

===Early life===
Chung Ju-yung was born in [[Kangwon Province (North Korea)]] when [[Korea under Japanese rule|Korea was under Japanese rule]]. Born to a large impoverished family of peasants, he was the eldest of seven children. As a young boy, Chung dreamed of becoming a school teacher, but his hopes were cut short because the restrictive environment at the time kept the family stuck in poverty, effectively keeping Chung away from [[higher education|higher educational]] opportunities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Despite the setbacks, Chung was able to attend a local [[Confucian]] school run by his grandfather whenever his time was not taken up by tasks on the family farm.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"&gt;{{cite book | title=Made In Korea: Chung Ju Yung and the rise of Hyundai | isbn=0-415-92050-7 | author=Richard M. Steers | publisher=[[Routledge]] | year=1999 | authorlink=Richard M. Steers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung’s talent for [[business]] became apparent during his trips into town where he would sell wood.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The fast-paced atmosphere of the town along with the articles in [[newspapers]] he read sparked his [[imagination]] and he soon grew tired of the [[poverty]] that he and his family had to endure. 

====First escape attempt====
At the age of sixteen, Chung and a friend decided to travel to the city of [[Chongjin]] for work in hopes of escaping the harsh realities of farm life.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"&gt;[http://www.asanmuseum.com/english/sub07_english01.htm Chung ju yung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008184233/http://www.asanmuseum.com/english/sub07_english01.htm |date=2007-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 15-mile trek through the most dangerous parts of the [[Paechun]] valley, the pair reached the town of [[Kowon]] where they took up jobs as [[Construction|construction workers]].&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999" /&gt; They worked long hours for low pay but Chung enjoyed the fact that he could earn money independently. Chung and his friend continued the work for two months until Chung's father learned of their whereabouts.

====Second escape attempt====
The journey that Chung and his friend had embarked on made him realize his passion for [[civil engineering]] and gave him a sense of accomplishment. Once he returned to [[Asan]], he devised another escape plan; this time towards [[Seoul]]. With two companions, Chung left for Seoul in April 1933.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999" /&gt; The journey seemed destined for failure, especially since one of the boys was caught by a sibling early on. More misfortune came upon them when Chung and his friend were conned by a stranger who promised them jobs but instead took all of their money. The journey came to an end when Chung's father found the two staying at Chung's grandfather's house nearby.

====Third escape attempt====
Chung once again found himself in Asan, where he remained for a year helping his father work on the family farm. Once his duties to the family were complete, Chung decided it was time to make another attempt at getting out of poverty. He managed to get a train ticket for 70 [[South Korean won|won]] by selling one of his father's cows.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; Once he arrived in [[Seoul]], Chung enrolled himself in a local [[bookkeeping]] school hoping to start a career as an [[accountant]]. Things went smoothly for two months when his father managed to find him and after a mild argument, took him back to Asan.

===Rice merchant===
In 1933,&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; at the age of 18, Chung decided to make a fourth attempt to escape. He left during the night with a friend who was trying to escape a [[forced marriage]].&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt; Once Chung reached [[Seoul]] he jumped at any job he could find. He worked first as a laborer at [[Incheon]] Harbor,&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; a construction worker at Boseong Professional School and as a handyman for a starch syrup factory.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt;

After working at the syrup factory for nearly a year, Chung managed to land a job as a [[deliveryman]] at the Bokheung Rice Store in Seoul.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; Chung's new job offered him room for advancement and as he became more successful at it, he decided to stay on full-time. He eventually won the praise of the rice store's core customers which impressed the owner so much that he allowed Chung to manage the store's accounting after only six months on the job.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} His experiences as the store [[accountant]] helped him to thoroughly develop his business sense.

In 1937, the owner of the rice store became ill and decided it would be in his best interest to give the store to Chung. At 22 years of age, Chung became the store owner and changed the name of the store to Kyungil Rice Store.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; The store grew and made good profits until early 1939 when Japan, in its war efforts to secure rice supplies for the country and its military, imposed an oppressive rice-rationing system which forced Korean businesses out of trading rice.&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt;

===Creation of Hyundai===

====A-do Service Garage====
Chung returned to his [[village]] once his business failed and remianed there until 1940, when he decided to try again in Seoul. After considering the reality of restrictions imposed on Koreans in certain industries by the Japanese colonial government, Chung decided to enter the [[automobile]] repair business. Using a service garage he purchased from a friend, Chung started the A-do Service Garage on a 3,000 [[South Korean won|won]] [[loan]]. Within three years, the number of employees grew from 20 to 70 and Chung was able to earn a good income. In 1943, the Japanese Occupational Government forced the garage to merge with a steel plant as part of the war effort.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chung ju yung"/&gt; Although his businesses were shut down due to suppression by the Japanese, Chung returned to Asan with 50,000 won in savings to try to make the best of the situation.&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt;

====Hyundai====
In 1946, after the liberation of Korea from Japanese control, Chung started [[Hyundai]] and Hyundai Civil Industries in anticipation of the post-war reconstruction and industrialization. Chung won major government contracts and became responsible for building much of South Korea's transportation infrastructure, including the [[Soyang Dam]] in 1967, the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] in 1970, the world's largest [[shipyard]] in [[Ulsan]], the [[Kori Nuclear Power Plant]] among others. Chung also won contracts from the American military to build facilities for their personnel as his younger brother could speak English and was on good terms with the U.S. Army engineers.

During the [[North Korea's Invasion of South Korea|North Korean invasion of 1950]], Chung abandoned his construction projects and fled with his younger brother to [[Busan]] for safety. His son, [[Chung Mong-joon]] was born there. Chung continued to build onto the company by gathering any kind of work he could get from the [[United Nations Command (Korea)|U.N. forces]] and the [[Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs|Korean Ministry of Transportation]].&lt;ref name="Richard M. Steers 1999"/&gt; Once Seoul was retaken by U.N. forces, Chung reestablished the company and continued to gather more work from the Americans. Hyundai was known for great gas-saving methods.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

From then on, Chung continued to grow and diversify the company into one of South Korea's major [[chaebol]] (conglomerate). With no experience in shipbuilding, he created the Ulsan shipyard, the largest shipyard in the world. The first vessel was completed in three years (rather than the expected five) as Chung had the shipyard and vessel built simultaneously. He introduced the [[Hyundai Pony]] in 1975 and the [[Hyundai Excel]] in 1986 using European expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Autopolis (2011). "[https://autopolis.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/1975-1982-hyundai-pony-an-almost-cinderella-story/ 1975-1982 Hyundai Pony: An Almost Cinderella Story]".&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Autopolis (2011). "[https://autopolis.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/1985-1994-hyundai-excel-the-car-that-launched-a-million-ships/ https://autopolis.wordpress.com/2011/05/15/1985-1994-hyundai-excel-the-car-that-launched-a-million-ships/]".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===

From the 1980s until recently, the Hyundai Group was split into many satellite groups. Chung had a very successful career. In [[Seosan City|Seosan]], he carried out a successful reclamation project, using a decommissioned [[oil tanker]] as a [[cofferdam]].&lt;ref name="Oil"&gt;Amazon (2010). "[https://www.amazon.com.au/Korean-Founders-Automobile-Manufacturers-Books/dp/1158277865 Korean Founders of Automobile Manufacturers]".&lt;/ref&gt; Also, he sent 1001 cows over the [[Demilitarized Zone (Korea)|DMZ]] to North Korea. He was the first to propose the [[Kumgang-san|Geumgangsan]] sightseeing excursions.&lt;ref name="Oil"/&gt; He founded the Hyundai Heavy Steel Company which developed a non-dock ship-making method.

Chung's philanthropy distinguished him from the other businessmen of his generation. In 1977, he founded the [[Asan Foundation]] with a scope of activities comparable to those of the Ford or Rockefeller Foundations. It Foundation was organized into four major areas of service: medical support, social welfare, research and development, and a scholarship fund. Through its efforts, the Foundation established nine hospitals throughout South Korea, built Ulsan Medical College, and funded the Asan Life Sciences Research Institute. The Foundation also initiated cooperative arrangements between industry and academic institutions by supporting such academic research as the Sinyoung Research Fund.

=== Political activities ===
Chung is credited with successfully lobbying for South Korea to host the [[1988 Summer Olympics]]. This success highlighted the accomplishments of his generation in the eyes of the world and became a source of great pride to the people of Seoul. In 1992 the [[International Olympic Committee]] awarded Chung an IOC Medallion for his contributions to sports as a vehicle of international understanding.

Chung ran unsuccessfully as a presidential candidate for the 1992 Korean presidential elections.

Chung also worked to normalize relations between the two Koreas. In 1998, at the age of 82, he worked with the South Korean government to provide economic assistance to the North. [[Kim Dae-jung|President Kim]] wanted to provide a $100 million donation as a way to jump-start economic development in North Korea. However, Kim could not find a legal way to transfer the funds. He turned to Chung, who was already negotiating a large program with the North. Kim persuaded Chung to increase his investment by $100 million with money from secret loans provided by the government-controlled [[Korea Development Bank]]. The historic South-North summit took place, with Chung traveling across the border in a motorcade of cars containing some 1001 "[[Korean reunification|unification]] cows" as a gift to the North Korean people.

===Death===
Chung died at the age of 85 of [[natural causes]] at his home in Seoul, and he was buried in accordance to Buddhist and Confucian customary rites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?linkid=12&amp;articleid=2007032212590767180&amp;newssetid=82 故 정주영 명예회장 묘소 참배하는 이명박]; [http://www.wowzine.net/wowzine/2001/09-03.htm 이제는 새 청사진을 그려야 할 때] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051105063446/http://www.wowzine.net/wowzine/2001/09-03.htm |date=2005-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife, Byun Joong-seok, died on August 17, 2008 at the age of 88, due in part to long-term heart complications,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2007081839148 Hyundai’s Cornerstone Passes Away]; [http://kr.news.yahoo.com/service/news/shellview.htm?linkid=4&amp;articleid=2007082108181515914&amp;newssetid=746 '현대家의 대모' 변중석 여사 영원히 잠들다]&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in a family graveyard in [[Hanam]], along with her husband and their son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200308/200308080007.html 2,000 Attend Funeral Services for Chung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224141803/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200308/200308080007.html |date=2007-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career and personal life==
Chung became a politician when he was elected as an assembly man in 1988 and served consecutive 7 terms in two different electoral districts. Initially he was elected in [[Dong District, Ulsan]] where predominant share of its population consisted of [[Hyundai Heavy Industries Group]]'s employees, its affiliated companies' employees, and their families. Most of other population in [[Dong District, Ulsan|Dong District]] run businesses related with serving those workers and their families. Chung served as a representative of this particular district for 20 years. He joined [[Grand National Party]] in 2007 shortly before 2007 South Korean presidential election, declaring his support to that party's presidential candidate [[Lee Myung-bak]]. As a member of [[Grand National Party]], he switched his electoral district to [[Dongjak District]], [[Seoul]], and represented there as an assembly man for 2 terms until 2014 when he had to give up that seat to run for mayor of Seoul, but the election was lost to [[Park Won-soon]] leaving no political titles for Chung after. [[Grand National Party]] changed its name to [[Liberty Korea Party|Saenuri Party]] in 2012. Chung had announced his candidacy for [[FIFA]] president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bigstory.ap.org/article/6cc76f47c47c4b3da8727c84c0b6f8a1/chung-mong-joon-announces-bid-run-fifa-president Chung Mong-Joon announces bid to run for FIFA president  - Associated Press Aug. 17, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; However he was banned from all football activities for six years by [[FIFA Ethics Committee]] in October 2015.&lt;ref name=FIFAban&gt;{{cite web |title=Independent Ethics Committee bans several football officials |publisher=FIFA.com |date=8 October 2015 |url=https://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2015/m=10/news=independent-ethics-committee-bans-several-football-officials-2709916.html |quote=The former FIFA Vice-President Chung Mong-joon has been banned for six years and fined CHF 100,000.

===Presidential campaign of 2002===
In 2002, he ran for the presidency, but later gave up his candidacy supporting [[Millennium Democratic Party]]'s candidate [[Roh Moo-hyun]]. Their coalition was motivated to prevent [[Grand National Party]] from winning the presidential election. South Korean regionalism became much more serious and antagonistic under President [[Kim Dae-jung]]'s term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0004439079 초점 영남권에 근거없는 유언비어 확산, 연합뉴스 01-21-1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0000018992 경남권 "노무현 고향은 전라도" 소문 파다&lt;주간조선&gt; "10대조부터 김해 거주" 보도, 오마이뉴스 12-13-2002 ]&lt;/ref&gt; President Kim is the only South Korean president coming from [[Jeolla]] province, whereas all the other South Korean presidents since General [[Park Chung-hee]]'s [[May 16 coup|military coup]] in 1961 have been from [[Gyeongsang]] province.

Chung participated in Roh's presidential campaign up to the last day before the election, Dec 19, 2002. On Dec 18 afternoon, before the crowd of his supporters in [[Myeong-dong]], [[Seoul]], Roh suggested [[Chung Dong-young]] and [[Choo Mi-ae]] as viable choices of candidates for the next presidential race in 2007. Roh suggested those Democratic Party's politicians when he saw some of the crowd having slogans "Chung Mong-joon for the next presidential candidate" Roh's suggestion was not intended to exclude Chung as a presidential candidate, but to encourage and to praise his party's politicians in return to their supports to his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0000292316 與盧 파기발단 문제발언 해명, 연합뉴스 12-19-2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung's joining of [[Grand National Party]] is an irony because his withdrawal from the presidential race in 2002 supporting [[Roh Moo-hyun]] was responsible for [[Grand National Party]]'s failure in winning the presidential election. The party's candidate [[Lee Hoi-chang]] received absolute support from conservative or anti [[Jeolla]] voters. By the help of Chung's withdrawal, the election became bipolar between Roh and Lee, and Roh turned out to be a winner receiving exclusive support from reform-minded Korean voters. [[Grand National Party]] had to wait another 5 years to produce a president from this defeat. Also his declaration to support [[Lee Myung-bak]] when he joined [[Grand National Party]] is an irony. When Chung's father [[Chung Ju-yung]] ran for the presidency in 1992, [[Lee Myung-bak]] supported [[Kim Young-sam]] instead of [[Chung Ju-yung]] despite the fact that Lee made fortune and fame when he worked at Hyundai.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=115&amp;oid=214&amp;aid=0000046725 이명박, 샐러리맨 성공신화, MBC TV 08-21-2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e-today.co.kr/200707/news/newsview.php?TM=news&amp;SM=0101&amp;idxno=150000 이명박-현대家, 앙금 풀어지나?, 이투데이 12-20-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chung Ju-yung]] even bought him a luxurious house when Lee worked for [[Chung Ju-yung]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=003&amp;aid=0004995928 李 대통령 "시민으로 돌아간다"…논현동 자택 복귀, 뉴시스 02-24-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; So Chung supported his father's ex subordinate who in fact hadn't supported his father in earlier presidential race.

Chung's brother [[Chung Mong-hun]], then the president of [[Hyundai Asan]] who pioneered South and North joint [[Mount Kumgang]] tour business, committed suicide on Aug 4, 2003 when he was investigated by prosecutors for his alleged $400 millions cash remit to [[North Korea]] shortly before 2000 [[Inter-Korean summit|North-South summit]].

In his autobiography which was published in 2011, Chung argues that President Roh didn't refuse [[Grand National Party]]'s demand of investigation because he believes Roh actually wanted to investigate his brother to revenge on his withdrawal of supporting Roh in [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;[http://book.naver.com/bookdb/book_detail.nhn?bid=6729144  나의도전 나의열정 (정몽준의 인생과 세상 이야기), 정몽준 저, 김영사 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another ironical point behind Chung's joining of [[Grand National Party]]. The party tried to dig and disclose Chung's private life information to defame him in [[South Korean presidential election, 2002|2002 presidential election]]&lt;ref name="Private"&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=047&amp;aid=0000017072 정몽준 '사생활'을 캐라!한나라, 'MJ 흑색선전' 문건 논란, 오마이뉴스 11-25-2002]&lt;/ref&gt; These included his alleged prior diagnosis of mental disorder in school years, his cheating incidence during final exam in college years, questionable identity of his real mother, discredit of his [[Johns Hopkins University]] doctoral degree, and etc.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; Some of these rumors have turned out to be true. In conclusion Chung settled at the party which had been at odds with him before.

Chung was known to be suspended and repeat courses for cheating final exam when he was a freshman in [[Seoul National University]].&lt;ref name="커닝"&gt;[http://www.businesspost.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=1928  Who Is ? 정몽준 전 새누리당 의원, 비즈니스포스트 05-15-2014]&lt;/ref&gt; He was caught by an exam monitor when he was peeping at some other classmate's exam over shoulder during final exam.&lt;ref name="커닝" /&gt; He was reported to disciplinary committee and got such punishment after the incidence. Chung gave an excuse for this, saying he cheated final exam trying to finish it early to go out with his friends.&lt;ref name="커닝" /&gt; Chung is the only known public figure in Korean history having such record.

Chung's real mother is unknown. When he ran for the South Korean presidency in 2002, [[Grand National Party]] explored this point.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; They speculated about the identity of Chung's real mother. They speculated that his real mother could be a house maid, a [[geisha]], or a particular traditional musician whom [[Chung Ju-yung]] had an affair with.&lt;ref name="Private" /&gt; In fact, in his interview with news reporters in 2002, Chung indicated that his real mother is someone else, saying he would reveal the truth someday.&lt;ref name="Mom"&gt;&gt;[http://woman.donga.com/docs/magazine/woman/2002/10/07/200210070500045/200210070500045_1.html 대선 출마 선언하며 자신의 출생 비밀 솔직하게 털어놓은 정몽준의원, 여성동아 10-01-2002]&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that he was crying when he was questioned about his real mother.&lt;ref name="Mom" /&gt; Chung explained about his real mother in his autobiography in 2011. Chung says that when he studied in US in 1978, he received a letter from someone in Korea who claimed to be his real mother. He hurried to return to Korea, and met her at her place, according to his autobiography. Chung says this was the first and last for him to see that woman.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

===Presidential campaign of 2012===
Shortly after he published his autobiography in 2011, some South Korean media reported an allegation that his shipbuilding company bought a large sum of his autobiography in order to make it known as a best seller.&lt;ref name="사재기"&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/498883.html  “정몽준 자서전 현대중 직원 동원 ‘사재기’”, 한겨레 10-02-2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The media gathered that information after interviewing inside personnel, and found that [[Hyundai Heavy Industries Group]] distributed [[gift certificates]] to thousands of their employees to purchase Chung's autobiography.&lt;ref name="사재기"/&gt; It was reported that they required employees to return the books along with receipts to the company after purchase, and added a special instruction not to purchase large volumes at once for fear of getting suspicions from public.&lt;ref name="사재기"/&gt;

On top of publishing his autobiography, Chung also donated huge sums of money and set up a charity foundation in 2011, a year before 2012 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/08/113_92888.html Is Chung gearing up for a presidential bid?, The Korea Times 2011.08.16]&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed $200 million worth of Korean won from selling approximately 5% of his assets and established the Asan Sharing Foundation, which offers educational opportunities and financial assistance to young people from low income families.

Chung didn't think of [[Park Geun-hye]] as accomplished as himself before 2012 presidential election. When he decided to compete with [[Park Geun-hye|Park]], he said he was a better choice as a presidential candidate because of his educational background and work experience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005138749 정몽준 "박근혜, 당 대표냐 특정계파 책임자냐", 연합뉴스 2011.06.29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://manmand.blog.me/40132727632 KBS라디오 열린토론 6/29(한나라당 정몽준 의원)]&lt;/ref&gt; When he pointed out Park's disadvantage, he argued that expertise of politics and economy is not something to be achieved in a short time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressian.com/article/article.asp?article_num=60110823112828 정몽준 "박근혜는 여성, 나는 씩씩한 남성", 프레시안 2011.08.23]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Park Geun-hye]] wrote an article about North Korean issue in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', Chung discredited it claiming someone else had written it under her name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/common/redirect.jsp?category_id=020601000000&amp;news_id=20110905000476 (Editorial) Park Geun-hye’s essay, The Korea Herald 2011-09-05]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was clear that he wouldn't miss 2012 presidential election. In 2012, he ran for the presidency, but only briefly. He was the first politician who submitted application for registration as a preliminary presidential candidate on May 1, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=100&amp;oid=001&amp;aid=0005599746 "정몽준 전대표 대선 예비후보 등록", 연합뉴스 2012.05.01]&lt;/ref&gt; but dropped out of the race in a couple of months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/politics/assembly/541695.html 정몽준·이재오 “불참”…새누리 경선 ‘1강4약’ 뻔한 싸움으로, 한겨레신문 2012-07-09]&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted rule change for [[primary election]] so that general population choose party's presidential candidate, but he wasn't able to make this demand sound serious to [[Grand National Party]], since [[Park Geun-hye]]'s followers dominated and controlled the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20120611001077 Ruling party launches primary committee despite protests from minor candidates, The Korea Herald 2012-06-11]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave up his candidacy and supported [[Park Geun-hye|Park]] after. When he advertised [[Park Geun-hye|Park]] at streets, he was saying to crowd that [[Park Geun-hye|Park]] was prepared, and she was the one to take good care of economy and diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=shm&amp;sid1=123&amp;oid=156&amp;aid=0000013691 박근혜 대통령 후보, 울산 롯데백화점 광장 유세 주요내용(보도자료), 새누리당 2012.12.12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?news_seq_no=1272752 (대선 D-9) 박근혜 후보, TV토론 준비…지원단 유세 활발, MBN 2012.12.10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chung is losing popular support in South Korean politics now. When he ran for assemblyman in 2008, he received 54.41% of votes in [[Dongjak District]], but for the following election in 2012, he just received 50.80% barely surviving to lose to the opposition candidate. When he ran for [[mayor of Seoul]] in 2014, he received 43.03% votes from Seoul residents, losing to then incumbent [[mayor of Seoul]] and previous civil rights activist [[Park Won-soon]], who received 55% of the total vote. It turned out that Chung's electoral district, [[Dongjak District|Dongjak]] voted only 41.80% for Chung whereas it gave 57.45% for [[Park Won-soon|Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyeongin.com/?mod=news&amp;act=articleView&amp;idxno=864663 서울시장 박원순 당선인, 22개구 승리… 정몽준 지역구 동작서도 앞서, 경인일보 06-05-2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}

A '''collateral contract''' is usually a single term [[contract]], made in [[consideration]] of the party for whose benefit the contract operates &lt;!-- i almost inserted a comma here, but i realized at the last minute that the lack of a comma may have been intentional. Ambiguity is better than than an unambiguous error.... right?  ????? --&gt; agreeing to enter into the principal or main contract, which sets out additional terms relating to the same subject matter as the main contract.&lt;ref&gt;Aherns Lawyers, [http://www.ahernslawyers.com.au/latest-news/contracts-collateral-inconsistent/ Contracts Collateral &amp; Inconsistent]&lt;/ref&gt; The collateral contract co-exists side by side.{{vague|reason= gosh, {{sarcasm|IANAL, so does that mean laying them next to each other on the table is ''not'' good enuf? I mean, do they have to be stapled at 3 points, left edge to right edge? Or is top-right-corner to top-left-corner sufficient?}} |date=March 2018}}  For example, a collateral contract is formed when one party pays the other party a certain sum for entry into another contract. A collateral contract may be between one of the parties and a third party.

It can also be epitomized as follows: a collateral contract is one that induces a person to enter into a separate "primary" contract. For example, if X agrees to buy goods from Y that will, accordingly, be manufactured by Z, and does so on the strength of Z's assurance as to the high quality of the goods, X and Z may be held to have made a collateral contract consisting of Z's promise of quality given in consideration of X's promise to enter into the main contract with Y.

== Elements of a valid collateral contract ==
A party to an existing contract may attempt to show that a collateral contract exists if their claim for a breach of contract fails because the statement they relied upon was not held to be a [[Contractual term|term]] of the main contract. It has been held that for this to be successful, the statement must have been promissory in nature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''J J Savage &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney'' (1970) 119 CLR 435.&lt;/ref&gt; Remedies may be awarded for breach of a collateral contract.

=== Promissory in nature ===
A collateral contract is one where the parties to one contract enter into or promise to enter into another contract. Thus, the two contracts are connected and it may be enforced even though it forms no constructive part of the original contract.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In ''[[JJ Savage and Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney]]'' a mere expression of opinion was held insufficient to be satisfied as a promise. In ''[[Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd]]'' a statement by a landlord made to intending tenants when negotiating a lease that they would be “looked after at renewal time”, would not bind the landlord to offer a further five year lease.&lt;ref&gt;Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd [2016] HCA 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intention to induce ===
The promisor must have expressly or impliedly requested about the main contract and his promissory statement must have intended to induce the entry of the other party into the main contract.&lt;ref&gt;JJ Savage &amp; Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney (1970) 119 CLR 435.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alfred Denning, Baron Denning|Lord Denning MR]], a collateral contract is held binding "when a person gives a promise, or an assurance to another, intending that he should act on it by entering into a contract'.&lt;ref&gt;Evans &amp; Sons Ltd v Andrea Merzario Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 1078.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consistency ===
A collateral contract, if forged between the same parties as the main contract, must not contradict the main contract. That is, if the term was agreed upon prior to the completion of the formal contract (but was still included as a term, and could not be executed until completion of the second term), the first term will still be allowed.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' (1919) 27 CLR 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially the collateral contracts cannot contradict any element of the main contract nor the rights created by it.&lt;ref&gt;''Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer'' (1919) 27 CLR 133; see also ''Jacobs v Batavia &amp; General Plantations Trust Ltd'' [1924] 1 Ch. 287.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Letter of credit ==
A theory sustains that is feasible to typify [[letter of credit]] as a collateral [[Third-party beneficiary|contract for a third-party beneficiary]] because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application of the theory of [[Jean Domat]] the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with [[legal tender]]. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an [[implied-in-fact contract]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2019474 Letter of Credit, its Relation with Stipulation for the Benefit of a Third Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exception to other legal rules ==

=== Privity of contract ===
Collateral contracts are an exception to the [[Privity of contract|privity of contract doctrine]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Shanklin Pier Ltd v Detel Products Ltd]]'' (1951) 2 KB 854.&lt;/ref&gt; which provides that a contract cannot impose obligations or confer rights on a non-contracting party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.australiancontractlaw.com/law/scope-privity.html|title=Australian Contract Law {{!}} Julie Clarke|website=www.australiancontractlaw.com|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in circumstances where a collateral contract is established between a third party and one of the contracting parties, the Court may allow rights or impose obligations on the non-contracting party, as illustrated in the earlier tortious case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parol evidence rule ===
[[Common law]] recognises collateral contract as an exception to [[parol evidence rule]], meaning that admissible evidence of a collateral contract can be used to exclude the operation of the [[parol evidence rule]]. Practically, it is rare to find collateral contract as an exception as it must be strictly proved; and the burden of proof is only eased if the subject matter with which the main contract deals is more unusual.&lt;ref&gt;Heilbut, Symons &amp; Co v Buckleton [1912] UKHL 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
In the English case of ''[[Barry v Davies]]'', it was held that an auctioneer and a buyer had formed a collateral contract.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Barry v Davies t/as Heathcote Ball &amp; Co'' [2001] 1 All ER 944; [2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; It was held that even though the main contract does not involve the auctioneer, benefits given to the auctioneer for increasing the price of a bid constitutes a good consideration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In ''[[Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer]]'', a landlord has promised orally not to exercise the right to termination in the principal contract if tenant signed the contract; landlord ended up terminating the main contract, whereas tenant's appeal was dismissed by the Court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Cut throat competition''' is a term that was widely used to describe the reason for [[consumer protection]] regulation, [[labour law]], and enforcement of [[competition law]] or antitrust, in the late 19th and early 20th century.

In economics, cut throat competition is also referred to as ruinous, excessive or unfettered competition. More generally, cut throat competition is also subsumed under the term "destructive competition".

Many countries have strict legislation against cut throat competition and [[anti-competitive practices]] in pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ruwantissa Abeyratne|title=Strategic Issues in Air Transport: Legal, Economic and Technical Aspects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BISPzlwSfBoC&amp;pg=PA366|date=5 January 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-21959-7|pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Federal Trade Commission]], the alleged necessity of a pricing agreement to avoid cut-throat competition is not considered a valid defense in the case of a proven [[price fixing]] agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/competition-guidance/guide-antitrust-laws/dealings-competitors/price-fixing|title=Price Fixing|work=Competition Guidance|publisher=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10276">'''Employability''' refers to the attributes of a person that make that person able to gain and maintain employment.

==Overview==

Employability is related to work and the ability to be employed, such as: 
*The ability to gain initial employment; hence the interest in ensuring that 'key competencies', careers advice and an understanding about the world of work are embedded in the education system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berntson|first1=Erik|title=Employability perceptions: Nature, determinants, and implications for health and well-being|date=2008|publisher=Stockholm University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ability to maintain employment and make 'transitions' between jobs and roles within the same organization to meet new job requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forrier|first1=Anneleen |last2=Sels |first2=Luc | author-link2=Luc Sels |title=The concept employability: a complex mosaic |date=2003 |journal=International Journal of Human Resources Development and Management |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=102–124 |url=http://www.ouderenenarbeid.uhasselt.be/Documenten/artikel%20IJHRDM.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1504/IJHRDM.2003.002414}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ability to obtain new employment if required, i.e. to be independent in the labour market by being willing and able to manage their own employment transitions between and within organisations (Van der Heijde and Van der Heijden (2005) The continuously fulfilling, acquiring or creating of work through the optimal use of efforts)

[[Lee Harvey (academic)|Lee Harvey]] defines employability as the ability of a graduate to get a satisfying job, stating that job acquisition should not be prioritized over preparedness for employment to avoid pseudo measure of individual employability. 
Lee argues that employability is not a set of skills but a range of experiences and attributes developed through higher-level learning, thus employability is not a "product' but a process of learning.

Employability continues to develop because the graduate, once employed, does not stop learning (i.e. continuous learning). Thus employability by this definition is about learning, not least learning how to learn, and it is about empowering learners as critical reflective citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Lee|title=On Employability|page=3|url=http://qualityresearchinternational.com/esecttools/esectpubs/harveyonemp.pdf|accessdate=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvey‘s (2001) definition is important for it emphasizes the employability of graduates, which is similar to our context, hence, able to provide insight about how to measure graduates' employability and what are the differences between graduates and experienced individuals in the labor market.

Berntson (2008) argues that employability refers to an individual's perception of his or her possibilities of getting new, equal, or better employment. Berntson's study differentiates employability into two main categories – actual employability (objective employability) and perceived employability (subjective employability).

Several employability definitions have been developed based on, or including input from business and industry. In the United States, an Employability Skills Framework was developed through a collaboration of employers, educators, human resources associations, and labour market associations. This framework states, "Employability skills are general skills that are necessary for success in the labor market at all employment levels and in all sectors". After conducting research with employers across Canada, the Conference Board of Canada released Employability Skills 2000+, which defines employability as "the skills you need to enter, stay in, and progress in the world of work". Saunders &amp; Zuzel (2010) found that employers valued personal qualities such as dependability and enthusiasm over subject knowledge and ability to negotiate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Letter on the Digital Economy|url=http://openletteronthedigitaleconomy.org|website=Open Letter on the Digital Economy|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In relation to freelance or ad hoc work==

In the future fewer will be employed and more people work as free lancers or ad hoc on projects. Robin Chase, co-founder of Zip Car, argues that in the future more work will be done as freelancers or ad hoc works. Collaborative economy and other similar platforms are reinventing capitalism, for example platforms like Freelancer.com, a new way of organizing demand and supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Robin|title=Peers Inc: How People and Platforms Are Inventing the Collaborative Economy and Reinventing Capitalism|date=9 June 2015|publisher=Publicaffairs|isbn=1610395549}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Freelancer is also an example of how employability can be developed even for people who are not employed – Freelancers offers exposure of certification and in the future similar platforms will also offer continuous upgrade of competencies for the people associated.

==Organizational issues==

Employability creates organizational issues, because future competency needs may require re-organization in many ways. The increasing automation and use of technology also makes it relevant to discuss not only change but also transformation in tasks for people. The issues are relevant at government level, at corporate level and for individuals.

==Institutions for employability==

In the past, government had institutions to handle unemployment and employment. In the future this will be extended to include employability.

===The Institute for Employability===
Singapore has created an Institute for Employability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Employment and Employability Institute|url=http://e2i.com.sg|website=E2I|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that works on competency upgrades, to reduce risk of unemployment, and increase the competitiveness of the nation and corporations and the employability of the individual.

ERT is currently available for some lysosomal storage diseases: [[Gaucher's disease|Gaucher disease]], [[Fabry disease]], [[Mucopolysaccharidosis|MPS I]], [[Hunter syndrome|MPS II (Hunter syndrome)]], [[Maroteaux–Lamy syndrome|MPS VI]] and [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT does not correct the underlying genetic defect, but it increases the concentration of the enzyme that the patient is lacking.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt; ERT has also been used to treat patients with [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID) resulting from an adenosine deaminase deficiency ([[Adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA-SCID]]).&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=17300989|year=2007|author1=Booth|first1=C|title=Management options for adenosine deaminase deficiency; proceedings of the EBMT satellite workshop (Hamburg, March 2006)|journal=Clinical Immunology|volume=123|issue=2|pages=139–47|last2=Hershfield|first2=M|last3=Notarangelo|first3=L|last4=Buckley|first4=R|last5=Hoenig|first5=M|last6=Mahlaoui|first6=N|last7=Cavazzana-Calvo|first7=M|last8=Aiuti|first8=A|last9=Gaspar|first9=H.

Other treatment options for patients with enzyme or protein deficiencies include [[substrate reduction therapy]], [[gene therapy]], and [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone-marrow derived stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;]]

== History ==

ERT was developed in 1964 by Christian de Duve and Roscoe Brady.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Neufeld|first1= E. F. |date=2006|chapter=Chapter 10: Enzyme replacement therapy – a brief history|veditors= Mehta A, Beck M, Sunder-Plassmann G|title= Fabry  Disease: Perspectives from 5 Years of FOS|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford PharmaGenesis|isbn= 978-1-903539-03-3|pmid= 21290685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading work was done on this subject at the Department of Physiology at the University of Alberta by Mark J. Poznansky and Damyanti Bhardwaj, where a model for enzyme therapy was developed using rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF02783734|pmid= 6395807|year= 1984|author1= Poznansky|first1= M. J.|title= Enzyme-albumin polymers. New approaches to the use of enzymes in medicine|journal= Applied biochemistry and biotechnology|volume= 10|pages= 41–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ERT was not used in clinical practice until 1991, after the FDA gave [[orphan drug]] approval for the treatment of Gaucher disease with [[Alglucerase]].&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  ERTs were initially manufactured by isolating the therapeutic enzyme from human placenta.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  The FDA has now approved ERTs that are derived from other human cells, animal cells (i.e. Chinese hamster ovary cells, or CHO cells), and plant cells.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Medical uses ==
[[Lysosomal storage disease]]s are fatal group of diseases and a main application of ERT.  [[Lysosome]]s are cellular organelles that are responsible for the metabolism of many different macromolecules and proteins.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=111–113|doi=10.4161/cib.20373|pmc=3376041|year=2012|author1=Weiss|first1=N|title=Cross-talk between TRPML1 channel, lipids and lysosomal storage diseases|journal=Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology|volume=5|issue=2|pmid=22808310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They use enzymes to break down macromolecules, which are recycled or disposed.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; As of 2012, there are 50 lysosomal storage diseases, and more are still being discovered.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;"Lysosomal Storage Disorders – NORD (National Organization For Rare Disorders)". ''NORD (National Organization for Rare Disorders)''. Apr. 2017, from https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/lysosomal-storage-disorders/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  These disorders arise because of genetic mutations that prevent the production of certain enzymes used in the lysosomes.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  The missing enzyme often leads to a build-up of the [[Substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] within the body.  This can result in a variety of symptoms, many of which are severe and can affect the skeleton, brain, skin, heart, and the central nervous system.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt;  Increasing the concentration of the missing enzyme within the body has been shown to improve the body's normal cellular metabolic processes and reduce substrate concentration in the body.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

ERT has also been successful in treating severe combined immunodeficiency caused by an adenosine deaminase deficiency (ADA-SCID).&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=26684479|year=2016|author1=Tartibi|first1=H. M.|title=A 24-Year Enzyme Replacement Therapy in an Adenosine-deaminase-Deficient Patient|journal=Pediatrics|volume=137|issue=1|pages=e20152169|last2=Hershfield|first2=M. S.|last3=Bahna|first3=S. L.|doi=10.1542/peds.2015-2169}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a fatal childhood disease that requires early medical intervention.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  When the enzyme adenosine deaminase is deficient in the body, the result is a toxic build-up of metabolites that impair [[lymphocyte]] development and function.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;  Many ADA deficient children with SCID have been treated with the polyethylene glycol-conjugated adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) enzyme.  This is a form of ERT that has resulted in healthier, longer lives for patients with ADA-SCID.&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;

== Administration ==
ERT is administered by IV infusion.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27384562|pmc=4964441|year=2016|author1=Coutinho|first1=M. F.|title=Less is More: Substrate Reduction Therapy for Lysosomal Storage Disorders|journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1065|last2=Santos|first2=J. I.|last3=Alves|first3=S|doi=10.3390/ijms17071065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, infusions occur every week or every two weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;  For some types of ERT, these infusions can occur as infrequently as every four weeks.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

== Complications ==
ERT is not a cure for lysosomal storage diseases, and it requires lifelong IV infusions of the therapeutic enzyme.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This procedure is expensive; in the United States, it may cost over $200,000 annually.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; The distribution of the therapeutic enzyme in the body ([[biodistribution]]) after these IV infusions is not uniform.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The enzyme in less available to certain areas in the body, like the bones, lungs, brain.  For this reason, many symptoms of lysosomal storage diseases remain untreated by ERT, especially neurological symptoms.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Additionally, the efficacy of ERT is often reduced due to an unwanted immune response against the enzyme, which prevents metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

== Other treatments for enzyme deficiencies ==
Substrate reduction therapy is another method for treating lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  In this treatment, the accumulated compounds are inhibited from forming in the body of a patient suffering from a lysosomal storage disease.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  The accumulated compounds are responsible for the symptoms of these disorders, and they form via a multi-step biological pathway.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  Substrate reduction therapy uses a small molecule to interrupt this multi-step pathway and inhibit the biosynthesis of these compounds.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  This type of treatment is taken orally.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;  It does not induce an unwanted immune response, and a single type of small molecule could be used to treat many lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt; Substrate reduction therapy is FDA approved and there is at least one treatment available on the market.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;

Gene therapy aims to replace a missing protein in the body through the use of [[Vectors in gene therapy|vectors]], usually [[viral vector]]s.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;"How does gene therapy work? - Genetics Home Reference." U.S. National Library of Medicine. April 18, 2017, from https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/primer/therapy/procedures.&lt;/ref&gt;  In gene therapy, a gene encoding for a certain protein is inserted into a vector.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt; The vector containing the therapeutic gene is then injected into the patient.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  Once inside the body the vector introduces the therapeutic gene into host cells, and the protein encoded by the newly inserted gene is then produced by the body's own cells.&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;  This type of therapy can correct for the missing protein/enzyme in patients with lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto6" /&gt;

Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is another treatment for lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt; HSCs are derived from bone-marrow.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Domen, J., Wagers, A., &amp; Weissman, I. "Bone Marrow (Hematopoietic) Stem Cells." April 19, 2017, from https://stemcells.nih.gov/info/Regenerative_Medicine/2006chapter2.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; These cells have the ability to mature into the many cell types that comprise blood, including red blood cells, platelets, and white blood cells.&lt;ref name="auto5" /&gt;  Patients suffering from enzyme deficiencies often undergo HSC transplantations in which HSCs from a healthy donor are injected.  This treatment introduces HSCs that regularly produce the deficient enzyme since they have normal metabolic function.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=26604151|year=2016|author1=Biffi|first1=A|title=Gene therapy for lysosomal storage disorders: A good start|journal=Human Molecular Genetics|volume=25|issue=R1|pages=R65–75|doi=10.1093/hmg/ddv457}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This treatment is often used to treat the central nervous system of patients with some lysosomal storage diseases.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt;

The '''Expedited Funds Availability Act''' (EFA or EFAA) was enacted in 1987 by the [[United States Congress]] for the purpose of standardizing hold periods on deposits made to [[commercial bank]]s and to regulate institutions' use of deposit holds. It is also referred to as '''Regulation CC''' or '''Reg CC''', after the [[Federal Reserve]] regulation that implements the act. The law is codified in Title 12, Chapter 41 of the [[United States Code|US Code]] and Title 12, Part 229 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]{{ref|1}}.

== Disclosure ==
Financial institutions must disclose their hold policies to all account holders, and make the policy available in written form upon request by any customer. It must also be provided at the time of opening of all new accounts.

Additional disclosures are required on deposit slips, at [[automated teller machine]]s, and when the policy is changed in any way.

== Types of hold ==
Regulation CC stipulates four types of holds that a bank may place on a [[Cheque|check deposit]] at its discretion.  Each has its own qualifications and it is legal for the bank to place any type where the requirements are met, although bank policy may instruct that the type of hold placed be the one that holds the most funds the longest that can be applied legally.

As of February 27, 2010, there is only one check processing region for the entire United States. Therefore, all checks are now local.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20091231a.htm Amendments to Appendix A of Regulation CC.] (Federal Reserve website) "... the amendments are effective February 27, 2010.  At that time, there will only be a single check-processing region for purposes of Regulation CC and there will no longer be any checks that are nonlocal."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbservices.org/communications/check_restructuring.html Federal Reserve Banks' Check Restructuring Resource Center].

'''Regarding insurance checks''', if the insurance check is drawn on an in-state bank funds will be available on the 5th business day; if the insurance check is drawn on an out-of-state bank funds will be available on the 7th business day.

There are a few exceptions to these guidelines that are important to note.  If an account owner is depositing into an account that does not qualify for the exception hold but also owns another account that does qualify, then the Exception NSF Hold can be placed.  In the same manner, if an account owner is depositing into an account that has been open for less than 30 days but owns another account that has been open greater than 30 days, the New Account Hold cannot be legally placed.

There are certain items that present less risk to financial institutions and thus are subject to expedited availability under the stipulations of Regulation CC.  The following items must have the first $5000 available for the Statutory, Large Deposit and New Account Hold by the first business day following the deposit:

*Cashier's checks, certified checks, or teller's checks&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;;
*Postal money orders;
*U.S. Treasury checks;
*Checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank;
*Any check issued by a state, city, county, or other municipality;
*Any check drawn from another account at the depository institution.

For each of these items, the item must be presented for deposit into the payee's account for it to receive expedited fund availability; when one of these checks is presented for deposit into a third party account, it loses its preferential treatment.  Also, the bank may require use of a special deposit slip or envelope for next-day availability of cashier's checks, certified checks, teller's checks, or state &amp; local government checks; if it does so, it must notify customers and tell them how to obtain the special slip or envelope.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Regulation CC defines a "cashier's check" as a check that is issued by a bank, drawn on that same bank, is a direct liability of the bank, and signed by one or more officers of that bank.  Though the term "teller's check" is commonly used only by Federal credit unions, under Regulation CC '''any''' check "drawn by the bank, and drawn on another bank or payable through or at a bank" is a "teller's check" if issued "for remittance purposes".  "Official Checks" or "Bank Checks" may not qualify as "cashier's checks" under Regulation CC, but they usually qualify for next-day availability as "teller's checks".''

== Payment of interest ==
According to the regulation, interest-bearing accounts shall receive earnings from funds from the time they are collected by the depository institution, regardless of hold lengths.

== Enforcement ==
Under the act, enforcement is divided by the type of institution, respective to each type's mandated oversight authority:
*For national banks, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks, the act is enforced by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]];
*For members of the [[Federal Reserve System]] who are not national banks, and for offices, branches, and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States (who are not federal branches and agencies of foreign banks), the provisions are enforced by the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve]];
*In the case of banks insured by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] who are not members of the Federal Reserve System, and insured state branches of foreign banks, enforcement falls to the Board of Directors of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC);
*The Director of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the act in the case of savings associations whose deposits are insured by the FDIC;
*Federal credit unions or [[credit union]]s insured by the [[National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund]] are subject to enforcement of the act by the [[National Credit Union Administration Board]].

Awards for damages are limited under the regulation, including not more than $1000 in addition to actual damages for individual actions, and not more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the net worth of the bank, in addition to actual damages, for class actions.

==Related legislation==
On June 9, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed {{USBill|113|HR|1679}} ''To amend the Expedited Funds Availability Act to clarify the application of that Act to American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.''&lt;ref name=1679actions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1679 - Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1679/actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, if it were to become law, would extend "by two business days, for [[American Samoa]], any time periods established for large or redeposited check, repeated overdraft, reasonable cause, or other emergency exceptions to the 30-day funds availability requirements for deposits in an depository institution account by a new depositor."&lt;ref name=1679sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1679 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1679|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also apply "this two-day extension to any deposit in an account at a depository institution located in American Samoa by a check drawn on an originating depository institution which is not located in the same state as the receiving depository institution."&lt;ref name="1679sum"/&gt;

'''Export hay''' is [[hay]] that is produced for export markets. In [[Australia]], hay needs to meet a number of quality standards before it can be exported. Because hay in standard round and large square bales is not dense enough to be economically exported to overseas markets, export hay is normally processed to increase the density of the product and improve its suitability for [[containerization]]. This form of processing was pioneered by [[ACX Pacific Northwest]], and is often referred to as double compression.{{fact|date=March 2015}} This process allows forage and roughage exporters to inspect and package the hay prior to shipping. 

In Australia, [[Oat]]en hay is the most common type of export hay. [[Alfalfa]] (also known as lucerne in Australia) is also grown for export hay, often under irrigation, and is the most common type of export hay in the U.S.

'''Huntingdon Life Sciences''' ('''HLS''') is a [[contract research organisation]] (CRO) founded in 1951 in Cambridgeshire, England. It has two laboratories in the United Kingdom and one in the United States. With over 1600 staff, it is now the largest non-clinical CRO in Europe.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrow.com/multimedia/archive/00068/DS239_68757a.pdf |title=AGROW'S 30 LEADING CONTRACT RESEARCH ORGANISATIONS |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, Huntingdon Life Sciences, [[Harlan (company)|Harlan Laboratories]], GFA, NDA Analytics and LSR associates merged into [[Envigo]].

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and is now in private ownership. Prior to this, the latest Annual Report (2008) showed that the company had revenues of $US242.4m and an Operating Profit of 14.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aQbXuxCXzquQ | work=Bloomberg | title=LSR Announces Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2008 Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although HLS is the third-largest non-clinical CRO in the world, it is probably better known to the general public as the target of a high-profile [[animal rights]] campaign. The campaign, in the main, has been orchestrated by the animal rights group [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC).&lt;ref name="SHAC website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net |title=SHAC website |publisher=Shac.net |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
HLS has two facilities in the UK ([[Huntingdon]], Cambridgeshire and Eye, Suffolk), one in the USA ([[East Millstone, New Jersey]]) and an office in Japan (Tokyo).

==History==
Huntingdon Life Sciences was founded in the UK in 1951 as Nutrition Research Co. Ltd., a commercial organisation that initially focused on [[nutrition]], [[veterinary]], and [[biochemical]] research. The original facilities were split over two locations; the main offices were within Cromwell House in the town of Huntingdon, Cambs, UK; and the main laboratories were at the Hartford Field Station (just over a mile away). It then became involved with [[pharmaceuticals]], [[food additives]], and industrial and consumer chemicals. In 1959 it changed its name to Nutritional Research Unit Ltd. The company benefited in the early 1960s from increased government regulatory testing requirements, especially in the pharmaceutical industry. In 1964 it was acquired by the U.S. medical supply firm of Becton Dickinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history2/92/Huntingdon-Life-Sciences-Group-plc.html |title=HLS Group |publisher=Reference for Business |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1983, [[Becton Dickinson]] created Huntingdon Research Centre PLC. It then offered four million [[American depositary receipt]]s (ADRs) for sale at $15 each, representing the company's entire interest in Huntingdon. In 1985, as it began to expand its operations, the company changed its name to Huntingdon International Holdings plc. In that year it established Huntingdon Analytical Services Inc. to conduct business in the United States.

To augment its CRO business, Huntingdon acquired Minnesota's Twin City Testing Laboratory Inc. and affiliated companies in 1985, followed by the acquisition of Nebraska Testing Corporation in 1986; Travis Laboratories and Kansas City Test Laboratory Inc. in 1989; and Southwestern Laboratories, Inc. in 1990. Huntingdon also diversified its operations, primarily in the United States, becoming involved in engineering and environmental services.

In 1987, HLS purchased Northern Engineering and Testing, Inc., and then in 1988 bought Empire Soils Investigations Inc., Chen Associates Inc., and Asteco Inc. In 1988 HLS was floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in 1989 obtained a listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. In 1990 Huntingdon acquired the St. Louis branch of Envirodyne Engineers Inc. and Whiteley Holdings Ltd. And in 1991 it acquired Austin Research Engineers, Inc., followed by Travers Morgan Ltd.

By the early 1990s, Huntingdon was organised into three business groups: the Life Sciences Group, the Engineering/Environmental Group, and the Travers Morgan Group, which offered engineering and environmental consulting services outside of the United States. However, only the Life Sciences Group showed long-term promise. Travers Morgan was allowed to lapse into insolvency, control passed into other hands, and Huntingdon wrote off the investment. In 1995 the engineering and environmental businesses were sold to Maxim Engineers Inc. of Dallas, Texas.

To bolster its CRO business and reinforce its U.S. presence, Huntingdon in 1995 acquired the toxicology business of Applied Biosciences International for $32.5 million in cash, plus the Leicester Clinical Research Centre. The deal not only included a U.S. laboratory located near [[Princeton, New Jersey]], it brought with it two British facilities as well. In 1997 Huntingdon International Holdings changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group. The U.K. subsidiary, Huntingdon Research Centre, changed its name to Huntingdon Life Sciences Ltd., while the U.S. business operated as Huntingdon Life Sciences Inc.

In 2002, HLS moved its financial centre to the [[United States]] and incorporated in [[Maryland]] as Life Sciences Research.

In 2009, HLS was bought outright and once again is in private ownership.&lt;ref&gt;BusinessWire: Life Sciences Research, Inc. Announces Consummation of Going Private Transaction [http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20091124006124/en/Life-Sciences-Research-Announces-Consummation-Private-Transaction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core industries==
HLS provides [[Contract Research Organisation]] services in pre-clinical and non-clinical biological safety evaluation research. As with other major CROs operating in this business area, its major business is serving the pharmaceutical industry. However, more than a third of its business comes from non-pharmaceutical sources, the most important of which is the [[crop protection]] industry which accounts for around 60% of their non-pharmaceutical business.&lt;ref name="Agrow Awards"/&gt;

==Staff numbers==
The latest available public figures from 2008 show that HLS employs more than 1600 staff across all of its facilities. They break down as:&lt;ref&gt;HLS Annual Report 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of animals==
HLS uses animals in the biomedical research it conducts for its customers. The most recent numbers released state that in the UK around 60,000 animals are used annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html Huntingdon Life Sciences website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227223520/http://www.huntingdon.com/ethics/animals-used-in-research.html |date=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This number is broken down by species:

==Controversy==
Huntingdon is criticised by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] groups for using animals in research, for instances of [[animal abuse]] and for the wide range of substances it tests on animals, particularly non-medical products. It is claimed by SHAC that 500 animals died every day at HLS (182,500 a year),&lt;ref name="SHAC website 2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shac.net/news/2011/august/26-27.html |title=&gt;&gt; Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty |publisher=SHAC |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a figure at odds with HLS' published numbers.

Huntingdon's labs were infiltrated by [[undercover]] animal rights [[activists]] in 1997 in the UK and in 1998 in the US.

In 1997, film secretly recorded inside HLS in the UK by [[BUAV]] and subsequently broadcast on [[Channel 4]] television as "It's a Dog's Life", showed serious breaches of animal-protection laws, including a [[beagle]] puppy being held up by the scruff of the neck and repeatedly punched in the face, and animals being taunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |title=Small World TV |publisher=Small World TV |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308224555/http://www.smallworldtv.co.uk/public/main.cfm?m1=c_75&amp;m2=c_2&amp;m3=c_54&amp;m4=e_0 |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The laboratory technicians responsible were suspended from HLS the day after the broadcast. All three were later dismissed.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/lawandorder/4276376/The-men-who-stood-up-to-animal-rights-militants.html The men who stood up to animal rights' militants], ''The Daily Telegraph'', 17 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the men seen hitting and shaking dogs were found guilty under the Animals Act of 1911 of "cruelly terrifying dogs." It was the first time laboratory technicians had been prosecuted for animal cruelty in the UK. HLS admitted that the technicians' behaviour was deplorable and a new management team was introduced the following year which, according to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', "introduced greater openness and new training methods."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

In 1998, an undercover investigator for [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) used a camera hidden in her glasses to make 50 hours of videotape of the HLS laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey. She also made four 90-minute audiotapes, photocopied 8,000 company documents, and copied the company's client list. According to PETA some of the film she shot showed a monkey being dissected while still alive and conscious. The president of HLS in New Jersey, [[Alan Staple]], said the monkey was alive but sedated during the dissection.&lt;ref name="Kolata"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/24/science/tough-tactics-in-one-battle-over-animals-in-the-lab.html|title=Tough Tactics In One Battle Over Animals In the Lab|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=24 March 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HLS obtained a "gagging order" in the US that prevents PETA from publicising or talking about any of the information that they discovered. The order also prevented PETA from communicating with the American Department of Agriculture, which had been going to investigate the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2465/is_2_31/ai_71634854/ |title=Seeing Is Believing - cruelty to dogs at Huntingdon Life Sciences, The Ecologist,March, 2001. |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests and intimidation===
The [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC) campaign is based in the UK and US, and has aimed to close the company down since 1999. According to its website, the campaign's methods are restricted to non-violent [[direct action]], as well as [[lobbying]] and demonstrations. It targets not only HLS itself, but any company, institution, or person allegedly doing business with the laboratory, whether as clients, suppliers, or even disposal and cleaning services, and the employees of those companies.

Despite its stated non-violent position, SHAC members have been convicted of crimes of violence against HLS employees. On 25 October 2010 five SHAC members received prison sentences for threatening HLS staff. SHAC has also been accused of encouraging [[arson]] and violent assault. An HLS director was assaulted in front of his child.&lt;ref name=Piercy125&gt;Piercy, Nigel. ''Market-Led Strategic Change: A Guide to Transforming the Process of Going to Market''. Butterworth-Heinemann 2002, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; HLS managing director [[Brian Cass]] was sent a mousetrap primed with razor blades,&lt;ref name=Piercy125/&gt; and in February 2001 was attacked by three men armed with pickaxe handles and CS gas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1494924.stm Jail for lab boss attacker], BBC News, 16 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Another businessman with links to HLS was attacked and knocked unconscious adjacent to a barn his assailants had set alight.&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt;

Both SHAC and [[Animal Liberation Front]] activists have engaged in [[harassment]] and [[intimidation]], including issuing hoax bomb threats and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.scotsman.com/opinion.cfm?id=288432003 Counting the cost of fear], Scotland on Sunday, 9 March 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Daily Mail'' cites as an example the sending of 500 letters to the neighbours of a company manager who did business with HLS; the letter contained an unsupported allegation that the man was a paedophile, with police having to inform all 500 households that the allegations were false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html "The Animals of Hatred"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629082805/http://lists.envirolink.org/pipermail/ar-news/Week-of-Mon-20031013/008215.html |date=29 June 2006 }}, ''Daily Mail'', 15 October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 seven of SHAC's senior members were described by prosecutors as "some of the key figures in the Animal Liberation Front" and found guilty of conspiracy to blackmail HLS.&lt;ref name="TimesYeoman"&gt;Fran Yeoman [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/crime/article5391798.ece "Extremists face long jail sentences after blackmail conviction"], ''The Times'', 24 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect of campaign===
The campaign against HLS led to its share price crashing, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] closing its bank account, and the British government arranging for the [[Bank of England]] to give them an account.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 2000, HLS was dropped from the [[New York Stock Exchange]] because of its [[market capitalization]] had fallen below NYSE limits.&lt;ref name=Potter&gt;Potter, Will. [http://www.counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html "Green is the New Red"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408094959/http://counterpunch.org/potter05042006.html |date=8 April 2007 }}, ''Counterpunch'', 4 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government response===
{{Expand section|reason= The government of the day responded to the 1997 investigative work, and additional responses were made before 2006|date=August 2012}}
From 2006, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reports, the British Government took the decision to tackle "the problem of animal rights extremism."&lt;ref name="CassTelegraph"/&gt; On 1 May 2007, a police campaign called ''Operation Achilles'' was enacted against SHAC, a series of raids involving 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,517875-2,00.html "Britain's other war on terror"], Spiegel online, 19 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 32 people linked to the group were arrested,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 "Animal rights extremism – police arrest 32 people"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927074535/http://www.netcu.org.uk/media/article.jsp?id=249 |date=27 September 2007 }}, National Extremism Tactical Coordination Unit press release, 1 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and seven leading members of SHAC, including [[Greg Avery]], were found guilty of blackmail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/92cf1796-93d2-11dd-b277-0000779fd18c.html "Activists in live testing trial deny blackmail"], ''[[Financial Times]]'' 6 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Police estimated in 2007 that, as a consequence of the operation, "up to three quarters of the most violent activists" were jailed. ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' writes that the number of attacks on HLS and their business declined drastically but "the movement is by no means dead."&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt;

'''Maksim Kurmanbekovich Bakiyev''' ({{lang-ru|Максим Курманбекович Бакиев}}; born 27 October 1977, [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], [[RSFSR]]), is the youngest son of former president of [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]], from his marriage to Russian-born [[Tatyana Bakiyeva|Tatyana Petrova]]. He is a resident of the UK having been granted political asylum.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Maksim Bakiyev has a legal background, having graduated from the joint [[Kyrgyz-Russian Slavic University]]. As a student, Maksim worked in a consulting firm, specialized in investment into emerging markets in Central Asia and the Middle East. In March 2010 Maksim was widely believed to be the richest man in Kyrgyzstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-15/maksim-bakiyev-most-wanted.html Maksim Bakiyev – most wanted in Kyrgyzstan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617024712/http://rt.com/Politics/2010-06-15/maksim-bakiyev-most-wanted.html |date=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Maksim was appointed the head of the Central Agency for Development in October 2009. Since the 2010 overthrow he has been charged with embezzlement and abuse of power by the interim government of Kyrgyzstan. It is suspected that he transferred about $35 million of a $300 million loan from Russia into his private bank accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100416/158613170.html |title=Bakiyev's son suspected of Russian loan embezzlement |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2010-04-16 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosecutors also alleged that his companies owed almost $80 million in taxes on aviation fuel sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100615/ap_on_re_as/as_kyrgyzstan UN says violence in Kyrgyzstan was orchestrated] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617212043/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100615/ap_on_re_as/as_kyrgyzstan |date=June 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A civil fraud claim regarding this was brought in the UK High Court and was withdrawn by two Kygrz Republic agencies in October 2016, and he has no charges for fraud against him.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/kyrgyz-withdraws-20-million-fraud-claim-against-bakiev&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2010 Kyrgyzstan uprising|2010 uprising]] in Kyrgyzstan, Maxim Bakiyev was headed to the US for a series of meetings in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothkopf |first=David |url=http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2010/04/19/where_in_the_world_is_maksim_bakiyev |title=Where in the world is Maksim Bakiyev? |publisher=Blog.foreignpolicy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he never showed up. In May [[Interpol]] posted Maxim Bakiyev as wanted on its website. In 2016, following the successful dismissal of all fraud and criminal charges against Maxim Bakiev, Interpol withdrew its red notice against Mr Bakiev.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and asylum==
On June 13, 2010, Maksim was arrested in the UK when he landed at [[Farnborough Airport]] in Hampshire in a privately hired jet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/met-arrests-son-of-ousted-kyrgyz-leader-8210436.html&lt;/ref&gt; He sought asylum there but the interim government demanded his extradition at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/bakiev-secures-interpol-victory&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Kyrgyz official warned that the interim government would consider shutting down the U.S. [[Transit Center at Manas|Manas airbase]] if Britain refuses to hand him over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Miriam Elder in Moscow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jun/17/kyrgyzstan-us-airbase-warning |title=Kyrgyzstan threatens to shut US base unless ex-president's son is extradited |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was later denounced by president of Kyrgyzstan, [[Roza Otunbayeva]].

On October 12, 2012, Bakiyev was arrested in London by UK extradition officers on the request of U.S. authorities, who want to question him for alleged involvement in fraud. In a statement, the Kyrgyz presidency declared: "''Because of the absence of an extradition agreement between the Kyrgyz Republic and Great Britain, the British side is now considering the issue of extraditing Maxim Bakiyev to the United States.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex Kyrgyz President's Son Arrested in London|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/ex-kyrgyz-presidents-son-arrested-in-london/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=13 October 2012|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2013, a Kyrgyz court sentenced Bakiyev in absentia to 25 years in prison for corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Former Kyrgyz President's Son Sentenced in Absentia to 25 years Jail|url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/former-kyrgyz-presidents-son-sentenced-in-absentia-to-25-years-jail/|newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia|date=28 March 2013|publisher=Satrapia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, a US criminal securities fraud case against him was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-09/u-s-case-ends against-ex-kygryz-leader-bakiyev-s-son&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 a personal injury claim against Maxim Bakiev was brought by British businessman Mr Sean Daley, alleging that his shooting and attempted murder in Bishkek had been organized and arranged by Mr Bakiev, was dismissed at the High Court of Justice in London as not "credible", "unsatisfactory" and "wholly implausible". Evidence submitted was stated by Mr Justice Supperstone to give "rise to real concern that it was made in collaboration with Mr Ismailov (the Kyrgyz prosecutor)for the purpose of ensuring the conviction of Mr Bakiev.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hickmanandrose.co.uk/site/about/press-releases/details/high-court-dismisses-personal-injury-claim-against-maksim&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 South Kyrgyzstan unrest==
In May 2010, an audio recording&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KB8GAnNM78&amp;feature=channel |title=Phone conversation between Maksim and Janybek Bakiyev |publisher=Youtube |date=2012-01-29 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; was posted anonymously on YouTube with a caption identifying the voices as those of Maxim and his uncle [[Janish Bakiyev]]. The men were discussing plans to arm groups to spread chaos across the south of Kyrgyzstan, sometime in June. Both men have denied the authenticity of the tape and Bakiyev has repeatedly said he has no involvement in the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/06/20106164631604263.html |title=Kyrgyz violence level 'alarming' |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence to incriminate the Bakievs in the June events.&lt;ref&gt;https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_490.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyrgyz deputy Prime Minister [[Almazbek Atambayev]], claims that the [[2010 South Kyrgyzstan riots|2010 inter-ethnic riots in south Kyrgyzstan]] were paid for with $10 million from Bakiyev's pocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20100615/159430286.html |title=Kyrgyzstan to seek extradition of ex-president's son over riots |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical logistics functions comprise an important part of the health care system: after staff costs, medical supplies are the single most expensive component of health care. To drive costs out of the health-care sector, medical logistics providers are adopting supply chain management theories.

This organizational chart is as follows and separated into three key areas. 

# [[Medical Materiel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpub.com/content/armymedical/MD0029/MD00290018.htm|title=Materiel Branch|date=2010|publisher=U.S. ARMY MEDICAL DEPARTMENT CENTER AND SCHOOL|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Biomedical Engineering ([[BMET]]) or [[Clinical Engineering]]
# Facilities Management. 

These areas are managed by a qualified Director of Logistics. The Director of Logistcs educational background holds some type of accredited graduate degree ([[MBA]] or [[Master of Science|M.S.]])

==History==
From 1999 to 2007, enterprise and energy were the responsibility of the '''Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning'''. The [[Second McConnell government]] from 2003 to 2007 instituted Tourism as a portfolio, combined with Culture and Sport, as the '''Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport'''. The [[Government of the 3rd Scottish Parliament|Salmond government]], elected following the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007]] created the junior post of '''Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism''' by combining the roles.  In November 2014 his post became the '''Minister for Business, Energy and Tourism''', as part of the [[first Sturgeon government]]. The post was retitled as '''Minister for Business, Innovation and Energy''' as part of the [[second Sturgeon government]], and renamed again in June 2018 to Business, Fair Work and Skills.&lt;ref name="june2018"/&gt;

'''NASCAR Mexico''' is a joint-venture between [[NASCAR]] and [[Grupo CIE|OCESA]], a Mexican entertainment company, aiming to develop, manage and operate local motorsports events and oversee television distribution, sponsorship and licensing.

The venture attempts to create marketing programs to increase interest in local NASCAR events as well as NASCAR events in the [[United States]] that are televised in [[Mexico]].

NASCAR Mexico had been responsible for the organization of the [[Corona México 200]], a former [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|NASCAR Nationwide Series]] race at the [[Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez]] in [[Mexico City]].

It also organizes and sanctions two racing series, the [[NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series]] and the [[NASCAR Mexico T4 Series]].

The series experienced its first fatality on June 14, 2009 when [[Carlos Pardo]] was killed in an accident on the final lap. Pardo was declared the winner of the same race he was killed in after he led the final completed lap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NASCAR Mexico driver killed in crash|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/news/story?id=4259654&amp;campaign=rss&amp;source=RPMHeadlines|date=2009-06-15|accessdate=2009-06-15|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Secretary of Labor CNBC Interview (9578604382).jpg|thumb|left|Maria Bartiromo interviewing Labor Secretary [[Tom Perez]] in 2013]]
''The Wall Street Journal Report'' was premiered on September 4, 1970. [[Maria Bartiromo]] joined the program in September 2004, replacing [[Consuelo Mack]] as its host.&lt;ref name="variety1" /&gt; The program features interviews, discussions, weekly job reports, stock market updates, and stories about the economy. The program was renamed ''On the Money with Maria Bartiromo'' from the January 6, 2013 broadcast with the end of CNBC's content agreement with the ''Wall Street Journal'' owner [[Dow Jones &amp; Company]], which was purchased by [[News Corporation]] (owners of CNBC's competitor [[Fox Business Network]]) in 2007; ''[[On the Money (2005 TV series)|On the Money]]'' had previously been the title of a daily program on CNBC from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Alex|last=Weprin|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/wall-street-journal-report-getting-new-name-as-end-of-cnbcwsj-deal-nears_b158934|title=‘Wall Street Journal Report’ Getting New Name, As End of CNBC/WSJ Deal Nears"|work=[[Adweek]]|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartiromo left CNBC on November 22, 2013, moving to [[Fox Business Network]] and making that weekend's ''On the Money'' her last. The program was subsequently re-titled ''On the Money'' and since then has been hosted by CNBC's [[Becky Quick]], who also appears on ''[[Squawk Box]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2002">'''Operational continuity''' refers to the ability of a system to continue working despite damages, losses or critical events. In the Human Resources and Organizational domain, including IT, it implies the need to determine the level of [[Resilience_(organizational)|resilience]] of the system, its ability to recover after an event, and build a system that resists to external and internal events or is able to recover after an event without losing its external [[performance management]] capability. Organizational Continuity is achieved only with specific corporate planning.&lt;ref&gt;Argenti, John (1974). Systematic Corporate Planning. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; In the material domain, it determines the need to adopt redundant systems, performance monitoring systems, and can even imply the practice to cannibalize or to remove serviceable assemblies, sub-assemblies or components from a repairable or serviceable item of equipment in order to install them on another, in order to keep the external system performance active.&lt;ref&gt;North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Nato Standardization Agency AAP-6 - Glossary of terms and definitions, p 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
Operational continuity may be referred to single systems, single individuals, up to teams or entire complex systems such as IT infrastructures, implying the ability of an organization or system to continue to provide its mission.

'''Paul M. Leonardi''' is the Duca Family Professor of Technology Management at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmp.ucsb.edu/files/leonardi/CV.Leonardi.pdf|title=Curriculum Vitae: Paul M. Leonardi|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=2015-05-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518080834/http://www.tmp.ucsb.edu/files/leonardi/CV.Leonardi.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the Investment Group of Santa Barbara Founding Director of the Master of Technology Management Program. Leonardi moved to UCSB to found the [[Technology Management Program]] and start its [[Master of Technology Management]] and Ph.D. programs. Before joining UCSB, Leonardi was a faculty member in the School of Communication, the McCormick School of Engineering, and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

Leonardi’s research focuses on how companies can design their organizational networks and implement new technologies to more effectively create and share knowledge. He is particularly interested in how data intensive technologies, such as simulation and social media tools, enable new ways to access, store, and share information; how the new sources of information these technologies provide can change work routines and communication partners; and how shifts in employees’ work and communication alter the nature of an organization's expertise. His work on these topics cuts across the fields of [[Organization Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], and [[Information Systems]] and has been published in leading journals in these fields, such as ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Review]]'', ''[[Journal of Communication]]'', ''[[Human Communication Research]]'', ''[[Information Systems Research]]'',  ''[[MIS Quarterly]]'', and ''[[Organization Science (journal)|Organization Science]].'' He is also the author of three books ''[[Car Crashes Without Cars: Lessons About Simulation Technology and Organizational Change from Automotive Design]]'' (2012, MIT Press), ''[[Materiality and Organizing: Social Interaction in a Technological World]]''(2012, Oxford University Press), and ''[[Technology Choices: Why Occupations Differ in Their Embrace of New Technologies]]'' (2015, MIT Press).

He has won awards for his research from the [[Academy of Management]],&lt;ref name="Gerardine DeSanctis Award"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ocis.aomonline.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=438&amp;Itemid=1|title=Gerardine DeSanctis Award :|publisher=Academy of Management |accessdate=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William H.

Over the past decade, he has consulted with for-profit and non-profit organizations about how to manage the human aspects of new technology implementation. His recent engagements have focused on helping companies to improve communication between departments, to use social technologies to enhance internal knowledge sharing, and to strengthen global product development operations.

'''Priority Matrix''' is a [[time management]] software application that is supported on a number of platforms, including [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and [[iOS]]. It is based on the [[Eisenhower method|Eisenhower Method]] of arranging tasks by urgency and importance in a 2x2 [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]. Priority Matrix offers a [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based synchronization of data, allowing for data management across multiple devices. The application is also loosely based on [[David Allen (author)|David Allen]]'s [[Getting Things Done]] methodology of improving productivity.

==Features==
* '''Quadrants-based task prioritization'''- The 2x2 time management matrix, based on the Eisenhower Method of time management, is the general framework on which Priority Matrix is run. The quadrants organize tasks based on importance and urgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time Management for Sales People|url=http://salestrong.co.uk/time-management-for-sales-people/|publisher=www.salestrong.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Priority Matrix, the four quadrants' default labels are: Critical and Immediate, Critical but not Immediate, Not Critical but Immediate, and Uncategorized.
* '''Task [[drag and drop]]'''- Tasks and projects are capable of being dragged from one location to another, allowing users to change a task's priority level without having to create a new item altogether.
* '''Project import/export'''- Entire projects can be exported into the program's native file format, .pmatrix, for transferring a workspace quickly.
* '''Cloud-based synchronization across platforms'''- Despite running on several different platforms, Priority Matrix is able to sync project and task data over the cloud, with data being stored on Priority Matrix's [[Server (computing)|server]]s.
* '''Progress and date tracking'''- Dates and deadlines can be made for each task, providing notifications and allowing users to track their progress over time.
* '''Project summary emails and reporting'''- Emails can be created out of entire projects, for quick reporting and sending a summary of projects.
* '''Color and label customization'''- Each quadrant's background can be changed to any color in the [[RGB]] [[spectrum]]. For further customization, every task has icons that can be selected to represent a specific task.
* '''Template system'''- New projects can be created from sample templates, to avoid repetitive data input. Various templates are available &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Priority Matrix templates|url=https://sync.appfluence.com/templates/Innovation-Management-Matrix/|publisher=appfluence.com|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for different thought processes.

==Reception==
Across the various platforms, Priority Matrix has over 90,000 paid customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appfluence.com/ |title=Appfluence - Plan differently. - The best desktop to do list app for Windows, Mac, iPhone and iPad |publisher=Appfluence |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ranked among the 10 highest downloaded [[productivity]] [[Mobile app|apps]] in the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appfluence.com/productivity/priority-matrix-top-10-free-productivity-iphone-app/ |title=productivity 151: striving for continuous improvement - a blog by appfluence |publisher=Appfluence |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PC Magazine]] has ranked the [[iPad]] version of Priority Matrix among its 100 Best iPad Apps in 2011, 2012, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcmag.com/slideshow_viewer/0,3253,l%253D250054%2526a%253D250058%2526po%253D24,00.asp?p=n |title=The 100 Best iPad Apps - Priority Matrix - Slideshow from PCMag.com |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the product has garnered a 4 out of 5-star rating or better on the Apple App Store on both the [[iPhone]] and iPad platforms, with over 1,300 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/priority-matrix/id364906005?mt=8 |title= Priority Matrix for iPad |publisher=Apple Inc. |accessdate=July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version was added to the [[Google Play|Play Store]] September 2013. As of 2014, this version had an average rating of 3.9, with 1,000-5,000 installs.{{cn|date=January 2016}}

A '''quasi-foreign corporation''' (also known as a '''pseudo-foreign corporation''') is a [[corporation]] incorporated in a [[jurisdiction]] with which it has minimal business contacts. Corporations may incorporate in foreign jurisdictions in order to minimize liability, taxes, or regulatory interference.

[[Offshore corporation]]s are a common example, as are [[Delaware corporation]]s and [[Nevada corporation]]s in the [[United States]].

==Legal regimes==
Generally, the [[internal affairs doctrine]] provides that a corporation's internal affairs are governed by the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated. However, many jurisdictions apply local law to foreign corporations in certain determinations such as [[piercing the corporate veil]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nvinc.com/ApplicationOfForumLaw.htm The Application of Forum Law to "Pseudo-Foreign" Corporations] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061028025437/http://www.nvinc.com/ApplicationOfForumLaw.htm |date=October 28, 2006 }}, Nevada Corporate Planners.&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions have gone further in attempting to control the activities of quasi-foreign corporations.

===California===
[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2100-2117.1 Section 2115] of the [[California]] Corporations Code applies many aspects of California corporate law to foreign corporations operating in California under Californian ownership, including many provisions dealing with director liability and shareholder authority. While these rules may apply in suits brought against foreign corporations in California courts, Delaware courts refuse to apply Section 2115 in suits against Delaware corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Ribstein, [http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2005/05/big_surprise_de.html Big surprise: Delaware applies the internal affairs rule] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326203321/http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2005/05/big_surprise_de.html |date=March 26, 2006 }}, Ideoblog, May 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The [[Japan]]ese corporate statute of 2006 provides that "no foreign company having its main office in Japan or the primary purpose of which is to carry on business in Japan may engage in transactions on a continuous basis in Japan" and that "any person who has engaged in transactions in violation of the provision of the preceding paragraph shall be [[joint and several liability|jointly and severally liable]] with the foreign company to any counterparty for such transactions."&lt;ref name=morgan&gt;Robert Alan Feldman, [http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20050630-thu.html Japan: Article 821: Finest Hour of Cooperation], Morgan Stanley Global Economic Forum, June 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the statute was passed, many [[bank]]s and other multinational corporations operated in Japan as foreign entities in order to avoid Japanese regulations requiring banking and securities businesses to be separated by [[Chinese wall]]s. These companies, along with international chambers of commerce and other organizations, extensively lobbied the Japanese government to change the language of the draft bill.&lt;ref&gt;David Ibison, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/e6e8139c-e128-11d9-a3fb-00000e2511c8.html Businesses wake too late to Japan law's implications], ''Financial Times'', June 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solution was for the House of Councillors, the upper house of the [[Diet of Japan]], to add a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the bill calling for "all efforts... to ensure that existing foreign companies in Japan and future investments that may be made by foreign companies into Japan will not be adversely impacted."&lt;ref name=morgan /&gt;

'''Ramón Areces Rodríguez''' (1904 in [[La Mata (Grado)]], [[Asturias]], [[Spain]] &amp;ndash; 1989 in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).

At fifteen, Areces emigrated to [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. There he learned the basics of the business working at EL ENCANTO Department Store. He later traveled through the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], before returning to Spain.  When he returned to Madrid in 1935, he opened up a small tailor shop on the ''calle Preciados''. Areces used the techniques he learned on his trip, and his business grew, quite unexpectedly. In July 1940 he opened the first [[El Corte Inglés]] [[department store]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].

[[File:Smartvillagelandscape.JPG|thumb|A view of the Smart Village in 6th of October]]
'''Smart Village''' ({{Lang-ar|القرية الذكية}}) is a high-technology business district in the city of [[6th of October (city)|6th of October]], [[Egypt]], established by Presidential Decree no.355 in 2000, with activities starting in 2001. It is located on the [[Cairo–Alexandria desert road | Cairo-Alexandria Desert Road]], slightly west of [[Cairo]].&lt;ref name="Smart Village East"&gt;{{cite news |title=Abu Dhabi JV plans to build smart city in Cairo |url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_317268.html |accessdate=17 October 2018 |work=Trade Arabia |date=27 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128140950/http://www.tradearabia.com/news/CONS_317268.html |archive-date=2016-11-28 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smart Village occupies an area of 450 [[feddan|feddans]]. It's a business district with office buildings, retail shops, entertainment, factories and green spaces.&lt;ref name="Real_Estate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smartvillageegypt.com/ |website=Smart Village Egypt |title=Real Estate |accessdate=17 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823142606/https://smartvillageegypt.com/ |archive-date=2018-08-23 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Hosni Mubarak]] signed the decree and provided the land for the building of Smart Village, in order for Egypt to build its IT economy and IT industry. Mubarak worked to get Microsoft, IBM and Cisco on-board. The 2001 decree gave companies in the Smart Village a ten-year tax break. The plan was to create several ''smart villages'' in Egypt.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Staff writer |title=Work Like an Egyptian |url=https://www.wired.com/2000/11/work-like-an-egyptian/ |magazine= Wired|location=Science |date=14 November 2000 |access-date= 17 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Insider''''' is a 1999 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Michael Mann]], from a script adapted by [[Eric Roth]] and Mann from [[Marie Brenner]]'s ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article "The Man Who Knew Too Much". The film stars [[Al Pacino]] and [[Russell Crowe]], with supporting actors including [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Bruce McGill]], [[Diane Venora]] and [[Michael Gambon]].

A fictionalized account of a true story, it is based on the ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment about [[Jeffrey Wigand]], a whistleblower in the [[big tobacco|tobacco industry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=1999|title=The Insider |medium=Motion picture|publisher=Touchstone Pictures|time=2:33:32|quote=Although based on a true story, certain elements in this motion picture have been fictionalized for dramatic effect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering the personal struggles of him and CBS producer [[Lowell Bergman]] as they defend his testimony against efforts to discredit and suppress it by CBS and Wigand's former employer.

Though not a box office success, ''The Insider'' received overwhelmingly positive reviews, with particular praise for Crowe's portrayal of Wigand, and Mann's direction. It was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor in a Leading Role]] (for Russell Crowe).

==Plot==
A prologue establishes the journalistic bona fides of Bergman and [[Mike Wallace]] as they prepare to interview [[Sheikh Fadlallah]] for ''[[60 Minutes]].''

Bergman approaches Wigand—a former executive at the [[Brown &amp; Williamson]] tobacco company—for help translating technical documents. Wigand agrees, but intrigues Bergman when he refuses to discuss anything else, citing a confidentiality agreement. B&amp;W later coerce Wigand into a more restrictive agreement, leading Wigand to accuse Bergman of betraying him. Bergman subsequently visits Wigand to defend himself and investigate the potential story. Wigand, though apparently possessing very damaging information, is hesitant to jeopardize his severance package with B&amp;W by revealing anything.

The Wigand family move into a more modest house, Wigand now working as a teacher. One night Wigand finds evidence of trespass, and receives a sinister phone call.

Bergman contacts [[Richard Scruggs]], an attorney representing [[Mississippi]] in a lawsuit against the tobacco industry, suggesting that if they [[Deposition (law)|deposed]] Wigand, it could negate his confidentiality agreement and give CBS cover to broadcast the information. Scruggs expresses interest.

Some time later Wigand receives an emailed death threat, and finds a bullet in his mailbox. He contacts the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but the agents who attend are hostile and confiscate his computer. A furious Wigand demands that Bergman arrange an interview. In the interview, Wigand states that he was fired after he objected to B&amp;W intentionally making their cigarettes more addictive.

Bergman later arranges a security detail for Wigand's home, and the Wigands suffer marital stress. Wigand testifies in Mississippi, over the objections of B&amp;W attorneys, despite having been served with a [[gag order]]. On returning home, he discovers that his wife Liane ([[Diane Venora]]) has left him and taken their daughters.

Eric Kluster, the president of CBS News, decides not to broadcast Wigand's interview, after CBS legal counsel Helen Caperelli warns that CBS is at risk of legal action from B&amp;W. Bergman confronts Kluster, believing that he is protecting the impending sale of CBS to [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]], which would enrich both Kluster and Caperelli. Wallace, and their executive producer [[Don Hewitt]], both side with Kluster. Wigand is appalled, and terminates contact with Bergman.

Investigators probe Wigand's personal history and publish their findings in a 500-page dossier. Bergman learns that ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' intends to use it in a piece questioning Wigand's credibility. He convinces the editor of the ''Journal'' to delay while [[Jack Palladino]], an attorney and investigator, evaluates it.

After infighting at CBS over the segment, Bergman is ordered to take a "vacation", as the abridged ''60 Minutes'' segment airs. Bergman contacts Wigand, who is both dejected and furious, accusing Bergman of manipulating him. Bergman defends himself and praises Wigand and his testimony. Scruggs urges Bergman to air the full segment to draw public support for their lawsuit, itself under threat by a lawsuit from the Governor of Mississippi. Bergman is unable to assist, and privately questions his own motives in pursuing the story.

Bergman contacts an editor at ''[[The New York Times]]'', disclosing the full story and events at CBS. The ''Times'' prints the story on the front page, and condemns CBS in a scathing editorial. The ''Journal'' dismisses the dossier as [[character assassination]] and prints Wigand's deposition. Hewitt accuses Bergman of betraying CBS, but finds that Wallace now agrees that bowing to corporate pressure was a mistake. ''60 Minutes'' finally airs the original segment, including the full interview with Wigand.

Bergman tells Wallace that he has resigned, believing ''60 Minutes''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; credibility and integrity is now permanently tarnished.

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2016}}
With a budget set at $68 million,&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Insider-The#tab=summary| title=The Insider (1999): Metrics| publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC| access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mann began collecting a massive amount of documents to research the events depicted in the film: depositions, news reports and ''60 Minutes'' transcripts. He had read a screenplay that [[Eric Roth]] had written, called ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]'', about the first 25 years of the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Based on this script, Mann approached Roth to help him co-write ''The Insider''. Mann and Roth wrote several outlines together and talked about the structure of the story. Roth interviewed Bergman numerous times for research and the two men became friends. After he and Mann wrote the first draft together, at the bar at the Broadway Deli in [[Santa Monica]], Roth met Wigand. The whistle blower was still under his confidentiality agreement and would not break it for Roth or Mann. Roth's initial impressions of Wigand were that he came across as unlikable and defensive. As they continued to write more drafts, the two men made minor adjustments in chronology and invented some extraneous dialogue but also stuck strictly to the facts whenever possible. However, Mann and Roth were not interested in making a documentary.

[[Val Kilmer]] was considered by Mann for the role of Jeffrey Wigand. Producer Pieter Jan Brugge suggested Russell Crowe and after seeing him in ''[[L.A. Confidential (film)|L.A. Confidential]]'', Mann flew Crowe down from Canada where he was on location filming ''[[Mystery, Alaska]]'' on the actor's one day off and had him read scenes from ''The Insider'' screenplay for two to three hours. When Crowe read the scene where Wigand finds out that the ''60 Minutes'' interview he did will not be aired, he captured the essence of Wigand so well that Mann knew he had found the perfect actor for the role. Crowe, who was only 33 years old at the time, was apprehensive at playing someone much older than himself when there were so many good actors in that age range. Once Crowe was cast, he and Mann spent six weeks together before shooting began, talking about his character and his props, clothes and accessories. Crowe put on {{convert|35|lb|kg}} for the role, shaved back his hairline, bleached his hair seven times and had a daily application of wrinkles and liver spots to his skin to transform himself into Wigand (who was in his early-to-mid-50s during the events depicted in the film). Crowe was not able to talk to Wigand about his experiences because he was still bound by his confidentiality agreement during much of the film's development period. To get a handle on the man's voice and how he talked, Crowe listened repeatedly to a six-hour tape of Wigand.

Al Pacino was Mann's only choice to play Lowell Bergman. He wanted to see the actor play a role that he had never seen him do in a movie before. Pacino, who had worked with Mann previously in ''Heat'', was more than willing to take on the role. To research for the film, Mann and Pacino hung out with reporters from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, spent time with [[ABC News]] and Pacino actually met Bergman to help get in character.

Pacino suggested Mann cast Christopher Plummer in the role of [[Mike Wallace]]. Pacino had seen the veteran actor on the stage many times and was a big fan of Plummer's work. Mann had also wanted to work with Plummer since the 1970s. Pacino told Mann to watch Plummer in [[Sidney Lumet]]'s ''Stage Struck'' (1958), and afterwards he was the director's only choice to play Wallace—Plummer did not have to audition. He met with Mann and after several discussions was cast in the film.

For the scene in which the deposition hearing takes place, the filmmakers used the actual courtroom in [[Pascagoula, Mississippi]] where the deposition was given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jeffreywigand.com/theinsider.php|title=Jeffrey Wigand : The Insider|last=|first=|date=|website=www.jeffreywigand.com|publisher=|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
{{see also|Brown &amp; Williamson#Controversy}}
''The Insider'' was adapted from "The Man Who Knew Too Much", an influential article on [[tobacco industry]] [[whistleblower]] [[Jeffrey Wigand]], written by journalist [[Marie Brenner]] for the May 1996 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brenner|first=Marie|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much| url=http://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/archive/1996/05/wigand199605|newspaper=Vanity Fair|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace said that two-thirds of the film was quite accurate, but he disagreed with the film's portrayal of his role in the events; in particular, he objected to the impression that he would have taken a long time to protest CBS's corporate policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/wal2int-5 | title=Mike Wallace | date=May 24, 2008 | publisher=American Academy of Achievement | access-date=June 18, 2016 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070133/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/wal2int-5 | archivedate=June 2, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

===Box office===
''The Insider'' was released in 1,809 theaters on November 5, 1999 where it grossed a total of $6,712,361 on its opening weekend and ranked fourth in the country for that time period. It went on to make $29.1 million in North America and $31.2 million in the rest of the world for a total of $60.3 million worldwide, significantly lower than its $90 million budget.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite news|title=''The Insider''|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=insider.htm|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was considered to be a commercial disappointment. [[The Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] executives had hoped that Mann's film would have the same commercial and critical success as ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]'', a film in the same vein. However, ''The Insider'' had limited appeal to younger moviegoers (studio executives reportedly said the prime audience was over the age of 40) and the subject matter was "not notably dramatic," according to marketing executives. Then-Disney chairman [[Joe Roth]] said, "It's like walking up a hill with a refrigerator on your back. The fact of the matter is we're really proud we did this movie. People say it's the best movie they've seen this year. They say, 'Why don't we make more movies like this?'"&lt;ref name="weinraub"&gt;{{cite news|last = Weinraub|first=Bernard|title=At the Movies|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 3, 1999|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/03/movies/at-the-movies.html?scp=20&amp;sq=%22Michael+Mann%22&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the film received seven [[Academy Awards]] nominations, [[Joe Roth]] said,  "Everyone is really proud of the movie. But it's one of those rare times when adults loved a movie, yet they couldn't convince their friends to go see it, any more than we could convince people in marketing the film." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/feb/16/entertainment/ca-64714/2 | title=The Wind Shifts and So Does the Hunt | author=Patrick Goldstein | date=February 16, 2000 | publisher=Los Angeles Times | access-date=June 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Despite the disappointing box office reception, ''The Insider'' received near-unanimous critical praise, garnering some of the best reviews of 1999 and of Michael Mann's career. It holds a 96% "fresh" rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, " Intelligent, compelling, and packed with strong performances, ''The Insider'' is a potent corporate thriller."&lt;ref name="rottom"&gt;{{cite news|title = The Insider (1999)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insider/|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also holds a metascore of  84 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]], based on 34 critical reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref name="meta"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Insider Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-insider|accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three and a half out of four stars and praised "its power to absorb, entertain, and anger".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert| first=Roger|title=''The Insider''|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 5, 1999|url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19991105/REVIEWS/911050302/1023|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine's [[David Ansen]] wrote, "Mann could probably make a movie about needlepoint riveting. Employing a big canvas, a huge cast of superb character actors and his always exquisite eye for composition, he's made the kind of current-events epic that Hollywood has largely abandoned to TV—and shows us how movies can do it better".&lt;ref name="ansen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansen|first=David|title= Smoke Gets In Your Eyes|work=Newsweek| date = November 8, 1999 | url = http://www.newsweek.com/id/90142| accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] praised Russell Crowe as "a subtle powerhouse in his wrenching evocation of Wigand, takes on the thick, stolid look of the man he portrays", and felt that it was "by far Mann's most fully realized and enthralling work".&lt;ref name="maslin"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Mournful Echoes of a Whistle-Blower|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 5, 1999|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/05/movies/film-review-mournful-echoes-of-a-whistle-blower.html?scp=14&amp;sq=%22Michael+Mann%22&amp;st=nyt|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "When Crowe gets to command the screen, ''The Insider'' comes to roiled life. It's an ''All the President's Men'' in which Deep Throat takes center stage, an insider prodded to spill the truth".&lt;ref name="corliss"&gt;{{cite news|last = Corliss|first=Richard|title=Mournful Echoes of a Whistle-Blower|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=November 1, 1999|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,992439,00.html|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "With its dynamite performances, strafing wit and dramatic provocation, ''The Insider'' offers Mann at his best—blood up, unsanitized, and unbowed".&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter| title=''The Insider''|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 8, 2000|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-insider-19991105|accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B" rating and felt that it was "a good but far from great movie because it presents truth telling in America as far more imperiled than it is".&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite news| title=''The Insider''|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=November 12, 1999|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,271589,00.html|accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Quentin Tarantino]] included ''The Insider'' in his list of top 20 films released since 1992 (the year he became a director).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Team America, Anything Else Among the Best Movies of the Past Seventeen Years, Claims Quentin Tarantino| last=Brown|first=Lane | work=[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]] | publisher=New York Media LLC | url =http://www.vulture.com/2009/08/speed_and_team_america_among_q.html | accessdate=September 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
In 2006, ''Premiere'' ranked Crowe's performance #23 of the 100 Greatest Performances of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premiere.com/List/The-100-Greatest-Performances-of-All-Time/The-100-Greatest-Performances-of-All-Time-24-1 Premiere's 100 Greatest Performances of All Time: 24-1]&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Roth and Michael Mann won the [[Humanitas Prize]] in the Feature Film category in 2000.

The '''Truth in Lending Act''' '''(TILA)''' of 1968 is a [[United States federal law]] designed to promote the informed use of [[consumer credit]], by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Intro to Business|last1=Dlabay|first1=Les R. |last2=Burrow |first2=James L. |last3=Brad |first3=Brad |year=2009|publisher=South-Western [[Cengage Learning]]|location=[[Mason, Ohio]]|isbn=978-0-538-44561-0 |page=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TILA also gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a [[lien]] on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain [[credit card]] practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes. With the exception of certain high-cost [[mortgage loan]]s, TILA does not regulate the charges that may be imposed for consumer credit. Rather, it requires uniform or standardized disclosure of costs and charges so that consumers can shop. It also imposes limitations on home equity plans that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|40}} and certain "higher-priced" mortgage loans (HPMLs) that are subject to the requirements of {{USCFR|12|1026|35}}. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a consumer's principal [[dwelling]].

==History==
The Truth in Lending Act was originally Title I of the [[Consumer Credit Protection Act]], {{USStatute|90|321|82|146|1968|05|29}}. The regulations implementing the statute, which are known as "Regulation Z", are codified at {{USCFR|12|226}}. Most of the specific requirements imposed by TILA are found in Regulation Z, so a reference to the requirements of TILA usually refers to the requirements contained in Regulation Z, as well as the statute itself.&lt;ref name="FRB-regz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/reglisting.htm#Z |title=Federal Reserve System Banking Information and Regulation |date=July 30, 2008|work=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System |publisher=FRB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From TILA's inception,  the authority to implement the statute by issuing regulations was given to the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). However, effective July 21, 2011, TILA's general rule making authority was transferred to the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] (CFPB), whose authority was established pursuant to provisions enacted by the passage of the [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] in July 2010. Any forthcoming regulations implementing the statute, which are also formally referred to as Regulation Z, will be codified at {{USCFR|12|1026}} and attempt to mirror the FRB's Regulation Z whenever feasible.&lt;ref name="CFPB-02-13-13"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.consumerfinance.gov/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-lays-out-implementation-plan-for-new-mortgage-rules/ |title=CFPB Lays Out Implementation Plan for New Mortgage Rules |date=February 13, 2013|work=Consumer Financial Protection Bureau |publisher=CFPB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Reserve will retain some limited rule making authority under TILA for loans made by certain motor vehicle dealers, and for certain other provisions.

The TILA introduced the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) calculation mandated for all consumer lenders.  Certain misleading interest rate calculations used previously, mainly on auto loans, were barred.  For more than a decade, consumer loans were reported by APR in an economically meaningful way.  Then in the 1980s the auto manufacturers began to exploit a loophole in TILA and its administration. Neither the Act nor its administrators adequately differentiated between "amount financed" and "finance charges," two terms that appear on the TILA required disclosure statements.  By "bundling" the price of the car and its financing charges (which come from the auto maker's captive finance company), auto makers were able to shift money between the two categories, even to eliminating the financing charge entirely.  Thus "zero percent APR" financing was born.

Typical offers from auto companies are "Zero Percent APR financing available or $1,000 rebate."  The consumer who elects "zero percent" financing gives up a $1,000 rebate (reduction in car price).  Effectively, he or she pays $1,000 to get the "interest free" loan.  Since only auto makers can do this type of bundling, banks, credit unions and other competitors are left at a disadvantage.  They must disclose true APR rates while the auto makers can claim no interest costs.  In the process, the typical consumer is left with a complex finance problem.  "Zero percent" financing can cost a lot less, or a lot more than conventional financing with a non-auto maker institution.

==Organization==
The regulation is divided into subparts.

Subpart B relates to open-end credit lines ([[revolving credit]] accounts), which includes credit card accounts and home-equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

Subpart C relates to closed-end credit, such as home-purchase loans and motor vehicle loans with a fixed loan term. It contains rules on disclosures, treatment of credit balances, [[annual percentage rate]] calculations, right of rescission,non requirements, and advertising.

Subpart D contains rules on oral disclosures, [[Spanish language]] disclosure in [[Puerto Rico]], record retention, effect on state laws, state exemptions (which only apply to states that had Truth in Lending-type laws prior to the Federal Act), and rate limitations.

Subpart E contains special rules for mortgage transactions.&lt;ref name="12CFR1026"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CFR-2013-title12-vol8/CFR-2013-title12-vol8-part1026-subpartE/content-detail.html |title=12 C.F.R. 1026, Subpart E, §§ 31–45 (2013 Edition)|date=January 1, 2013|work=Code of Federal Regulations|publisher=GPO}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* § 1026.32 frames the requirements for certain closed-end home mortgages.
* § 1026.33 are requirements for [[reverse mortgage]] mortgages, including the total annual loan cost rate and transaction disclosures.{{cn|date=November 2013}}
* § 1026.34 prohibits acts or practices in connection with "high-cost" mortgages.
* § 1026.35 prohibits acts or practices in connection with "higher-priced" mortgage loans (HPMLs).
* § 1026.36 prohibits acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a dwelling.
* § 1026.39 deals with mortgage transfer disclosure guidelines.
* § 1026.40 sets the requirements for home equity plans.
* § 1026.42 aims to promote valuation independence.

Several appendices contain information such as the procedures for determinations about state laws, state exemptions and issuance of staff interpretations, special rules for certain kinds of credit plans, a list of enforcement agencies, model disclosures which if used properly will ensure compliance with the Act, and the rules for computing [[annual percentage rate]]s in closed-end credit transactions and total annual loan cost rates for [[reverse mortgage]] transactions.


==Right of rescission==
{{unsourced section|date=May 2018}}
For certain transactions secured by a borrower's principle dwelling, TILA requires that the borrower be granted three business days following loan consummation to rescind the transaction. The right of rescission allows borrowers time to reexamine the credit agreement and cost disclosures, as well as to reconsider whether they want to place their homes at risk by offering it as security for the credit.  Each borrower and any person who has a vested interest in the property may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following consummation, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last.  If the required rescission notice or material TILA disclosures are inaccurate or not delivered, the borrowers right to rescind may be extended from three days after consummation to up to three years.

When a borrower rescinds, the security interest becomes void and the borrower is not liable for any amount, including finance charges.  The bank must return any money or property given to anyone in connection with the transaction within 20 calendar days and remove any record of security interest that the bank may have taken for the new loan.  Until the rescission period has ended, the bank may not 1) disperse funds other than to a valid escrow account, 2) perform any services, or 3) deliver any materials.

The right of rescission does not apply to loans that are obtained for the purpose of purchasing a home, nor does it apply to a refinance or consolidation of a home loan with the same creditor unless the amount refinanced or consolidated exceeds the unpaid balance on the existing debt.

==Exemptions==
TILA requirements do not apply to the following types of loans or credit:

* Credit extended primarily for business, agricultural or commercial purposes;
* Credit extended to an entity (not a person, with an exception for certain trusts for tax or estate planning), including government agencies or instrumentalities.
* Credit in excess of an annually adjusted threshold, not secured by real estate or personal property, used or expected to be used as a principal dwelling;

'''Underemployment'''  is  the under-use of a worker due to a [[employment|job]] that does not use the worker's skills, or is part time, or leaves the worker idle.&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, D. C. (1996). The nature, antecedents and consequences of underemployment. ''Journal of Management, 22''(3), 385–407. {{doi|10.1177/014920639602200302}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include holding a part-time job despite desiring full-time work, and [[overqualification]], where the employee has education, experience, or skills beyond the requirements of the job.&lt;ref&gt;Chohan, Usman W. [https://theconversation.com/young-people-worldwide-fear-a-lack-of-economic-opportunities-its-easy-to-see-why-65248 "Young people worldwide fear a lack of opportunities, it's easy to see why"] ''The Conversation''.

[https://theconversation.com/young-educated-and-underemployed-are-we-building-a-nation-of-phd-baristas-53104 "Young, Educated and Underemployed: Are we Building a Nation of PhD Baristas"] ''The Conversation''. January 15, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Underemployment has been studied from a variety of perspectives, including [[economics]], [[management]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]. In economics, for example, the term underemployment has three different distinct meanings and applications. All meanings involve a situation in which a person is working, unlike [[unemployment]], where a person who is searching for work cannot find a [[Job (role)|job]]. All meanings involve under-utilization of labor which is missed by most official (governmental agency) definitions and measurements of [[unemployment]].

In economics, underemployment can refer to:
# "[[Overqualification]]", or "overeducation", or the [[employment]] of workers with high education, [[skill]] levels, or experience in jobs that do not require such abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Erdogan, B., &amp; Bauer, T. N. (2009). Perceived overqualification and its outcomes: The moderating role of empowerment. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 94''(2), 557–65. {{doi|10.1037/a0013528}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a trained [[medical doctor]] with a foreign credential who works as a [[taxicab|taxi]] driver would experience this type of underemployment.
# "Involuntary part-time" work, where workers who could (and would like to) be working for a full work-week can only find part-time work. By extension, the term is also used in [[regional planning]] to describe regions where [[economic activity]] rates are unusually low, due to a lack of job opportunities, [[training]] opportunities, or due to a lack of services such as [[childcare]] and [[public transport]]ation.
# "Overstaffing" or "hidden unemployment" or "disguised unemployment" (also called "labor hoarding"&lt;ref&gt;Felices, G. (2003). Assessing the Extent of Labour Hoarding. ''Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, 43''(2), 198–206.&lt;/ref&gt;), the practice in which [[business]]es or entire [[economics|economies]] employ workers who are not fully occupied—for example, workers currently not being used to produce goods or services due to legal or social restrictions or because the work is highly seasonal.

Underemployment is a significant cause of [[poverty]]: although the worker may be able to find part-time work, the part-time pay may not be sufficient for basic needs. Underemployment is a problem particularly in [[developing countries]], where the unemployment rate is often quite low, as most workers are doing subsistence work or occasional part-time jobs. The global average of full-time workers per adult population is only 26%, compared to 30–52% in developed countries and 5–20% in most of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/145487/Gallup-Global-Employment-Tracking.aspx|title=Gallup Global Employment Tracking|author=Gallup, Inc.|publisher=|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underutilization of skills==
In one usage, underemployment describes the [[employment]] of workers with high [[skill]] levels and [[postsecondary education]] who are working in relatively low-skilled, [[low-wage job]]s. For example, someone with a college [[academic degree|degree]] may be [[bartender|tending bar]], or working as a [[factory]] assembly line worker. This may result from the existence of [[unemployment]], which makes workers with bills to pay (and responsibilities) take almost any jobs available, even if they do not use their full talents.  This can also occur with individuals who are being [[discrimination|discriminated]] against, lack appropriate [[trade certification]] or [[academic degree]]s (such as a [[high school]] or [[college]] [[diploma]]), have disabilities or mental illnesses, or have served time in [[prison]].

Two common situations which can lead to underemployment are [[immigrant]]s and new graduates. When highly trained immigrants arrive in a country, their [[foreign credentials]] may not be recognized or accepted in their new country, or they may have to do a lengthy or costly re-credentialing process. As a result, when doctors or engineers from other countries immigrate, they may be unable to work in their profession, and they may have to seek menial work. New graduates may also face underemployment, because even though they have completed the technical training for a given field for which there is a good job market, they lack experience. So a recent graduate with a master's degree in [[accounting]] or [[business administration]] may have to work in a low-paid job as a [[barista]] or store clerk–jobs which do not require a university degree–until they are able to find work in their professional field.

Another example of underemployment is someone who holds high skills for which there is low [[Demand (economics)|market-place demand]]. While it is costly in terms of money and time to acquire [[academic degree|academic credentials]], many types of degrees, particularly those in the [[liberal arts]], produce significantly more graduates than can be properly employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Vedder| first =Richard| first2 =Christopher |last2=Denhart |first3=Jonathan |last3=Robe| title =Why are Recent College Graduates Underemployed? : University Enrollments and Labor Market Realities| publisher =Center for College Affordability and Productivity| date =January 2013| url =http://centerforcollegeaffordability.org/research/studies/underemployment-of-college-graduates| accessdate = June 2, 2013|quote=Increasing numbers of recent college graduates are ending up in relatively low-skilled jobs that, historically, have gone to those with lower levels of educational attainment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Employers have responded to the oversupply of graduates by raising the academic requirements of many occupations [[credentialism and educational inflation|higher than is really necessary to perform the work]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

If university graduates spend too long in situations of underemployment, the skills they gained from their degrees can atrophy from disuse or become out of date. For example, a person who graduates with a [[PhD]] in [[English literature]] has advanced research and writing skills when they graduate, but if she or he works as a store clerk for a number of years, these research and writing skills will atrophy from disuse. Similarly, technically specialized workers may find themselves unable to acquire positions commensurate with their skills for extended lengths of time following [[layoff]]s. A skilled machinist who is laid off may find that she cannot find another machinist job, so she may work as a server in a restaurant, a position which does not use her professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Given that most university study in Western countries is subsidized (either because it takes place at a [[state university]] or [[public university]], or because the student receives government loans or grants), this type of underemployment may also be an ineffective use of public resources. Several solutions have been proposed to reduce skill-based underemployment: for example, government-imposed restrictions on enrollment in public universities in fields with a very low labor market demand (e.g. fine arts), or changes in degree cost structure that reflected potential labour market demand.

A related kind of underemployment refers to "involuntary part-time" workers. These are workers who could (and would like to) be working for the standard work-week (typically [[full-time]] [[employment]] means 40 hours per week in the [[United States]]) who can only find part-time work. Underemployment is more prevalent during times of economic stagnation (during [[recession]]s or [[depression (economics)|depressions]]). Obviously, during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, many of those who were not unemployed were underemployed. These kinds of underemployment arise because [[labor market]]s typically do not "[[market clearing|clear]]" using [[Quantity adjustment|wage adjustment]]. Instead, there is non-wage [[rationing]] of jobs.

==Underuse of economic capacity==
Underemployment can also be used in [[regional planning]] to describe localities where [[economic activity]] rates are unusually low. This can be induced by a lack of job opportunities, [[training]] opportunities, or services such as [[childcare]] and [[public transport]]ation.  Such difficulties may lead [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] to accept economic inactivity rather than register as [[unemployment|unemployed]] or actively seek jobs because their prospects for regular employment appear so bleak. (These people are often called [[discouraged worker]]s and are not counted officially as being "unemployed.") The tendency to get by without work (to exit the [[labor force]], living off relatives, friends, personal savings, or non-recorded economic activities) can be aggravated if it is made difficult to obtain unemployment benefits.

Relatedly, in [[macroeconomics]], "underemployment" simply refers to ''[[unemployment#Cyclical unemployment|excess unemployment]]'', i.e., high unemployment relative to [[full employment]] or the [[natural rate of unemployment]], also called the [[NAIRU]]. Thus, in [[Keynesian economics]], reference is made to [[underemployment equilibrium]]. Economists calculate the cyclically-adjusted [[full employment]] unemployment rate, e.g. 4% or 6% [[unemployment]], which in a given context is regarded as "normal" and acceptable. Sometimes, this rate is equated with the [[NAIRU]]. The difference between the observed unemployment rate and cyclically adjusted full employment unemployment rate is one measure of the societal level of underemployment. By [[Okun's Law]], it is correlated with the gap between [[potential output]] and the actual real [[gross domestic product|GDP]]. This "GDP gap" and the degree of underemployment of labor would be larger if they incorporated the roles of underemployed labor, involuntary part-time labor, and discouraged workers.

==Underuse of employed workers==
The third definition of "underemployment" describes a polar opposite phenomenon: to some [[economist]]s, the term refers to "overstaffing" or "hidden unemployment," the practice of [[business]]es or entire [[economics|economies]] employing workers who are not fully occupied (in other words, employees who are not [[productivity|economically productive]], or underproductive, or [[economic inefficiency|economically inefficient]]). This may be because of legal or social restrictions on firing and lay-offs (e.g. union rules requiring managers to make a case to fire a worker or spend time and money fighting the union) or because they are ''overhead'' workers, or because the work is highly seasonal (which is the case in [[accounting|accounting firms]] focusing on [[tax]] preparation, as well as [[agriculture]]). The presence of this issue in [[White-collar worker|white collar]] office jobs is described in the [[boreout]] phenomenon, which posits that the major issue facing office workers is lack of work and [[boredom]].

This kind of underemployment does ''not'' refer to the kind of non-work time done by, for instance, [[firefighters]] or [[lifeguards]], who spend a lot of their time waiting and watching for emergency or rescue work to do; this kind of activity is necessary to ensure that if (e.g.) three fires occur at once, there are sufficient firefighters available.

This kind of underemployment may exist for ''[[structural]]'' or ''[[business cycle|cyclical]]'' reasons. In many economies, some firms become insulated from fierce competitive pressures and grow [[inefficiency|inefficient]], because they are awarded a government [[monopoly]] (e.g., telephone or electrical utilities) or due to a situation of abuse of market power (e.g., holding a [[monopoly]] position in a certain industry). As such, if they may employ more workers than necessary, they might not be getting the market signals that would pressure them to reduce their labour force, and they may end up carrying the resultant excess [[cost]]s and depressed [[Profit (economics)|profits]].  

In some countries, labour laws or practices (e.g. powerful [[labor union|unions]]) may force employers to retain excess employees.  Other countries (e.g. [[Japan]]) often have significant cultural influences (the relatively great importance attached to [[worker solidarity]] as opposed to [[shareholder]] rights) that result in a reluctance to shed labour in times of difficulty. In Japan, there is a long-held tradition that if a worker commits to serve a company with long and loyal service, the company will, in return, keep the worker on the payroll even during economic downturns. In [[central planning|centrally-planned economies]], lay-offs were often not allowed, so that some state-run companies would have periods when they had more workers than they needed to complete the organization's tasks.

Cyclical underemployment refers to the tendency for the [[capacity utilization]] of firms (and therefore of their demand for labor) to be lower at times of [[recession]] or [[economic depression]]. At such times, underemployment of workers may be tolerated—and indeed may be wise business policy—given the financial cost and the degradation of [[morale]] from shedding and then re-hiring staff. Alternatively, paying underused overhead workers is seen as an investment in their future contributions to production. This kind of underemployment has been given as a possible reason why [[Airbus]] gained [[market share]] from [[Boeing]]. Unlike Airbus, which had more flexibility, Boeing was unable to ramp up [[Production, costs, and pricing|production]] fast enough when prosperous times returned because the company had dismissed a great part of its personnel in lean times.

Another example is the [[tourism]] sector, which faces cyclical demand in areas where attractions are weather-related. In some tourism sectors, such as the sun and sand tours operated by [[Club Med]], the company can shed bartenders, lifeguards, and sports instructors, and other staff in the off-season, because there is such a strong demand amongst young people to work for the company, because its glamorous beachfront properties are desirable places to work. However, not all tourism sectors find it so easy to recruit staff. Some tourism sectors require workers with unusual or hard-to-find skills. Northern Ontario hunting and fishing camps that require skilled guides may have an incentive to retain their staff in the off-season. Another example is companies which run tours for foreign tourists using staff speaking the travelers' native tongue. In Canada, guided tours are available for Japanese and German tourists in their native languages; in some locations, it may be hard for companies to find Japanese- or German-speaking staff, so the companies may retain their staff in the off-season.

'''Vladimir Alexeyevich Bryntsalov''' ({{lang-ru|Влади́мир Алексе́евич Брынца́лов}}; born November 23, 1946) is a  [[Russia]]n businessman and politician. He is the founder and owner of pharmaceutical company ZAO  Bryntsalov A.&lt;ref name="Брынцалов"&gt;[http://flb.ru/persprint/180.html  Биография Владимира Алексеевича Брынцалова]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 until 2003 he was a deputy in the [[State Duma]] of Russia. Bryntsalov was a candidate in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 Russian presidential election]]. He attempted to run for president again in [[Russian presidential election, 2004|2004]], but failed to attain ballot access.

==Early life==

In 1969 Bryntsalov graduated from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Novocherkassk Polytechnic Institute|ru|3=Южно-Российский государственный политехнический университет}} with a degree in Mine Surveying and Geodesy.&lt;ref name="Брынцалов"/&gt;

Bryntsaloc founded the pharmaceutical company ZAO  Bryntsalov A.&lt;ref name="Брынцалов"/&gt;

==Political career==
Bryntalov was elected to the [[State Duma]] in [[Russian legislative election, 1995|1995]]. He was reelected to the State Duma in [[Russian legislative election, 1999|1999]] and served in the State Duma until 2003.

===Presidential campaign, 1996===
Bryntaslov ran as the candidate of the Russian Socialist Party in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 Russian presidential election]].

Brynsalov announced his candidacy with a speech on February 20.&lt;ref name=reutersscreen1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reuters.screenocean.com/record/347682 |title=RUSSIA: BILLIONAIRE VLADIMIR BRYNTSALOV LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENCY |date=February 20, 1996 |website=www.reuters.screenocean.com |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |publisher=Reuters |access-date=September 12, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech he declared that money was "man's greatest invention".&lt;ref name=reutersscreen1/&gt;

As a candidate, Brytsalov boasted about his wealth and personality, saying, {{quote|I'm rich, I'm strong. I'll teach everybody, and force people to do what they're supposed to do.&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9606/06/russias.perot/ |title=Russia's Ross Perot |last=O'Connor |first=Eileen |date=June 6, 1996 |website=www.cnn.com |publisher=CNN |access-date=July 24, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brytsalov promoted himself with the superlative claim of being "the richest man in Russia". As a candidate, Brytsalov flaunted his wealth by dressing in a flashy wardrobe and wearing a $80,000 Rolex.&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn/&gt; During his campaign he was often was accompanied by his wife, who was noticeably twenty years his minor.&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn/&gt; In addition to flamboyantly flaunting his wealth, Bryntsalov sought to present himself as a [[rags to riches]] success story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bate |first=Roger |date=2012 |title=Phake: The Deadly World of Falsified and Substandard Medicines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8H2dpglBxHcC&amp;dq |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=228 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brytsalov claimed that his leadership would eliminate the country's poverty, promising that, if he were elected, there would be, "no poor pensioners, no poor workers, no poor entrepreneurs, no poor farmers."&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn/&gt;

His plan, which he dubbed "Russian socialism", was for large companies to begin paying wages comparable to companies in other industrialized nations. The plan anticipated that the employees of the companies would consequentially pay larger income taxes, spend more on consumer goods, and increase their productivity at their jobs. The feasibility of this plan was criticized, as Russian companies were considered to be unable to pay such wages.&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn/&gt;

Despite being a (recently elected) deputy of the State Duma, Brytsalov did not have a voting-record. In his legislative career, he had very low attendance and extremely little participation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://kommersant.ru/doc/16388 Справочник Вся Дума]''. — Коммерсант-Власть, 25.01.2000. — № 3&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had initially filed his registration, the [[Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation|Central Election Commission]] 400,000 of his 1.35 million signatures were deemed invalid. Rather than collecting additional signatures (which was still an option, as he had turned-in his registration ahead of the deadline), he appealed the decision to the [[Supreme Court of Russia|Supreme Court]]. Controversially, the Supreme Court found in favor of Bryntsalov and ruled that 170,000 of the contested signatures were indeed valid. These were enough signatures to place Bryntsalov above the required one-million signatures, thus permitting him to be a candidate in the election.&lt;ref name=russianelectionwatch18&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu:80/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/RusElSrc |title=Russian Election Watch, April 18, 1996 |date=April 18, 1996 |access-date=2018-07-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001205155600/http://ksgnotes1.harvard.edu/BCSIA/Library.nsf/wwwdocsname/RusElSrc |archive-date=5 December 2000 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.aimnet.com/~ksyrah/ekskurs/preslist.html|title=Candidates in 1996 Russian Presidential Elections|author=Albert L.

Relatively unknown to the Russian populace, Brytsalov was generally seen as a marginal candidate and was viewed as unlikely to win the election.&lt;ref name=Brytsalovcnn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1141153.html |title=DEADLINE FOR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES EXPIRES. |last=Belin |first=Laura |date=April 17, 1996 |website=www.rferl.org |publisher=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty |access-date=September 12, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential campaign, 2004===
Bryntsalov again ran for president in [[Russian presidential election, 2004|2004]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vedomosti.ru/photogallery/13804 Ведомости]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vybory.izbirkom.ru/region/region/izbirkom?action=show&amp;root=1&amp;tvd=1001000882950&amp;vrn=1001000882950&amp;region=0&amp;global=1&amp;sub_region=0&amp;prver=0&amp;pronetvd=null&amp;type=341&amp;vibid=1001000890770 Брынцалов Владимир Алексеевич]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he withdrew from the race in January without having submitted any signatures to register as a candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/rew204.pdf |title=RUSSIAN ELECTION WATCH Vol.3, No.5, |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=February 2004|website=www.belfercenter.org |publisher=Harvard University (Belfer Center for Science &amp; International Affairs, Davis Center for Russian &amp; Eurasian Studies) and Indiana University-Bloomington |access-date=October 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryntsalov was perceived to be supporting Putin and his candidacy was seen as an attempt at putting himself forward a "show" opponent rather than a true challenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/rew104.pdf |title=RUSSIAN ELECTION WATCH Vol.3, No.4, |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=January 2004|website= |publisher=Harvard University (Belfer Center for Science &amp; International Affairs, Davis Center for Russian &amp; Eurasian Studies) and Indiana University-Bloomington |access-date=October 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Bryntsalov's first marriage was to Lydia Tikhonovna Bryntsalova. Together they have a daughter, Natalya (born 1971).

His marriage is to Natalya Bryntsalova (born in 1967). He has two children with her, a son Alexey (1992) and daughter Alena (1994). Natalya decided to finally part with Bryntsalov, he left her his property in [[Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sobesednik.ru/scandals/20120806-vladimira-bryntsalova-brosila-zhena Владимира Брынцалова бросила жена]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1562">'''Voluntary Counselling and Testing''' ('''VCT''') for [[HIV]] usually involves two counseling sessions: one prior to taking the test known as "pre-test counseling" and one following the HIV test when the results are given, often referred to as "post-test counseling". Counseling focuses on the infection (HIV), the disease ([[AIDS]]), the test, and positive behavior change.  VCT has become popular in many parts of [[Africa]] as a way for a person to learn their HIV status.  VCT centers and counselors often use rapid HIV tests that require a drop of [[blood]] or some [[cell (biology)|cell]]s from the inside of one's cheek; the tests are cheap, require minimal training, and provide accurate results in about 15 minutes.
