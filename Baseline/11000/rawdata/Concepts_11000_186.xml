{{Jainism}}
'''Ajiva''' ([[Sanskrit]]) is anything that has no soul or life, the polar opposite of "[[Jīva (Jainism)|jīva]]" (soul). Because ''ajiva'' has no life, it does not accumulate ''karma'' and cannot die. Examples of ajiva include chairs, computers, paper, plastic, etc. According to [[Jain philosophy]], ''Ajiva'' can be divided into two kinds, with form and without form.&lt;ref name="Shah"&gt;{{citation |last=Shah |first=Natubhai |title=Jainism : The World of Conquerors |publisher=Sussex Academic Press |date=November 1998 |isbn=1-898723-30-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g120RG8GkHAC&amp;pg=PA50 |p=50 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five categories of Ajiva==
In [[Jainism]], there are five categories which ''ajīva'' can be placed into.{{sfn|George|2008|p=328}} Out of these, four categories, ''Dharma'' (medium of motion), ''Adharma'' (medium of rest), ''[[Ākāśa (Jainism)|Akasha]]'' (space) and ''[[Pudgala]]'' (matter) are described as the ''asti-kaya [[Dravya (Jainism)|dravya's]]'' (substances which possess constituent parts extending in space) while the fifth category ''Kala'' is an ''anasti-kaya dravya'' (which has no extension in space).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-Astikaya===
{{Main|Dharma (Jainism)}}
Dharmastikaya is formed from the two words: [[Dharma]] &amp; Astikaya. Dharma here isn't referring to religion, but instead its referring to the medium of motion. Astikay itself is formed of two words: Asti &amp; Kaya. Asti means space, body or mode and Kaya means collection. So Astikaya means a collection of spaces or regions. Dharmastikaya denotes the medium of motion for things in the universe. In the absence of this medium, living things (i.e. [[jiva]]) would not be able to move.

===Adharma-Astikaya===
Adharmastikaya is also formed from two words: Adharma &amp; Astikaya. Adharma in this case means the
medium of rest. In the absence of this medium, Living things or [[jiva]] would continuously move.

===Ākāśa -Astikaya===
{{Main|Ākāśa (Jainism)}}
The infinity of space, called ''ākāśa'' in Sanskrit, is divided by the [[Jain philosophy]] into two parts, namely, the ''lokākāśa'' (loka+ākāśa), that is the space occupied by the universe, and the ''alokākāśa'' (a not, and lokākāśa), the portion beyond the universe. The ''lokākāśa'' is the portion in which are to be found the remaining five substances, i.e., ''Jīvas'', Matter, Time, Dharma and Adharma; but the ''alokākāśa'' is the region of pure space containing no other substance and lying stretched on all sides beyond bounds of the three worlds (the entire universe).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Third|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=518–520}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the summit of the ''lokākāśa'' is the ''[[Siddhashila]]'' (abode of the liberated souls).&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, C. (1997). ''A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-0365-5}}, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pudgala-Astikaya===
{{Main|Pudgala}}
The word [[Pudgala]] is made up of two terms: ''Pud'' means supplement (integration) and ''Gala'' means disintegration (division). In other words, what continuously changes by supplementation and/or division (''purayanti galanti cha'') is called Pudgala or [[matter]]. All matter in the [[universe]] is called Pudgala. Pudgala has form and [[shape]]. Pudgala can be experienced by touching, tasting, smelling, or seeing.{{sfn|Jaini|1998|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;"Sparsharasagandhavarnavantah pudgalah" - [[Umasvati]], [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvarthadhigama-sutra]], v.23&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Jiva]] Pudgala is also mobile. According to [[Jainism]], The karma [[wiktionary:Particle|particles]] that attach to our souls are also Pudgala. Pudgala can only be divided and subdivided to a certain extent that it is not possible to further subdivide it. This indivisible part of Pudgala, which is separated from the main pudgala, is called Paramanu. A paramanu is much more minute than even an [[atom]]. When a Paramanu is attached to the main pudgala, it is called a Pradesha. These [[subatomic]] Paramanus are too minute to be detected by normal vision, but they can be combined. Thus when a paramanu is combined with one or more other paramanus, they are called a skandha which are more or less like a [[molecules]]. Part of skandha is called desha. Such sknadhas may be large or small. Small skandhas may be invisible to the eye, but they can be seen when the combinations are larger.

===Kala===
Kala refers to time that brings forth changes. Past, present, and future are the different modes of time and are measured in terms of years, months, days, hours, minutes or seconds. For practical purposes a second happens to be the finest measurement of time. [[Jainism]] however, recognizes a very small [[measurement]] of time known as ''samaya'' which is an infinitely small part of a [[second]]. 

''Kala'' (time) is infinite, but there are cycles (''kalachakra''s) in it. Each cycle having two eras of equal duration described as the ''[[avasarpini]]'' and the ''utsarpini''. The former is a descending era in which virtue gradually decreases. The latter is an ascending era in which the reverse takes place. The present era is stated to be the former.&lt;ref&gt;Hiriyanna, M. (1993, reprint 2000). ''Outlines of Indian Philosophy'', Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|81-208-1099-6}}, pp.159-60&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br&gt;Indivisible time = 1 Samaya (smallest unit of measurement)
&lt;br&gt;Countless Samayas = 1 Avalika
&lt;br&gt;16,777,216 Avalikas = 1 Muhurt (48 minutes)
&lt;br&gt;30 Muhurtas = 1 day and night
&lt;br&gt;15 Days and nights = 1 Paksha
&lt;br&gt;2 Pakshas = 1 Month
&lt;br&gt;12 Months = 1 Year
&lt;br&gt;Countless years = 1 Palyopam
&lt;br&gt;1,000,000,000,000,000 (one quintillion) Palyopams = 1 Sagaropam; one quintillion is 1,000,000,000,000,000,000
&lt;br&gt;1,000,000,000,000,000 Sagaropams = 1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini
&lt;br&gt;1 Utsarpini or Avasarpini = 1 Kalchakra (One time cycle)

'''Artha''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|t|ə|,_|-|θ|ə}}; {{lang-sa|अर्थ}}) is one of the four aims of human life in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=jamesl&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Rosen Publishing, New York, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, pp 55–56&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''artha'' literally translates as "meaning, sense, goal, purpose or essence" depending on the context.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* [http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=artha&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 Sanskrit English Dictionary] University of Kloen, Germany (2009)
* Karl Potter (1998), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 3, {{ISBN|81-208-0310-8}}, Motilal Banarsidass, pp 610 (note 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Artha is also a broader concept in the scriptures of [[Hinduism]]. As a concept, it has multiple meanings, all of which imply "means of life", activities and resources that enable one to be in a state one wants to be in.&lt;ref name=johnk&gt;John Koller, Puruṣārtha as Human Aims, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 18, No. 4 (Oct., 1968), pp. 315–319&lt;/ref&gt;

Artha applies to both an individual and a government. In an individual's context, ''artha'' includes wealth, career, activity to make a living, financial security and economic prosperity. The proper pursuit of artha is considered an important aim of human life in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt;&lt;ref name=bruces&gt;Bruce Sullivan (1997), Historical Dictionary of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0-8108-3327-2}}, pp 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; At government level, ''artha'' includes social, legal, economic and worldly affairs. Proper [[Arthashastra]] is considered an important and necessary objective of government.&lt;ref name=bruces/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constance Jones and James Ryan (2007), Encyclopedia of Hinduism, {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5458-9}}, pp 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hindu traditions, Artha is connected to the three other aspects and goals of human life: [[Dharma]] (virtuous, proper, moral life), [[Kama]] (pleasure, sensuality, emotional fulfillment) and [[Moksha]] (liberation, release, self-actualization). Together, these mutually non-exclusive four aims of life are called [[Puruṣārtha]].&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;"Artha" in Encyclopædia Britannica, Chicago, 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 601.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see:

==Definition and meaning==
Artha as a concept includes multiple meanings. It is difficult to capture the meaning of artha, or related terms of ''dharma'', ''kama'' and ''moksha'', each in a single English word.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in [[Julius Lipner]] (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, paragraph overlapping pp. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;

John Lochtefeld describes&lt;ref name=jamesl/&gt; ''artha'' as the means of life, and includes material prosperity. Karl Potter explains&lt;ref name=karlp&gt;Karl H. Potter (2002), Presuppositions of India's Philosophies, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-81-208-0779-2}}, pp. 1–29&lt;/ref&gt; it as an attitude and capability that enables one to make a living, to remain alive, to thrive as a free person. It includes economic prosperity, security and health of oneself and those one feels responsible for.&lt;ref name=swsk/&gt; Artha includes everything in one's environment that allows one to live. It is neither an end state nor an endless goal of aimlessly amassing money, claims Karl Potter,&lt;ref name=karlp/&gt; rather it is an attitude and necessary requirement of human life. John Koller takes&lt;ref name=johnk/&gt; a different viewpoint than Karl Potter's interpretation. John Koller suggests artha is not an attitude, rather it is one of the necessities of human life. A central premise of Hindu philosophy, claims Koller, is that every person should live a joyous and pleasurable life, that such fulfilling life requires every person's needs and desires be acknowledged and fulfilled, that needs can only be satisfied through activity and when sufficient means for those activities are available. Artha, then, is best described as pursuit of activities and means necessary for a joyous and pleasurable life.&lt;ref name=johnk/&gt;

[[Daya Krishna]] argues&lt;ref name=dayak&gt;Daya Krishna, The myth of the purusarthas, in Theory of Value (Editor: Roy Perrett), Volume 5, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|0-8153-3612-8}}, pp 11–24&lt;/ref&gt; that ''artha'', as well as the concept of Puruṣārthas, is a myth. The various schools and ancient Sanskrit texts  provide no consensus opinion, notes Krishna, rather they present a debate, a diversity of views on what ''artha'' and Puruṣārtha means. Inconsistencies and conflicting verses are even present within the same script, such as the Manusmriti. Some ancient Indian texts suggest artha are instruments that enable satisfaction of desires; some include wealth, some include power, and some such as the [[Bhakti movement|bhakti school]]s include instruments to love God. Some of this, suggests Krishna, reflects differences in human needs. Perhaps, conjectures Krishna, artha is just a subset of [[kama]] and [[karma]].&lt;ref name=dayak/&gt;

[[Vatsyayana]] in Kama Sutra defines ''artha'' as the acquisition of arts, land, cattle, wealth, equipages and friends. He explains, artha is also protection of what is already acquired, and the increase of what is protected.&lt;ref name=ksv&gt;The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/kamasutraofvatsy00vatsuoft#page/8/mode/2up The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana], University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gavin Flood]] explains&lt;ref name=gavinf&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; artha as "worldly success" without violating dharma (moral responsibility), kama (love) and one's journey towards moksha (spiritual liberation). Flood clarifies that ''artha'' in ancient Hindu literature, as well as purushartha, is better understood as a goal of Man (not a man). In other words, it is one of the four purposes of human life. The survival and the thriving of humans requires artha - that is, economic activity, wealth and its creation, worldly success, profit, political success and all that is necessary for human existence.&lt;ref name=gavinf/&gt;

==History==
The word Artha appears in the oldest known scriptures of India. However, the term connotes 'purpose', goal or 'aim' of something, often as purpose of ritual sacrifices. Over time, artha evolves into a broader concept in the [[Upanishad]]ic era. It is first included as part of ''Trivarga'' concept (three categories of human life - dharma, artha and kama),&lt;ref name=ka&gt;See:
* Kautilya Arthashastra at 1.7.3–7; For English translation - Rangarajan (1987), Penguin Classics, {{ISBN|978-0-14-044603-6}};
* Ashok S. Chousalkar (2004), Methodology of Kautilya's Arthashastra, The Indian Journal of Political Science, Vol. 65, No. 1, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt; which over time expanded into the concept ''Caturvarga'' (four categories, including moksha). ''Caturvarga'' is also referred to as Puruṣārtha.&lt;ref name=gavinf13&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 13–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mimamsa]] school of Hinduism explained artha, dharma and kama by contrasting Puruṣārtha and Kratvartha. Puruṣārtha is human purpose of a [[yajna]], while Kratvartha is sacrificial purpose of a [[yajna]]. They recognized and explained all human actions have two effects: first, every act affects itself regardless of actors involved; second, every act has human meanings, hopes and desires and affects each actor in a personal way.&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Jaimini explained in 3rd century BC, that this human meaning cannot be separated from the human goal. The ''phala'' (fruit, result) of a sacrifice is implicit in the ''artha'' (meaning, purpose) of the sacrifice. Mimamsa school then argued that man is for the purpose of actions demanded by Vedic injunctions (apauruseya), and such subordination of man to rituals allows man to reach heaven.&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Other schools of Hinduism, such as Yoga and Vedanta schools, disagreed with Mimamsa school. They argued that rituals and sacrifice are means, not ends. Their emphasis shifted from rituals to effort and knowledge, from heaven to moksha, from freedom after life to freedom in this life, from human being as a cog in cosmic wheel to human being as an end in himself. For example, [[Aranyaka#Aitareya Aranyaka|Aitareya Aranyaka]] recites:
{{Quote|
1=&lt;poem&gt;
He knows tomorrow, he knows the world and what is not the world.
By the mortal he desires the immortal, being this endowed.
Man is the sea, he is above all the world.
Whatever he reaches he desires to go beyond it.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|2=Aitareya Aranyaka|3=II.1.3&lt;ref&gt;R. V. De Smet (1972), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397675 Early Trends in the Indian Understanding of Man], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 22, No. 3, pp. 259–268&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thereafter came a flowering of the [[Shastra]]ic literature on Artha and other aims of human beings: of dharma in [[Dharmashastra]]s, of artha in [[Arthashastra]]s, of kama in [[Kamashastra]]s (Kamasutra being one part of the compendium).&lt;ref name=gavinf13/&gt; Different schools of Hinduism offer different perspectives on artha, just like dharma, karma and moksha. Most historical literature of ancient India from about 5th century BC and after, interlaces all four aims of humans. Many Upanishads as well as the two Indian Epics - the Ramayana and the Mahabharata - discuss and use the words dharma, artha, kama and moksha as part of their respective themes. Even subhasitas, gnomic and didatic Indian literature from 1st and 2nd millennium CE, incorporate artha and other three aims of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwik Sternbach (1974), Subhasitas, Gnomic and Didatic Literature, in A History of Indian Literature Volume IV, {{ISBN|3-447-01546-2}}, Otto Harrassowitz, Germany, pp. 1–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relative precedence between Artha, Kama and Dharma==
Ancient Indian literature emphasizes that [[dharma]] is foremost. If dharma is ignored, artha and kama - profit and pleasure respectively - lead to social chaos.&lt;ref name=gavinf16&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 16–21&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gautama's Dharmasutra|Gautama]] Dharmashastra, [[Apastamba]] Dharmasutra and [[Yājñavalkya Smṛti]], as examples, all suggest that dharma comes first and is more important than artha and kama.&lt;ref&gt;See:
* [[Patrick Olivelle]], Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}, Note 24.23 at pp 364;
* Gautama Dharmashastra at 1.9.46–47, Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}, paragraph overlapping pp 92–93;
* Yajnavalkya Smrti at 1.115, Translation by Rai Vidyarnava (1918), [https://archive.org/stream/yajnavalkyasmrit00yj#page/232/mode/2up/search/dharma The Sacred Books of Hindus] Volume XXI, Verse CXV and commentary at pp 232;
* Apastamba Dharmasutra 2.20.18–23; Patrick Olivelle, Dharmasutras - The Law Codes of Ancient India, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-283882-2}}, Miscellaneous Rules 18–23 at pp 64&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vatsyayana]], the author of [[Kamasutra]], recognizes relative value of three goals as follows: artha is more important and should precede kama, while dharma is more important and should precede both kama and artha.&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt; Kautiliya's [[Arthashastra]], however, argues that artha is the foundation for the other two. Without prosperity and security in society or at individual level, both moral life and sensuality become difficult. Poverty breeds vice and hate, while prosperity breeds virtues and love, suggested Kautiliya.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt; Kautilya adds that all three are mutually connected, and one should not cease enjoying life, nor virtuous behavior, nor pursuit of wealth creation. Excessive pursuit of any one aspect of life with complete rejection of other two, harms all three including the one excessively pursued.&lt;ref name=ka/&gt;

Some&lt;ref name=ksv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.V. Kane (1941), History of Dharmashastra, Volume 2, Part 1, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Indian literature observe that the relative precedence of artha, kama and dharma are naturally different for different people and different age groups. In a baby or child, education and kama takes precedence; in youth kama and artha take precedence; while in old age dharma takes precedence.

The Epics such as the Mahabharata debate the relative precedence of dharma, artha, kama and moksha, through the different characters in Book 12, the [[Shanti Parva|Book of Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;R.C. Zachner (1962), pp 115–117&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi [[Vidura]] says dharma must take the highest precedence. [[Arjuna]] claims without profit and prosperity (artha), people's ability for dharma and kama fall apart. [[Bhima]] claims pleasure and sex (kama) come first, because without these there is no dharma, artha or moksha. [[Yudhishthira]] asserts dharma should always lead one, including in matters of artha and kama, but then admits balancing dharma, artha and kama is often confusing and difficult.&lt;ref name=gavinf16/&gt; In another book, the Mahabharata suggests that morality, profit and pleasure - dharma, artha and kama - all three must go together for happiness:
{{Quote|1=Morality is well practiced by the good. Morality, however, is always afflicted by two things, the desire of Profit entertained by those that covet it, and the desire for Pleasure cherished by those that are wedded to it. Whoever without afflicting Morality and Profit, or Morality and Pleasure, or Pleasure and Profit, followeth all three - Morality, Profit and Pleasure - always succeeds in obtaining great happiness.|2=The [[Mahabharata]]|3=Book 9.60&lt;ref&gt;Kisari Mohan Ganguli (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/mahabharataofkri05royp#page/232/mode/2up Book 9:Calya Parva] The Mahabharata, pp 232&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Contemporary relevance==
Gavin Flood suggests the concepts embedded in purushartha, which includes artha, reflect a deep understanding and insights into human nature, and of conflicts which are inevitably faced by all human beings. It is an attempt to acknowledge and encourage one to understand diversity yet seek coherence between people, rather than deny one or more aspects of human life or force a particular precept and code on people.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, {{ISBN|978-1-896209-30-2}}, pp 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Halbfass (1994), Menschsein und Lebensziele: Beobachtungen zu den puruṣārthas, In Hermeneutics of Encounter: Essays in Honour of Gerhard Oberhammer on the Occasion of His 65th Birthday (Editors: D'Sa and Mesquita), Vienna, pp 123–135&lt;/ref&gt;

Donald Davis suggests that ''artha'', ''kama'' and ''dharma'' are broadly applicable human aims, that extend beyond Hindu studies. They are Indian perspective on the nature of human life, a perspective shared in Jain and Buddhist literature.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Davis Jr. (2004), Being Hindu or Being Human: A Reappraisal of the Puruṣārthas, International Journal of Hindu Studies, 8.1–3, pp 1–27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ataptatanū''' ([[Sanskrit]]:अतप्ततनू) – ''tapa'' (तप) means – 'to burn', 'heat up'; ''atapta'' (अतप्त) – means - 'not heated', 'cool', and ''tanū'' (तनू) – means - 'body', 'the physical self';  ''ataptatanū'' means – 'he whose body or mass is not prepared in fire', 'raw' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier-Williams Sabskrit-English Dictionary|url= http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/3.html }},&lt;/ref&gt;

The compound word, ''ataptatanū'', appears in the below cited mantra of the IX Mandala of the Rig Veda. In a [[sukta]] addressed to Pavmāna Somo Devatā, Rishi Pavitra prays:-

:पवित्रं ते विततं ब्रह्मणस्पते प्रभुर्गात्राणि पर्येषि विश्वतः |
:अतप्ततनूर्न तदामो अश्नुते श्रृतास इद्वहन्तस्तत्समाशत ||   ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.1) 

In this mantra, ''ataptatanūh'', refers to the one who has not subjected himself to the heat of tapas, ''tadāmah'' refers to one who is raw and who therefore, ''aśunate'' - cannot experience the highest bliss because his body is not yet properly prepared to receive the knowledge he seeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda with commentary in Hindi of Swami Dayananda Saraswati|publisher=Arya Samaj, Jamnagar|page=272|url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/rugveda_v5/rugveda.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[Satyarth Prakash]] (Light of Truth), Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]] explains that ''ataptatanū'' does not refer to branding with fire of one’s body which fact is clarified by Rishi Pavitra in the subsequent mantra which reads:-

:तपोष्पवित्रं विततं दिवस्पदे शोचन्तो अस्य तन्तवो वयस्थिरन् |
:अवन्त्यस्य पवीतारमाशवो दिवस्पृष्ठमधि तिष्ठन्ति चेतसा ||

and which means –

: " O Lord Thou Who art the Protector of the universe and the Veda, and art Omnipotent, Omnipresent, and Holy in nature canst not be approached by a human soul that has not been purified by tapa (or tapasya by means of thorough control of the senses, truthful speech, subjugation of the animal in man (instinct), conquest of the lower self, the practice of yoga, association with good men – all these constitute tapasya), and is therefore, not spiritually regenerate; it is only those, whose souls have been cleansed through righteous conduct and devotion to virtue, that can see Thee Who art All Holy. " ([[Rig Veda]] IX.83.2) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Light of Truth-Satyarth Prakash|author=Dayananda Saeaswati|publisher=Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=369|url= https://www.scribd.com/doc/250453797/359/PAGE-369 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapa]] or ''tapasya'', is practical discipline; according to the [[Bhagavada Gita]] (XVII.14), revering the gods, the twice-born, elders, teachers and wise men, purity, celibacy, and non-violence these are the ''tapasya'' of the body, of speech and of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bhagavad Gita|publisher=Islamkotob|page=240|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=b387bE4Ok0oC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Zh2xVJmYNoKauQSkn4D4Dw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The finishing phase of a scholar’s higher education was called ''tapasya'' in the time of [[Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna Charitra|author=Alo Shome|publisher=V&amp;amp;S publishers|page=55|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ASNmhKlL0ioC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7CKxVLTfHYayuASjr4CQAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gandhi]] considered ''tapasya'' to be the test of love, ''[[ahimsa]]'', self-suffering and self-sacrifice, essentials in the quest for truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=wisdom in Action|author=Raghavan Iyer|publisher=Theosophy Trust|page=254|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=SrmqJTBK_f4C&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=tapasya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uCSxVLCWM8aLuASxk4KQDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=tapasya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Capandshare02outline.jpg|thumb|300px|A diagram which sets out the basic process of the policy]]

'''Cap and Share''' was originally developed by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] (the Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability) and is a regulatory and economic framework for controlling the use of fossil fuels in relation to climate stabilisation. Accepting that climate change is a global problem and that there is a need to cap and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions globally, the philosophy of Cap and Share maintains that the earth’s atmosphere is a fundamental common resource. Consequently, it is argued, each individual should get an equal share of the benefits from the limited amount of fossil fuels that will have to be burned and their emissions released into the atmosphere in the period until the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases has been stabilised at a safe level.

== Design ==

This market based mechanism was devised by [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability|Feasta]] in 2005 and 2006, and they have set out the case for the introduction of Cap and Share globally in policy documents.&lt;ref name=Feasta1&gt;The Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Cap-and-Share-May08.pdf Cap and Share: A Fair Way to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions]. Feasta, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for global emissions to be capped at their current level and then brought down year by year at a rate fast enough to prevent catastrophic climate change. Each year, the emissions tonnage involved would be shared equally amongst the Earth's adult population, each of whom would receive a certificate representing their individual entitlement. The recipients would then sell their certificates through the banking system to oil, coal and gas producers who would need to acquire enough of them to cover the carbon dioxide emissions that would be emitted from all of the fossil fuel they sold. Everyone would receive at least partial compensation for the higher cost of fossil fuels that limiting their availability would necessarily involve.

Comhar, the National Sustainable Development Council of Ireland, commissioned a report on the mechanism which incorporates policy&lt;ref name=AEAReport&gt;AEA Energy and Environment, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/AEA_cap_and_share.pdf Cap and Share: Phase 1; Policy Options for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions.] Report to Comhar Sustainable Development Council. AEA, Didcot.&lt;/ref&gt; and economic analysis of using Cap and Share to control emissions in Ireland, particularly from the transport sector. The final report&lt;ref name=AEAReport2&gt;AEA Energy and Environment and Cambridge Econometrics, 2008. [http://www.feasta.org/documents/energy/Comhar_Cap_and_Share_Report.pdf A Study in Personal Carbon Allocation: Cap and Share]. Comhar Sustainable Development Council, Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in December 2008.

Cap and Share is partly an extension and popularisation of the [[Contraction and Convergence]] proposal developed by the Global Commons Institute, which also calls for an equal per capita distribution of emissions. Cap and Share differs in that it insists that emissions allocations should be distributed equally to individuals as their right, whereas Contraction and Convergence (C&amp;C) allows governments to decide if this is the way they wish to share out what is, essentially, their national allocation. C&amp;C also allows for (but does not insist on) a convergence period, during which the richer countries would receive higher per capita emissions allowances than poorer countries. Cap and Share says people in rich countries should get the same emissions entitlement as those in poor countries from the start, but suggests that in the early years of the system, a portion of everyone's emissions entitlement should be held back and distributed to governments of countries which were facing exceptional difficulties in adapting to climate change or to low levels of fossil energy use. The governments involved would sell their certificates to raise money for remedial works. For example, the government of Bangladesh might sell its allocation to pay for better defences against rising sea levels.

== Principles ==

# That a ceiling or cap on carbon dioxide and other green house gas (ghg) emissions from fossil fuels should be calculated that prevents an average global temperature rise of over 2 degrees Celsius.
# That the right to emit such ghgs is a human right, and should be shared on an equal-per-capita basis, with permits going to each individual rather than to their governments.
# That the permits would be saleable through the post office and banking system to the importers and producers of fossil fuels who would need to acquire enough permits to cover the emissions from the fuels they introduce.
# That any national or European Union scheme should be designed as a possible prototype for a global system that will also help set the conditions for the alleviation of poverty and the maintenance of biodiversity.

== Economic assessment ==

If the future were known with certainty, then the economic implications of Cap and Share would equal the economic implications of a carbon tax with lump sum recycling—that is, the carbon tax revenue would be used to send every household a cheque in the post. Some argue that lump sum recycling is an inferior way to recycle the revenue of environmental taxes,&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence H. Goulder (1995), Effects of Carbon Taxes in an Economy with Prior Tax Distortions: An Intertemporal General Equilibrium Analysis, Journal of Environmental Economics and Management, 29, 271-297.&lt;/ref&gt; and that this has been repeatedly confirmed for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Adele Bergin et al. (2004), [http://www.epa.ie/downloads/pubs/research/econ/epa_reducing_greenhouse_gas.pdf   The macroeconomic effects of using fiscal instruments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions], Environmental Protection Agency, Johnstown Castle.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Conefrey et al. (2008), [http://ideas.repec.org/p/esr/wpaper/wp251.html The impact of a carbon tax on economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Ireland], Working Paper 251, [[Economic and Social Research Institute]], Dublin.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is that with the carbon tax revenue coming into government coffers, it could be directly spent by the government rather than distributed to the population via cheques, and that other kinds of taxation, such as labour taxation, could be decreased correspondingly. It is argued that this would have a positive effect on GDP since there would be a greater incentive for firms to increase employment, and that it would also positively affect social equity, since labour taxes are regressive by nature.

The NGO that developed Cap and Share, Feasta, argues that while it is definitely a good idea to shift the tax burden away from labour and towards capital, a carbon tax is not the optimal instrument for this purpose. Carbon taxes do not establish a predictable level of emissions cuts, unlike a cap, and can be vulnerable to short-term political pressures such as an increase in the price of oil, since a country's tax policy is usually adjusted each year in the annual Budget.   Feasta suggests that if a carbon tax were to be introduced, it would work best in tandem with Cap and Share. The two policies could be used to help countries fine-tune their responses to climate change and [[Peak Oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217174252/http://www.feasta.org/documents/papers/IIEA_Occasional_Paper_4.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feasta also advocates the introduction of a [[land value tax|land-value-based tax]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feasta.org/documents/landhousing/coritax.html&lt;/ref&gt; which they believe could be used as a substitute for taxation on labour and could therefore have a similar effect on the market to a carbon tax.

As the future is not known with certainty, some argue that cap and share has all the drawbacks of quantity-based regulation for a stock pollutant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Weitzman]] (1974), Prices vs Quantities, [[Review of Economic Studies]], 41 (4), 477-491.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of greenhouse gas emissions, the argument goes, price-based regulation (incl. a carbon tax with lump-sum recycling) is more robust to uncertainty and leads to lower welfare losses.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Pizer (1999), The optimal choice of climate change policy in the presence of uncertainty, Resource and Energy Economics, 21, 255-287.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, however, Cap and Share advocates argue that the problem of assuring that specific emissions targets are reached is not properly addressed by using a purely price-based mechanism for emissions reduction. From their perspective, a definite, substantial decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, carried out in an equitable way so that the poor are not adversely affected, is well worth a possible decrease in "welfare" as measured by GDP (a highly problematic instrument for measuring wellbeing&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUaJMNtW6GA&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Athletics competitions.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Competition in sports. A selection of images showing some of the sporting events that are classed as [[sport of athletics|athletics]] competitions.]]

'''Competition''' is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more entities, organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for [[territory (animal)|territory]], a niche, for scarce [[resource]]s, goods, for mates, for [[:wikt:prestige|prestige]], [[Recognition (sociology)|recognition]], for [[award]]s, for group or social status, or for [[leadership]] and [[Profit (economics)|profit]].&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2017. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, pp.1-12. https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307 
&lt;/ref&gt; It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (an example of which is a [[zero-sum game]]).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, K.G., Ferrier, W.J. and Ndofor, H., 2001. Competitive dynamics research: Critique and future directions. Handbook of strategic management, pp.315-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition occurs [[nature|naturally]] between living organisms which co-exist in the same [[natural environment|environment]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"&gt;Keddy, P.A. 2001. ''Competition'', 2nd ed., Kluwer, Dordrecht. 552 p.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, animals compete over water supplies, food, mates, and other [[resource (biology)|biological resources]]. Humans usually compete for food and mates, though when these needs are met deep rivalries often arise over the pursuit of [[wealth]], power, prestige, and [[celebrity|fame]].

Competition is often considered to be the opposite of [[cooperation]], however in the real world, mixtures of cooperation and competition are the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociologyguide.com/basic-concepts/Competition.php Competition], Sociology guide&lt;/ref&gt; Optimal strategies to achieve goals are studied in the branch of mathematics known as [[game theory]].

Competition is also a major tenet of [[market economy|market economies]] and business. It is often associated with business competition as most companies are in competition with at least one other firm over the same group of customers. Also competition inside a company is usually stimulated with the larger purpose of meeting and reaching higher quality of services or improved products that the company may produce or develop.

== Consequences ==
Competition can have both beneficial and detrimental effects. Many evolutionary biologists view inter-species and intra-species competition as the driving force of [[adaptation]], and ultimately of [[evolution]]. However, some biologists disagree, citing competition as a driving force only on a small scale, and citing the larger scale drivers of evolution to be abiotic factors (termed 'Room to Roam').&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–47 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Dawkins]] prefers to think of evolution in terms of competition between single genes, which have the welfare of the organism 'in mind' only insofar as that welfare furthers their own selfish drives for replication (termed the 'selfish gene').

Some [[social Darwinist]]s claim that competition also serves as a mechanism for determining the best-suited group; politically, economically and ecologically. Positively, competition may serve as a form of [[recreation]] or a challenge provided that it is non-hostile. On the negative side, competition can cause injury and loss to the organisms involved, and drain valuable resources and energy. In the human species competition can be expensive on many levels, not only in lives lost to war, physical injuries, and damaged psychological well beings, but also in the health effects from everyday civilian life caused by work stress, long work hours, abusive working relationships, and poor working conditions, that detract from the enjoyment of life, even as such competition results in financial gain for the owners.

== Biology and ecology ==
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Natural selection]] --&gt;
{{Main|Competition (biology)}}
Competition within, between, and among species is one of the most important forces in biology, especially in the field of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt;

Competition between members of a species ("intraspecific") for resources such as [[food]], [[water]], [[Territory (animal)|territory]], and [[sunlight]] may result in an increase in the frequency of a variant of the species best suited for survival and reproduction until its fixation within a population. However, competition among resources also has a strong tendency for diversification between members of the same species, resulting in coexistence of competitive and non-competitive strategies or cycles between low and high competitiveness. Third parties within a species often favour highly competitive strategies leading to species extinction when environmental conditions are harsh ([[evolutionary suicide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldauf|first1=Sebastian A.|last2=Engqvist|first2=Leif|last3=Weissing|first3=Franz J.|title=Diversifying evolution of competitiveness|journal=Nature Communications|date=29 October 2014|volume=5|pages=5233|doi=10.1038/ncomms6233|pmid=25351604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition is also present between species ("interspecific"). When resources are limited, several species may depend on these resources. Thus, each of the species competes with the others to gain access to the resources. As a result, species less suited to compete for the resources may [[extinction|die out]] unless they [[adaptation|adapt]] by character dislocation, for instance. According to [[evolutionary theory]], this competition within and between species for resources plays a significant role in [[natural selection]]. At shorter time scales, competition is also one of the most important factors controlling diversity in ecological communities, but at larger scales expansion and contraction of ecological space is a much more larger factor than competition.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010"/&gt; This is illustrated by living plant communities where asymmetric competition and competitive dominance frequently occur.&lt;ref name="Keddy, P.A 2001"/&gt; Multiple examples of symmetric and asymmetric competition also exist for animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borzée|first1=Amaël|last2=Kim|first2=Jun Young|last3=Jang|first3=Yikweon|title=Asymmetric competition over calling sites in two closely related treefrog species|journal=Scientific Reports|date=7 Sep 2016|volume=6|page=32569|doi=10.1038/srep32569|pmc=5013533|pmid=27599461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research usually focuses on particular sets of strategies known as [[Solution concept|"solution concepts" or "equilibria"]]. A common assumption is that players act rationally. In non-cooperative games, the most famous of these is the [[Nash equilibrium]]. A set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if each represents a best response to the other strategies. If all the players are playing the strategies in a Nash equilibrium, they have no unilateral incentive to deviate, since their strategy is the best they can do given what others are doing.&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-09"&gt;[http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 Game-theoretic model to examine the two tradeoffs in the acquisition of information for a careful balancing act] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524231021/http://www.insead.edu/facultyresearch/research/doc.cfm?did=46503 |date=2013-05-24 }} Research paper [[INSEAD]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GT-F-R-10"&gt;[http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 Options Games: Balancing the trade-off between flexibility and commitment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620053305/http://www.europeanfinancialreview.com/?p=4645 |date=June 20, 2013 }}.

==Economics and business==
{{Main|Competition (economics)}}

Merriam-Webster defines competition in business as "the effort of two or more parties acting independently to secure the business of a third party by offering the most favorable terms".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/competition m-w.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described by [[Adam Smith]] in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' and later economists as allocating productive [[resource]]s to their most highly valued uses and encouraging [[X-inefficiency|efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;[[George J. Stigler]] ([[The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics|[1987]]] 2008). "competition," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000261&amp;q=competition&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=6 Abstract.]&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[microeconomic theory]] distinguished between [[perfect competition]] and [[imperfect competition]], concluding that no system of resource allocation is more efficient than [[perfect competition]]. Competition, according to the theory, causes commercial firms to develop new products, services and technologies, which would give consumers greater selection and better products. The greater selection typically causes lower prices for the products, compared to what the price would be if there was no competition ([[monopoly]]) or little competition ([[oligopoly]]).

However, competition may also lead to wasted (duplicated) effort and to increased [[cost]]s (and prices) in some circumstances. For example, the intense competition for the small number of [[superstar|top jobs in music and movie acting]] leads many aspiring musicians and actors to make substantial investments in training which are not recouped, because only a fraction become successful. Critics have also argued that competition can be destabilizing, particularly competition between certain financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Simkovic, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1924831 ''Competition and Crisis in Mortgage Securitization'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts have also questioned the constructiveness of competition in profitability. It has been argued that competition-oriented objectives are counterproductive to raising revenues and profitability because they limit the options of strategies for firms as well as their ability to offer innovative responses to changes in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/CompOrientPDF%2011-27%20%282%29.pdf |title=The Profitability of Winning |author1=J.

Scott Armstrong |author2=Kesten C. Greene | journal = International Journal of Business | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 116–34 | year = 2007 | issn= 1083-4346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three levels of economic competition have been classified:

* The most narrow form is '''direct competition''' (also called category competition or brand competition), where [[product (business)|products]] which perform the same function compete against each other. For example, one brand of pick-up trucks competes with several other brands of pick-up trucks. Sometimes, two companies are rivals and one adds new products to their line, which leads to the other company distributing the same new things, and in this manner they compete.
* The next form is '''substitute''' or '''indirect competition''', where products which are close substitutes for one another compete. For example, butter competes with margarine, mayonnaise and other various sauces and spreads.
* The broadest form of competition is typically called '''budget competition'''. Included in this category is anything on which the [[consumer]] might want to spend their available [[income|money]]. For example, a family which has $20,000 available may choose to spend it on many different items, which can all be seen as competing with each other for the family's expenditure. This form of competition is also sometimes described as a competition of "share of wallet".

In addition, companies also compete for [[finance|financing]] on the capital markets (equity or debt) in order to generate the necessary cash for their operations. An [[investor]] typically will consider alternative investment opportunities given his risk profile and not only look at companies just competing on product ('''direct competitors'''). Enlarging the investment universe to include '''indirect competitors''' leads to a broader peer universe of comparable, indirectly competing companies.

Competition does not necessarily have to be between companies. For example, business writers sometimes refer to '''internal competition'''. This is competition within companies. The idea was first introduced by [[Alfred Sloan]] at [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] in the 1920s. Sloan deliberately created areas of overlap between divisions of the company so that each division would be competing with the other divisions. For example, the [[Chevrolet]] division would compete with the [[Pontiac]] division for some [[market segment]]s. The competing brands by the same company allowed parts to be designed by one division and shared by several divisions, for example parts designed by Chevrolet would also be used by Pontiac. Also, in 1931, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] initiated a deliberate system of internal brand-versus-brand rivalry. The company was organized around different [[brand]]s, with each brand allocated resources, including a dedicated group of employees willing to champion the brand. Each brand manager was given responsibility for the success or failure of the brand, and compensated accordingly.

Finally, most businesses also encourage competition between individual employees. An example of this is a contest between sales representatives. The sales representative with the highest sales (or the best improvement in sales) over a period of time would gain benefits from the employer. This is also known as '''intra-brand competition.'''

Shalev and Asbjornsen also found that success (i.e. the saving resulted) of [[reverse auction]]s correlated most closely with competition. The literature widely supported the importance of competition as the primary driver of reverse auctions success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1727409 papers.ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings appear to support that argument, as competition correlated strongly with the reverse auction success, as well as with the number of bidders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39032383/Electronic-Reverse-Auction-and-the-Public-Sector-Factors-of-Success-Moshe-E-Shalev-Stee-Asbjorensen |publisher= Shalev Moshe and Asbjornsen Stee |title=Electronic reverse auctions and the public sector – Factors of success |work=Journal of Public Procurement |pages=428–52 |volume=10 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should also be noted that business and economic competition in most [[country|countries]] is often limited or restricted. Competition often is subject to legal restrictions. For example, competition may be legally prohibited, as in the case with a [[government monopoly]] or a [[government-granted monopoly]]. [[Tariffs]], [[subsidies]] or other [[protectionist]] measures may also be instituted by government in order to prevent or reduce competition. Depending on the respective economic policy, pure competition is to a greater or lesser extent regulated by [[competition policy]] and [[competition law]].  Another component of these activities is the discovery process, with instances of higher [[government regulation]]s typically leading to less competitive businesses being launched.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=884&amp;full=1 Competition, Regulation, and the Market Process: An "Austrian" Perspective, Sept. 30, 1982] by [[Israel M. Kirzner]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate===
{{See also|Race to the bottom}}
Competition between countries is quite subtle to detect, but is quite evident in the [[world economy]]. Countries compete to provide the best possible business environment for [[multinational corporations]]. Such competition is evident by the policies undertaken by these countries to educate the future workforce. For example, East Asian economies such as Singapore, Japan and South Korea tend to emphasize education by allocating a large portion of the budget to this sector, and by implementing programmes such as [[gifted education]].

===Law===
{{Main|Competition law}}
[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] building in [[Washington, D.C.]] is home to the influential [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] enforcers of U.S. competition laws]]
Competition [[law]], known in the [[United States]] as antitrust law, has three main functions. First, it prohibits agreements aimed to restrict free trading between business entities and their customers. For example, a [[cartel]] of sports shops who together fix football jersey prices higher than normal is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;''JJB Sports v OFT [2004] CAT 17''&lt;/ref&gt; Second, competition law can ban the existence or abusive behaviour of a firm dominating the market. One case in point could be a software company who through its [[monopoly]] on computer platforms makes consumers use its media player.&lt;ref&gt;in the E.U. side of the saga, see [http://europa.eu.int/jurisp/cgi-bin/gettext.pl?lang=en&amp;num=79958777T1904%20R0201_2&amp;doc=T&amp;ouvert=T&amp;seance=ORD&amp;where=() Case T-201/04] ''Microsoft v. Commission'' Order, 22 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Third, to preserve competitive markets, the law supervises the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of very large corporations. Competition authorities could for instance require that a large packaging company give plastic bottle [[license]]s to competitors before taking over a major [[Polyethylene terephthalate|PET]] producer.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-12/03 P, Commission v. Tetra Laval&lt;/ref&gt; In this case (as in all three), competition law aims to protect the [[consumer welfare|welfare of consumers]] by ensuring business must compete for its share of the [[market economy]].

In recent decades, competition law has also been sold as good medicine to provide better [[public services]], traditionally funded by [[tax]] payers and administered by [[Democracy|democratically]] accountable [[government]]s. Hence competition law is closely connected with the law on deregulation of access to markets, providing state aids and subsidies, the [[privatisation]] of state-owned assets and the use of independent sector regulators, such as the United Kingdom telecommunications watchdog [[Ofcom]]. Behind the practice lies the theory, which over the last fifty years has been dominated by [[neo-classical economics]]. Markets are seen as the most efficient method of allocating resources, although sometimes [[market failure|they fail]], and regulation becomes necessary to protect the ideal market model. Behind the theory lies the history, reaching back further than the [[Roman Empire]]. The business practices of market traders, [[guilds]] and governments have always been subject to scrutiny and sometimes severe sanctions. Since the twentieth century, competition law has become global. The two largest, most organised and influential systems of competition regulation are [[United States antitrust law]] and [[European Community competition law]]. The respective national authorities, the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] (DOJ) and the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) in the United States and the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|European Commission's Competition Directorate General]] (DGCOMP) have formed international support and enforcement networks. Competition law is growing in importance every day, which warrants for its careful study.

== Trade ==

Competition is also found in [[trade]]. For nations, as well as firms it is important to understand trade dynamics in order to market their goods and services effectively in international markets. [[Balance of trade]] can be considered a crude, but widely used proxy for international competitiveness across levels: [[country]], [[industry]] or even [[business|firm]]. Research data hints that exporting firms have a higher survival rate and achieve greater employment growth compared with non-exporters.

Using a simple concept to measure heights that firms can climb may help improve execution of strategies. International competitiveness can be measured on several criteria but few are as flexible and versatile to be applied across levels as Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://kmomaya.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/ijm_pranusha_bhokray_momaya_export_competitiveness_pre-publication_review.pdf | title = Export Competitiveness of Select Firms from India: Glimpse of Trends and Implications |author1=Manthri P. |author2=Bhokray K. |author3=Momaya K. S. | journal = Indian Journal of Marketing | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 7–13 | year = 2015 | doi=10.17010/ijom/2015/v45/i5/79934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
Competition is also found in [[politics]]. In [[democracy|democracies]], an [[election]] is a competition for an elected office. In other words, two or more candidates strive and compete against one another to attain a position of power. The winner gains the seat of the elected office for a predefined period of time, towards the end of which another election is usually held to determine the next holder of the office.

In addition, there is inevitable competition inside a government. Because several offices are appointed, potential candidates compete against the others in order to gain the particular office. Departments may also compete for a limited amount of resources, such as for [[budget|funding]]. Finally, where there are [[party systems]], elected leaders of different parties will ultimately compete against the other parties for [[law]]s, [[funding]] and [[political power|power]].

Finally, competition also exists between [[government]]s. Each [[country]] or [[nationality]] struggles for world dominance, power, or [[military]] strength. For example, the [[United States]] competed against the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]] for world power, and the two also struggled over the different types of government (in these cases [[representative democracy]] and [[communism]]). The result of this type of competition often leads to worldwide tensions, and may sometimes erupt into [[war]]fare.

== Sports ==
{{Anchor|Competitive sports}}&lt;!-- Previous title. 2013-07-01 --&gt;
[[File:US Olympic Committee Headquarters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Olympic Committee]]'s headquarters in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. The [[Olympic Games]] are regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.]]
While some [[sport]]s and [[game]]s (such as [[fishing]] or [[hiking]]) have been viewed as primarily recreational, most sports are considered competitive. The majority involve competition between two or more persons (sometimes using [[horse racing|horses]] or [[auto racing|cars]]). For example, in a game of [[basketball]], two teams compete against one another to determine who can score the most points. When there is no set reward for the winning team, many players gain a sense of [[pride]]. In addition, extrinsic rewards may also be given. Athletes, besides competing against other humans, also compete against [[nature]] in sports such as [[whitewater kayaking]] or [[mountaineering]], where the goal is to reach a destination, with only natural barriers impeding the process. A regularly scheduled (for instance annual) competition meant to determine the "best" competitor of that cycle is called a [[championship]].
[[File:Citi Field Day.jpg|thumb|left|[[Baseball]], a competitive sport]]
Competitive sports are governed by codified rules agreed upon by the participants. Violating these rules is considered to be [[unfair competition]]. Thus, sports provide artificial (not natural) competition; for example, competing for control of a ball, or defending territory on a playing field is not an innate biological factor in humans. Athletes in sports such as [[gymnastics]] and competitive [[Diving (sport)|diving]] compete against each other in order to come closest to a conceptual ideal of a perfect performance, which incorporates measurable criteria and standards which are translated into numerical ratings and scores by appointed judges.

Sports competition is generally broken down into three categories: '''individual''' sports, such as [[archery]]; '''dual''' sports, such as [[tennis|doubles tennis]], and '''team''' sports competition, such as [[cricket]] or [[football]]. While most sports competitions are recreation, there exist several [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major]] and [[minor league|minor]] professional sports leagues throughout the world. The [[Olympic Games]], held every four years, is usually regarded as the international pinnacle of sports competition.

== Education ==
Competition is a major factor in education. On a global scale, national education systems, intending to bring out the best in the next generation, encourage competitiveness among students through [[scholarships]]. Countries such as England and Singapore have [[special education]] programmes which cater for specialist students, prompting charges of [[academic elitism]]. Upon receipt of their academic results, students tend to compare their grades to see who is better. In severe cases, the pressure to perform in some countries is so high that it can result in stigmatization of intellectually deficient students, or even suicide as a consequence of failing the exams; Japan being a prime example (see [[Education in Japan]]). This has resulted in critical re-evaluation of examinations as a whole by educationalists {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Critics of competition as a motivating factor in education systems, such as [[Alfie Kohn]], assert that competition actually has a net negative influence on the achievement levels of students, and that it "turns all of us into losers" (Kohn 1986). Economist [[Richard Layard]] has commented on the harmful effects, stating "people feel that they are under a great deal of pressure. They feel that their main objective in life is to do better than other people. That is certainly what young people are being taught in school every day. And it's not a good basis for a society."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13052639 ''Group dedicated to happiness launched in UK'', BBC video, April 12, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other studies such as the [[Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking]] show that the effect of competition on students depends on each individual's level of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]]. Students with a high level of agency thrive on competition, are self-motivated, and are willing to risk failure. Compared to their counterparts who are low in agency, these students are more likely to be flexible, adaptable and creative as adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Literature ==
Literary competitions, such as contests sponsored by [[literary journals]], publishing houses and theaters, have increasingly become a means for aspiring writers to gain recognition. Awards for fiction include those sponsored by the ''[[Missouri Review]]'', ''[[Boston Review]]'', ''[[Indiana Review]]'', ''[[North American Review]]'' and ''[[Southwest Review]]''. The [[Edward Albee|Albee]] Award, sponsored by the Yale Drama Series, is among the most prestigious playwriting awards.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

== Consumer competitions - games of luck or skill==
{{further|Game of chance}}
In Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, competitions or lottos are the equivalent of what are commonly known as [[sweepstakes]] in the United States. The correct technical name for Australian consumer competitions is a trade promotion lottery or lottos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olgr.nsw.gov.au/promos_trade_promos.asp |title=OLGR &gt; Promotions and competitions &gt; Trade promotion lotteries |publisher=Olgr.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition or trade promotion lottery entrants enter to win a prize or prizes, hence many entrants are all in competition, or competing for a limited number of prizes.

A trade promotion lottery or competition is a free entry lottery run to promote goods or services supplied by a business. An example is where you purchase goods or services and then given the chance to enter into the lottery and possibly win a prize. A trade promotion lottery can be called a lotto, competition, contest, sweepstake, or giveaway.

Such competitions can be games of luck (randomly drawn) or skill (judged on an entry question or submission), or possibly a combination of both.

People that enjoy entering competitions are known as compers. Many compers attend annual national conventions. In 2012 over 100 members of the online competitions community of lottos.com.au from around Australia met on the Gold Coast, Queensland to discuss competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lottos.com.au/competitions/viewthreadlite.php?tid=275933 |title=NATIONAL LOTTOS MEET GOLD COAST 16TH SEPTEMBER 2012 :) |publisher=Lottos.com.au |date= |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amv7jMwbHIw&amp;t=6s |title=Comp Queens |publisher=Aca.ninemsn.com.au |date=2012-09-21 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study==
Competition has been studied in several fields, including [[psychology]], [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]]. Social [[psychologist]]s, for instance, study the nature of competition. They investigate the natural urge of competition and its circumstances. They also study [[group dynamics]], to detect how competition emerges and what its effects are. [[Sociologist]]s, meanwhile, study the effects of competition on society as a whole. In addition, [[anthropologist]]s study the history and prehistory of competition in various cultures. They also investigate how competition manifested itself in various [[culture|cultural]] settings in the past, and how competition has developed over time.

==Competitiveness==
{{Main|Competitiveness}}
Many [[philosopher]]s and [[psychologist]]s have identified a trait in most living organisms which can drive the particular organism to compete. This trait, called competitiveness, is viewed as an innate [[biology|biological]] [[Trait (biological)|trait]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}which coexists along with the urge for survival. Competitiveness, or the inclination to compete, though, has become synonymous with aggressiveness and ambition in the [[English language]]. More advanced [[civilization]]s integrate aggressiveness and competitiveness into their [[Social interaction|interactions]], as a way to distribute resources and adapt. Many plants compete with neighboring ones for sunlight.

However, [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and others have argued that as one ascends the evolutionary hierarchy, competitiveness (the survival instinct) becomes less innate, and more a learned behavior.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The same could be said for co-operation: in humans, at least, both co-operation and competition are considered learned behaviors{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, because the human species learns to adapt to environmental pressures. Consequently, if survival requires competitive behaviors, the individual will compete, and if survival requires co-operative behaviors, the individual will co-operate. In the case of humans, therefore, aggressiveness may be an innate characteristic, but a person need not be competitive at the same time, for instance when scaling a cliff. On the other hand, humans seem also to have a nurturing instinct, to protect newborns and the weak. While that does not necessitate co-operative behavior, it does help.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The term also applies to [[econometrics]]. Here, it is a comparative measure of the ability and performance of a firm or sub-sector to sell and produce/supply goods and/or services in a given market. The two academic bodies of thought on the assessment of competitiveness are the '''Structure Conduct Performance Paradigm''' and the more contemporary '''New Empirical Industrial Organisation''' model. Predicting changes in the competitiveness of business sectors is becoming an integral and explicit step in public policymaking. Within capitalist economic systems, the drive of enterprises is to maintain and improve their own competitiveness.

=== Hypercompetitiveness ===
The tendency toward extreme, unhealthy competition has been termed '''hypercompetitiveness'''. This concept originated in [[Karen Horney]]'s theories on [[neurosis]]; specifically, the highly aggressive personality type which is characterized as "moving against people". In her view, some people have a need to compete and win at all costs as a means of maintaining their [[self-esteem|self-worth]]. These individuals are likely to turn any activity into a competition, and they will feel threatened if they find themselves losing. Researchers have found that men and women who score high on the trait of hypercompetitiveness are more [[Narcissism|narcissistic]] and less psychologically healthy than those who score low on the trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ryckman, R.

[[Karl Marx]] insisted that "the capitalist system fosters competition and egoism in all its members and thoroughly undermines all genuine forms of community".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
It promotes a "climate of competitive egoism and individualism", with competition for jobs and competition between employees; Marx said competition between workers exceeds that demonstrated by company owners.&lt;ref name="allenb"&gt;
Allen E. Buchanan, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=j1AOAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Marx and justice: the radical critique of liberalism]'', [[Taylor &amp; Francis]], 1982
&lt;/ref&gt; He also points out that competition separates individuals from one another and while concentration of workers and development of better communication alleviate this, they are not a decision.&lt;ref name="allenb"/&gt;

===Freud===
[[Sigmund Freud]] explained competition as a primal dilemma in which all infants find themselves. The infant competes with other family members for the attention and affection of the parent of the opposite sex or the primary caregiving parent. During this time, a boy develops a deep fear that the father (the son's prime rival) will punish him for these feelings of desire for the mother, by castrating  him. Girls develop penis envy towards all males. The girl’s envy is rooted in the biologic fact that, without a penis, she cannot sexually possess mother, as the infantile id demands, resultantly, the girl redirects her desire for sexual union upon father in competitive rivalry with her mother. This constellation of feelings is known as [[Oedipus Complex]] ( after the Greek Mythology figure who accidentally killed his father and married his mother). This is associated with the [[phallic stage]] of childhood development where intense primal emotions of competitive rivalry with (usually) the parent of the same sex are rampant and create a crisis that must be negotiated successfully for healthy psychological development to proceed. Unresolved Oedipus complex competitiveness issues can lead to lifelong neuroses manifesting in various ways related to an overdetermined relationship to competition.

===Mahatma Gandhi===
[[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] speaks of egoistic competition.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"&gt;
Parmeshwari Dayal, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FemHmw5fGQUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gandhian Theory of Social Reconstruction], Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; For him, such qualities glorified and/or left unbridled, can lead to violence, conflict, discord and destructiveness. For Gandhi, competition comes from the ego, and therefore society must be based on mutual love, cooperation and sacrifice for the well-being of humanity.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt; In the society desired by Gandhi, each individual will cooperate and serve for the welfare of others and people will share each other's joys, sorrows and achievements as a norm of a social life. For him, in a non-violent society, competition does not have a place and this should become realized with more people making the personal choice to have fewer tendencies toward egoism and selfishness.&lt;ref name="Gandhi"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">[[File:Brahmi Kya (Ka-Ya) conjunct consonant.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|"Kya" (Ka+Ya) conjunct consonant in the [[Brahmi script]], consisting in the vertical assembly of consonants "Ka" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]] and "Ya" [[File:Brahmi y.svg|12px]]. Used in the spelling of the word "[[Shakyas|Shakyamuni]]" to designate the [[Buddha]], [[Lumbini|Rummindei pillar]] of [[Ashoka]] (circa 250 BCE).]]
'''Conjunct consonants''' are a type of letters, used for example in [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] or modern [[Devanagari]], to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}. Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel "a" (as with "k" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]], pronounced "ka" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an [[diacritic]] (as with "ki" [[File:Brahmi letter Ki.svg|12px]] in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with "kya" [[File:Brahmi Kya.jpg|12px]], formed with the consonants k [[File:Brahmi k.svg|10px]] and y [[File:Brahmi y.svg|10px]] assembled verticaly).&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.

In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael C. |title=A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi |date=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120805088 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). 

Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tuṅga |first1=Sudhāṃśu Śekhara |title=Bengali and Other Related Dialects of South Assam |date=1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170995883 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRRYBHQvXdsC&amp;pg=PA163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Balinese script|Balinese]], conjunct consonants are called ''Haksara Wrehastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shadeg |first1=Norbert |title=Tuttle Balinese-English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9781462910786 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ktBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conjunct consonant are not limited to Brahmic languages, and can be seen in [[Navajo language|Navajo]] for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McDonough |first1=J.

== Controversy ==

Some [[Transgender rights|trans rights activists]] have described this as [[transphobic]] [[social exclusion|exclusion]]. In 2014, [[Julia Serano]] wrote that "when the overwhelming majority of [[cisgender|cis]] [[Dyke (slang)|dykes]] date and fuck cis women, but are not open to, or are even turned off by, the idea of dating or fucking trans women, how is that not transphobic?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-struggle-to-find-trans-love-in-san-francisco|title=The Struggle To Find Trans Love In San Francisco|website=thedailybeast.com|date=14 January 2014|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cisgender]] lesbian Andrea Zanin wrote in 2013 that "a lot of cis and otherwise non-trans gals need to ... take the opportunity to really examine how much of our desire rests on [[cissexism]], and how much of the sexual culture we create and consume excludes trans women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transadvocate.com/if-trans-women-arent-welcome-neither-am-i_n_10232.htm|title=If trans women aren't welcome, neither am I|website=transadvocate.com|date=25 September 2013|accessdate=21 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other trans activists consider the concept problematic. Journalist [[Paris Lees]] wrote in 2015 that "there's a huge difference between denying someone a job versus not desiring someone sexually. Sexual attraction may be the one area that it's OK to 'discriminate' in—after all, it's up to you who you want to fuck—but you don't need to be a dick about your preference."&lt;ref name="paris" /&gt; Meanwhile, a 2013 [[Everyday Feminism]] article, written by an anonymous trans woman, stated that "the 'cotton ceiling' should be considered an unhelpful concept for this type of discussion and should be set aside by trans activists moving forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/05/getting-with-girls-like-us/|title=Getting With Girls Like Us: A Radical Guide To Dating Trans Women For Cis Women|website=everydayfeminism.com|date=12 May 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is almost universally condemned by [[Feminist views on transgender topics|anti-trans activists]]. Academic [[Sheila Jeffreys]] wrote in her 2014 book "Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism" that '[t]he campaign relies on guilt-tripping, in which women who resist are accused of transphobia or transmisogyny, in an attempt to induce them to admit unwanted penises to their bodies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kLhwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4AwdJgbb6J&amp;sig=QLAzz2Shhs-MFvujIEQmAcpWWHQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwijsZ_gvObYAhVRZlAKHQiFCIk4HhDoATAHegQIChAB#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton+ceiling+trans&amp;f=false|title=Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism|first=Sheila|last=Jeffreys|date=24 April 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=22 January 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, while in the same year blogger Julian Vigo wrote on [[CounterPunch]] that "[w]hile many are sympathetic to the fact that trans women wish to be accepted within social circles as women, they find it preposterous that lesbians are now being asked to deny their sexuality as proof of their solidarity with trans women, least (sic) they be labelled a bigot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/07/the-left-hand-of-darkness/|title=The Left Hand of Darkness|website=counterpunch.org|date=7 June 2013|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cultural icon''' is an [[cultural artifact|artifact]] that is identified by members of a culture as representative of that culture. The process of identification is subjective, and "icons" are judged by the extent to which they can be seen as an authentic proxy of that culture. When individuals perceive a cultural icon, they relate it to their general perceptions of the cultural identity represented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grayson|first=Kent|last2=Martinec|first2=Radan|date=2004-09-01|title=Consumer Perceptions of Iconicity and Indexicality and Their Influence on Assessments of Authentic Market Offerings|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article-abstract/31/2/296/1824949/Consumer-Perceptions-of-Iconicity-and-Indexicality|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|volume=31|issue=2|pages=296–312|doi=10.1086/422109|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural icons can also be identified as an authentic representation of the practices of one culture by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Motley|first=Carol M.|last2=Henderson|first2=Geraldine Rosa|date=2008-03-01|title=The global hip-hop Diaspora: Understanding the culture|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296307001609|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Cross-Cultural Business Research|volume=61|issue=3|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2007.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[mass media|media]], many items and persons of [[popular culture]] have been called "iconic" despite their lack of durability; and the term "[[pop icon]]" is often now used. Some commentators believe that the word is overused or misused.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3713610.html Heard about the famous icon? We have - far too often], ''The Independent'' (London), January 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

The values, norms and ideals represented by a cultural icon vary both among people who subscribe to it, and more widely among other people who may interpret cultural icons as symbolising quite different values. Thus an [[apple pie]] is a cultural icon of the [[United States]], but its significance varies among Americans.

National icons can become targets for those opposing or criticising a regime, for example, crowds destroying statues of Lenin in Eastern Europe after the fall of communism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2013/dec/09/smashing-statues-sweetest-revenge-protesters-lenin-kiev|publisher=Guardian|date=December 9, 2013|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|title=Why smashing statues can be the sweetest revenge}}&lt;/ref&gt; or burning the [[American flag]] to protest US actions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/14/us-film-protests-idUSBRE88D0O320120914|publisher=Reuters|date=September 14, 2012|first=ulf|last=Laessing|title=Anti-American fury sweeps Middle East over film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious icon]]s can also become cultural icons in societies where religion and culture are deeply entwined, such as representations of the [[Madonna_(art)|Madonna]] in societies with a strong Catholic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating Ourselves, African Americans and Hispanic Americans on popular culture and religious expression|editors=Anthony B Pinn and Benjamin Valentin|publisher=Duke University Press|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Describing something as ''iconic'' or as an ''icon'' has become very common in the popular media. This has drawn criticism from some: a writer in ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' calls "iconic" "a word that makes my flesh creep", a word "pressed into service to describe almost anything."&lt;ref name="LDP"&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191891103.html Let's hear it for the Queen's English], ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Christian Examiner]]'' nominates "iconic" in its list of overused words, finding over 18,000 "iconic" references in news stories alone, with another 30,000 for "icon", including its use for ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]''.&lt;ref name="CE"&gt;[http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html Modern word usage amazingly leaves us yearning for gay, old times] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225101358/http://www.christianexaminer.com/Articles/Articles%20Aug09/Art_Aug09_oped2.html |date=2010-12-25 }}, ''[[Christian Examiner]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="78638">In [[mathematics]], '''differential forms on a Riemann surface''' are an important special case of the general theory of [[differential forms]] on [[smooth manifold]]s, distinguished by the fact that the [[conformal structure]]  on the [[Riemann surface]] intrinsically defines a [[Hodge star operator]] on 1-forms (or differentials) without specifying a [[Riemannian metric]]. This allows the use of [[Hilbert space]] techniques for studying function theory on the Riemann surface and in particular for the construction of harmonic and holomorphic differentials with prescribed singularities. These methods were first used by {{harvtxt|Hilbert|1909}} in his variational approach to the Dirichlet principle, making rigorous the arguments proposed by [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]]. Later {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}} found a direct approach using his method of orthogonal projection, a precursor of the modern theory of [[elliptic differential operator]]s and [[Sobolev space]]s. These techniques were originally applied to prove the [[uniformization theorem]] and its generalization to [[planar Riemann surface]]s. Later they supplied the analytic foundations for the [[Hodge theory|harmonic integrals]] of {{harvtxt|Hodge|1940}}. This article covers general results on differential forms on a Riemann surface that do not rely on any choice of [[Riemannian manifold|Riemannian structure]].

==Hodge star on 1-forms==
On a Riemann surface the [[Hodge star]] is defined on 1-forms by the local formula

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ \star(p\,dx + q\, dy) =  -q\,dx + p\, dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

It is well-defined because it is invariant under [[holomorphic]] changes of coordinate.

Indeed, if {{nowrap|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is holomorphic as a function of {{nowrap|1=''w'' = ''u'' + ''iv''}},
then by the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]] {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''y''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''y''&lt;sub&gt;''u''&lt;/sub&gt; = –''x''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. In the new coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{p\,dx + q\, dy = (px_u + q y_u)du + (px_v+qy_v)dv=p_1 du + q_1 dv,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{-q_1 \,du + p_1 \,dv= -(px_v+qy_v)du + (px_u + q y_u)dv = -q(x_u du + x_v dv) + p(y_u du + y_vdv) = -q\,dx + p\, dy,}&lt;/math&gt;

proving the claimed invariance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that for 1-forms {{nowrap|1=''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx'' + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''dy''}} and {{nowrap|1=''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''dx'' + ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''dy''}}

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\omega_1 \wedge \star \omega_2 = (p_1p_2 + q_1q_2)\, dx\wedge dy =  \omega_2 \wedge \star \omega_1.}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular if {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\omega \wedge \star \omega =(p^2+q^2) \, dx\wedge dy.}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that in standard coordinates

:&lt;math&gt; \star dz = -i dz,\,\, \star d\overline{z} = i d\overline{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Recalling that

:&lt;math&gt;{\partial\over \partial z} = {1\over 2}\left({\partial \over \partial x} - i {\partial \over \partial y}\right),\,\,\, {\partial \over\partial \overline{z}} =
{1\over 2} \left({\partial \over\partial x} +i {\partial \over\partial y}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; df= f_z \, dz + f_{\overline{z}}\, d\overline{z} = \partial f + \bar{\partial}f.&lt;/math&gt;

The decomposition &lt;math&gt;d = \partial  + \bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the choice of local coordinate. The 1-forms with only a &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; component are called (1,0) forms; those with only a &lt;math&gt;d\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt; component are called (0,1) forms. The operators &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\overline{\partial}&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[Complex differential form#Dolbeault operators|Dolbeault operators]].

It follows that
 
:&lt;math&gt; \star df=  -i\partial f + i\bar{\partial}f.&lt;/math&gt;

The Dolbeault operators can similarly be defined on 1-forms and as zero on 2-forms. They have the properties

:&lt;math&gt;d=\partial+\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^2=\bar{\partial}^2=\partial\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\partial=0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Poincaré lemma==
On a Riemann surface the [[Poincaré lemma]] states that every closed 1-form or 2-form is locally exact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Napier|Ramachandran|2011|pages=443–444}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if ''ω'' is a smooth 1-form with {{nowrap|1=''dω'' = 0}} then in some open neighbourhood of a given point there is a smooth function ''f'' such that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} in that neighbourhood; and for any smooth 2-form Ω there is a smooth 1-form ''ω'' defined in some open neighbourhood of a given point such that {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''dω''}} in that neighbourhood.
 
If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} is a closed 1-form on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}}, then {{nowrap|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. If {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} then {{nowrap|1=''p'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{nowrap|1=''q'' = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''}}.  Then {{nowrap|1=''h'' = ''f'' − ''g''}} must satisfy {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}} and {{nowrap|1=''h''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''q'' − ''g''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The right hand side here is independent of ''x'' since its partial derivative with respect to ''x'' is 0. So

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{h(x,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds - g(a,y)=\int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds,}&lt;/math&gt;

and hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{f(x,y)=\int_a^x p(t,y)\, dt + \int_c^y q(a,s)\, ds.}&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''r'' ''dx'' ∧ ''dy''}} then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''d''(''f'' ''dx'' + ''g'' ''dy'')}} with {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''r''}}. Thus a solution is given by {{nowrap|1=''f'' = 0}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{g(x,y)=\int_a^x r(t,y) \, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Comment on differential forms with compact support.''' Note that if ''ω'' has compact support, so vanishes outside some smaller rectangle {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;''b''}} and {{nowrap|''c'' &lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''}}, then the same is true for the solution ''f''(''x'',''y''). So the Poincaré lemma for 1-forms holds with this additional conditions of compact support.

A similar statement is true or 2-forms; but, since there is some choices for the solution, a little more care has to be taken in making those choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|2011|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact if Ω has compact support on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}} and if furthermore {{nowrap|1=∬ Ω = 0}}, then {{nowrap|1=Ω = ''dω''}} with ''ω'' a 1-form of compact support on {{nowrap|(''a'',''b'') × (''c'',''d'')}}. Indeed, Ω must have support in some smaller rectangle {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|''a'' &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;''b''}} and {{nowrap|''c'' &lt; ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''d''}}. So {{nowrap|''r''(''x'', ''y'')}} vanishes for {{nowrap|''x'' ≤ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''x'' ≥ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and for {{nowrap|''y'' ≤ ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{nowrap|''y'' ≥ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Let ''h''(''y'') be a smooth function supported in (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) with {{math|1=∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''h''(''t'') ''dt'' = 1}}. Set {{math|1=''k''(''x'') = ∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''r''(''x'',''y'') ''dy''}}: it is a smooth function supported in  (''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). Hence {{nowrap|1=''R''(''x'',''y'') = ''r''(''x'',''y'') − ''k''(''x'')''h''(''y'')}} is smooth and supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. It now satisfies {{math|1=∫{{su|b=''c''|p=''d''}} ''R''(''x'',''y'') ''dy'' ≡ 0}}. Finally set

:&lt;math&gt;P(x,y)=\int_c^y R(x,y) dy,\,\,\, Q(x,y)=h(y)\int_a^x k(s) \, ds.&lt;/math&gt;

Both ''P'' and ''Q'' are smooth and supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with {{nowrap|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''}} and {{nowrap|1=''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'',''y'') = ''k''(''x'')''h''(''y'')}}. Hence {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = −''P'' ''dx'' + ''Q'' ''dy''}} is a smooth 1-form supported in {{nowrap|(''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) × (''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} with

:&lt;math&gt;d\omega = (Q_x + P_y)\,dx \wedge dy = r \,dx \wedge dy =\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

==Integration of 2-forms==
If Ω is a continuous 2-form of compact support on a Riemann surface ''X'', its support ''K'' can be covered by finitely many coordinate charts ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and there is a partition of unity χ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of smooth non-negative functions with compact support such that ∑ χ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 on a neighbourhood of ''K''. Then the integral of Ω  is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_X \Omega = \sum \int_{X} \chi_i\Omega= \sum \int_{U_i} \chi_i \Omega,}&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral over ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has its usual definition in local coordinates. The integral is independent of the choices here.

If Ω has the local representation ''f''(''x'',''y'') ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'', then |Ω| is the density |''f''(''x'',''y'')| ''dx'' ∧ ''dy'', which is well defined and satisfies |∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω| ≤ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|. If Ω is a non-negative continuous density, not necessarily of compact support, its integral is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_X \Omega =\sup_{0\le \psi \le 1,\, \psi\in C_c(X)} \int_X \psi \Omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

If Ω is any continuous 2-form it is integrable if  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω| &lt; ∞. In this case, if ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  |Ω| = lim ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|, then ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω can be defined as lim ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω. The integrable continuous 2-forms form a complex normed space with norm ||Ω||&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; |Ω|.

==Integration of 1-forms along paths==
If ''ω'' is a 1-form on a Riemann surface ''X'' and ''γ''(''t'') for {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}} is a smooth path in ''X'', then the mapping ''γ'' induces a 1-form ''γ''∗''ω'' on [''a'',''b'']. The integral of ''ω'' along ''γ'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = \int_a^b \gamma^{*} \omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition extends to piecewise smooth paths ''γ'' by dividing the path up into the finitely many segments on which it is smooth. In local coordinates if {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''p'' ''dx'' + ''q'' ''dy''}} and {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''t'') = (''x''(''t''),''y''(''t''))}} then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\gamma^* \omega= p(\gamma(t)) \dot{x}(t) \, dt + q(\gamma(t))\dot{y}(t)\, dt,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega= \int_a^b p(\gamma(t)) \dot{x}(t) \, dt + q(\gamma(t))\dot{y}(t)\, dt.}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that if the 1-form ''ω'' is exact on some connected open set ''U'', so that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''df''}} for some smooth function ''f'' on ''U'' (unique up to a constant), and ''γ''(''t''), {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ ''t'' ≤ ''b''}}, is a smooth path in ''U'', then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega =\int_a^b d(f(\gamma(t)) = f(\gamma(b)) - f(\gamma(a)).}&lt;/math&gt;

This depends only on the difference of the values of ''f'' at the endpoints of the curve, so is independent of the choice of ''f''. By the Poincaré lemma, every closed 1-form is locally exact, so this allows ∫&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt; ω to be computed as a sum of differences of this kind and for the integral of closed 1-forms to be extended to continuous paths:

'''Monodromy theorem.''' If ''ω'' is a closed 1-form, the integral {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}} can be extended to any continuous path ''γ''(''t''), {{nowrap|''a'' ≤ t ≤ ''b''}} so that it is invariant under any [[homotopy]] of paths keeping the end points fixed.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=151–158}}
*{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=272–275}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
::In fact, the image of ''γ'' is compact, so can be covered by finitely many connected open sets ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on each of which ω can be written ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some smooth function ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, unique up to a constant.&lt;ref&gt;It is not assumed that if two ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;'s intersect then their intersection is connected, as is the case for disks in the plane. Note, however, that if the ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; were chosen to be small geodesic disks for a conformal Riemannian metric, locally of the form {{nowrap|1=''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''f''(''z'') {{abs|''dz''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then any non-empty intersection of finitely many ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; would be [[geodesically convex]] and hence connected; see {{harvnb|do Carmo|1976|pages=303–305}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may be assumed that [''a'',''b''] is broken up into finitely many closed intervals {{nowrap|1=''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = [''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} with {{nowrap|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a''}} and {{nowrap|1=''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''b''}} so that {{nowrap|1=''γ''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊂ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. From the above if ''γ'' is piecewise smooth,

:::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = \sum \int_{\gamma|_{K_i}} \omega= \sum \int_{K_i} d(f_i\circ \gamma) =\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(\gamma(t_i)) - f_i(\gamma(t_{i-1}))=
f_n(\gamma(b)) - f_1(\gamma(b)) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} [f_i(\gamma(t_i)) - f_{i+1}(\gamma(t_i))].}&lt;/math&gt;

::Now ''γ''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) lies in the open set {{nowrap|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, hence in a connected open component ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The difference {{nowrap|1=''g''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=''dg''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, so is a constant ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; independent of ''γ''. Hence

:::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_\gamma \omega = f_n(\gamma(b)) - f_1(\gamma(a)) + \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} c_i.}&lt;/math&gt;

::The formula on the right hand side also makes sense if ''γ'' is just continuous on [''a'',''b''] and can be used to define {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The definition is independent of choices: for the curve ''γ'' can be uniformly approximated by piecewise smooth curves ''δ'' so close that {{nowrap|''δ''(''K''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) ⊂ ''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for all ''i''; the formula above then equals {{nowrap|∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}} and shows the integral is independent of the choice of ''δ''. The same argument shows that the definition is also invariant under small homotopies fixing endpoints; by compactness, it is therefore invariant under any homotopy fixing endpoints.

The same argument shows that a homotopy between closed continuous loops does not change their integrals over closed 1-forms. Since {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' = ''f''(''γ''(''b'')) − ''f''(''γ''(''a''))}}, the integral of an exact form over a closed loop vanishes. 
Conversely if the integral of a closed 1-form ''ω'' over any closed loop vanishes, then the 1-form must be exact.

::Indeed a function ''f''(''z'') can be defined on ''X'' by fixing a point ''w'', taking any path ''δ'' from ''w'' to ''z'' and setting {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The assumption implies that ''f'' is independent of the path. To check that {{nowrap|1=''df'' = ''ω''}}, it suffices to check this locally. Fix ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and take a path ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; from ''w'' to ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the Poincaré lemma implies that {{nowrap|1=''ω'' = ''dg''}} for some smooth function ''g'' defined in a neighbourhood of ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a path from ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to ''z'', then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' + ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' + ''g''(''z'') − ''g''(''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, so ''f'' differs from ''g'' by a constant near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence {{nowrap|1=''df'' = ''dg'' = ''ω''}} near ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

A closed 1-form is exact if and only if its integral around any piecewise smooth or continuous Jordan curve vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In fact the integral is already known to vanish for an exact form, so it suffices to show that if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = 0}} for all piecewise smooth closed Jordan curves ''γ'' then {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = 0}} for all closed continuous curves ''γ''. Let ''γ'' be a closed continuous curve. The image of ''γ'' can be covered by finitely many opens on which ''ω'' is exact and this data can be used to define the integral on ''γ''. Now recursively replace ''γ'' by smooth segments between successive division points on the curve so that the resulting curve ''δ'' has only finitely many intersection points and passes through each of these only twice. This curve can be broken up as a superposition of finitely many piecewise smooth Jordan curves. The integral over each of these is zero, so their sum, the integral over ''δ'', is also zero. By construction the integral over ''δ'' equals the integral over ''γ'', which therefore vanishes.

The above argument also shows that given a continuous Jordan curve ''γ''(''t''), there is a finite set of simple smooth Jordan curves ''γ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') with nowhere zero derivatives such that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_\gamma \omega = \sum_i \int_{\gamma_i} \omega&lt;/math&gt;

for any closed 1-form ''ω''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=290–292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus to check exactness of a closed form it suffices to show that the vanishing of the integral around any  regular closed curve, i.e. a simple smooth Jordan curve with nowhere vanishing derivative.

The same methods show that any continuous loop on a Riemann surface is homotopic to a smooth loop with nowhere zero derivative.

==Green–Stokes formula==
{{see also|Green's theorem|Stokes' theorem}}
If ''U'' is a bounded region in the complex plane with boundary consisting of piecewise smooth curves and ''ω'' is a 1-form defined on a neighbourhood of the closure of ''U'', then the [[Green's theorem|Green–Stokes formula]] states that

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial U} \omega = \int_U d\omega .&lt;/math&gt;

In particular if ''ω'' is a 1-form of compact support on '''C''' then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\bf C} d\omega = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

since the formula may be applied to a large disk containing the support of ω.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=251–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar formulas hold on a Riemann surface ''X'' and can be deduced from the classical formulas using [[partition of unity|partitions of unity]].&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Weyl|1955|pages=72–78}}
*{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=158–163}}
*{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=284–290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus if {{nowrap|''U'' ⊂ ''X''}} is a connected region with compact closure and piecewise smooth boundary ∂''U'' and ''ω'' is a 1-form defined on a neighbourhood of the closure of ''U'', then the '''Green–Stokes formula''' states that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_{\partial U} \omega = \int_U d\omega.}&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''ω'' is a 1-form of compact support on ''X'' then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{X} d\omega = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

To prove the second formula take a partition of unity ''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; supported in coordinate charts covering the support of ''ω''. Then {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''dω'' = ∑ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''ψ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'') = 0}}, by the planar result. Similarly to prove the first formula it suffices to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\int_{\partial U} \psi\omega = \int_U d(\psi\omega)}&lt;/math&gt;

when ''ψ'' is a smooth function compactly supported in some coordinate patch. If the coordinate patch avoids the boundary curves, both sides vanish by the second formula above. Otherwise it can be assumed that the coordinate patch is a disk, the boundary of which cuts the curve transversely at two points. The same will be true for a slightly smaller disk containing the support of ''ψ''. Completing the curve to a Jordan curve by adding part of the boundary of the smaller disk, the formula reduces to the planar Green-Stokes formula.

The Green–Stokes formula implies an adjoint relation for the Laplacian on functions defined as Δ''f'' = −''d''∗''df''. This gives a 2-form, given in local coordinates by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f =\left( -{\partial^2 f \over \partial x^2} - {\partial^2 f \over \partial y^2}\right) \, dx \wedge dy .&lt;/math&gt;

Then if ''f'' and ''g'' are smooth and the closure of ''U'' is compact

:&lt;math&gt;\int_U f\Delta g - g \Delta f = \int_{\partial U} g {\star d f} - f{\star d g} .&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, if ''f'' or ''g'' has compact support then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_X f \Delta g = \int_X g \Delta f .&lt;/math&gt;

== Duality between 1-forms and closed curves ==
'''Theorem.''' If  ''γ'' is a continuous Jordan curve on a Riemann surface ''X'', there is a smooth closed 1-form ''α'' of compact support such that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α''}} for any closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' on ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::It suffices to prove this when ''γ'' is a regular closed curve. By the [[inverse function theorem]], there is a [[tubular neighborhood|tubular neighbourhood]] of the image of ''γ'', i.e. a smooth diffeomorphism {{math|Γ(''t'', ''s'')}} of the annulus {{math|''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; × (−1,1)}} into ''X'' such that {{math|1=Γ(''t'',0) = ''γ''(''t'')}}. Using a bump function on the second factor, a non-negative function ''g'' with compact support can be constructed such that ''g'' is smooth off ''γ'', has support in a small neighbourhood of ''γ'', and in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of ''γ'' is equal to 0 for {{nowrap|''s'' &lt; 0}} and 1 for {{nowrap|''s'' ≥ 0}}. Thus ''g'' has a jump discontinuity across ''γ'', although its differential ''dg'' is smooth with compact support. But then, setting {{nowrap|1=''α'' = −''dg''}}, it follows from Green's formula applied to the annulus {{math|''γ'' × [0,''ε'']}} that

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_X \omega \wedge \alpha = \int_X dg \wedge \omega =  \int_{\gamma\times (0,\varepsilon)} dg \wedge \omega = \int_{\gamma\times (0,\varepsilon)}d(g\omega) = \int_\gamma \omega.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Corollary 1.''' A closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' is exact if and only if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = 0}} for all smooth 1-forms ''α'' of compact support.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::In fact if ''ω'' is exact, it has the form ''df'' for ''f'' smooth, so that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ''α'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d''(''f'' ''α'') = 0}} by Green's theorem. Conversely, if {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α'' = 0}} for all smooth 1-forms ''α'' of compact support, the duality between Jordan curves and 1-forms implies that the integral of ''ω'' around any closed Jordan curve is zero and hence that ''ω'' is exact.

'''Corollary 2.''' If ''γ'' is a continuous closed curve on a Riemann surface ''X'', there is a smooth closed 1-form ''α'' of compact support such that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ ''α''}} for any closed smooth 1-form ''ω'' on ''X''. The form ''α'' is unique up to adding an exact form and can be taken to have support in any open neighbourhood of the image of ''γ''.

::In fact ''γ'' is homotopic to a piecewise smooth closed curve ''δ'', so that {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''γ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. On the other hand there are finitely many piecewise smooth Jordan curves ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; such that {{math|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' = ∑ ∫&lt;sub&gt;''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω''}}. The result for ''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; thus implies the result for ''γ''. If ''β'' is another form with the same property, the difference {{nowrap|''α'' − ''β''}} satisfies {{nowrap|1=∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''ω'' ∧ (''α'' − ''β'') = 0}} for all closed smooth 1-forms ''ω''. So the difference is exact by Corollary 1. Finally, if ''U'' is any neighbourhood of the image of ''γ'', then the last result follows by applying first assertion to ''γ'' and ''U'' in place of ''γ'' and ''X''.

==Intersection number of closed curves==
The '''[[intersection number]]''' of two closed curves γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a Riemann surface ''X'' can be defined analytically by the formula&lt;ref&gt;See:

*{{harvnb|Farkas|Kra|1992|pages=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Note that more generally intersection theory has also been developed separately within [[differential topology]] using [[Sard's theorem]]. See for example:

where α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are smooth 1-forms of compact support corresponding to γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. From the definition it follows that {{math|1=''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = − ''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. Since α&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; can be taken to have its support in a neighbourhood of the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that {{math|1=''I''(γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0}} if γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are disjoint. By definition it depends only on the homotopy classes of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

More generally the intersection number is always an integer and counts the number of times ''with signs'' that the two curves intersect. A crossing at a point is a positive or negative crossing according to whether ''d''γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ''d''γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the same or opposite sign to {{math|1=''dx'' ∧ ''dy'' = −i/2 ''dz'' ∧ ''d''{{overline|''z''}}}}, for a local holomorphic parameter ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''.&lt;ref&gt;This makes sense if the tangent vectors to the two curves at the crossing point exist, are non-vanishing and are transverse there, i.e. are not proportional.&lt;/ref&gt;

::Indeed, by homotopy invariance, it suffices to check this for smooth Jordan curves with nowhere vanishing derivatives. The α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be defined by taking α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''df'' with ''f'' of compact support in a neighbourhood of the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; equal to 0 near the left hand side of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 1 near the right hand side of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and smooth off the image of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Then if the points of intersection of γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') with γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; occur at ''t'' = ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ...., ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;, then

:::&lt;math&gt;I(\gamma_1,\gamma_2) = \int_{\gamma_2} \alpha_1 = \int_{\gamma_2} df = \sum f\circ \gamma_2(t_i+) - f\circ\gamma_2(t_i-).&lt;/math&gt;

::This gives the required result since the jump {{math|1=''f''∘γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;+) − ''f''∘γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;−)}} is + 1 for a positive crossing and −1 for a negative crossing.

==Holomorphic and harmonic 1-forms==
A '''holomorphic 1-form''' ω is one that in local coordinates is given by an expression ''f''(''z'') ''dz'' with ''f'' [[holomorphic]]. Since &lt;math&gt;dg=\partial_z g \, dz + \partial_{\overline{z}} g\, d\overline{z},&lt;/math&gt; it follows that ''d''ω = 0, so any holomorphic 1-form is closed. Moreover, since ∗''dz'' = ''i'' ''dz'', ω must satisfy ∗ω = ''i''ω. These two conditions characterize holomorphic 1-forms. For if ω is closed, locally it can be written as ''dg'' for some ''g'', The condition ∗''dg'' = ''i'' ''dg'' forces &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\overline{z}} g = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so that ''g'' is holomorphic and ''dg'' = ''g'' '(''z'') ''dz'', so that ω is holomorphic.

Let ω = ''f'' ''dz'' be a holomorphic 1-form. Write ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; real. Then  ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0  and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0; and since ∗ω = ''i''ω, ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. This process can clearly be reversed, so that there is a one-one correspondence between holomorphic 1-forms and real 1-forms ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; satisfying ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 and ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. Under this correspondence, ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the real part of ω while ω is given by ω= ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Such forms ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are called '''harmonic 1-forms'''. By definition ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic if and only if ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic.

Since holomorphic 1-forms locally have the form ''df'' with ''f'' a holomorphic function and since the real part of a holomorphic function is harmonic, harmonic 1-forms locally have the form ''dh'' with ''h'' a [[harmonic function]]. Conversely if ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be written in this way locally, ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''∗''dh'' = (''h''&lt;sub&gt;''xx''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''yy''&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dx''∧''dy'' so that ''h'' is harmonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=168–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Remark.''' The definition of harmonic functions and 1-forms is intrinsic and only relies on the underlying Riemann surface structure. If, however, a conformal metric is chosen on the Riemann surface ([[Differential forms on a Riemann surface#Conformal netrics|see below]]), the adjoint ''d''* of ''d'' can be defined and the Hodge star operation extended to functions and 2-forms. The Hodge Laplacian can be defined on ''k''-forms as ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''dd''* +''d''*''d'' and then a function ''f'' or a 1-form ω is harmonic if and only if it is annihilated by the Hodge Laplacian, i.e. ∆&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' = 0 or ∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ω = 0. The metric structure, however, is not required for the application to the uniformization of simply connected or planar Riemann surfaces.

==Sobolev spaces on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;==
The theory of Sobolev spaces on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}, an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as {{harvtxt|Warner|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Griffiths|Harris|1994}}. It provides an analytic framework for studying function theory on the torus '''C'''/'''Z'''+''i'' '''Z''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; using [[Fourier series]], which are just eigenfunction expansions for the Laplacian {{math|1=–∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; –∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The theory developed here essentially covers tori '''C''' / Λ where Λ is a [[lattice (discrete subgroup)|lattice]] in '''C'''. Although there is a corresponding theory of Sobolev spaces on any compact Riemann surface, it is elementary in this case, because it reduces to [[harmonic analysis]] on the compact Abelian group {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Classical approaches to Weyl's lemma use harmonic analysis on the non-compact Abelian group '''C''' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. the methods of [[Fourier analysis]], in particular [[convolution operator]]s and the [[fundamental solution]] of the Laplacian.&lt;ref&gt;For treatments in texts on Riemann surfaces, see:

Let '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''e''&lt;sup&gt;''ix''&lt;/sup&gt;,''e''&lt;sup&gt;''iy''&lt;/sup&gt;: ''x'', ''y'' ∈ [0,2π)} = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/'''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = '''C'''/Λ where Λ = '''Z''' + ''i'' '''Z'''.
For λ = ''m'' + ''i'' ''n'' ≅ (''m'',''n'') in Λ, set {{math|1=''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; (''x'',''y'') = ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''(''mx'' + ''ny'')&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Furthermore, set ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;= -''i''∂/∂''x'' and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = -''i''∂/∂''y''. For α = (''p'',''q'') set ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; =(''D''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; (''D''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;, a differential operator of total degree |α| = ''p'' + ''q''. Thus {{math|1=''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|1=λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; =''m''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The (''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;) form an [[orthonormal basis]] in C('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for the inner product {{math|1=(''f'',''g'') = (2π)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;∬ ''f''(''x'',''y'') {{overline|''g''(''x'',''y'')}} ''dx'' ''dy''}}, so that {{math|1=(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∑ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;) = ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|''b''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}.

For ''f'' in C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''k'' an integer, define the ''k''th Sobolev norm by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|f\|_{(k)} = \left(\sum |\widehat{f}(\lambda)|^2 (1 + |\lambda|^2)^k\right)^{1/2}.}&lt;/math&gt;

The associated inner product

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f,g)_{(k)} = \sum \widehat{f}(\lambda)\overline{\widehat{g}(\lambda)} (1 +|\lambda|^2)^k}&lt;/math&gt;

makes C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) into an inner product space. Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) be its Hilbert space completion. It can be described equivalently as the Hilbert space completion of the space of [[trigonometric polynomial]]s—that is finite sums {{math|1=(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}}—with respect to the ''k''th Sobolev norm, so that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = {∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; : ∑ |''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; ∞} with inner product

:(∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;, ∑ ''b''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;μ&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;(''k'')&lt;/sub&gt; = ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;{{overline|''b''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;}} (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;.

As explained below, the elements in the intersection ''H''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) =  &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are exactly the smooth functions on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; elements in the union ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) are just [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (sometimes referred to as "periodic distributions" on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990}}
*{{harvnb|Rudin|1973|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of properties of the Sobolev spaces.

*'''Differentiability and Sobolev spaces.''' {{math|1=''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} for ''k'' ≥ 0 since, using the [[binomial theorem]] to expand (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;,

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|f\|_{(k)}^2 = \sum_{|\alpha|\le k} {k\choose \alpha} \|D^\alpha f\|^2  \le C \cdot \sup_{|\alpha|\le k} |D^\alpha f|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;
 
*'''Differential operators.''' ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−|α|&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; defines a bounded linear map from ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−|α|&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  The operator ''I'' + Δ defines a unitary map of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); in particular (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; defines a unitary map of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for ''k'' ≥ 0. 
::The first assertions follow because ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; = λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; and |λ&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;| ≤ |λ|&lt;sup&gt;|α|&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;|α|/2&lt;/sup&gt;. The second assertions follow because ''I'' + Δ acts as multiplication by 1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;.

*'''Duality.''' For ''k'' ≥ 0, the pairing sending ''f'', ''g'' to (''f'',''g'') establishes a duality between ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

::This is a restatement of the fact that (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; establishes a unitary map between these two spaces, because {{math|1=(''f'',''g'') = ((''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''f'',''g'')&lt;sub&gt;(−''k'')&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

*'''Multiplication operators.''' If ''h'' is a smooth function then multiplication by ''h'' defines a continuous operator on ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

::For ''k'' ≥ 0, this follows from the formula for ||''f''||{{su|p=2|b=(''k'')}} above and the [[product rule|Leibniz rule]]. Continuity for ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) follows by duality, since {{math|1=(''f'',''hg'') = ({{overline|''h''}}''f'',''g'')}}.

*'''Sobolev spaces and differentiability (Sobolev's embedding theorem).''' For ''k'' ≥ 0, {{math|1=''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ⊂ ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and sup&lt;sub&gt;|α|≤''k''&lt;/sub&gt; |''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''|  ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;(''k''+2)&lt;/sub&gt;.

::The inequalities for trigonometric polynomials imply the containments. The inequality for ''k'' = 0 follows from

= \left(\sum (1+|\lambda|^2)^{-2}\right)^{1/2} \cdot \|\sum a_\lambda e_\lambda\|_{(2)},}&lt;/math&gt;

::by the [[Cauchy-Schwarz inequality]]. The first term is finite by the [[integral test]], since ∬&lt;sub&gt;'''C'''&lt;/sub&gt; (1 + |''z''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx'' ''dy'' = {{math|1=2π ∫{{su|p=∞|b=0}} (1 + ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; ''r'' ''dr''}} &lt; ∞ using [[polar coordinates]]. In general if |α| ≤ k, then |sup ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''| ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ||''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f''||&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ||''f''||&lt;sub&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sub&gt; by the continuity properties of ''D''&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;.

*'''Smooth functions.''' ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) consists of Fourier series ∑ ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; ''e''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; such that for all ''k'' &gt; 0, (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; |''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;| tends to 0 as |λ| tends to ∞, i.e. the Fourier coefficients ''a''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; are of "rapid decay".

::This is an immediate consequence of the Sobolev embedding theorem.

*'''Inclusion maps (Rellich's compactness theorem).''' If ''k'' &gt; ''j'', the space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a subspace of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and the inclusion ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is [[compact operator|compact]].

::With respect to the natural orthonormal bases, the inclusion map becomes multiplication by (1 + |λ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;−(''k''−''j'')/2&lt;/sup&gt;. It is therefore compact because it is given by a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries tending to zero.

*'''Elliptic regularity (Weyl's lemma).''' Suppose that ''f'' and ''u'' in  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;−∞&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = &lt;math&gt;\cup&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) satisfy ∆''u'' = ''f''. Suppose also that ψ ''f'' is a smooth function for every smooth function ψ vanishing off a fixed open set ''U'' in '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; then the same is true for ''u''. (Thus if ''f'' is smooth off ''U'', so is ''u''.)

::By the Leibniz rule {{math|1=Δ(ψ''u'') = (Δψ) ''u'' + 2(ψ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) + ψ Δ''u''}}, so {{math|1=ψ''u'' = (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;[ψ''u'' + (Δψ) ''u'' + 2(ψ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; +  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) + ψ''f'']}}. If it is known that φ''u'' lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for some ''k'' and all φ vanishing off ''U'', then differentiating shows that φ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;  and φ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The square-bracketed expression therefore also lies in  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The operator (''I'' + Δ)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; carries this space onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), so that ψ''u'' must lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

Indeed by the Green-Stokes formula&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Warner|1983|pages=220–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(d\alpha,\beta) = \int d\alpha \wedge \star \overline{\beta} = \int d\alpha \wedge \star \overline{\beta} -\int d(\alpha\wedge \star\overline{\beta}) = (-1)^{\partial\alpha} \int \alpha\wedge d\star\overline{\beta} = \int\alpha \wedge \star\overline{\delta\beta} = (\alpha,\delta\beta).}&lt;/math&gt;

:The operators ''d'' and δ = ''d''* satisfy ''d''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

This allows the Hodge decomposition to be generalised to include 1-forms and 2-forms:

In the Hilbert space completion of  Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) the orthogonal complement of {{math|1=im ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ∗''d''  }} is {{math|1=ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''∗}}, the finite-dimensional space of harmonic ''k''-forms, i.e. the constant ''k''-forms. In particular in  {{math|1=Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} ,  {{math|1=ker ''d'' / im ''d'' =  ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''*}}, the space of harmonic ''k''-forms. Thus the [[de Rham cohomology]] of '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is given by harmonic (i.e. constant) ''k''-forms.

::From the Hodge decomposition on functions, Ω&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) = ker ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ∆&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The last assertion follows because ker ''d'' contains {{math|1=ker ''d'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ker ''d''* &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; im ''d''}} and is orthogonal to im ''d''* = im ∗''d''.

==Hilbert space of 1-forms==
In the case of the compact Riemann surface '''C''' / Λ, the theory of Sobolev spaces shows that the Hilbert space completion of smooth 1-forms can be decomposed as the sum of three pairwise orthogonal spaces, the closure of exact 1-forms ''df'', the closure of coexact 1-forms ∗''df'' and the harmonic 1-forms (the 2-dimensional space of constant 1-forms). The '''method of orthogonal projection''' of {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}}  put Riemann's approach to the Dirichlet principle on sound footing by generalizing this composition to arbitrary Riemann surfaces.

If ''X'' is a Riemann surface Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X'') denote the space of continuous 1-forms with compact support. It admits the complex inner product

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(\alpha,\beta) = \int_{X} \alpha \wedge \star\overline{\beta},}&lt;/math&gt;

for α and β in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Let ''H'' denote the Hilbert space completion of Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Although ''H'' can be interpreted in terms of measurable functions, like Sobolev spaces on tori it can be studied directly using only elementary [[functional analysis|functional analytic]] techniques involving Hilbert spaces and bounded linear operators.

Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closure of ''d'' ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''X'') and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote the closure of ∗''d'' ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''X''). Since {{math|1=(''df'',∗''dg'') = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ''d''{{overline|''g''}} = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''d'' (''f'' ''d''{{overline|''g''}}) = 0}}, these are orthogonal subspaces. Let ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; denote the orthogonal complement
(''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; = ''H''{{su|b=1|p=⊥}} &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''H''{{su|b=2|p=⊥}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=178–206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theorem (Hodge−Weyl decomposition).''' ''H'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The subspace ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; consists of square integrable harmonic 1-forms on ''X'', i.e. 1-forms ω such that ''d''ω = 0, ''d''∗ω = 0 and ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ω ∧ ∗{{overline|ω}} &lt; ∞.

*Every square integrable continuous 1-form lies in ''H''.

::The space of continuous 1-forms of compact support is contained in the space of square integrable continuous 1-forms. They are both inner product spaces for the above inner product. So it suffices to show that any square integrable continuous 1-form can be approximated by continuous 1-forms of compact support. Let ω be a continuous square integrable 1-form, Thus the positive density Ω = ω ∧ ∗{{overline|ω}} is integrable and there are continuous functions of compact support ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with 0 ≤  ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 such that ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω tends to ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; Ω = ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Let {{math|1=φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 − (1 − ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, a continuous function of compact support with {{math|1=0 ≤ φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1}}. Then ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω tends to ω in ''H'', since ||ω − ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; (1 − ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) Ω tends to 0.

*If ω in ''H'' is such that ψ ⋅ ω is continuous for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''), then  ω is a square integrable continuous 1-form.

::Note that the multiplication operator ''m''(φ) given by ''m''(φ)α = φ ⋅ α for φ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') and α in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X'') satisfies ||''m''(φ)α|| ≤ ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; ||α||, where ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; = sup |φ|. Thus ''m''(φ) defines a bounded linear operator with operator norm ||''m''(φ)|| ≤ ||φ||&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;. It extends continuously to a bounded linear operator on ''H'' with the same operator norm. For every open set ''U'' with compact closure, there is a continuous function φ of compact support with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1 with φ ≅ 1 on ''U''. Then φ ⋅ ω is continuous on ''U'' so defines a unique continuous form ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U''. If ''V'' is another open set intersecting ''U'', then  ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'': in fact if ''z'' lies in ''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'' and  ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''U'' &lt;math&gt;\cap&lt;/math&gt; ''V'') ⊂ ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with  ψ = 1 near ''z'', then ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ψ ⋅ ω = ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt;, so that ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''V''&lt;/sub&gt; near ''z''. Thus the  ω&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt;'s patch together to give a continuous 1-form ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; on ''X''. By construction,  ψ ⋅ ω = ψ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). In particular for φ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with {{math|1=0 ≤ φ ≤ 1}}, ∫  φ ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = ||φ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ||φ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; ⋅ ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ||ω||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. So ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is integrable and hence ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is square integrable, so an element of ''H''. On the other hand ω can be approximated by ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''X''). Take ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') with 0 ≤ ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1 with {{math|1=ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Since real-valued continuous functions are closed under [[lattice (order)|lattice operation]]s. it can further be assumed that ∫ ψ{{su|b=''n''|p=2}} ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and hence  ∫ ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ ∗{{overline| ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, increase to ||ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;||&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But then ||ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω − ω|| and ||ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; − ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;|| tend to 0. Since {{math|1=ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω = ψ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ⋅ ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}, this shows that {{math|1=ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}}. 
 
*Every square integrable harmonic 1-form ω lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

::This is immediate because ω lies in ''H'' and, for ''f'' a smooth function of compact support, {{math|1=(''df'',ω) = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ∗ω  = −∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' ''d''∗ω = 0}} and {{math|1=(∗''df'',ω) = ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''df'' ∧ ω = − ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' ''d''ω = 0}}.

*Every element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by a square integrable harmonic 1-form.

::Let ω be an element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and for fixed ''p'' in ''X'' fix a chart ''U'' in ''X'' containing ''p'' which is conformally equivalent by a map ''f'' to a disc ''D'' ⊂ '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with ''f''(0) = ''p''.  The identification map from  Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''U'') onto Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''D'') and hence into Ω&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) preserves norms (up to a constant factor). Let ''K'' be the closure of  Ω{{su|b=''c''|p=1}}(''U'') in ''H''. Then the above map extends uniquely to an isometry ''T'' of ''K'' into ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''dx'' &lt;math&gt;\oplus&lt;/math&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)''dy''. Moreover if ψ is in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''U'') then {{math|1=''T'' ''m''(ψ) = ''m''(ψ ∘ ''f'') ''T''}}. The identification map ''T'' is also compatible with ''d'' and the Hodge star operator. Let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; be a smaller concentric disk in '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and set ''V'' = ''f''(''V'').  Take φ in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''U'') with φ ≡ 1 on ''V''. Then (''m''(φ) ω,''dh'') = 0 = (''m''( φ) ω,∗''dh'') for ''h'' in ''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''V''). Hence, if  ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''(φ)ω and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''(ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), then (ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''dg'') = 0 = (ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''dg'') for ''g'' in {{math|1=''C''{{su|b=''c''|p=∞}}(''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}.

::Write ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''a'' ''dx'' + ''b'' ''dy'' with ''a'' and ''b'' in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The conditions above imply (''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''g'') = 0 = (''d''∗ ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ∗''g''). Replacing ∗''g'' by ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with ω&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; a smooth 1-form supported in ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  = 0 on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus ∆''a'' = 0 = ∆''b'' on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence by Weyl's lemma, ''a'' and ''b'' are harmonic on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In particular both of them, and hence ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are smooth on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Transporting these equations back to ''X'', it follows that ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is smooth on ''V'' and ''d''ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 = ''d''∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on ''V''. Since ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''m''(φ)ω  and ''p'' was an arbitrary point, this implies in particular that ''m''(ψ)ω is continuous for every ψ in ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt;(''X''). So ω is continuous and square integrable.

::But then ω is smooth on ''V'' and ''d''ω = 0 = ''d''∗ω on ''V''. Again since ''p'' was arbitrary, this implies ω is smooth on ''X'' and ''d''ω = 0 = ''d''∗ω on ''X'', so that ω is a harmonic 1-form on ''X''.

From the formulas for the Dolbeault operators &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;, it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{d C^\infty_c(X) \oplus * d C^\infty_c(X) = \partial C^\infty_c(X) \oplus  \overline{\partial}C^\infty_c(X),}&lt;/math&gt;

where both sums are orthogonal. The two subspaces in the second sum correspond to the ±''i'' eigenspaces of the Hodge ∗ operator. Denoting their closures by ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it follows that ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ⊕ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and that these subspaces are interchanged by complex conjugation. The smooth 1-forms in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or ''H''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; have a simple description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=200–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ''df'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the form ∗''df'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' for ''f'' smooth.
*A smooth 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the form &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''f'' for ''f'' smooth.

::In fact, in view of the decompositions of ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} and its invariance under the Hodge star operation, it suffices to prove the first of these assertions. Since  ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  is invariant under complex conjugation, it may be assumed that α is a smooth real 1-form in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It is therefore a limit in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of forms ''df''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; with ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; smooth of compact support. The 1-form α must be closed since, for any  real-valued ''f'' in ''C''{{su|b=c|p=∞}}(''X''),

:::&lt;math&gt; \int_X f \, d\alpha = -\int_X df \wedge \alpha=  (\alpha,*df)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

::so that ''d''α = 0. To prove that α is exact it suffices to prove that ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; α ∧ ∗β = 0 for any smooth closed real 1-form β of compact support. But by Green's formula

:::&lt;math&gt;\int_X \alpha \wedge \star \beta = (\alpha,\beta) = \lim (df_n,\beta)= \lim \int_X df_n \wedge \beta=\lim \int_X d(f_n\beta)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
 
The above characterisations have an immediate corollary:

*A smooth 1-form α in ''H''{{su|b=0|p=⊥}} can be decomposed uniquely as α = ''da'' + ∗''db'' = &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' + &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''g'', with ''a'', ''b'', ''f'' and ''g'' smooth and all the summands square integrable.

Combined with the previous Hodge–Weyl decomposition and the fact that an element of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is automatically smooth, this immediately implies:

'''Theorem (smooth Hodge–Weyl decomposition).''' If α is a smooth square integrable 1-form then α can be written uniquely as {{math|1=α = ω + ''da'' + *''db'' = ω +  &lt;math&gt;\partial&lt;/math&gt;''f'' + &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;''g''}} with  ω harmonic, square integrable and {{math|1=''a'', ''b'', ''f'', ''g''}} smooth with square integrable differentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=195–205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Holomorphic 1-forms with a double pole==
The following result—reinterpreted in the next section in terms of harmonic functions and the Dirichlet principle—is the key tool for proving the [[uniformization theorem]] for simply connected, or more generally planar, Riemann surfaces.

'''Theorem.''' If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique holomorphic differential 1-form ω with a double pole at ''P'', so that the singular part of  ω  is ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' near ''P'',  and regular everywhere else, such that ω is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P'' and the real part of ω is exact on ''X'' \ {P}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The double pole condition is invariant under holomorphic coordinate change ''z'' &lt;math&gt;\mapsto&lt;/math&gt; ''z'' + ''az''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅. There is an analogous result for poles of order greater than 2 where the singular part of ω  has the form ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–''k''&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' with ''k'' &gt; 2, although this condition is not invariant under holomorphic coordinate change.

::To prove uniqueness, note that if ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and  ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two solutions then their difference ω = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  is a square integrable holomorphic 1-form which is exact on ''X'' \ {P}. Thus near ''P'',  {{math|1=ω = ''f''(''z'') ''dz''}} with ''f'' holomorphic near ''z'' = 0. There is a holomorphic function ''g'' on  ''X'' \ {P} such that ω = ''dg'' there. But then ''g'' must coincide with a [[primitive function|primitive]] of ''f'' near ''z'' = 0, so that ω = ''dg'' everywhere. But then ω lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0), i.e. ω = 0.

::To prove existence, take a bump function 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1 in ''C''{{su|b=c|p=∞}}(''X'') with support in a neighbourhood of ''P'' of the form |''z''| &lt; ε and such that ψ ≡ 1 near ''P'' . Set

:::&lt;math&gt;\alpha =-d \left({\psi(z)\over z}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

::so that α equals ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' near ''P'', vanishes off a neighbourhood of ''P'' and is exact on ''X'' \ {P}. Let β = α − ''i''∗α, a smooth (0,1) form on ''X'', vanishing near ''z'' =0, since it is a (1,0) form there, and vanishing off a larger neighbourhood of ''P''.  By the smooth Hodge−Weyl decomposition, β can be decomposed as  β  =   ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''da'' –  ''i''∗''da'' with ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; a harmonic and square integrable (0,1) form and ''a'' smooth with square integrable differential. Now set γ = α –  ''da'' = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗α − ''i''∗''da'' and ω = Re γ + ''i''∗ Re γ. Then α is exact on ''X'' \ {P}; hence so is γ, as well as its real part, which is also the real part of ω. Near ''P'', the 1-form ω differs from ''z''&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' by a smooth (1,0) form. It remains to prove that &lt;math&gt;\bar{\partial}&lt;/math&gt;ω = 0 on ''X'' \ {P}; or equivalently that Re γ is harmonic on ''X'' \ {P}. In fact γ is harmonic on ''X'' \ {P}; for ''d''γ = ''d''α − ''d''(''da'') = 0 on ''X'' \ {P} because α is exact there; and similarly ''d''∗γ = 0 using the formula γ = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''i''∗α − ''i''∗''da'' and the fact that ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is harmonic.

'''Corollary of proof.''' &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique real-valued 1-form δ  which is harmonic on ''X'' \ {''P''} such that δ – Re ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;''dz'' is harmonic near ''z'' = 0 (the point ''P'')  such that δ is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P''. Moreover, if ''h'' is any real-valued smooth function on ''X'' with ''dh'' square integrable and ''h'' vanishing near ''P'', then (δ,''dh'') = 0.

::Existence follows by taking δ = Re γ = Re ω above. Since ω = δ + ''i''∗δ, the uniqueness of  ω implies the uniqueness of δ. Alternatively if δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are two solutions, their difference η = δ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – δ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has no singularity at ''P'' and is harmonic on ''X'' \ {''P''}. It is therefore harmonic in a neighbourhood of ''P'' and therefore everywhere. So η lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. But also η is exact on ''X'' \ ''P'' and hence on the whole of ''X'', so it also lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But then it must lie in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ∩ ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (0), so that η = 0. Finally, if ''N'' is the closure of a neighbourhood of ''P'' disjoint from the support of ''h'' and ''Y'' = ''X'' \ ''N'', then δ|&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; lies in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')  and ''dh'' lies in the space ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'') so that

:::&lt;math&gt;(\delta,dh) =\int_X \delta \wedge \star dh = \int_Y \delta \wedge \star dh = (\delta|_Y,dh)_Y = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dirichlet's principle on a Riemann surface==
{{See also|Dirichlet's principle}}
'''Theorem.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=209–212, 219}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''X'' is a Riemann surface and ''P'' is a point on ''X'' with local coordinate ''z'', there is a unique real-valued harmonic function ''u'' on ''X'' \ {''P''} such that ''u''(''z'') – Re ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is harmonic near ''z'' = 0 (the point ''P'')  such that ''du'' is square integrable on the complement of a neighbourhood of ''P''. Moreover, if ''h'' is any real-valued smooth function on ''X'' with ''dh'' square integrable and ''h'' vanishing near ''P'', then (''du'',''dh'')=0.

::In fact this result is immediate from the theorem and corollary in the previous section. The harmonic form δ constructed there is the real part of a holomorphic form ω = ''dg'' where ''g'' is holomorphic function on ''X'' with a simple pole at ''P'' with residue -1, i.e. ''g''(''z'') = –''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''z'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ near ''z'' = 0. So ''u'' = - Re ''g'' gives a solution with the claimed properties since δ = −''du'' and hence (''du'',''dh'') =  −(δ,''dh'') = 0.

This result can be interpreted in terms of [[Dirichlet's principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=211–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|2007|pages=294–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weyl|1955|pages=93–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt; be a parametric disk |''z''| &lt; ''R'' about ''P'' (the point ''z'' = 0) with ''R'' &gt; 1. Let α =  −''d''(ψ''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), where 0 ≤ ψ ≤ 1 is a bump function supported in ''D'' = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, identically 1 near ''z'' = 0. Let α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt;(''z'') Re ''d''(''z''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) where χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[characteristic function]]{{dn|date=March 2017}} of ''D''. Let γ= Re α and γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Re  α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Since  χ&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; can be approximated by bump functions in L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − γ lies in the real Hilbert space of 1-forms Re ''H''; similarly  α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − α lies in ''H''. Dirichlet's principle states that the distance function

:''F''(ξ) = ||γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − γ – ξ||

on Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is minimised by a smooth 1-form ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In fact −''du'' coincides with the minimising 1-form: γ + ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = -''du''.

This version of Dirichlet's principle is easy to deduce from the previous construction of ''du''. By definition ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthogonal projection of γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – γ  onto Re ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the real inner product Re (η&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,η&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) on ''H'', regarded as a real inner product space. It coincides with the real part of the orthogonal projection ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; of α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for the complex inner product on ''H''. Since the Hodge star operator is a unitary map on ''H'' swapping ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ∗ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the orthogonal projection of  ∗(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; –  α) onto ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. On the other hand, ∗α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = −''i'' α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, since α is a (1,0) form. Hence

:(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α) − ''i''∗(α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; – α) = ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,

with ω&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; in ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. But the left hand side equals – α + ''i''∗α = −β, with β defined exactly as in the preceding section, so this coincides with the previous construction.

Further discussion of Dirichlet's principle on a Riemann surface can be found in {{harvtxt|Hurwitz|Courant|1929}}, {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1947}}, {{harvtxt|Courant|1950}}, {{harvtxt|Schiffer|Spencer|1954}}, {{harvtxt|Pfluger|1957}} and {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|Sario|1960}}.

'''Historical note.''' {{harvtxt|Weyl|1913}} proved the existence of the harmonic function ''u'' by giving a direct proof of Dirichlet's principle. In {{harvtxt|Weyl|1940}}, he presented his method of orthogonal projection which has been adopted in the presentation above, following {{harvtxt|Springer|1957}}, but with the theory of Sobolev spaces on '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; used to prove elliptic regularity without using measure theory. In the expository texts {{harvtxt|Weyl|1955}} and {{harvtxt|Kodaira|2007}}, both authors avoid invoking results on measure theory: they follow Weyl's original approach for constructing harmonic functions with singularities via Dirichlet's principle. In Weyl's method of orthogonal projection, Lebesgue's theory of integration had been used to realise Hilbert spaces of 1-forms in terms of measurable 1-forms, although the 1-forms to be constructed were smooth or even analytic away from their singularity. In the preface to {{harvtxt|Weyl|1955}}, referring to the extension of his method of orthogonal projection to higher dimensions by {{harvtxt|Kodaira|1949}}, Weyl writes:

::"Influenced by Kodaira's work, I have hesitated a moment as to whether I should not replace the Dirichlet principle by the essentially equivalent "method of orthogonal projection" which is treated in a paper of mine. But for reasons the explication of which would lead too far afield here, I have stuck to the old approach."

In {{harvtxt|Kodaira|2007}}, after giving a brief exposition of the method of orthogonal projection and making reference to Weyl's writings,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kodaira|312−314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kodaira explains:

::"I first planned to prove Dirichlet's Principle using the method of orthogonal projection in this book. However, I did not like to have to use the concept of Lebesgue measurability only for the proof of Dirichlet's Principle and therefore I rewrote it in such a way that I did not have to."

The methods of Hilbert spaces, ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; spaces and measure theory appear in the non-classical theory of Riemann surfaces (the study of [[moduli space]]s of Riemann surfaces) through the [[Beltrami equation]] and [[Teichmüller theory]].

==Holomorphic 1-forms with two single poles==
'''Theorem.''' Given a Riemann surface ''X'' and two distinct points ''A'' and ''B'' on ''X'', there is a holomorphic 1-form on ''X'' with simple poles at the two points with non-zero residues having sum zero such that the 1-form is square integrable on the complement of any open neighbourhoods of the two points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|1957|pages=212–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proof is similar to the proof of the result on holomorphic 1-forms with a single double pole. The result is first proved when ''A'' and ''B'' are close and lie in a parametric disk. Indeed, once this is proved, a sum of 1-forms for a chain of sufficiently close points between ''A'' and ''B'' will provide the required 1-form, since the intermediate singular terms will cancel. To construct the 1-form for points corresponding to ''a'' and ''b'' in a parametric disk, the previous construction can be used starting with the 1-form

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = d\left (\psi(z) \log{z-a\over z-b}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

which locally has the form

:&lt;math&gt; {dz\over z-a} - {dz\over z-b}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Poisson equation==
{{see also|Poisson equation}}
'''Theorem (Poisson equation).''' If Ω is a smooth 2-form of compact support on a Riemann surface ''X'', then Ω can be written as Ω = ∆''f'' where ''f'' is a smooth function with ''df'' square integrable if and only if  ∫&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;  Ω = 0.

::In fact, Ω can be written as Ω = ''d''α with α a smooth 1-form of compact support: indeed, using partitions of unity, this reduces to the case of a smooth 2-form of compact support on a rectangle. Indeed Ω can be written as a finite sum of 2-forms each supported in a parametric rectangle and  having integral zero. For each of these 2-forms the result follows from Poincaré's lemma with compact support. Writing α = ω + ''da'' + *''db'', it follows that Ω = ''d''*''db'' = ∆''b''.

In the case of the simply connected Riemann surfaces '''C''', ''D'' and ''S''= '''C''' ∪ ∞, the Riemann surfaces are [[symmetric space]]s ''G'' / ''K'' for the groups ''G'' =  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, SL(2,'''R''') and SU(2). The methods of group representation theory imply the operator ∆ is ''G''-invariant, so that its fundamental solution is given by right convolution by a function  on ''K'' \ ''G'' / ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helgason|2001|page=444–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|pages=104–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in these cases Poisson's equation can be solved by an explicit integral formula. It is easy to verify that this explicit solution tends to 0 at ∞, so that in the case of these surfaces there is a solution ''f'' tending to 0 at ∞. {{harvtxt|Donaldson|2011}} proves this directly for simply connected surfaces and uses it to deduce the [[uniformization theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donaldson|2011|pages=131–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2007}}

The '''doctrine of necessity''' is the basis on which extra-legal actions by state actors, which are designed to restore order, are found to be constitutional. The [[legal maxim|maxim]] on which the doctrine is based originated in the writings of the medieval jurist [[Henry de Bracton]], and similar justifications for this kind of extra-legal action have been advanced by more recent legal authorities, including [[William Blackstone]].

In modern times, the doctrine was first used in a controversial 1954 judgment in which Pakistani Chief Justice [[Muhammad Munir]] validated the extra-constitutional use of emergency powers by [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor General]], [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]].&lt;ref name="ref16zifem"&gt;{{Citation | title=The post-colonial states of South Asia: democracy, development, and identity | author=Amita Shastri, A. Jeyaratnam Wilson | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, 2001 | isbn=978-0-312-23852-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=du7xvBFpbg4C | quote=''... Dismissing Mirza, army chief General Mohammad Ayub Khan took over first as chief martial law administrator ... a compliant judiciary upheld the imposition of martial law under the doctrine of necessity ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his judgment, the Chief Justice cited [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] [[Legal maxim|maxim]], 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', thereby providing the label that would come to be attached to the judgment and the doctrine that it was establishing.

The doctrine of necessity has since been applied in a number of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, and in 2010 was invoked to justify extra-legal actions in [[Nigeria]].

==Pakistan, 1954: First use==
On 24 October 1954 the Governor-General of Pakistan, [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Mohammad]], dissolved the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan|Constituent Assembly]] and appointed a new Council of Ministers on the grounds that the existing one no longer represented the people of Pakistan. [[Stanley Alexander de Smith|Stanley de Smith]] argues that the real reason for the dissolution was because Mohammad objected to the constitution which the Assembly was about to adopt.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  The President of the Constituent Assembly, [[Maulvi Tamizuddin]], appealed to the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi to restrain the new Council of Ministers from implementing the dissolution and to determine the validity of the appointment of the new Council under Section 223-A of the constitution.

In response, members of the new Council of Ministers appealed to the court saying that it had no jurisdiction to approve the request of the President to overturn the dissolution and appointments.  They argued that Section 223-A of the constitution had never been validly enacted into the Constitution because it was never approved of by the Governor-General, and therefore anything submitted under it was invalid.  The Chief Court of Sind ruled in favour of President Tamizuddin and held that the Governor-General's approval was not needed when the Constituent Assembly was acting only as a Constituent Assembly and not as the Federal Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Judgement and Order of the Chief Court of Sind at Karachi, 9 February 1955, PLD 1955 Sind 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Federation of Pakistan and the new Council of Ministers then appealed to the court, the appeal was heard in March 1955 (''Federation of Pakistan v Maulvi Tamizuddin Khan'').

In the appeal hearing under Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, the court decided that the Constituent Assembly functioned as the 'Legislature of the Domain' and that the Governor-General's assent was necessary for all legislation to become law.  Therefore, the Chief Court of Sind had no jurisdiction to overturn the Governor General's dissolution and it was held as valid.

However, the ground of which the court found in favour of the Federation of Pakistan called into question the validity of all legislation passed by the Assembly, not to mention the unconstitutionality of the Assembly itself since 1950.  To solve this problem, the Governor-General invoked Emergency Powers to retrospectively validate the Acts of the Constituent Assembly. An appeal was filed against the Governor-General for invoking emergency powers and the Chief Justice had to determine the constitutionality of invoking the Emergency Powers and whether the Governor-General could give his assent to legislation retroactively.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Phillips, Leslie.  "Constitutional Legitimacy: A Study of the Doctrine of Necessity." ''Third World Quarterly'', Vol. 1, No. 4 (October 1979) 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court held that in this case the Governor-General could not invoke emergency powers because in doing so he validated certain laws that had been invalid because he had not assented to them previously.  Justice Munir also ruled that constitutional legislation could not be validated by the Governor General but had to be approved by the Legislature.  The lack of a Constituent Assembly did not transfer the Legislature's powers over to the Governor-General.

The Court was referred to for an opinion. On 16 May 1955 it ruled:

# The Governor General in certain circumstances had the power to dissolve the Constituent Assembly.
# The Governor-General has during the interim period the power 'under the common law of civil or state necessity' of retrospectively validating the laws listed in the Schedule to the Emergency Powers ordinance.
#  The new Assembly (formed under the Constituent Convention Order 1955) would be valid and able to exerise all powers under the ''[[Indian Independence Act 1947]]''.&lt;ref&gt;PLD 1955 I FC 561-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In his verdict, Munir declared it was necessary to go beyond the constitution to what he claimed was the Common Law, to general legal maxims, and to English historical precedent. He relied on [[Henry de Bracton|Bracton's]] maxim, 'that which is otherwise not lawful is made lawful by necessity', and the Roman law maxim urged by [[Ivor Jennings]], 'the well-being of the people is the supreme law'.

==Grenada, 1985: Second use==
In a 1985 judgment, the Chief Justice of the High Court of [[Grenada]] invoked the doctrine of necessity to validate the legal existence of a court then trying for murder the persons who had conducted a coup against former leader [[Maurice Bishop]]. The court had been established under an unconstitutional "People's Law" following the overthrow of the country's constitution, which had subsequently been restored. The defendants argued that the court before which they were being tried had no legal existence under the restored constitution, and they were therefore being deprived of their constitutional right to a trial before a "Court established by law". The High Court acknowledged that the lower court "had come into existence in an unconstitutional manner", but "the doctrine of necessity validated its acts."&lt;ref&gt;[[H.V. Evatt]] and [[Eugene Forsey]], ''Evatt and Forsey on the Reserve Powers''. (Sydney: Legal Books, 1990), p. xciv.&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis, the murder trials were allowed to proceed.

==Nigeria, 2010: Nigerian parliament creates an Acting President==
A related (although non-judicial) use of the doctrine took place when, on 9 February 2010, the [[Nigeria]]n National Assembly passed a resolution making Vice President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] the Acting President and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Both chambers of the Assembly passed the resolution after President [[Umaru Yar'Adua]], who for 78 days had been in [[Saudi Arabia]] receiving medical treatment, was unable to formally empower the vice president to exercise full powers as acting president, as provided for in Section 145 of the country's constitution. No provision of the Nigerian constitution empowering the National Assembly to pass any such resolution, causing Senate President [[David Mark]] to assert that the Senate had been guided by the "doctrine of necessity" in arriving at its decision.

'''Donald M. Baer''' was a [[psychologist]] who contributed to the science of [[applied behavior analysis]] and pioneered the development of behavior analysis at two separate institutions. Baer is best known for his contributions at the [[University of Kansas]]. Throughout his career, he published over two hundred articles, books, and chapters on various psychological issues.  Some of his most noteworthy contributions include literature on behavior-analytic theory, experimental design, and early childhood interventions. Baer received numerous awards during his lifetime which acknowledged his innovation and dedication to his field of research.

==Background information==
Donald M. Baer was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on October 25, 1931.  His family later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]].  Baer attended the [[University of Chicago]] and received his doctoral degree in 1957 under the direction of Jacob L. Gewirtz (Poulson, 2002).  After graduation, Baer began working with [[Sidney W. Bijou]] at the [[University of Washington]].  Baer was soon offered a faculty position at the University of Kansas where he remained until his death on April 28, 2002.  He is survived by his wife Elsie Pinkston and his three daughters.

==Early work==
Collectively, Baer and Bijou established the behavior analysis approach to child development at the [[University of Washington]] (Anonymous, 2002). From 1957 to 1965, Baer and Bijou conducted an array of research on the effects of [[reinforcement]] contingencies on children (Anonymous, 2002). An influential paper titled "Effect of withdrawal of positive reinforcement on an extinguishing response in young children" was written during this time (Baer, 1961).  This research article established the effectiveness of "withdrawal of positive reinforcement" as a means of reducing behavior(Baer, 1961., p.&amp;nbsp;1).

While at the University of Washington, Baer made another noteworthy research paper on the escape and avoidance behaviors of preschool children (Baer, 1960).  Unfortunately, Baer and his research associates became involved in a "typical Psychology civil war" at the University of Washington (Baer, 1993., pp.&amp;nbsp;570).  The war stemmed from the administration's "intolerance of [[B. F. Skinner|Skinnerian]] perspectives and the rejection of research using single-subject designs." (Horowitz, 2002., pp.&amp;nbsp;313). Seeking a university environment more welcoming of behavior analysis, Don Baer found his way to the newly formed Human Development and Family Life Department at the University of Kansas.

The establishment of the Human Development and Family Life Department (HDFL) at the [[University of Kansas]] is a somewhat turbulent chain of events. The following comes from Baer (1993), unless otherwise stated.  Due to various professors retiring, the University of Kansas decided to dissolve its Home Economics Department in the early 1960s.  As a result, over $2 million in funding remained unused.  A recently acquired academic researcher, Frances Horowitz, pleaded to the Kansas administration to simply transform the Home Economics Department into the Department of Human Development and Family Life (HDFL).  The Home Economics Department was already a well known childhood research center. The administration agreed and appointed Horowitz chair of the department.  Horowitz assumed the task of recruiting researchers.  Horowitz and Donald Baer had conversed at APA meetings for years and became great friends.  At an APA meeting in Los Angeles, Horowitz asked Baer if he would be "interested in a challenge" (Baer, 1993. pp.&amp;nbsp;570).  The challenge Horowitz was referring to was establishing a new doctoral program from the ground up.  Don Baer remained at the department and began expanding the program to the highest degree.

==A fresh start==
At the University of Kansas, Baer began recruiting behavioral researchers for his newly formed department (Glover, pp.&amp;nbsp;146).  Among those recruited, Baer began research with Montrose M. Wolf, Todd R. Risley, and James A. Sherman.  The fruits of their research yielded the development of the discipline of applied behavior analysis (ABA) at the University of Kansas late in the 1960s.  Applied behavior analysis concentrates on "empirically-based interventions into problems of individual, social, and cultural importance" (Anonymous, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1).  This discipline provided a structure for working with developmentally delayed children and adults. According to Glover (1987), Baer established at Kansas "one of the outstanding centers for research in applied behavior analysis" (pp.&amp;nbsp;146).

The following comes from Colman (1994), unless otherwise stated.  Shortly after the establishment of ABA program, the first journal, Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, dedicated to the discipline was published in 1968.   In the first issue, Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968) published "Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis".  This groundbreaking article named seven definitive dimensions to the approach of behavior analysis. The seven dimensions state that "work in the field should be applied, behavioral, analytic, technological, conceptually systematic, effective and capable of generalized effects." (pp.&amp;nbsp;406). Twenty years later, Baer et al. published an updated version, "Some still current dimensions of applied behavior analysis" (pp.&amp;nbsp;406).  The seven dimensions had not changed, only elaborated on, throughout the years.

==Later work==

The following comes from Hains (1989), unless otherwise stated. Baer published hundreds of articles and books.  He coauthored a paper with an associate, Ann H. Hains, in 1989 on experimental design entitled "Interaction effects in multi-element designs: Inevitable, desirable, and ignorable".  In this paper, Baer addressed the single mindedness of the authors of single-subject research design books.  He stated that these researchers only investigated the effectiveness of treatments in alteration and never examined whether the treatments interact.  Baer proposed that single subject designs can and should be used to study not only separate effects but also interactions between the two conditions.  Don Baer always seemed to be thinking ahead of his time.

Developing new techniques and approaches for teaching developmentally delayed children was Baer's passion (Anonymous, 2002).  He wrote many articles analyzing the current public education system and ways to improve their methods (Anonymous, 2002). The following comes from Warren et al. (1981), unless otherwise stated.  One of his most read articles is titled "Generalization and maintenance of question-asking by severely retarded individuals".  This article states the importance of establishing question asking strategies with developmentally delayed children.

Normal children develop simple question-asking (e.g. "What's that") in early infancy (pp.&amp;nbsp;15).  Severely retarded children usually have great difficulty developing this skill.  Initial training for this strategy is costly and time consuming for school systems.  Despite the vast amount of time spent with the children, they can easily lose this ability.  Baer and colleagues urged school systems to establish maintenance programs to help developmentally delayed children to continue and improve on their question-asking strategy.  By maintaining this ability with the children, they will not only improve question-asking but save the school system valuable time and money from remedial training.

==Honors==
Donald M. Baer was an influential leader of the department of Applied Behavior Science at the University of Kansas.  He advised over 100 doctoral students while at Kansas, in addition to countless other graduate students.  He contributed to the Bureau of Child Research, now known as the Schiefelbusch Lifespan Institute (LSI).  The program was successful, receiving years of funding from the National Institute of Mental Health.  The Institute was also the first to obtain an award from the Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis (SABA) for its contributions to the field.

==Awards==
Baer won the Edgar A. Doll Award for his assistance to those with developmental disorders.  In 1987 he was awarded the Don Hake Award from Division 25 of the American Psychological Association.  In 1997, he won the award for Distinguished Service to Behavior Analysis from SABA.  Baer served as president of the Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior from 1983 to 1984.  He served as an editor for the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis (1970–1971).  As well as serving as an associated editor of the American Journal of Mental Deficiency.  Baer also spent much time traveling to other countries, including [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and [[Spain]], while serving as a distinguished visiting professor.

He died April 28, 2002 of [[heart failure]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]].  His ashes are buried at Pioneer Cemetery in Lawrence, Kansas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">'''Equation-free modeling''' is a method for [[multiscale computation]] and [[computer-aided analysis]]. It is designed for a class of complicated systems in which one observes evolution at a macroscopic, coarse scale of interest, while accurate models are only given at a finely detailed, microscopic, level of description. The framework empowers one to perform macroscopic computational tasks (over large space-time scales) using only appropriately initialized microscopic simulation on short time and small length scales. The methodology eliminates the derivation of explicit macroscopic [[evolution equation]]s when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form; hence the term equation-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last1=Kevrekidis |first1=I.G.|authorlink=Yannís G.

==Introduction==
In a wide range of chemical, physical and biological systems, coherent macroscopic behavior emerges from interactions between microscopic entities themselves (molecules, cells, grains, animals in a population, agents) and with their environment. Sometimes, remarkably, a coarse-scale differential equation model (such as the [[Navier-Stokes equations]] for fluid flow, or a [[reaction-diffusion system]]) can accurately describe macroscopic behavior.  Such macroscale modeling makes use of general principles of conservation (atoms, particles, mass, momentum, energy), and closed into a well-posed system through phenomenological [[constitutive equations]] or [[equations of state]].  However, one increasingly encounters [[complex systems]] that only have known microscopic, fine scale, models. In such cases, although we observe the emergence of coarse-scale, macroscopic behavior, modeling it through explicit closure relations may be impossible or impractical. [[Non-Newtonian fluid]] flow, [[chemotaxis]], [[porous media]] transport, [[epidemiology]], brain modeling and neuronal systems are some typical examples.  Equation-free modeling aims to use such microscale models to predict coarse macroscale emergent phenomena.

Performing coarse-scale computational tasks directly with fine-scale models is often infeasible: direct simulation over the full space-time domain of interest is often computationally prohibitive. Moreover,  modeling tasks, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, are often impossible to perform on the fine-scale model directly: a coarse-scale steady state may not imply a steady state for the fine-scale system, since individual molecules or particles do not stop moving when the gas density or pressure become stationary. Equation-free modeling circumvents such problems by using short bursts of appropriately initialized fine-scale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Kevrekidis, I.G. |year=2003 |title=Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks |journal=Comm. Math. Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=715–762 |mr=2041455 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The coarse time-stepper==
Dynamic problems invoke the coarse time-stepper.   In essence, short bursts of computational experiments with the fine-scale simulator estimate local time derivatives. Given an initial condition for the coarse variables &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt;, the coarse time-stepper involves four steps:

* Lifting, creates microscale initial conditions &lt;math&gt;u(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;, consistent with the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k)&lt;/math&gt;;
* Simulation, uses the microscale simulator to compute the microscale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; at over a short interval &lt;math&gt;t_k\leq t \leq t_k+\delta t&lt;/math&gt;;
* Restriction, obtains the macrostate &lt;math&gt;U(t_k+\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from the fine-scale state &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt;;
* the Time-step, extrapolation of macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;t_k&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;t_{k+1}=t_k+\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; predicts the state a macrotime in the future.

Multiple time steps simulates the system into the macro-future.
If the microscale model is stochastic, then an ensemble of microscale simulations may be needed to obtain sufficiently good extrapolation in the time step.  Such a coarse time-stepper may be used in many algorithms of traditional continuum numerical analysis, such as numerical bifurcation analysis, optimization, control, and even accelerated coarse-scale simulation.

Traditionally, algebraic formulae determine time derivatives of the coarse model. In our approach, the macroscale derivative is estimated by the inner microscale simulator, in effect performing a closure on demand.  A reason for the name ''equation-free'' is by analogy with matrix-free numerical linear algebra;&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Kelley. ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'', SIAM, Philadelphia, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the name emphasizes that  macro-level equations are never constructed explicitly in closed form.

===Restriction===
The restriction operator often follows directly from the specific choice of the macroscale variables. For example, when the microscale model evolves an ensemble of many particles, the restriction typically computes the first few moments of the particle distribution (the density, momentum, and energy).

===Lifting===
The lifting operator is usually much more involved. For example, consider a particle model: we need to define a mapping from a few low order moments of the particle distribution to initial conditions for each particle. The assumption that a relation exists that closes in these low order, coarse, moments, implies that the detailed microscale configurations are functionals of the moments (sometimes referred to as slaving &lt;ref&gt;H. Haken. Slaving principle revisited. ''Physica D'', 97:95–103, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;).  We assume this relationship is established/emerges on time scales that are fast compared to the overall system evolution (see [[slow manifold]] theory and applications &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts. Effectively model dynamics, deterministic and stochastic, across multiple space and time scales. In J. G. Hartnett and P. C. Abbott, editors, ''Frontiers of Fundamental and Computational Physics: 10th International Symposium'', volume 1246, pages 75–87. AIP, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Unfortunately, the closure (slaving relations) are algebraically unknown (as otherwise the coarse evolution law would be known).

Initializing the unknown microscale modes randomly introduces a lifting error: we rely on the separation of macro and micro time scales to ensure a quick relaxation to functionals of the coarse macrostates (healing). A preparatory step may be required, possibly involving microscale simulations constrained to keep the macrostates fixed.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryckaert, G. Ciccotti, and H. Berendsen. Numerical integration of the Cartesian equation of motion of a system with constraints: molecular dynamics of N-alkanes. ''J. Comput. Phys.'', 23:237, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; When the system has a unique fixed point for the unknown microscale details conditioned upon the coarse macrostates,  a constrained runs algorithm may perform this preparatory step using only the microscale time-stepper.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Gear, T. J.  Kaper, I. G. Kevrekidis, and A. Zagaris. Projecting to a Slow Manifold: Singularly Perturbed Systems and Legacy Codes. ''SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems'' 4(3):711–732, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===An illustrative example===
A toy problem illustrates the basic concepts.  For example, consider the [[differential equation]] system for two variables &lt;math&gt;(U(t),u(t))&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dU}{dt}=-U-u+2\,,\quad \frac{du}{dt}=100(U^3-u).&lt;/math&gt;
Capital &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the presumed macroscale variable, and lowercase &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; the microscale variable. This classification means that we assume a coarse model of the form &lt;math&gt;dU/dt=G(U)&lt;/math&gt; exists, although we do not necessarily know what it is.   Arbitrarily define the lifting from any given macrostate &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;(U,u)=(U,0.5)&lt;/math&gt;. A simulation using this lifting and the coarse time-stepper is shown in the figure.
[[File:EquationFreeProjectiveIntegration.png|400px|thumb|Equation-free coarse time-stepper applied to the illustrative example differential equation system using &lt;math&gt;\delta t=0.1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U(0)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.]]

The solution of the differential equation rapidly moves to the [[slow manifold]]  &lt;math&gt;u\approx U^3&lt;/math&gt; for any initial data. The coarse time-stepper solution would agree better with the full solution when the 100 factor is increased. The graph shows the lifted solution (blue solid line) &lt;math&gt;(U,u)&lt;/math&gt;. At times &lt;math&gt;t=n\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is restricted and then lifted again, which here is simply setting &lt;math&gt;u(n\delta t)=0.5&lt;/math&gt;. The slow manifold is shown as a  red line. The right plot shows the time derivative of the restricted solution as a function of time (blue curve), as well as the time derivative &lt;math&gt;dU/dt&lt;/math&gt; (the coarse time derivative), as observed from a full simulation (red curve).

===On application to concrete multiscale problems===
The equation-free approach has been applied to many examples. The examples illustrate the various ways to construct and assemble the algorithmic building blocks.  Numerical analysis establishes the accuracy and efficiency of this approach. Additional numerical analysis  on other methods of this type has also been done.&lt;ref&gt;W. E and B. Engquist (2003). The heterogeneous multiscale methods ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(1):87–132.&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying the equation-free paradigm to a real problem requires considerable care, especially defining the lifting and restriction operators, and the appropriate outer solver.

* The first challenge is to identify the macroscale observables.  They need to be complete enough so that the unknown microscale variables can be reliably reconstructed (lifted).  Physical arguments often the identify the macroscale observables.  Almost always one invokes densities, but there are some surprisingly simple examples where correlation functions are essential macroscale variables.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. Nature, 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; If not resorting to physical arguments, then modern data-mining or manifold learning techniques, such as Isomap or diffusion maps, may obtain the macroscale variables from microscale simulation.&lt;ref&gt;R. R. Coifman et al. (2005). Geometric diffusions as a tool for harmonic analysis and structure definition of data: Diffusion maps Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 102(21):7426–7431.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There should be a clear separation between the time-scales of the macroscale observables and the time-scales of the remaining microscale modes quasi-equilibrate given any macrostate.
* Knowing the macroscale observables might not be sufficient.  One strategy to obtain such information is the baby-bathwater scheme which uses only appropriately initialized simulations.&lt;ref&gt;J. Li, P. G. Kevrekidis, C. W. Gear and I. G. Kevrekidis (2003). Deciding the nature of the coarse equation through microscopic simulations: the baby-bathwater scheme ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 1(3):391–407.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse bifurcation analysis==
The recursive projection method&lt;ref&gt;G.M. Schroff and H.B. Keller (1993). Stabilization of unstable procedures: the recursive projection method ''SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis'' 30: 1099–1120.&lt;/ref&gt; enables the computation of [[bifurcation diagram]]s using legacy simulation code.  It also empowers the coarse time-stepper to perform equation-free bifurcation computations.  Consider the coarse time stepper in its effective form
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U^{n+1}=\vec S(\vec U^n,\lambda; \delta t),&lt;/math&gt;
which includes explicit dependence upon one or more parameters &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.  Bifurcation analysis computes [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibria]] or [[periodic orbit]]s, their stability and dependence upon parameter &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

Compute a coarse equilibrium as a [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]] of the coarse time stepper
:&lt;math&gt;\vec U-\vec S(\vec U,\lambda; \delta t)=\vec 0.&lt;/math&gt;
In the equation-free context, the recursive projection method is the outer solver of this equation, and the coarse time-stepper enables this method to be performed using fine scale dynamics.

Additionally, for problems where the macroscale has continuous symmetries, one can use a template based approach &lt;ref&gt;C. Rowley and J. Marsden (2000). Reconstruction equations and the Karhunen–Loève expansion for systems with symmetry ''Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena'' 142: 1–19.&lt;/ref&gt; to compute coarse [[self-similar]] or [[travelling wave]] solutions as fixed points of a coarse time-stepper that also encodes appropriate rescaling and/or shifting of space-time and/or solution.
For example, self-similar diffusion solutions may be found as the [[probability density function]] of detailed [[molecular dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Chen, P. Debenedetti, C.W. Gear, and I.G. Kevrekidis (2004). From molecular dynamics to coarse self-similar solutions: a simple example using equation-free computation ''Journal of Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics'' 120: 215–223.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative to the recursive projection method is to use Newton—Krylov methods.&lt;ref&gt;C.T. Kelley (1995). ''Iterative Methods for linear and nonlinear equations'' SIAM, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse projective integration==

The coarse time stepper accelerates simulation over large macroscale times. In the scheme described above, let the large macro-time-step &lt;math&gt;\Delta t\gg\delta t&lt;/math&gt;, and be on the time scale of the slow coarse dynamics.  Let the computed &lt;math&gt;U^n\approx U(n\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of the coarse variable, and let the microscale simulation compute &lt;math&gt;U^{n,k}\approx U(n\Delta t+k\delta t)&lt;/math&gt; from a local time simulation with initial condition that the coarse variable &lt;math&gt;U(n\Delta t)=U^n=U^{n,0}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then we approximate &lt;math&gt;U((n+1)\Delta t)&lt;/math&gt; via extrapolating over a gap by
:&lt;math&gt;U^{n+1}=U^{n,k}+(\Delta t-k\delta t)F(\vec U^n)&lt;/math&gt;
where, for example, simple linear extrapolation would be 
:&lt;math&gt;F(\vec U^n)=(U^{n,k}-U^{n,k-1})/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;
This scheme is the called coarse projective forward Euler, and is the simplest in the class.

The &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; steps taken before the extrapolation reflect that we must allow the system to settle onto a quasi-equilibrium (from the microscale point of view), so that we can make a reliable extrapolation of the slow dynamics.  Then the size of the projective integration step is limited by stability of the slow modes.&lt;ref&gt;C.W. Gear and I.G. Kevrekidis. Projective methods for stiff differential equations: problems with gaps in their eigenvalue spectrum . ''SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing'' 24(4):1091–1106, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevrekidis and  Theodoropoulos. Coarse integration/bifurcation analysis via microscopic simulators: micro-Galerkin methods ''Computers and Chemical Engineering'' 26: 941–963, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher order schemes for systems where the microscale noise is still apparent on the macroscale time step are more problematic.&lt;ref&gt;X.

==Patch dynamics==

The spatial analogue of projective integration is the gap-tooth scheme.
The idea of the gap-tooth scheme is to perform simulations of small patches of space, the teeth, separated by unsimulated space, the gaps.
By appropriately coupling the small patches of simulations we create a large scale, coarse level, simulation of the spatially extended system.
When the microscale simulator is computationally expensive the gap-tooth scheme empowers efficient large scale prediction.
Furthermore, it does this without us ever having to identify an algebraic closure for a large scale model.
&lt;ref&gt;Kevrekidis, I.G. et al. (2003). Equation-free, coarse-grained multiscale computation: enabling microscopic simulators to perform system-level tasks ''Comm. Math. Sciences'' 1(4): 715–762.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samaey, G.; Roose, D. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2005). The gap-tooth scheme for homogenization problems ''SIAM Multiscale Modeling and Simulation'' 4: 278–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"&gt;Roberts, A.J. and Kevrekidis, I.G. (2007). General tooth boundary conditions for equation free modelling ''SIAM J. Scientific Computing'' 29(4): 1495–1510.&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of the gap-tooth scheme with coarse projective integration is called patch dynamics.

===Coupling boundary conditions===

The key to the gap-tooth and patch scheme is the coupling of the small patches across unsimulated space.
Surprisingly, the generic answer is to simply use classic Lagrange interpolation, whether in one dimension&lt;ref name="Roberts2007"/&gt; or multiple dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Roberts, T. MacKenzie, and J. Bunder. A dynamical systems approach to simulating macroscale spatial dynamics in multiple dimensions. ''J. Engineering Mathematics'', 86(1):175–207, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This answer is related to the coupling in [[holistic discretization]] and theoretical support provided by the theory of [[slow manifold]]s.
The interpolation provides value or flux boundary conditions as required by the microscale simulator.  
High order consistency between the macroscale gap-tooth/patch scheme and the microscale simulation is achieved through high order Lagrange interpolation.

However, commonly the microscale is a noisy particle based or [[agent-based model]].
In such cases the relevant macroscale variables are averages such as mass and momentum density. 
Then one generally has to form averages over a core of each tooth/patch, and apply the coupling condition over a finite action region on the edges of each tooth/patch.
The provisional recommendation is to make these regions as big as half the tooth/patch.&lt;ref&gt;J. E. Bunder, A. J. Roberts, and I. Kevrekidis. Better buffers for patches in macroscale simulation of systems with microscale randomness. Technical report, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1415], Dec 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
That is, for efficiency one makes the microscale tooth/patch as small as possible, but limited by the need to fit in action and core regions big enough to form accurate enough averages.

===Lifting===

Patch dynamics is the combination of the gap-tooth scheme and coarse projective integration.  Just as for normal projective integration, at the start of each burst of microscale simulation, one has to create an initial condition for each patch that is consistent with the local macroscale variables, and the macroscale gradients from neighboring interpolated patches.  The same techniques suffice.

==Open problems and future directions==

Assumptions and choices about the macroscale evolution are crucial in the equation-free scheme.  The key assumption is that the variables we choose for the macroscale coupling must effectively close on the chosen macroscale.  If the chosen macroscale length is too small then more coarse scale variables may be needed: for example, in fluid dynamics we conventionally close the PDEs for density, momentum and energy; yet in high speed flow especially at lower densities we need to resolve modes of molecular vibration because they have not equilibrated on the time scales of the fluid flow.  Qualitatively the same considerations apply to the equation-free approach.

For many systems appropriate coarse variables are more-or-less known by experience.  However, in complex situations there is a need to automatically detect the appropriate coarse variables, and then use them in the macroscale evolution.  This needs much more research utilizing techniques from data mining and manifold learning.  In some problems it could be that as well as densities, the appropriate coarse variables also need to include spatial correlations, as in the so-called Brownian bugs.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Young, A. J. Roberts, and G. Stuhne. Reproductive pair correlations and the clustering of organisms. ''Nature'', 412:328–331, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The macroscale may have to be treated as a stochastic system, but then the errors are likely to be much larger and the closures more uncertain.

'''Erosion control''' is the practice of preventing or controlling wind or water [[erosion]] in [[agriculture]], [[land development]], [[coast|coastal areas]], [[Bank (geography)|river banks]] and [[construction]]. Effective erosion controls handle [[surface runoff]] and are important techniques in preventing [[water pollution]], [[soil erosion|soil loss]], wildlife [[habitat loss]] and human [[property]] loss.

==Usage==
Erosion controls are used in natural areas, agricultural settings or urban environments. In urban areas erosion controls are often part of [[stormwater]] runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve the creation of a physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining [[storm drain]]s. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with [[sediment control]]s such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.

[[Bank erosion]] is a natural process: without it, rivers would not meander and change course. However, land management patterns that change the hydrograph and/or vegetation cover can act to increase or decrease channel migration rates. In many places, whether or not the banks are unstable due to human activities, people try to keep a river in a single place. This can be done for environmental reclamation or to prevent a river from changing course into land that is being used by people. One way that this is done is by placing riprap or gabions along the bank.

==Mathematical modeling==
Since the 1920s and 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Horton. 1933&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have been creating [[mathematical model]]s for understanding the mechanisms of soil erosion and resulting sediment [[surface runoff]], including an early paper by [[Albert Einstein]] applying [[Baer's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein. 1926&lt;/ref&gt; These models have addressed both gully and sheet erosion. Earliest models were a simple set of linked equations which could be employed by manual calculation. By the 1970s the models had expanded to complex [[computer model]]s addressing [[nonpoint source pollution]] with thousands of lines of computer code.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The more complex models were able to address nuances in micrometeorology, soil particle size distributions and micro-terrain variation.

In vision, '''filling-in''' phenomena are those responsible for the completion of missing information across the [[blind spot (vision)|physiological blind spot]], and across natural and artificial [[scotomata]]. There is also evidence for similar mechanisms of completion in normal visual analysis. Classical demonstrations of perceptual filling-in involve filling in at the blind spot in monocular vision, and images stabilized on the retina either by means of special lenses, or under certain conditions of steady fixation. For example, naturally in monocular vision at the physiological blind spot, the percept is not a hole in the visual field, but the  content is “filled-in” based on information from the surrounding visual field. When a textured stimulus is presented centered on but extending beyond the region of the blind spot, a continuous texture is perceived. This partially inferred percept is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. (Ehinger ''et al.'' 2017).

A second type of example relates to entirely stabilized stimuli. Their colour and lightness fade until they are no longer seen and the area fills in with the colour and lightness of the surrounding region. A famous example of fading under steady fixation is [[Troxler's fading]]. When steadily fixating on the central dot for many seconds, the peripheral annulus will fade and will be replaced by the colour or texture of the background. Since the adapted region is actively filled-in with background colour or texture, the phenomenon cannot be fully explained by local processes such as adaptation.

There is general agreement that edges play a central role in determining the apparent colour and [[lightness]] of surfaces through similar filling-in mechanisms. However, the way in which their influence is performed is still unclear. Two different theories have been put forward to explain the filling-in completion phenomenon.

One theory, addressed as the "isomorphic filling-in theory" according to the definition of Von der Heydt, Friedman ''et al.'' (2003), postulates that perception is based on an image representation held in a two dimensional array of neurons, typically arranged retinotopically, in which colour signals spread in all directions except across borders formed by contour activity. The process is thought to be analogous to physical diffusion, with contours acting as diffusion barriers for the colour and [[brightness]] signals. An alternative hypothesis is that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Form and colour would be derived at a subsequent stage, not as the result of an isomorphic filling-in process, but as an attribute of an object or proto-object. This theory is called the symbolic filling-in theory.

According to the isomorphic filling-in theory, colour is represented by the activity of cells whose receptive fields point at the surface, but it is assumed that these cells receive additional activation through horizontal connections that keeps their activity level high despite mechanisms of lateral inhibition tending to suppress surface activity and despite the transient nature of the afferent signals. The lateral activation comes from receptive fields at contrast borders. These signals are strong because receptive fields are exposed to contrast, and reliable because the border produces continuous light modulation even during fixation, due to small residual eye movements. In the alternative symbolic hypothesis, there is no spreading of activity, but all the information would be carried by the relevant features, that would be tagged with information on contrast polarity, colour and lightness of the surfaces they enclose. Despite the many attempts to verify the two different models by psychophysical and physiological experiments, the mechanisms of colour and lightness filling-in are still debated.

==Isomorphic filling-in==
There are at least three different kinds of experiments whose results support the idea that a real spreading of neural activity in early visual areas is the basis for filling-in of visual information.

===Recordings from cells of the blind spot representation in monkey striate cortex===
Komatsu and colleagues (Komatsu et al., 2000) recorded activity of cells of the blind spot representation in monkey [[striate cortex]] (area V1) and found some cells, in layers 4–6, that responded to large stimuli covering the blind spot (the condition under which filling-in is perceived), but not to small stimuli near the blind spot. A neuronal circuitry seems to exist that elaborates and transmits colour and brightness information through the blind region.

Though intriguing, these results cannot be easily generalized to similar phenomena, such as the filling-in of [[illusory contours]] or the filling-in through artificial scotomata or adapted edges (such as in the Troxler's effect). All these phenomena are indeed similar, and probably rely on similar neural circuitries but they are not identical. For instance, an obvious difference between filling-in across the blind spot and filling-in of occluded edges is that filling-in across the blind spot is modal (i.e. you literally see the filled-in section), while filling-in across occluders is [[amodal perception|amodal]]. Filling-in across the blind spot was found to be different also from filling-in across cortical scotomata in two patients examined by Ramachandran (Ramachandran 1992; Ramachandran, Gregory ''et al.'' 1993). In these subjects, some features filled in the scotoma faster than others, and in some circumstances filling-in took some seconds before it was completed (while filling-in across the blind spot is immediate). Together these data suggested that mechanisms for the filling-in of colours, motion and texture can be dissociated and may correspond to processes in higher-order areas that are specialized for these attributes.

===Delayed masking psychophysical experiments===
Striking evidence implying a spreading of neural activity like the one postulated by isomorphic filling-in theory is given by experiments of backward masking after brief presentations of uniform surfaces or textures. The working hypothesis of these experiments is that if a response initially biased toward the boundaries fills-in to represent the interiors of uniform surfaces, it may be possible to interfere with the filling-in process and leave the percept at an incomplete stage.

Paradiso and Nakayama (1991) performed an experiment to verify this hypothesis. They presented a large disk of uniform brightness on a black background. The stimulus was briefly flashed and, after a variable stimulus offset asynchrony, a masking stimulus was presented. The mask consisted of a circle on a black background with the masking contours positioned within the boundaries of the large uniform disk. This experiment is grounded on the assumption that filling-in consists of a spreading of neural activity from the boundaries of luminance and through the surfaces, that is stopped when another luminance-contrast border is reached (this is proposed by many models of brightness perception, see for example Walls 1954, Gerrits and Vendrik 1970, Cohen and Grossberg 1984), and that the process takes some time to be completed.

Subjects were asked to match the brightness at the centre of the disk with a palette of grey scales. When the delay between target and mask presentation was long enough, the mask had no effect on the apparent brightness of the stimulus, but for stimulus offset asynchronies of 50–100&amp;nbsp;ms, the surface of the disk inside the masking annulus appeared unfilled. Moreover, the minimum target-mask delay at which the masking was effective increased with target size, suggesting that there would be a spreading phenomenon and that the farther the features delimiting a region, the more time is necessary for the filling-in to be completed. These results are supported also by further experiments on temporal limits of brightness induction in simultaneous contrast (De Valois, Webster ''et al.'' 1986; Rossi and Paradiso 1996; Rossi, Rittenhouse ''et al.'' 1996), as well as by a similar experiment performed by Motoyoshi (1999) on filling-in of texture.

===Recordings from striate cortex of cat===
An isomorphic filling-in theory calls for the existence of surface responsive neurons in early retinotopic visual areas. The activity of such neurons would be raised by elements capable of responding to the luminance of the surface also in the absence of edges; and would be strongly modulated by spreading of activity from the luminance borders enclosing the surface.

Electro-physiological recordings in [[retinal ganglion cell]]s, [[LGN]] and [[primary visual cortex]] showed that neurons of these areas responded to luminance modulation within the receptive field even in the absence of contrast borders.

In a second condition, a uniform grey patch was placed on the [[receptive field]] (extending 3–5 degrees beyond the receptive field boundary on either side), and two flanking patches modulated sinusoidally in time from dark to light. With such stimuli, the brightness of the central patch appears to modulate, despite the absence of luminance change. In this condition, cat retinal ganglion cells and lateral geniculate nucleus cells, having their receptive fields centred in the uniform grey patch, did not respond; on the other hand, primary visual cortex neurons were modulated by luminance changes far outside their receptive fields. Together, these results suggest that neurons in the retina and LGN are responsive to luminance modulation, but their response does not correlate with perceived brightness. On the other hand, striate neurons responded to stimulus conditions producing changes in brightness in the area corresponding to the receptive field.

The behaviour of primary visual cortex neurons seems to be in agreement with the one hypothesized by an isomorphic filling-in theory in that they both respond to luminance of the surfaces also in the absence of borders, and their activity is modulated by that of edges far outside the receptive field. Moreover, when the temporal frequency of luminance modulation in the surrounding patches exceeded a threshold value, the induced response disappeared, suggesting that it was the result of a spreading of activity, taking a finite time to happen, likely explainable in the context of isomorphic filling-in.

==Symbolic filling-in==
"Perceptual filling-in", in its simplest definition, is simply the filling-in of information that is not directly given to the sensory input. The missing information is inferred or extrapolated from visual data acquired in a different part of the visual field. Examples of filling-in phenomena include lightness assignment to surfaces from information of contrast across the edges and completion of features and textures across the blind spot, based on the features and textures that are detected in the visible part of the image. In this definition, it is clear that a filling-in process involves a rearrangement of visual information, in which activity in one region of the visual field (i.e. edges) is assigned to other regions (surfaces). In any event, the total amount of information available is not increased, being determined by the retinal input, and any rearrangement of information is useful only if it brings the information contained in the image into a form that is more easily analyzed by our brain.

Dennett and Kinsbourne (Dennett 1992; Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992) opposed to the idea that an active filling-in process would take place in our brain on philosophical grounds. They argued that such an idea would be the result of the false belief that in our brain there is a spectator, a sort of [[homunculus]] similar to ourselves, needing a filled-in image representation. From a scientific viewpoint, Dennett's homunculus may correspond to higher-order scene representation or decision-making mechanisms. The question is whether or not such mechanisms need a filled in, gap free representation of the image to function optimally (Ramachandran 2003).

The symbolic filling-in theory postulates that such a "homunculus" need not exist, and that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Surface form and colour are not coded at this stage, but would be derived only at a symbolic level of representation, as attributes of objects or proto-objects.

==Electrophysiology recordings from monkey primary visual cortex==
When experiencing perceptual filling-in, the colour of an adapted surface is gradually replaced by the colour or texture of outside the surface. Friedman ''et al.'' (Friedman 1998; Friedman, Zhou ''et al.'' 1999) performed an experiment aimed at determining if surface activity of cells in monkey primary visual cortex changed in accordance with perceptual change or simply followed the modulation of the colour presented to the retina. Stimuli consisted of a disk-ring configuration similar to that illustrating the Troxler effect, but where the inner and outer part of the annulus have two physically different colours. After a few seconds of (peripheral) fixation, the disk tends to disappear, whereas the outer contour of the ring is perceived much longer, and the area of the disk is filled-in with the colour of the ring (Krauskopf 1967). These stimuli where intermixed with control stimuli, in which the physical colour of the disk was gradually changed to that of the ring. The animals were instructed to signal a colour change, and their responses to control stimuli and to test stimuli were compared in order to determine if monkeys perceive colour filling-in under steady fixation like humans.

The authors recorded the activity of surface- and edge-cells (cells whose receptive fields pointed either to the filled-in surface or to the border between the disk and the ring) in the visual cortices V1 and V2 while the monkey was performing the filling-in task. The activity of surface-cells correlated with the physical stimulus change in both areas V1 and V2, but not with the perceived colour change induced by filling-in. The activity of edge-cells followed the stimulus contrast when the disk colour changed physically; when the colours were constant, the edge signals also decayed, but more slowly. Together, the data was incompatible with the isomorphic filling-in theory, which assumes that colour signals spread from the borders into uniform regions.

==fMRI experiments in human subjects==
The neuronal activity in different brain areas can be recorded in humans through non-invasive techniques, like [[fMRI]] (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Perna ''et al.'' (2005) used fMRI to investigate the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the [[Craik–O'Brien–Cornsweet illusion]]. These authors recorded the activity in different brain areas when observers were presented with a [[Tom N. Cornsweet|Cornsweet]] visual stimulus, and compared the activities with those elicited by a similar image, which however did not elicit any brightness filling-in.

Contrary to the predictions of isomorphic filling-in, these authors found an identical response to the stimulus that induced filling-in and to the control stimulus in early visual cortex.

Recently, Cornelissen ''et al.'' (2006) performed a similar experiment involving the simultaneous contrast illusion. These authors presented observers in an fMRI scan with simultaneous contrast stimuli composed of a central circle of uniform luminance and a peripheral region whose luminance was modulated in time (and also tested other conditions where the modulated and the constant regions were inverted). The brain activity was recorded in primary visual cortex in a retinotopic position corresponding to the perceptually filled-in region. Also in this condition, no activity was found at this level in response to the filled-in signal.

'''''Galateo: The Rules of Polite Behavior''''' (''Il Galateo, overo de' costumi''){{refn|group="nb"|Complete title: ''Trattato nel quale, sotto la persona d'un vecchio idiota ammaestrante un suo giovanetto, si ragiona de' modi che si debbono o tenere o schifare nella comune conversazione, cognominato Galateo overo de' costumi''}} by Florentine [[Giovanni Della Casa]] (1503–56) was published in [[Venice]] in 1558. A guide to what one should do and avoid in ordinary social life, this [[courtesy book]] of the Renaissance explores subjects such as dress, table manners, and conversation. It became so popular that the title, which refers to the name of one of the author’s distinguished friends, entered into the Italian language as a general term for social etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galateo|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/galateo/|work=Enciclopedia Treccani|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Della Casa did not live to see his manuscript’s widespread and lasting success, which arrived shortly after its publication. It was translated into French (1562), English (1576), Latin (1580), Spanish (1585), and German (1587), and has been read and studied in every generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Healey|first=Robin Patrick|title=Italian Literature Before 1900 in English Translation|year=2011|publisher=University of Toronto|pages=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Della Casa's work set the foundation for modern [[etiquette]] writers and authorities on [[manners]], such as “Miss Manners” [[Judith Martin]], [[Amy Vanderbilt]], and [[Emily Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==

In the twentieth century, scholars usually situated ''Galateo'' among the courtesy books and conduct manuals that were very popular during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pine-Coffin|first=R. S|title=Galateo: A New Translation.|year=1958|publisher=Penguin|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Castiglione’s celebrated ''Courtier'', other important Italian treatises and dialogues include [[Alessandro Piccolomini]]’s ''Moral institutione'' (1560), [[Luigi Cornaro]]’s  ''Treatise on the Sober Life'' (1558-1565), and [[Stefano Guazzo]]’s ''Art of Civil Conversation'' (1579). 

In recent years, attention has turned to the humor and dramatic flair of Della Casa’s book. It has been argued that the style sheds light on Shakespeare’s comedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrapodi|first=Michele|title=Italian Culture in the Drama of Shakespeare and His Contemporaries|year=2007|publisher=Ashgate|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Michele|first=Laura|title=Shakespeare: Una "Tempesta" Dopo L’altro|year=2005|publisher=Liguori|location=Napoli|pages=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When it first appeared in English translation by Robert Peterson in 1575, it would have been available in book stalls in Shakespeare's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce|title=Twelfth Night: Texts and Contexts|year=2001|publisher=Bedford|pages=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Greenblatt, author of ''Will in the World'', writes, "To understand the culture out of which Shakespeare is writing, it helps to read Renaissance courtesy manuals like Baldassare Castiglione’s famous Book of the Courtier (1528) or, still better, Giovanni della Casa’s ''Galateo or, The Rules of Polite Behavior'' (1558, available in a delightful new translation by M.F. Rusnak). It is fine for gentlemen and ladies to make jokes, della Casa writes, for we all like people who are funny, and a genuine witticism produces “joy, laughter, and a kind of astonishment.” But mockery has its risks. It is perilously easy to cross a social and moral line of no return." &lt;ref&gt;New York Review of Books, September 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Distinguished historians argue that ''Galateo'' should be read in the context of international European politics, and some contend that the work expresses an attempt to distinguish Italian excellence.  “During the half-century when Italy fell prey to foreign invasion (1494-1559) and was overrun by French, Spanish and German armies, the Italian ruling classes were battered by - as they often envisaged them - "barbarians". In their humiliation and laboured responses, Italian writers took to reflecting on ideals, such as the ideal literary language, the ideal cardinal, ideal building types, and the ideal general or field commander. But in delineating the rules of conduct, dress and conversation for the perfect gentleman, they were saying, in effect, "We are the ones who know how to cut the best figure in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Lauro Martines, Times Literary Supplement, August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; 

A skilled writer in Latin, Della Casa followed [[Erasmus]] in presenting a harmonious and simple morality based on [[Aristotle]]’s ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and notion of the mean, as well as other classical sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo: A Renaissance Treatise on Manners|year=2001|publisher=CRRS|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His treatise also reveals an obsession with graceful conduct and self-fashioning during the time of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Titian]]: “A man must not be content with doing good things, but he must also study to do them gracefully. Grace is nothing other than that luster which shines from the appropriateness of things that are suitably ordered and well arranged one with the other and together.”  The work has been edited in this light by such distinguished Italian scholars as Stefano Prandi, Emanuela Scarpa, and Giorgio Manganelli.

The work may be read in the context of what [[Norbert Elias]] called the “civilizing process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elias|first=Norbert|title=The Civilizing Process: The History of Manners|year=1969|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is generally agreed that, given the popularity and impact of ''Galateo'', the cultural elite of the Italian Renaissance taught Europe how to behave. Giulio Ferroni argues that Della Casa “proposes a closed and oppressive conformity, made of caution and hypocrisy, hostile to every manifestation of liberty and originality.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferroni|first=Giulio|title=Storia Della Letterature Italiana|year=1991|publisher=Einaudi|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others contend, on the contrary, that the work represents ambivalence, self-control, and a modern understanding of the individual in a society based on civility, [[intercultural competence]] and [[social networking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Harry|title=Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books|year=2000|publisher=Stanford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==

Della Casa addresses gentlemanly citizens who wish to convey a winning and attractive image. With a casual style and dry humor, he writes about everyday concerns, from posture to telling jokes to [[table manners]]. “Our manners are attractive when we regard others’ pleasure and not our own delight,” Della Casa writes.

Unlike [[Baldassare Castiglione]]’s ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'', the rules of polite behavior in ''Galateo'' are not directed to ideal men in a Renaissance court. Instead, Della Casa observes the ordinary habits of people who do not realize that clipping one’s nails in public is bad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=Hilary|title=Il Cortegiano and Il Galateo|journal=Modern Language Review|year=1947|volume=42|pages=457–466|doi=10.2307/3716799|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;   “One should not annoy others with such stuff as dreams, especially since most dreams are by and large idiotic,” we are advised.

Valentina D’Urso, Professor of Psychology and author of ''Le Buone Maniere'', writes, “The founding father of this literary genre, [Galateo] is an extraordinary read, lively and passionate.  One doesn’t know whether to admire more its rich style or the wisdom of the practical words of advice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Urso|first=Valentina|title=Le Buone Maniere|year=1997|publisher=Il Mulino|location=Bologna|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Language and Style==

The work was preceded by a short treatise on the same subject in Latin, ''De officiis inter tenuiores et potentiores amicos'' (1546). Latin at the time was the language of learned society, and Della Casa was a first-rate classicist and public speaker. The treatise opens with a Latinate ''conciossiacosaché'', which gained Galateo a reputation for being pedantic and labored. However, [[Giuseppe Baretti]] and poets such as [[Giacomo Leopardi]] ranked Della Casa alongside [[Machiavelli]] as a master of Italian prose style. "Una delle prose più eleganti e più attiche del secolo decimosesto," (one of the most elegant and Attic prose works of the sixteenth century) Leopardi said.  Della Casa’s ''Galateo'' is, in the words of scholar E. H. Wilkins, “still valuable…for the pleasant ease with which most of it is written, and for its common sense, its plentiful humor, and its general amenity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkins|first=E. H.|title=History of Italian Literature|year=1954|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Della Casa frequently alludes to [[Dante]] and more often to [[Boccaccio]], whose [[Decameron]] he evidently knew very well and whose style he imitates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bonora|first=Ettore|title=della prosa del Rinascimento. Il boccaccismo del "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|date=luglio–sett 1956|volume=133|issue=403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several comments on language in Galateo reflect the Tuscan language model proposed about the same time by Della Casa’s friend [[Pietro Bembo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Biow|first=Douglass|title=The culture of Cleanliness in Renaissance Italy|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=2006|pages=21–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of Galateo==
{{inappropriate person|section|date=January 2013}}
In the first chapter it is said that a gentleman should be at all times courteous, pleasant, and in manners beautiful. Although good manners may not appear as important as liberality, constancy, or magnanimity, they are nonetheless a virtue for achieving the esteem of others.  

One must not mention, do, or think anything that invokes images in the mind that are dirty or disreputable. One should not reveal by one's gestures that said person has just returned from the bathroom, do not blow one's nose and look into the handkerchief, avoid spitting and yawning. 

Della Casa tells his reader that outward appearance is very important, so clothes must be tailored and conform to prevailing custom, reflecting one’s social status. 

In Chapter 7, Della Casa deals with a pivotal subject - conversation: you have to talk about topics of interest to all present and show respect to everyone, avoiding anything that is base or petty. 

In Chapter 14 of the way we talk about the places where you are with other people and the first thing that the author discusses types of ceremonies, false flatteries, and fawning behavior. Another matter is whether the ceremonies are made to us: never refuse because it could be taken as a sign of arrogance.

Della Casa returns to illustrate the customs of conversation and public speaking.  Language should, as much as possible, be "orderly and well-expressed" so that the listener is able to understand what the speaker intends. In addition to the clarity of the words used, it is also important that they sound pleasant. Before talking about any topic, it is good to have it formed in your mind. It is not polite to interrupt someone while talking, nor to help him find his words.

In the last three chapters, the author writes about behaviour in general: what you do should be appropriate and done with grace.  A gentleman should never run, or walk too slowly. Della Casa brings us to behavior at the table, such as not scratching, not eating like a pig, not using a toothpick or sharing food.  In Della Casa’s vision, slight slips of decorum become [[taboo]].

==Publication history and reception==

It was probably first drafted during his stay at the Abbey of Saint Eustace at Nervesa, near Treviso, between 1551 and 1555.  ''Galateo'' was first published in Venice, and was edited by Erasmus Gemini in 1558. The first separate publication appeared in Milan a year later. 
The Vatican manuscript (formerly Parraciani Ricci), in Latin with autograph corrections, was edited and published by Gennaro Barbarisi in 1990. The manuscript contains neither the title nor the division into chapters. Many variants in the first edition are attributed to Erasmus Gemini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Di Benedetto|first=Arnaldo|title=Appunti sul "Galateo"|journal=Giornale storico della letteratura italiana|year=1995|volume=172:557-560|pages=481–508}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Spanish Galateo of Lucas Gracián Dantisco was very influential in the seventeenth century.  In the Enlightenment, the letters of Lord Chesterfield show the influence of Galateo, as does a self-help manuscript of George Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brookhiser|first=Richard|title=Rules of Civility: The 110 Precepts that Guided Our First President in War and Peace|year=2003|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first American edition was published in Baltimore in 1811, with a short appendix on how to slice and serve meats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Della Casa|first=Giovanni|title=Galateo, or, A treatise on politeness and delicacy of manners|year=1811|publisher=G.

'''Ilse Koch''' ({{IPA-de|kɔx|lang}}; [[née]] '''Margarete Ilse Köhler'''; 22 September 1906 – 1 September 1967, known as the '''Witch of Buchenwald''') was the wife of [[Karl-Otto Koch]], [[commandant]] of the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]] (1937–1941) and [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek]] (1941–1943). In 1947, she became one of the first prominent [[Nazi]]s tried by the [[U.S. military]].

After the trial received worldwide media attention, survivor accounts of her actions resulted in other authors describing her abuse of prisoners as sadistic, and the image of her as "the concentration camp murderess" was current in post-war [[Germany|German]] society.&lt;ref name="Przyrembel" /&gt; 

She was accused of taking souvenirs from the skin of murdered inmates with distinctive [[tattoo]]s, although those claims were rejected at both of her trials. She was known as "The Witch of Buchenwald" (''Die Hexe von Buchenwald'') by the inmates because of her cruelty and [[Wiktionary:lascivious#English|lasciviousness]] toward prisoners. In [[English language|English]], she is referred to as: "The Beast of Buchenwald",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan |last=Alban |title=Books Bound in Human Skin; Lampshade Myth? |url=http://hlrecord.org/?p=12516 |work=[[Harvard Law Record]] |date=10 November 2005 |accessdate=22 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Queen of Buchenwald",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cruel 'Queen of Buchenwald' given a permanent address |last=Boyle |first=Hal |work=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] |date=14 August 1947 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5R4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CSUEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2639%2C5958280 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buchenwald Queen must face German court on release |work=[[The Evening Independent]] |date=4 July 1949 |page=15 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xgNQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hFUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2323%2C5343119 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Red Witch of Buchenwald",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch, Red Witch of Buchenwald, on Trial |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=28 November 1950 |page=5 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/421613931.html?dids=421613931:421613931&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Nov+28%2C+1950&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Ilse+Koch%2C+Red+Witch+of+Buchenwald%2C+on+Trial&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=16 December 2012}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Life sentence for 'Red Witch' of Buchenwald |work=[[Lewiston Evening Journal]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=6 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=OkUpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I2cFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4894%2C1088893 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Butcher Widow",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Army seeks new charges against butcher widow |work=[[The Evening Independent]] |date=29 September 1948 |page=3 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KMALAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=k1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1384%2C987043 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more commonly, "The Bitch of Buchenwald".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich|author=William L.

==Early life==
Koch was born in [[Dresden]], Germany, the daughter of a factory foreman. She was known as a polite and happy child in her elementary school. At the age of 15, she entered an [[accountancy]] school. Later, she went to work as a bookkeeping clerk. At the time the economy of Germany had not yet recovered from Germany's defeat in [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. In 1932, she became a member of the rising [[Nazi Party]]. Through some friends in the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] and [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], she met [[Karl-Otto Koch]] in 1934, marrying him two years later.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1936, she began working as a guard and secretary at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]] near [[Berlin]], which her fiancé commanded, and was married the same year. In 1937 she came to Buchenwald when her husband was made Commandant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaustchronicle.org/StaticPages/117.html |title=The Holocaust Chronicle |work=1937: Quiet Before the Storm |page=117 |publisher=Holocaustchronicle.org |accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Buchenwald, Koch allegedly engaged in a gruesome experiment, where it was claimed that she ordered selected tattooed prisoners to be murdered and skinned to retrieve the tattooed parts of their bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buchenwald.de/1132|title=Lampenschirme aus Menschenhaut? - Gedenkstätte Buchenwald|first=Stiftung Gedenkstätte Buchenwald und|last=Mittelbau-Dora|publisher=buchenwald.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was allegedly done to help a prison doctor, {{illm|Erich Wagner|de|Erich Wagner (Arzt)}}, in his dissertation on tattooing and criminality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZxlfeGrIRPc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=795 "The most evil women in history"]. Discovery Channel, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, she built an indoor sports arena, which cost over 250,000 [[reichsmarks]] (approximately $62,500), most of which had been seized from the inmates. In 1941 Karl Otto Koch was transferred to [[Lublin]], where he helped establish the [[Majdanek concentration camp|Majdanek concentration and extermination camp]]. Ilse Koch remained at Buchenwald until 24 August 1943, when she and her husband were arrested on the orders of [[Josias von Waldeck-Pyrmont]], [[SS and Police Leader]] for [[Weimar]], who had supervisory authority over Buchenwald. The charges against the Kochs comprised private enrichment, [[embezzlement]], and the murder of prisoners to prevent them from giving testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Heinz Höhne |last=Höhne |first=Heinz |title=The Order of the Death's Head: A History of the SS |publisher=Penguin Books |year=2000 |isbn=9780141390123}} The author notes the irony that the SS prosecutor, [[Konrad Morgen]], investigated some cover-up murders of inmates in detail while being ignorant of, or willfully ignoring, the industrialized mass murder later alleged to have been going on in the camps further to the east.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilse Koch was imprisoned until 1944 when she was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her husband was found guilty and [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by an [[Hauptamt SS-Gericht|SS court]] in [[Munich]], and was executed by firing squad on 5 April 1945 in the court of the camp he once commanded. She went to live with her surviving family in the town of [[Ludwigsburg]], where she was arrested by U.S. authorities on 30 June 1945.

==First trial==
[[File:DachauerProzess.JPG|thumb|Ilse Koch at the U.S. Military Tribunal in [[Dachau]], 1947]]

Koch and 30 other accused were arraigned before the American military court at Dachau (General Military Government Court for the Trial of War Criminals) in 1947. Prosecuting her was future [[United States Court of Claims]] [[United States federal judge|Judge]] [[Robert Lowe Kunzig|Robert L. Kunzig]]. She was charged with "participating in a criminal plan for aiding, abetting and participating in the murders at Buchenwald".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Third Reich |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1991 |page=43 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch announced in the courtroom that she was eight months pregnant but on 19 August 1947, she was sentenced to life imprisonment for "violation of the laws and customs of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Yearbook of the European Convention on Human Rights |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PP1 |volume=5 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |year=1963 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mzxf11yq8o8C&amp;pg=PA126 126–136] |isbn=978-90-247-0949-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reduction of sentence==
Gen. [[Lucius D. Clay]] was the interim military governor of the [[American Zone]] in Germany, and he reduced the judgment to four years' imprisonment on 8 June 1948, after she had served two years of her sentence, on the grounds that "there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for extermination in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she possessed any articles made of human skin".&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25"&gt;{{cite journal |title=GERMANY: Very Special Present |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,859084,00.html#ixzz1JwxlL7xG |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 December 1950}} {{subscription required |date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; News of the reduced sentence did not become public until 16 September 1948, and Clay stood firm despite the ensuing uproar. [[Jean Edward Smith]] reported in his biography ''Lucius D. Clay: An American Life'' that the general maintained that the leather lamp shades were really made out of [[Goatskin (material)|goat skin]]. The book quotes a statement made by Clay years later:

{{quote|There was absolutely no evidence in the trial transcript, other than she was a rather loathsome creature, that would support the death sentence. I suppose I received more abuse for that than for anything else I did in Germany. Some reporter had called her the "Bitch of Buchenwald", had written that she had lamp shades made of human skin in her house. And that was introduced in court, where it was absolutely proven that the lampshades were made out of goatskin. In addition to that, her crimes were primarily against the German people; they were not war crimes against American or Allied prisoners ... Later she was tried by a German court for her crimes and sentenced to life imprisonment. But they had clear jurisdiction. We did not.}}

==Second trial==
Under the pressure of public opinion Koch was re-arrested in 1949 and tried before a [[West German]] court. The hearing opened on 27 November 1950 before the District Court at Augsburg and lasted seven weeks, during which 250 witnesses were heard, including 50 for the defense. Koch collapsed and had to be carried from the court in late December 1950,&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; and again on 11 January 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman decides against suicide Life demanded for Ilse Koch |work=[[The Spokesman-Review]] |date=12 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3DBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xuUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5602%2C3401594 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least four witnesses for the prosecution testified that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed, or had seen or been involved in the process of making [[Lampshades made from human skin|human-skin lampshades]] from tattooed skin.&lt;ref name="Time_1950-12-25" /&gt; However, this charge was dropped by the prosecution when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ilse Koch is given life term |work=[[Gettysburg Times]] |date=15 January 1951 |page=2 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0IElAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3fQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4254%2C5369899 |accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 January 1951, the Court pronounced its verdict, in a 111-page-long decision, for which Koch was not present in court.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt; It was concluded that the previous trials in 1944 and 1947 were not a bar to proceedings under the principle of ''[[ne bis in idem]]'', as at the 1944 trial Koch had only been charged with receiving, while in 1947 she had been accused of crimes against foreigners after 1 September 1939, and not with crimes against humanity of which Germans and Austrians had been defendants both before and after that date. She was convicted of charges of incitement to murder, incitement to attempted murder and incitement to the crime of committing grievous bodily harm, and on 15 January 1951 was sentenced to life imprisonment and permanent forfeiture of civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Arthur Lee |title=Die Hexe von Buchenwald: der Fall Ilse Koch |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PP1 |publisher=Böhlau Verlag |year=1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Slkfbe9ZEHEC&amp;pg=PA146 146] |language=German |isbn=978-3-412-10693-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koch appealed to have the judgment quashed, but the appeal was dismissed on 22 April 1952 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany|Federal Court of Justice]]. She later made several petitions for a pardon, all of which were rejected by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice. Koch protested her life sentence, to no avail, to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights|International Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scrapbookpages.com/DachauScrapbook/DachauTrials/IlseKoch.html|title=Ilse Koch on trial at Dachau for making human lamp shades at Buchenwald|website=www.scrapbookpages.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institutional Analysis and Development framework''' ('''IAD''') was developed by [[Elinor Ostrom]], an American [[political scientist]], also known as the first woman to receive the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom, Elinor]]. (1990) ''Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action''. New York: Cambridge University.&lt;/ref&gt; The IAD relates a set of concepts to help in the analysis of collective action problems that involve social structures, positions, and rules. Under the rational choice models, the IAD was devised in an attempt to ''explain and predict'' outcomes by formalising the structures, positions, and rules involved in collective choice problems. Thus, it can be seen as a [[Systematic sampling|systematic method]] to collect policy analysis functions similar to [[analytical technique|analytic technique]] commonly used in [[Physical science|physical]] and [[social science]]s and understand how institution operate and change over a period of time&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michael D.

=== Components of the framework ===
[[File:IAD framework diagram.png|thumb|400px|IAD framework diagram]]
Ostrom thought of the IAD as a "multi-level conceptual map" with which one could zoom in and out of particular hierarchical parts of the regularised interactions in an established social system. The IAD framework helps to perceive complex collective action problems by dividing them into 'action arenas', that are smaller pieces of practically understandable function.&lt;ref name="indiana" /&gt; The analyst assumes that the structure of the action situation is fixed in the short-term. For an action situation to exist, there must be "actors in positions" (the number of possible roles that are available in this recurring interaction situation)&lt;ref name="Understanding Institutional Diversity"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/chapters/s8085.pdf|title=Understanding Institutional Diversity|author=Elinor Ostrom|date=2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400831739|location=Princeton|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Actors have choices within the existing (rule) structure. In the study of outcomes from collective choice situations, actors are influenced by the institutional arrangements, the socio-economic conditions, and the physical environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Krister Andersson|title=Understanding decentralized forest governance: an application of the institutional analysis and development framework|url=http://sspp.proquest.com/archives/vol2iss1/0507-010.andersson.html|journal=Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3783">In algebra, the '''integral closure''' of an ideal ''I'' of a commutative ring ''R'', denoted by &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of all elements ''r'' in ''R'' that are integral over ''I'': there exist &lt;math&gt;a_i \in I^i&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;r^n + a_1 r^{n-1} + \cdots + a_{n-1} r + a_n = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
It is similar to the [[integral closure]] of a subring. For example, if ''R'' is a domain, an element ''r'' in ''R'' belongs to &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there is a finitely generated ''R''-module ''M'', annihilated only by ''r'', such that &lt;math&gt;r M \subset I M&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal of ''R'' (in fact, the integral closure of an ideal is always an ideal; see below.) ''I'' is said to be '''integrally closed''' if &lt;math&gt;I = \overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;.

The integral closure of an ideal appears in a theorem of [[David Rees (mathematician)|Rees]] that characterizes an [[analytically unramified ring]].

== Examples ==
*In &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}[x, y]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x^i y^{d-i}&lt;/math&gt; is integral over &lt;math&gt;(x^d, y^d)&lt;/math&gt;.
*[[Radical ideal]]s (e.g., prime ideals) are integrally closed. The intersection of integrally closed ideals is integrally closed.
*In a [[normal ring]], for any non-zerodivisor ''x'' and any ideal ''I'', &lt;math&gt;\overline{xI} = x \overline{I}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, in a normal ring, a principal ideal generated by a non-zerodivisor is integrally closed.
*Let &lt;math&gt;R = k[X_1, \ldots, X_n]&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial ring over a field ''k''. An ideal ''I'' in ''R'' is called [[monomial ideal|monomial]] if it is generated by monomials; i.e., &lt;math&gt;X_1^{a_1} \cdots X_n^{a_n}&lt;/math&gt;. The integral closure of a monomial ideal is monomial.

== Structure results ==
Let ''R'' be a ring. The [[Rees algebra]] &lt;math&gt;R[It] = \oplus_{n \ge 0} I^n t^n&lt;/math&gt; can be used to compute the integral closure of an ideal. The structure result is the following: the integral closure of &lt;math&gt;R[It]&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;R[t]&lt;/math&gt;, which is graded, is &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{n \ge 0} \overline{I^n} t^n&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, &lt;math&gt;\overline{I}&lt;/math&gt; is an ideal and &lt;math&gt;\overline{I} = \overline{\overline{I}}&lt;/math&gt;; i.e., the integral closure of an ideal is integrally closed. It also follows that the integral closure of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.

The following type of results is called the '''Briancon–Skoda theorem''': let ''R'' be a regular ring and {{mvar|I}} an ideal generated by {{mvar|l}} elements. Then &lt;math&gt;\overline{I^{n+l}} \subset I^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;n \ge 0&lt;/math&gt;.

A theorem of Rees states: let (''R'', ''m'') be a noetherian local ring. Assume it is [[formally equidimensional]] (i.e., the completion is equidimensional.). Then two ''m''-primary ideals &lt;math&gt;I \subset J&lt;/math&gt; have the same integral closure if and only if they have the same [[multiplicity of an ideal|multiplicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Swanson|2006|loc=Theorem 11.3.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5929">'''Interdiscourse''' is the implicit or explicit relations that a [[discourse]] has to other discourses. '''Interdiscursivity''' is the aspect of a discourse that relates it to other discourses. [[Norman Fairclough]] prefers the concept "orders of discourse". Interdiscursivity is often mostly an analytic concept, e.g. in Foucault and Fairclough. Interdiscursivity has close affinity to [[recontextualisation]] because interdiscourse often implies that elements are imported from another discourse.

The meaning of interdiscourse varies. It denotes at least three levels:

# In Courtine interdiscursivity means that ''a discourse has a relation to another discourse''. That is, a meaning which is close to the meaning of [[intertextuality]].
# In [[Norman Fairclough]] and Linell interdiscursive denotes ''relations between types of discourse'' such as genres.
# In [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Marc Angenot]], interdiscursive &lt;ref&gt;constellation/configuration interdiscursive, Foucault 1969: 88, 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; denotes ''relations between discursive formations'', that is, between large heterogeneous discursive entities, such as natural history and political economy during enlightenment. In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscourse is differences and equalities across [[discourse|discursive formations]].

An example (where 1. corresponds to a., etc.) illustrates the three levels: A minister of environment speaks in the parliament about a proposal.

*a. She refers to other specific speeches in the parliament about the proposal.
*b. She refers to a memorandum from her civil servants.
*c. She refers to scientific reports supporting the proposal.

The example illustrates that 2. and 3. are specific cases of 1, in the sense a-c all relate to another discourse. To avoid this, level 1. might be defined as relations to other discourses ''within'' the same discursive formation and type of discourse. Consequently, the definition of the levels depends on the definition of [[discourse|discursive formation]] and types of discourse, and the three levels may collapse to the extent that these concepts are not conceived. In short, the stratification of interdiscourse depends on the stratification of discourse.

==Power, ideology and interdiscursive configuration==

Level 2. and 3. may be conceived as particularly salient. This is explained in [[Marc Angenot]] and Bruce by reference to [[Bakhtin]]: In [[Bakhtin]]'s [[dialogism]], the utterance is the natural meaningful and finalised unit of speech, which others are supposed to respond to, that is, others ''interpret the utterance by situating it in a discursive context''. But, an utterance may be interpreted (contextualised) in various ways, and interdiscourse and interdiscursivity denote how certain such interpretations (and relations to other discourses) are socially more privileged than others. Since interdiscourse privileges certain interpretations, it has a close affinity to the concepts of [[ideology]], [[hegemony]] and [[power (sociology)]]. For Bakhtin/Voloshinov, signs are a reality that refracts another reality, that is, signs are ideological.&lt;ref&gt;Voloshinov 1973: 10&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the embedding of a discourse in an interdiscourse is an ideological interpretation of the discourse.

In [[Michel Foucault]], interdiscursivity is not bound to [[ideology]], but is a more open concept for analysing relations between [[discourse|discursive formations]], that is, mapping their interdiscursive configuration. Such analyses constitute a part of his [[discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Foucault 1969: 88-90&lt;/ref&gt;

The cogent and restrictive character of the interdiscourse is reflected in the concept of the ''primacy of interdiscourse''.&lt;ref&gt;Maingueneau 1991: 20&lt;/ref&gt; The interdiscourse is the sayable, the opposite of what cannot be enunciated (l'inénoncable). But, the interdiscourse has also primacy in the sense that it ''defines the relations between discursive entities (or formations) that are constitutive of the discursive entities''. What is acceptable discourse, is in many respects a matter of interdiscursivity at level 2 and 3, because the interdiscursive import and export relations constitute a worksharing between the discursive entities, and this frames what is acceptable discourse within each discursive entity: Generally, a discourse has little authority over what other discourses are assumed to speak of and will therefore accept imported form and content from the other discourses. On the other hand, when a discourse exports content to other discourses, there are expectations as to the exported form and content. Thus, the interdiscursive system shapes the discourses.

In [[mathematics]], the '''intersection''' ''A'' ∩ ''B'' of two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] ''A'' and ''B'' is the set that contains all elements of ''A'' that also belong to ''B'' (or equivalently, all elements of ''B'' that also belong to ''A''), but no other elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch05-rul.html |title=Stats: Probability Rules |publisher=People.richland.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For explanation of the symbols used in this article, refer to the [[table of mathematical symbols]].

==Basic definition==
[[File:Venn 0000 0001.svg|thumb|Intersection of three sets:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;~A \cap B \cap C&lt;/math&gt;]]
[[File:Venn diagram gr la ru.svg|thumb|Intersections of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[English alphabet|English]] and [[Russian alphabet|Russian]] alphabet, considering only the shapes of the letters and ignoring their pronunciation]]
[[File:PolygonsSetIntersection.svg|thumb|Example of an intersection with sets]]
The intersection of two sets ''A'' and ''B'', denoted by {{math|''A'' ∩ ''B''}}, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}}.
In symbols,

:&lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \{ x: x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is, ''x'' is an element of the intersection ''A'' ∩ ''B'' [[if and only if]] ''x'' is both an element of ''A'' and an element of ''B''.

For example:
* The intersection of the sets {1, 2, 3} and {2, 3, 4} is {2, 3}.
* The number 9 is {{em|not}} in the intersection of the set of [[prime number]]s {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...} and the set of [[odd numbers]] {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...}, because 9 is not prime.

Intersection is an [[associative]] operation; that is, for any sets ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', one has ''A'' ∩ (''B'' ∩ ''C'')&amp;nbsp;= (''A'' ∩ ''B'') ∩ ''C''.  Intersection is also [[Commutative property|commutative]]; for any ''A'' and ''B'', one has ''A'' ∩ ''B''&amp;nbsp;= ''B'' ∩ ''A.''  It thus makes sense to talk about intersections of multiple sets.  The intersection of ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', and ''D'', for example, is unambiguously written ''A'' ∩ ''B'' ∩ ''C'' ∩ ''D''.

Inside a universe ''U'' one may define the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; of ''A'' to be the set of all elements of ''U'' not in ''A''. Now the intersection of ''A'' and ''B'' may be written as the complement of the [[Union (set theory)|union]] of their complements, derived easily from [[De Morgan's laws]]:&lt;br&gt;
''A'' ∩ ''B'' = (''A''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ ''B''&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;

===Intersecting and disjoint sets===
We say that ''A intersects (meets) B at an element x'' if ''x'' belongs to ''A'' and ''B''. We say that ''A intersects (meets) B'' if ''A'' intersects B at some element. ''A'' intersects ''B'' if their intersection is [[inhabited set|inhabited]].

We say that ''A and B are disjoint'' if ''A'' does not intersect ''B''. In plain language, they have no elements in common. ''A'' and ''B'' are disjoint if their intersection is [[empty set|empty]], denoted &lt;math&gt;A\cap B=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the sets {1, 2} and {3, 4} are disjoint, while the set of even numbers intersects the set of [[Multiple (mathematics)|multiples]] of 3 at the multiples of 6.

==Arbitrary intersections==

The most general notion is the intersection of an arbitrary ''nonempty'' collection of sets.
If ''M'' is a [[empty set|nonempty]] set whose elements are themselves sets, then ''x'' is an element of the ''intersection'' of ''M'' if and only if [[universal quantification|for every]] element ''A'' of ''M'', ''x'' is an element of ''A''.
In symbols:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( x \in \bigcap_{A \in M} A \right) \Leftrightarrow \left( \forall A \in M, \ x \in A \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The notation for this last concept can vary considerably. [[Set theory|Set theorists]] will sometimes write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;''M''", while others will instead write "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''A''∈''M''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;''A''".
The latter notation can be generalized to "⋂&lt;!--U+22C2--&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;", which refers to the intersection of the collection {''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;: ''i''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''I''}.
Here ''I'' is a nonempty set, and ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is a set for every ''i'' in ''I''.

In the case that the [[index set]] ''I'' is the set of [[natural number]]s, notation analogous to that of an [[infinite product]] may be seen:

:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty} A_i.&lt;/math&gt;

When formatting is difficult, this can also be written "''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ''A''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∩ ...".  This last example, an intersection of countably many sets, is actually very common; for an example see the article on [[sigma algebra|σ-algebras]].

==Nullary intersection==

[[File:Multigrade operator AND.svg|thumb|[[Logical conjunction|Conjunctions]] of the arguments in parentheses&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The conjunction of no argument is the [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (compare: [[empty product]]); accordingly the intersection of no set is the [[universe (set theory)|universe]].]]
Note that in the previous section we excluded the case where ''M'' was the [[empty set]] (∅). The reason is as follows: The intersection of the collection ''M'' is defined as the set (see [[set-builder notation]])
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \{x : \forall A \in M, x \in A\}.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''M'' is empty there are no sets ''A'' in ''M'', so the question becomes "which ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s satisfy the stated condition?" The answer seems to be ''every possible x''. When ''M'' is empty the condition given above is an example of a [[vacuous truth]]. So the intersection of the empty family should be the [[universal set]] (the [[identity element]] for the operation of intersection) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, according to standard ([[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZFC]]) set theory, the universal set does not exist. A fix for this problem can be found if we note that the intersection over a set of sets is always a subset of the union over that set of sets. This can symbolically be written as
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A \subseteq \bigcup_{A \in M} A.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, we can modify the definition slightly to
:&lt;math&gt;\bigcap_{A \in M} A = \left\{x \in \bigcup_{A \in M} A : \forall A \in M, x \in A\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now if ''M'' is empty there is no problem. The intersection is the empty set, because the union over the empty set is the empty set. In fact, this is the operation that we would have defined in the first place if we were defining the set in ZFC, as except for the operations defined by the axioms (the [[power set]] of a set, for instance), every set must be defined as the subset of some other set or by [[Axiom schema of replacement | replacement]].

{{General relativity sidebar}}

The '''mathematics of general relativity''' is complex. In [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theories of motion, an object's length and the rate at which time passes remain constant while the object [[Acceleration|accelerates]], meaning that many problems in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian mechanics]] may be solved by [[algebra]] alone. In [[Theory of relativity|relativity]], however, an object's length and the rate at which time passes both change appreciably as the object's speed approaches the [[speed of light]], meaning that more variables and more complicated mathematics are required to calculate the object's motion. As a result, relativity requires the use of concepts such as [[Vector space|vector]]s, [[tensor]]s, [[pseudotensor]]s and [[curvilinear coordinates]].

For an introduction based on the example of particles following [[circular orbit]]s about a large mass, nonrelativistic and relativistic treatments are given in, respectively, [[Newtonian motivations for general relativity]] and [[Theoretical motivation for general relativity]].

==Vectors and tensors==
{{main|Euclidean vector|Tensor}}

===Vectors===
[[Image:Vector by Zureks.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of a typical vector.]]

In [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[engineering]], a '''Euclidean vector''' (sometimes called a '''geometric'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ivanov|2001}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''spatial vector''',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heinbockel|2001}}{{Citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; or – as here – simply a vector) is a geometric object that has both a [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] (or [[Norm (mathematics)#Euclidean norm|length]]) and direction. A vector is what is needed to "carry" the point {{math|''A''}} to the point {{math|''B''}}; the Latin word ''vector'' means "one who carries".&lt;ref&gt;From Latin ''vectus'', [[perfect participle]] of ''vehere'', "to carry".  For historical development of the word ''vector'', see {{OED|vector ''n.''}} and {{cite web|author = Jeff Miller| url = http://jeff560.tripod.com/v.html | title = Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of the vector is the distance between the two points and the direction refers to the direction of displacement from {{math|''A''}} to {{math|''B''}}. Many [[algebraic operation]]s on [[real number]]s such as [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[negation]] have close analogues for vectors, operations which obey the familiar algebraic laws of [[Commutative property|commutativity]], [[Associative property|associativity]], and [[Distributive property|distributivity]].

===Tensors===
[[Image:Components stress tensor cartesian.svg|300px|right|thumb|Stress, a second-order tensor. Stress is here shown as a series of vectors on each side of the box]]

A tensor extends the concept of a vector to additional dimensions. A [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], that is, a simple number without a direction, would be shown on a graph as a point, a zero-dimensional object. A vector, which has a magnitude and direction, would appear on a graph as a line, which is a one-dimensional object. A tensor extends this concept to additional dimensions. A two-dimensional tensor would be called a second-order tensor. This can be viewed as a set of related vectors, moving in multiple directions on a plane.

=== Applications ===

Vectors are fundamental in the physical sciences.  They can be used to represent any quantity that has both a magnitude and direction, such as [[velocity]], the magnitude of which is [[speed]]. For example, the velocity ''5 meters per second upward'' could be represented by the vector {{nowrap|(0, 5)}} (in 2 dimensions with the positive {{math|''y''}} axis as 'up'). Another quantity represented by a vector is [[force]], since it has a magnitude and direction. Vectors also describe many other physical quantities, such as [[displacement (vector)|displacement]], [[acceleration]], [[momentum]], and [[angular momentum]].  Other physical vectors, such as the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]], are represented as a system of vectors at each point of a physical space; that is, a [[vector field]].

Tensors also have extensive applications in physics:
* [[Electromagnetic tensor]] (or Faraday's tensor) in [[electromagnetism]]
* [[Finite deformation tensors]] for describing deformations and [[strain tensor]] for [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in [[continuum mechanics]]
* [[Permittivity]] and [[electric susceptibility]] are tensors in [[anisotropic]] media
* [[Stress–energy tensor]] in [[general relativity]], used to represent [[momentum]] [[flux]]es
* Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum [[angular momentum]] operator in [[spherical coordinates]]
* Diffusion tensors, the basis of [[diffusion tensor imaging]], represent rates of diffusion in biologic environments

=== Dimensions ===

In general relativity, four-dimensional vectors, or [[four-vector]]s, are required. These four dimensions are length, height, width and time. A "point" in this context would be an event, as it has both a location and a time. Similar to vectors, tensors in relativity require four dimensions. One example is the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].

=== Coordinate transformation ===

&lt;div style="float:right; border:1px solid black; padding:3px; margin-right: 1em; 
text-align:left"&gt;&lt;gallery widths=200px heights=200px&gt; 
Image:Transformation2polar_basis_vectors.svg|A vector {{math|'''v'''}}, is shown with two coordinate grids, {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. In space, there is no clear coordinate grid to use. This means that the coordinate system changes based on the location and orientation of the observer. Observer {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in this image are facing different directions.
Image:Transformation2polar contravariant vector.svg|Here we see that {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}} see the vector differently. The direction of the vector is the same. But to {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the vector is moving to its left. To {{math|''e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the vector is moving to its right.
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In physics, as well as mathematics, a vector is often identified with a [[tuple]], or list of numbers, which depend on some auxiliary coordinate system or [[frame of reference|reference frame]].  When the coordinates are transformed, for example by rotation or stretching of the coordinate system, then the components of the vector also transform. The vector itself has not changed, but the reference frame has, so the components of the vector (or measurements taken with respect to the reference frame) must change to compensate.

The vector is called [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|''covariant'' or ''contravariant'']] depending on how the transformation of the vector's components is related to the transformation of coordinates. 
* Contravariant vectors are "regular vectors" with units of distance (such as a displacement) or distance times some other unit (such as velocity or acceleration). For example, in changing units from meters to millimeters, a displacement of 1&amp;nbsp;m becomes 1000&amp;nbsp;mm.
* Covariant vectors, on the other hand, have units of one-over-distance (typically such as [[gradient]]). For example, in changing again from meters to millimeters, a gradient of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]/m becomes 0.001&amp;nbsp;K/mm.

In [[Einstein notation]], contravariant vectors and components of tensors are shown with superscripts, e.g. {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, and covariant vectors and components of tensors with subscripts, e.g. {{math|''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}}.  Indices are "raised" or "lowered" by multiplication by an appropriate matrix, often the identity matrix.

Coordinate transformation is important because relativity states that there is no one correct reference point in the universe. On earth, we use dimensions like north, east, and elevation, which are used throughout the entire planet. There is no such system for space. Without a clear reference grid, it becomes more accurate to describe the four dimensions as towards/away, left/right, up/down and past/future. As an example event, take the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. To a modern observer on [[Mount Rainier]] looking east, the event is ahead, to the right, below, and in the past. However, to an observer in medieval England looking north, the event is behind, to the left, neither up nor down, and in the future. The event itself has not changed, the location of the observer has.

==Oblique axes==

An oblique coordinate system is one in which the axes are not necessarily [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to each other; that is, they meet at angles other than [[right angle]]s. When using coordinate transformations as described above, the new coordinate system will often appear to have oblique axes compared to the old system.

==Nontensors==
{{see also|Pseudotensor}}

A nontensor is a tensor-like quantity that behaves like a tensor in the raising and lowering of indices, but that does not transform like a tensor under a coordinate transformation. For example, [[Christoffel symbols]] cannot be tensors themselves if the coordinates don't change in a linear way.

In general relativity, one cannot describe the energy and momentum of the gravitational field by an energy–momentum tensor. Instead, one introduces objects that behave as tensors only with respect to restricted coordinate transformations. Strictly speaking, such objects are not tensors at all. A famous example of such a pseudotensor is the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]].

==Curvilinear coordinates and curved spacetime==

[[Image:Cassini-science-br.jpg|thumb|right|250px|High-precision test of general relativity by the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] space probe (artist's impression): radio signals sent between the Earth and the probe (green wave) are [[Shapiro effect|delayed]] by the warping of [[space and time]] (blue lines) due to the [[Sun]]'s mass. That is, the Sun's mass causes the regular grid coordinate system (in blue) to distort and have curvature. The radio wave then follows this curvature and moves toward the Sun.]]

[[Curvilinear coordinates]] are coordinates in which the angles between axes can change from point to point. This means that rather than having a grid of straight lines, the grid instead has curvature.

A good example of this is the surface of the Earth. While maps frequently portray north, south, east and west as a simple square grid, that is not in fact the case. Instead, the longitude lines running north and south are curved and meet at the north pole. This is because the Earth is not flat, but instead round.

In general relativity, gravity has curvature effects on the four dimensions of the universe. A common analogy is placing a heavy object on a stretched out rubber sheet, causing the sheet to bend downward. This curves the coordinate system around the object, much like an object in the universe curves the coordinate system it sits in. The mathematics here are conceptually more complex than on Earth, as it results in [[Four-dimensional space|four dimensions]] of curved coordinates instead of three as used to describe a curved 2D surface.

==Parallel transport==
{{main|Parallel transport}}

[[Image:parallel displacement.svg|thumb|450px|right|Example: Parallel displacement along a circle of a three-dimensional ball embedded in two dimensions. The circle of radius {{math|''r''}} is embedded in a two-dimensional space characterized by the coordinates {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The circle itself is characterized by coordinates {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the two-dimensional space. The circle itself is one-dimensional and can be characterized by its arc length {{math|''x''}}. The coordinate {{math|''y''}} is related to the coordinate {{math|''x''}} through the relation {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r'' cos {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} and {{math|''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r'' sin {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}}. This gives {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|∂''x''}} {{=}} −sin {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} and {{math|{{sfrac|∂''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|∂''x''}} {{=}} cos {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}}}} In this case the metric is a scalar and is given by {{math|''g'' {{=}} cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}} + sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|''x''|''r''}} {{=}} 1}}. The interval is then {{math|''ds''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''g dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''dx''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The interval is just equal to the arc length as expected.]]

===The interval in a high-dimensional space===
In a [[Euclidean space]], the separation between two points is measured by the distance between the two points. The distance is purely spatial, and is always positive. In spacetime, the separation between two events is measured by the ''invariant interval'' between the two events, which takes into account not only the spatial separation between the events, but also their temporal separation. The interval, {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, between two events is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \Delta r^2 - c^2\Delta t^2 \,&lt;/math&gt;{{spaces|5}}(spacetime&amp;nbsp;interval),

where {{math|''c''}} is the speed of light, and {{math|Δ''r''}} and {{math|Δ''t''}} denote differences of the space and time coordinates, respectively, between the events. The choice of signs for {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} above follows the [[sign convention#Relativity|space-like convention (−+++)]]. A notation like {{math|Δ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} means {{math|(Δ''r'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The reason {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is called the interval and not {{math|''s''}} is that {{math|''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be positive, zero or negative.

Spacetime intervals may be classified into three distinct types, based on whether the temporal separation ({{math|''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Δ''t''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) or the spatial separation ({{math|Δ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}) of the two events is greater: time-like, light-like or space-like.

Certain types of [[world line]]s are called [[geodesic]]s of the spacetime – straight lines in the case of Minkowski space and their closest equivalent in the curved spacetime of general relativity. In the case of purely time-like paths, geodesics are (locally) the paths of greatest separation (spacetime interval) as measured along the path between two events, whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds, geodesics are paths of shortest distance between two points.&lt;ref&gt;This characterization is not universal: both the arcs between two points of a [[great circle]] on a sphere are geodesics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Cosmology and Gravitation |first1=Michael V. |last1=Berry |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |year=1989 |isbn=0-85274-037-9 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wTvFxXguod0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=wTvFxXguod0C&amp;pg=PA58 Extract of page 58, caption of Fig. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of geodesics becomes central in [[general relativity]], since geodesic motion may be thought of as "pure motion" ([[Fictitious force|inertial motion]]) in spacetime, that is, free from any external influences.

===The covariant derivative===

{{main|Covariant derivative}}

The covariant derivative is a generalization of the directional derivative from vector calculus. As with the directional derivative, the covariant derivative is a rule, which takes as its inputs: (1) a vector, {{math|'''u'''}}, (along which the derivative is taken) defined at a point {{math|''P''}}, and (2) a vector field, {{math|'''v'''}}, defined in a neighborhood of {{math|''P''}}. The output is a vector, also at the point {{math|''P''}}. The primary difference from the usual directional derivative is that the covariant derivative must, in a certain precise sense, be independent of the manner in which it is expressed in a coordinate system.

===Parallel transport===

Given the covariant derivative, one can define the [[parallel transport]] of a vector {{math|'''v'''}} at a point {{math|''P''}} along a curve {{math|''γ''}} starting at {{math|''P''}}. For each point {{math|''x''}} of {{math|''γ''}}, the parallel transport of {{math|'''v'''}} at {{math|''x''}} will be a function of {{math|''x''}}, and can be written as {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}}, where {{math|'''v'''(0) {{=}} '''v'''}}. The function {{math|'''v'''}} is determined by the requirement that the covariant derivative of {{math|'''v'''(''x'')}} along {{math|''γ''}} is 0. This is similar to the fact that a constant function is one whose derivative is constantly 0.

===Christoffel symbols===
{{main|Christoffel symbol}}

The equation for the covariant derivative can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols find frequent use in Einstein's theory of [[general relativity]], where [[spacetime]] is represented by a curved 4-dimensional [[Lorentz manifold]] with a [[Levi-Civita connection]]. The [[Einstein field equations]] – which determine the geometry of spacetime in the presence of matter – contain the [[Ricci tensor]]. Since the Ricci tensor is derived from the Riemann tensor, which can be written in terms of Christoffel symbols, a calculation of the Christoffel symbols is essential. Once the geometry is determined, the paths of particles and light beams are calculated by [[solving the geodesic equations]] in which the Christoffel symbols explicitly appear.

==Geodesics==
{{main|Geodesics in general relativity}}

In [[general relativity]], a '''geodesic''' generalizes the notion of a "straight line" to curved [[spacetime]]. Importantly, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force, is a particular type of geodesic. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.

In general relativity, gravity can be regarded as not a force but a consequence of a curved spacetime geometry where the source of curvature is the [[stress–energy tensor]] (representing matter, for instance).  Thus, for example, the path of a planet orbiting around a star is the projection of a geodesic of the curved 4-dimensional spacetime geometry around the star onto 3-dimensional space.

A curve is a geodesic if the [[tangent vector]] of the curve at any point is equal to the [[parallel transport]] of the [[tangent vector]] of the base point.

==Curvature tensor==
{{main|Riemann curvature tensor}}

The Riemann tensor tells us, mathematically, how much curvature there is in any given region of space. Contracting the tensor produces 3 different mathematical objects:

#The [[Riemann curvature tensor]]: {{math|''R&lt;sup&gt;ρ&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;σμν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, which gives the most information on the curvature of a space and is derived from derivatives of the [[metric tensor]]. In flat space this tensor is zero. 
#The [[Ricci tensor]]: {{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;σν&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, comes from the need in Einstein's theory for a curvature tensor with only 2 indices. It is obtained by averaging certain portions of the Riemann curvature tensor.
#The [[scalar curvature]]: {{math|''R''}}, the simplest measure of curvature, assigns a single scalar value to each point in a space. It is obtained by averaging the Ricci tensor.

The Riemann curvature tensor can be expressed in terms of the covariant derivative.

The Einstein tensor {{math|'''G'''}} is a rank-2 [[tensor]] defined over [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s.  In index-free notation it is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{R}-\tfrac12\mathbf{g}R,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''R'''}} is the [[Ricci tensor]], {{math|'''g'''}} is the [[metric tensor]] and {{math|''R''}} is the [[scalar curvature]]. It is used in the [[Einstein field equations]].

==Stress–energy tensor==
{{main|Stress–energy tensor}}
[[File:StressEnergyTensor contravariant.svg|right|250px|thumb|Contravariant components of the stress–energy tensor.]]

The '''stress–energy tensor''' (sometimes '''stress–energy–momentum tensor''' or '''energy–momentum tensor''') is a [[tensor]] quantity in [[physics]] that describes the [[density]] and [[flux]] of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] in [[spacetime]], generalizing the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]] of Newtonian physics. It is an attribute of [[matter]], [[radiation]], and non-gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]]s. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the [[gravitational field]] in the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], just as mass density is the source of such a field in [[Newtonian gravity]].

==Einstein equation==

{{main|Einstein field equations}}
The '''Einstein field equations''' ('''EFE''') or '''Einstein's equations''' are a set of 10 [[equation]]s in [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]] which describe the [[fundamental interaction]] of [[gravitation]] as a result of [[spacetime]] being [[curvature|curved]] by [[matter]] and [[energy]].&lt;ref name=ein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein |first=Albert |title=The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Annalen der Physik]] |volume=354 |issue=7 |pages=769 |year=1916 |publisher= |url=http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |doi=10.1002/andp.19163540702 |format=[[PDF]] |id= |accessdate= |bibcode=1916AnP...354..769E |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829045130/http://www.alberteinstein.info/gallery/gtext3.html |archivedate=2006-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; First published by Einstein in 1915&lt;ref name=Ein1915&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einstein| first=Albert| authorlink = Albert Einstein| date=November 25, 1915| title=Die Feldgleichungen der Gravitation| journal=Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin| pages=844–847 | url=http://nausikaa2.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/cgi-bin/toc/toc.x.cgi?dir=6E3MAXK4&amp;step=thumb | accessdate=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[tensor equation]], the EFE equate local spacetime [[curvature]] (expressed by the [[Einstein tensor]]) with the local energy and [[momentum]] within that spacetime (expressed by the [[stress–energy tensor]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The Einstein Field Equations can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu \nu}= {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''G&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[Einstein tensor]] and {{math|''T&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the [[stress–energy tensor]].

This implies that the curvature of space (represented by the Einstein tensor) is directly connected to the presence of matter and energy (represented by the stress–energy tensor).

==Schwarzschild solution and black holes==
{{main|Schwarzschild metric}}
In [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], the '''Schwarzschild metric''' (also '''Schwarzschild vacuum''' or '''Schwarzschild solution'''),  is a solution to the [[Einstein field equations]] which describes the [[gravitational field]] outside a spherical mass, on the assumption that the [[electric charge]] of the mass, the [[angular momentum]] of the mass, and the universal [[cosmological constant]] are all zero. The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many [[star]]s and [[planet]]s, including Earth and the Sun. The solution is named after [[Karl Schwarzschild]], who first published the solution in 1916.

According to [[Birkhoff's theorem (relativity)|Birkhoff's theorem]], the Schwarzschild metric is the most general [[rotational symmetry|spherically symmetric]], [[Vacuum solution (general relativity)|vacuum solution]] of the [[Einstein field equations]]. A '''Schwarzschild black hole''' or '''static black hole''' is a [[black hole]] that has no [[Charge (physics)|charge]] or [[angular momentum]]. A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.

'''John Houston Burrus''' (February 22, 1849 - March 27, 1917) was an educator in Nashville, Tennessee and [[Lorman, Mississippi]]. He was a member of the first class of students at Fisk University in Nashville and when that class graduated became among the first group of African-Americans to graduate from a liberal arts college south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]]. He was a professor of mathematics at Fisk and in 1883 became the second president of [[Alcorn State University|Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College]], a position he held until 1893.

==Early life==
John Houston Burrus was born February 22, 1849 to William C. J. Burrus and his slave, Nancy near [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee]]&lt;ref name="Brown1887"&gt;Brown, John Howard, ed. The Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Comprising the Men and Women of the United States Who Have Been Identified With the Growth of the Nation. 1887, p177&lt;/ref&gt; in Rutherford County.&lt;ref&gt;Death of Prof J. H. Burrus, The Nashville Globe (Nashville, Tennessee), March 30, 1917, page 4, accessed September 23, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6749887/death_of_prof_j_h_burrus_the/&lt;/ref&gt; William was a planter and lawyer&lt;ref name="Johnson1904"&gt;Johnson, Rossiter, and John Howard Brown, eds. The twentieth century biographical dictionary of notable Americans. Vol. II. Biographical Society, 1904.&lt;/ref&gt; and had been a whig member of the General Assembly of Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) October 18, 1843, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy was mixed-race: African-American, Native American, and white.&lt;ref name="Johnson1904"/&gt; William and Nancy had two other sons, [[James Dallas Burrus]] and [[Preston Robert Burrus]] and lived together as husband and wife, with William never marrying and James later remembering their relationship as affectionate and respectful.&lt;ref name="Richardson1965"&gt;Richardson, Joe M. (1965). "A negro success story: James Dallas Burrus." ''The Journal of Negro History''. 50(4): 274-282.&lt;/ref&gt; William died in 1860&lt;ref name="Johnson1904"/&gt; and the Burrus family went to a brother of their master, the mother as a cook and the brothers as body servants, serving their master while he was a soldier in the [[US Civil War]] (1861-1865).&lt;ref name="Richardson1965"/&gt;

At the end of the War, Burrus, was with his two brothers, mother, and [[Braxton Bragg]]'s Army in [[Marshall, Texas]]. Finally free, they were brought to [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], then to [[New Orleans]], and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]] where John took a job as a cook on a stern-wheel [[steamboat]]. He remained in Memphis for a short time, and moved in 1866 to Nashville where he took a job as a hotel waiter along with James. The pair studied nights with two ladies boarding at the hotel where they worked.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p281-285&lt;/ref&gt; During this time they saved enough and learned enough so that by 1867 they were able to enroll at [[Fisk University]] along with [[America W. Robinson]] and [[Virginia E. Walker Broughton|Virginia Walker]], who were the schools first students.&lt;ref name="Richardson1965"/&gt; During his first year at Fisk John converted to the Congregational Church. As a student, Burrus would teach during the summer until his eyesight began to weaken. In the summers of 1873 and 1874 he gave religious presentations with a panorama he bought.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; At Fisk, John studied Greek and James studied math. John, James, and Virginia Walker graduated in May, 1875, becoming the first blacks to graduate from a liberal arts college south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]]. America would join the [[Fisk Jubilee Singers]] and become fiance to James, although they did not marry.&lt;ref name="Richardson1965"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduation, Burrus became a teacher at a school in the suburbs of Nashville and was quickly promoted to principal. In 1876 he was selected by the Republican State committee as a delegate to the [[1876 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. At the convention, he initially gave his support to [[Oliver P. Morton]], but finally supported [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] on the last ballot, which nominated Hays. That fall he accepted principalship of the Yazoo city school In [[Yazoo, Mississippi]], and in June 1877, he was offered a position of instructor of mathematics at Fisk University in place of his brother who had just resigned from the position. He taught for two years at Fisk&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; and received an A.M. (masters) degree in May 1878 along with Virginia Walker (now Virginia Walker Broughton) and America Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;Closing Exercises at Fisk University, The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) May 24, 1878, page 4, accessed September 23, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6749343/closing_exercises_at_fisk_university/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, he resigned in favor of his younger brother who had just graduated. In 1878 he was elected permanent secretary of the Tennessee Republican State convention and was secretary and treasurer of the State executive committee for the next two years. He was elected to the board of school directors for his district for consecutive three year terms from 1878 to 1884. The district had two other directors, both white, and 17 teachers, of whom nine were white. He served as chairman of the board and succeeded in equalizing the salaries of the white and black teachers. In 1880, he spoke at the State Teachers Institute convention in Nashville about unequal funding in schools. This was based on the requirements of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act of 1862]] which funded land-grant institutions and resulted in new scholarships for black students at Fisk University. He was chosen alternate delegate to the [[1880 Republican National Convention]]. In 1882 he was a candidate for register in [[Davidson County, Tennessee]] in August, and in November he was a candidate for the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; While at Fisk, Burrus began to study law and he was admitted to the bar in 1881. He also began to work as a correspondent for several newspapers&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; and did some real estate work, forming the Laborer's Cooperative Building and Endowment Association.&lt;ref&gt;Lovett, Bobby L. The African-american History of Nashville, Tn: 1780-1930 (p). University of Arkansas Press. p117&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcorn A&amp;M===
In August 1883 he was offered the presidency of Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College in Lorman, Mississippi, following [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]] in that position.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; James Burrus had become professor of mathematics and superintendent of the college farm in 1882, and had played a key role in promoting John for the position.&lt;ref name="Richardson1965"/&gt; He held the position until 1893 until forced to retire due to health issues. He was very successful and the enrollment at Alcorn increased greatly during his tenure&lt;ref name="Lamon1973"&gt;Lamon, Lester C. "The Tennessee Agricultural and Industrial Normal School: Public Higher Education for Black Tennesseans." Tennessee Historical Quarterly 32, no. 1 (1973): 42-58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898 he attended the National Educational Association Convention in Nashville&lt;ref&gt;Opening Day. The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) June 17, 1889, page 10, accessed September 23, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6749394/opening_day_the_tennessean_nashville/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
After leaving Alcorn, he continued to be active in education. In 1903, he wrote to the Nashville ''American'' again criticizing inequal treatment of blacks when federal moneys given to Tennessee under the Morrill Acts were dispersed.&lt;ref name="Lamon1973"/&gt; He also continued to practice law until his health further deteriorated. He then purchased a farm on Brick Church pike in Nashville.&lt;ref&gt;One of First Fisk Graduates Passes Away. The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) April 1, 1917 page 14, accessed September 23, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6749794//&lt;/ref&gt; He died of [[bronchial pneumonia]] on March 27, 1917 in Nashville. His funeral was at Howard Congregational Church and was buried in [[Greenwood Cemetery (Nashville, Tennessee)|Greenwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;Death Notices, The Tennessean (Nashville, Tennessee) March 28, 1917, page 7, accessed September 23, 2016 at https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6749778/death_notices_the_tennessean/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1787">'''Journaliste en danger''' ('''JED''') is an independent, non partisan [[non-profit organization]] ({{lang-fr|association à but non lucratif}}) founded on November 20, 1998 in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], on the initiative of a group of [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Congolese]] [[journalist]]s for the defence and promotion of the [[press freedom]] in DR Congo. 

JED was founded out of the concern that press freedom was being violated and that journalists had become victims of unfair justice. JED is not an association reserved solely for journalists, but rather a wholly independent and open structure to all those who feel like having a vocation to defend and promote their right to inform and to be informed freely without any restriction. 

Since May 2003, JED has been active in eight other [[Central Africa]]n countries: [[Burundi]], [[Cameroon]], [[Congo Brazzaville]], [[Gabon]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], The [[Central African Republic]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Chad]].

JED is a member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of non-governmental organisations that monitors [[freedom of expression]] worldwide and defends journalists, writers, internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]].

The question whether the use of language influences [[spatial cognition]] is closely related to theories of [[linguistic relativity]]—also known as the [[Sapir-Whorf hypothesis]]—which states that the structure of a language affects cognitive processes of the speaker. Debates about this topic are mainly focused on the extent to which language influences spatial cognition or if it does at all. Research also concerns differences between perspectives on spatial relations across [[cultures]], what these imply, and the exploration of potentially partaking cognitive mechanisms.

==Frames of reference across cultures==
Research shows that frames of reference for spatial cognition differ across cultures and that language could play a crucial role in structuring these different frames.&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Majid, Bowerman, Kita, Haun, &amp; Levinson|title=Can language  restructure cognition? The case for space|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=108–114|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Three types of perspectives on space can be distinguished:&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004"/&gt;
* The '''Relative''' perspective (dominant in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[English language|English]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]) is dependent on the viewer's position towards the object and often uses descriptions like "the object is to the left/right of ...".
* The '''Absolut''' perspective (found in speakers of [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]], [[Kuuk Thaayore]], and [[Tzeltal language|Tzeltal]]) is based on cardinal directions such as north, east, south, and west. Therefore, the description of the location of an object does not change according to the position towards it.
* The '''Intrinsic''' perspective (found in speakers of [[Mopan language|Mopan]] and [[Totonac]]) describes the location of an object without referring to yourself or the use of cardinal directions. Instead it uses the relation towards another object to specify spatial relations (e.g. "the object is at the back/front/side of ...").
Languages like English or Dutch do not exclusively make use of relative descriptions but these appear to be most frequent compared to intrinsic or absolute descriptions. An absolute frame of reference is usually restricted to large scale geographical descriptions in these languages. Speakers of the [[Australian]] languages [[Arrernte language|Arrernte]], [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]], and [[Kuuk Thaayore]] only use absolute descriptions.&lt;ref name="Majid, 2004" /&gt;
The relative and intrinsic perspectives seem to be connected as there is no known language which applies only one of these frames of reference exclusively.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levinson|title=Space in Language and Cognition: Explorations in Cognitive Diversity|date=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pederson, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pederson|title=Spatial Cognition III: Routes and  Navigation, Human Memory and Learning, Spatial Representation and Spatial Learning|date=2003|publisher=Springer Verlag|pages=287–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two views on spatial cognition==
(1.) It has been argued that people universally use an [[egocentric]] representation to solve non-linguistic spatial tasks which would align with the relative frame of reference.&lt;ref name="Wang, 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wang &amp; Spelke|title=Human spatial representation: insights from animals|date=2002|pages=376–382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(2.) Other researchers have proposed that people apply multiple frames of reference during their daily lives and that languages reflect these cognitive structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallistel|title=Language and spatial frames of reference in mind and brain|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2002|volume=6|pages=321–322|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(02)01962-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the light of the current body of literature the second view seems to be the more plausible one.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levinson|title=Returning the tables: language affects spatial reasoning|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=84|pages=155–188|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pederson, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pederson|title=Semantic typology and spatial conceptualization|journal=Language|date=1998|volume=74|pages=557–589|doi=10.1353/lan.1998.0074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wassmann &amp; Dasen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wassmann &amp; Dasen|title=Balinese spatial orientation: some empirical evidence of  moderate linguistic relativity|journal=J. R. Anthropol. Inst|date=1998|volume=4|pages=689–711|doi=10.2307/3034828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directional gestures==
The dominant frames of reference have found to be reflected in the common types of [[gesticulation]] in the respective language.&lt;ref name=McNeill&gt;{{cite book|last1=McNeill|title=Hand and Mind|date=1992|publisher=Chicago University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of absolute languages would typically represent an object moving north with a hand movement towards the north.&lt;ref name="Haviland, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haviland|title=Anchoring, iconicity, and orientation in GuuguYimithirr pointing  gestures|journal=J. Linguist. Anthropol.|date=1993|volume=3|pages=3–45|doi=10.1525/jlin.1993.3.1.3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haviland, 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haviland|title=Guugu Yimithirr cardinal directions|journal=Ethos|date=1998|volume=26|pages=25–47|doi=10.1525/eth.1998.26.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas speakers of relative languages typically depict a movement of an object to the right with a hand movement to the right, independent of the direction they are facing during speech.&lt;ref name="Kita, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kita &amp; Özyürek|title=What does cross-linguistic variation in semantic coordination  of speech and gesture reveal? Evidence for an interface representation of spatial thinking and speaking|journal=J. Mem. Lang.|date=2003|volume=48|pages=16–32|doi=10.1016/s0749-596x(02)00505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of intrinsic languages would, for example, typically represent human movement from the perspective of the mover with a [[sagittal]] hand gesture away from the speaker.&lt;ref name="kita, 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kita|title=Cultural speciﬁcity of spatial schemas as manifested in spontaneous  gestures|date=2001|publisher=MIT Press|pages=115–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The spatial representation of time==
A study by Boroditsky and Gaby&lt;ref name="Boroditsky, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boroditsky &amp; Gaby|title=Remembrances of times east: Absolute spatial  representations of time in an aboriginal Australian community|journal=Psychological Science|date=2010|volume=21|pages=1635–1639|doi=10.1177/0956797610386621|pmid=20959511}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared speakers of an absolute language—[[Pormpuraawans]]—with English speakers. The task on which they compared them consisted of the spatial arrangement of cards which showed a temporal progression. The result was that the speakers of the relative language (Americans) exclusively chose to represent time spatially as progressing from left (earlier time) to right (later time). Whereas the [[Pormpuraawans]] took the direction they faced into account and preferred to depict time as progressing from east (earlier time) to west (later time) the most.

==Third variables==
[[Confounding variables]] could potentially explain a significant proportion of the measured difference in performance between the linguistic frames of reference. 
These can be categorized into three types of confounding factors:
* '''Environmental factors''' (e.g. rural vs. urban or open terrain vs. dense forest) could influence linguistic and non-linguistic categories.&lt;ref name="Li, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li &amp; Gleitman|title=Turning the tables: language and spatial reasoning|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=83|pages=265–294|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00009-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lindsey, 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindsey &amp; Brown|title=Color naming and the phototoxic effects of sunlight on  the eye|journal=Psychol. Sci.|date=2002|volume=13|pages=506–512|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00489}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Global cognitive styles''' (e.g. [[individualism]] vs. [[collectivism]]) could act as a [[:wikt:mediator|mediator]] between language and cognition.&lt;ref name="Greenfield, 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenﬁeld|title=Cultural pathways through universal development|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|date=2003|volume=54|pages=461–490}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Differences in habitual action''' (could be reflected in subsistence patterns) might shape the differing use of frames of reference in language and cognition.&lt;ref name=Gallistel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallistel|title=Conception, perception and the control of action. Reply to Majid.|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2002|volume=6|page=504|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(02)02033-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The importance of language for cognition===
Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow&lt;ref name="Gentner, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gentner, Özyürek, Gürcanli, and Goldin-Meadow|title=Spatial language  facilitates spatial cognition: Evidence from children who lack language input|journal=Cognition|date=2013|volume=127|issue=3|pages=318–330|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2013.01.003|pmid=23542409|pmc=3708650}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that deaf children, who lacked a conventional language, did not use gestures to convey spatial relations (see [[home sign]]). Building on that, they showed that deaf children performed significantly worse on a task of spatial cognition compared to hearing children. They concluded that the acquisition of (spatial) language is an important factor in shaping spatial cognition.

==Cognitive mechanisms==
Several mechanisms accounting for or contributing to the possible effect of language on cognition have been suggested: 
*'''Perceptual tuning and attention''': Experience (with language) can direct habitual attention so that perception becomes more oriented towards particular features in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstone|title=Perceptual learning|journal=Annu. Rev. Psychol.|date=1998|volume=49|pages=585–612|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.585}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sloutsky|title=The role of similarity in the development of categorization|journal=Trends Cogn. Sci.|date=2003|volume=7|pages=246–251|doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00109-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[The novice-expert shift]]''': Increased experience in a specific domain can lead to a recoding of representational units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bailenson|title=A bird’s eye view: biological categorization and reasoning within  and across cultures.|journal=Cognition|date=2002|volume=84|pages=1–53|doi=10.1016/s0010-0277(02)00011-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|title=Cultural and experiential differences in the development of folkbiological  induction|journal=Cogn. Dev.|date=2003|volume=18|pages=25–47|doi=10.1016/s0885-2014(02)00142-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Structure-mapping''': When comparing conceptual representations based on similarities, language can influence what tends to be compared to what by promoting the saliency of specific categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bowerman &amp; Choi|title=Space under construction: language-speciﬁc spatial  categorization in ﬁrst language acquisition|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|pages=387–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gentner|title=Why we’re so smart|date=2003|publisher=MIT Press|pages=195–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Costs of computation''': Based on the assumption of language promoting the formation of different categories, it would result that the cognitive effort to access the more salient frame of reference in the respective language (relative, absolute or intrinsic) is lower in comparison to switching to another frame.&lt;ref name="Levinson, 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hunt &amp; Agnoli|title=The Whorﬁan hypothesis: a cognitive psychology perspective|journal=Psychol. Rev.|date=1991|volume=98|pages=377–389|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.98.3.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23176">'''Learned industriousness''' is a [[behavior]]ally rooted theory developed by [[Robert Eisenberger]] to explain the differences in general work effort among people of equivalent [[Aptitude|ability]].  According to Eisenberger, individuals who are [[reinforcement|reinforced]] for exerting high effort on a task are also [[Reinforcement|secondarily reinforced]] by the [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]] of high effort. Individuals with a history of reinforcement for effort are predicted to generalize this effort to new behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R. (1992). Learned Industriousness. ''Psychological Review'', 99(2), 248-267.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operationalization of industriousness ==
An individual is considered industrious if he or she demonstrates [[Perseveration|perseverance]] and [[determination]] in performing a task. This term has also been used interchangeably with [[work ethic]],&lt;ref name="Text"&gt;Tucker-Ladd, C. E. (1996). ''Psychological self-help''. The Self-Help Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; which is generally regarded as the attitude that hard work and effort is virtuous. Learned industriousness theory asserts that industriousness is developed over time through a history of reinforcement.

== Possible relationship to learned helplessness ==
[[Learned helplessness]] is a term to explain a specific pattern of [[behavior]] that occurs in both animals and humans. When an animal or human is consistently exposed to an aversive condition (pain, unpleasant noise, etc.) and is unable to escape this condition, that animal or human will become helpless and stop attempting escape.  The animal or human may develop motivational deficits, as demonstrated in [[Learned helplessness#Foundation of research and theory|learned helplessness experiments]].&lt;ref&gt;Overmier, J. B., &amp; Seligman, M. E. P. (1967). Effects of inescapable shock upon subsequent escape and avoidance responding. ''Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology'', 63, 28-33.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, learned industriousness theory attempts to explain why some individuals are more motivated than others. In an attempt to merge these two phenomena, Eisenberger, Park, &amp; Frank invoked learned industriousness in children by providing task-contingent verbal approval for a small group of behaviors, contrasting this with a group of children conditioned to exhibit learned helplessness, and a control group. On a subsequent approval-contingent task, children conditioned task-contingent verbal approval outperformed controls. However, the learned-helplessness group performed no differently from controls.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1976a"&gt;Eisenberger, R., Park, D. C., &amp; Frank, M. (1976). [http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/33/2/227/ Learned industriousness and social reinforcement.] ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 33(2), 227-232.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antecedents of industriousness ==
=== Effort ===
[[Effortfulness|Effort]] is the subjective experience of fatigue felt by the body when it is in motion or meets resistance.&lt;ref&gt;English, H. B., &amp; English, A. C. (1968). ''A comprehensive dictionary of psychological and psychoanalytical terms''. New York: McKay.&lt;/ref&gt; This fatigue can refer to both physical and mental fatigue depending on the task at hand. Until the theory of learned industriousness, effort was generally considered an [[aversive]] sensation. Hull summed up this concept with the Law of Least Effort, which asserts that individuals will choose a solution that minimizes effort for any given problem. Learned industriousness theory is considered an addendum to the Law of Least Effort.&lt;ref&gt;Hull, C. L. (1943). ''Principles of behavior''. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Relationship between effort and goal-setting strategies ====
Individuals with high levels of industriousness have a history of applying great effort towards tasks. It has been demonstrated in many studies that different uses of goals result in more effort and task persistence. Thus, specific goal-setting strategies are antecedents to effort and subsequently increase the likelihood of an individual 'learning' industriousness. Below is an overview of the findings.

A [[goal]] is defined as the "object or aim of an action".&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E. A. &amp; Latham, G. P. (2002). Building a practically useful theory of goal setting and task motivation. ''American Psychologist'', 57(9), 705-717.&lt;/ref&gt; As [[motivation]]al tools, goals have been shown to improve performance in a wide variety of settings. For example, one study looked at the effects of high goals versus low goals on performance. To investigate this effect, students were given goals for a [[brainstorming]] activity; those with higher goals were able to brainstorm more ideas than those with lower goals. Therefore, the investigator concluded that [[goal setting]] not only increases performance, but more ambitious goals evoke better performance than lower-set goals.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, E. A. (1982). Relation of goal level to performance with a short work period and multiple goal levels. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 67(4), 512-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to improving performance, setting goals also increases task effort and persistence. In one study, participants were assigned to three groups: short-term goals, long-term goals, and a control group with no goals. The participants were then asked to attempt a complicated mirror maze as many times as they would like. Both groups with goals persisted on the maze task significantly longer than the control group, providing evidence that goals promote higher effort and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, R. N., Korienek, G., Jarvis, D., McColskey, D., &amp; Candeletti, G. (1981). Goal-setting and task persistence. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 53, 881-882.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another facet of goals that has been studied in relation to task persistence is whether the goal is a cooperative or competitive goal structure. A cooperative goal structure is one in which an individual must work alongside a group to reach a common goal, whereas a competitive goal structure is one in which an individual competes with others to reach a goal. The investigators tested whether participants' social values (cooperativeness, competitiveness, and individualism) moderate the relationship between goal structure and task persistence. In accordance with their hypotheses, individuals who were classified as "cooperators" persisted longer on the cooperative goal-structured task than the competitive goal-structured task. Similarly, individuals who were classified as "individualists" persisted longer on a competitive goal-structured task than a cooperative one. Therefore, the investigators conclude that the effect of "cooperative versus competitive goal structures on task persistence are influenced by individuals' social values and history of rewarded effort".&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1992a"&gt;Eisenberger, R., Kuhlman, D. M., &amp; Cotterell, N. (1992). Effects of social values, effort training, and goal structure on task persistence. ''Journal of Research in Psychology'', 26, 258-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The relationship between effort and task interest/difficulty ====
There are certain aspects of tasks that induce greater effort and persistence: a performer's interest in the task and the level of difficulty of the task. These factors are relevant in creating an environment where an individual is likely to exert more effort and, in turn, become more industrious. Therefore, task interest and task difficulty may both act as moderators in the relationship between effort and industriousness.

Task interest, or an individual's engagement in an activity, is claimed to be an antecedent to the exertion of effort on a task. In a study by Fisher &amp; Noble, the hypothesis that task interest is important for self-regulation during performance and task effort was empirically tested. The findings suggest that task interest positively predicted effort with a significant correlation.  While a significant correlation cannot prove causation, there is evidence that higher effort is linked to higher intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;Fisher, C. D. &amp; Noble, C. S. (2004). A within-person examination of correlates of performance and emotions while working. ''Human Performance'', 17(2), 145-168.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have supported this finding as well.&lt;ref&gt;Izard, C. E., &amp; Ackerman, B. P. (2000). Motivational, organizational, and regulatory functions of discrete emotions. In M. Lewis &amp; J. M. Haviland-Jones (Eds.), ''Handbook of Emotions'' (pp. 253-264). New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sansone, C., &amp; Smith, J. L. (2000). Interest and self-regulation: The relation between having to and wanting to. In C. Sansone &amp; J. M. Harackiewicz (Eds.), ''Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: The search for optimal motivation and performance'' (pp. 341-372). San Diego, CA: Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Task difficulty is also suggested to precede high effort. The reasoning behind this claim is that high difficulty tasks evoke high effort exertion if the individual is motivated to succeed on the task. The study conducted by Fisher and Noble also supports this hypothesis, as a significant positive relationship between task difficulty and effort was found.&lt;ref name="Fisher" /&gt;

=== Reinforcement ===
According to Daniels &amp; Daniels, [[reinforcement]] is any stimulus, event, or situation that fulfills the following two requirements:
:# Follows a behavior
:# Increases the frequency of that behavior&lt;ref name="Daniels"&gt;Daniels, A. C., &amp; Daniels, J. E. (2006). ''Performance Management: Changing Behavior that Drives Organizational Effectiveness''. Atlanta, GA: Performance Management Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], event, or situation is considered a reinforcer if it follows a targeted behavior and causes the increased occurrence of that behavior. Many confuse the terms "reward" and "reinforcer" because they often mean the same thing; a reward is given as a consequence of a desired behavior and often motivates an individual to perform that behavior again in order to receive another reward. However, individuals can receive rewards and not increase the behavior in question (e.g., receiving a prize for completing a marathon may not motivate an individual to run more marathons). In that case, the reward is not a reinforcer because it does not increase the frequency of the behavior. Positive reinforcement is any stimulus that is presented after a behavior and increases the frequency of that behavior. Negative reinforcement is the removal of an aversive stimulus after a behavior that increases the frequency of that behavior. Both positive and negative reinforcement are effective in the development of industriousness.

==== Reinforcing high effort ====
Learned industriousness theory asserts that reinforcing an individual for achieving a performance standard increases the likelihood of that individual's performing those behaviors again. If the individual exerted high levels of effort during the completion of the task, the effort takes on its own reinforcing value. This is because the individual enjoys the sensation of working hard because it is associated with reinforcement. Therefore, this individual is more likely to generalize this high level of effort to other tasks because it is less aversive and is associated with positive results. On the other hand, the theory also claims that if an individual has a history of being reinforced for completing tasks with very low levels of effort, that individual will eventually generalize this low level of effort to other tasks. This facet of the theory is termed "learned laziness."&lt;ref name="Text" /&gt; Evidence for these claims is provided below.

Eisenberger's theory claims an essentially dichotomous relationship between effort and reinforcement: the exertion of low effort on a simple tasked paired with high levels of reinforcement will result in low levels of effort on future tasks; on the other hand, the exertion of high effort on a difficult task paired with low levels of reinforcement (intermittent reinforcement) will result in high levels of effort on future tasks.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1992a" /&gt; A study conducted by Drucker et al. showed support for this claim. In this study, participants were randomly assigned to computer tasks that ranged in level of difficulty and then given either high or low levels of reinforcement for performance on the task. Participants then were given an anagram task on which their persistence time was measured. In accordance with Eisenberger's theory, individuals who were highly reinforced for performance on the low-difficulty computer task spent less time persisting on the subsequent anagram task, demonstrating that the low level of effort generalized to another activity. Additionally, individuals who were given low levels of reinforcement for performance on the moderately high-difficulty computer task spent more time persisting on the anagram task. This demonstrated that the effort exerted on the first task, paired with low levels of reinforcement, generalized to the following task. However, participants who were given the highest-difficulty computer tasks did not generalize this effort. According to the researchers, this version of the task was so difficult that the participants could not succeed and thus demonstrated a pattern of behaviors similar to learned helplessness.&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;Drucker, P. M., Litto, T., Drucker, D. B., &amp; Stevens, R. (1998). Relation of task difficulty to persistence. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills'', 86, 787-794.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Consequences ==
=== Increased effort ===
In addition to being an antecedent to industriousness, effort is the foremost consequence of learned industriousness theory.  As predicted by the theory, multiple experimental studies have demonstrated increased effort when paired with reinforcement.

Pierce, Cameron, Banko, and So conducted two studies in directly testing Eisenberger's theory.  Mimicking Drucker's methodology, the authors placed participants in a task that was of either constant or progressively higher difficulty and then either rewarded for completing the task or not rewarded (a 2x2 experiment).  Afterwards the participants were presented with a difficult free-choice task.  Participants who were in the progressive difficulty-reward condition spent more time on the free-choice task, especially compared to the constant difficulty-reward condition (who spent the least amount of time).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, W. D., Cameron, J., Banko, K. M., &amp; So, S. (2003). Positive effects of rewards and performance standards on intrinsic motivation. ''The Psychological Record'', 53(4), 561-579.&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, Cameron, Pierce, and So repeated the experiment, this time with an easy/difficult task condition split instead of a constant/progressive difficulty condition split.  Not only did participants in the difficult-reward condition put forth more effort in the free-choice phase, the authors found that participants who were rewarded for completing the difficult task performed better on the free choice task than those who were not rewarded.  Additionally, participants who were rewarded for completing the easy task performed worse on the free choice task than those who were not rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, J., Pierce, W., &amp; So, S. (2004). Rewards, Task Difficulty, and Intrinsic Motivation: A Test of Learned Industriousness Theory. ''Alberta Journal of Educational Research'', 50(3), 317-320.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another similar study found that the secondary effort reinforcement, both positive and negative, is equally transferable to tasks other than the one originally used in the conditioning.&lt;ref&gt;Gear, A. (2008). ''Learned industriousness and intrinsic motivation: Effects of rewards and task difficulty on students' free-choice performance and interest''. Dissertation Abstracts International Section A, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Creativity ===
There have been many studies looking at the links between [[creativity]] and rewards.  Many argue that if students are rewarded for a task such as creativity, they will be less interested, perform worse, and enjoy the task less once the reward is removed.&lt;ref&gt;Deci, E. L., Koestner, R., &amp; Ryan, R. M. (1999). A meta-analytic review of experiments examining the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 125, 627-668.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1Kohn, A. (1993). ''Punished by rewards: The trouble with gold stars, incentive plans, A's, praise, and other bribes''. Boston, MA US: Houghton, Mifflin and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Eisenberger applied his learned industriousness theory to studies of creativity to show that extrinsic rewards do not always negatively affect intrinsic motivation or creativity.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberger, R., &amp; Shanock, L. (2003). Rewards, Intrinsic Motivation, and Creativity: A Case Study of Conceptual and Methodological Isolation. Creativity Research Journal, 15, 121-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a similar training, Eisenberger and Selbst performed a series of experiments looking at whether creativity and divergent thought could be conditioned in the same manner as effort.  Participants performed a task where they pulled letters out of a long word to create different words and were either given a performance standard (high difficulty condition) or no performance standard (low difficulty condition). After completing five rounds of words, the participants were instructed to make as many unique drawings from a circle as they could.  The pictures were judged for uniqueness and general creativity.&lt;ref name="Eisen"&gt;Eisenberger, R., &amp; Selbst, M. (1994). Does reward increase or decrease creativity?. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 66(6), 1116-1127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors found similar results to previous learned industriousness studies: participants in the high difficulty-low reward condition showed more creativity in the circle drawing task than those without a reward while participants in the low difficulty-low reward showed even less creativity. Although most creativity research up until that point suggested that any reward for creative thoughts reduced generalized creativity,&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, K. O., &amp; McCullers, J. C. (1979). Evidence of a detrimental effect of extrinsic incentives on breaking a mental set. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 15(3), 285-294.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B. (1982). Reinforcement-induced behavioral stereotypy: How not to teach people to discover rules. ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'', 111(1), 23-59.&lt;/ref&gt; this study showed that increases or decreases in generalized creativity depend on whether or not high or low divergent thought is rewarded.&lt;ref name="Eisen" /&gt;

=== Smoking/drug habits ===
Currently the area of study that learned industriousness has been cited in the applied world is [[smoking]] and drug cessation research.  An example of such research is Quinn et al.'s correlational study which examined the levels of persistence of smokers vs. non-smokers using the Anagram Persistence Task (APT) and the Mirror-Tracing Persistence Task (MTPT). As predicted, non-smokers had higher levels of persistence than smokers.  The authors suggested that people who have been reinforced with high effort throughout their lives would be more persistent in their use of strategies for [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with stress than smokers and that people reinforced with low effort would be more likely to use low effort strategies when coping with stress (such as smoking). In addition, people with low persistence are less likely to produce the high effort behaviors required to quit smoking.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, E. P., Brandon, T. H., &amp; Copeland, A. L. (1996). Is task persistence related to smoking and substance abuse? The application of learned industriousness theory to addictive behaviors. ''[[Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology]]'', 4(2), 186-190.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding support to Brandon et al.'s hypotheses is a study by Brown, Lejuez, Kahler, &amp; Strong.  The authors found that smokers who have never been able to quit for more than a day had lower levels of persistence than those who were able to quit for at least 3 months at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R. A., Lejuez, C. W., Kahler, C. W., &amp; Strong, D. R. (2002). Distress tolerance and duration of past smoking cessation attempts. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 111(1), 180-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study by Brandon, Herzog, Juliano, Irvin, Lazev, &amp; Simmons continued the work of the previous two by using a longitudinal perspective.  After testing for persistence using the APT and the MTPT, the participants went through eleven days of [[smoking cessation]] therapy that included [[cognitive-behavioral therapy]], training on coping strategies, and [[nicotine replacement therapy]].  Participants were then contacted on a monthly basis for 6 months and then at 9 and 12 months for updates on their smoking habits.  In addition to supporting previous findings that smokers perform worse on persistence tasks, participants who scored higher on the persistence tasks were less likely to relapse during the 12-month period of the study.  Although the study was again limited because of its correlational design, the authors suggest that their results fit within the theoretical framework of learned industriousness.&lt;ref name="Brandon"&gt;Brandon, T. H., Herzog, T. A., Juliano, L. M., Irvin, J. E., Lazev, A. B., &amp; Simmons, V. (2003). Pretreatment task persistence predicts smoking cessation outcome. ''Journal of Abnormal Psychology'', 112(3), 448-456.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional study by Steinberg et al. looking at adolescents and smoking found much of the same results as Brandon et al.  Non-smoking adolescents scored higher on a self-reported persistence measure than smokers and smokers who planned on quitting scored higher than those who did not plan on quitting.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, M. B., Akincigil, A., Delnevo, C. D., Crystal, S., &amp; Carson, J. L. (2006). Gender and Age Disparities for Smoking-Cessation Treatment. ''American Journal of Preventive Medicine'', 30(5), 405-412.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future research ==
There are several areas in which the literature on learned industriousness can be expanded. Due to the unclear results of Eisenberger's study of a Learned Industriousness-Learned Helplessness Continuum, further research should be done to provide evidence for or against its existence. This research could be useful for personnel selection purposes and understanding performance in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Eisenberger1976a"/&gt;  Also, the most current smoking-related learned industriousness research has been correlational; experimental studies could not only be powerful evidence for the theory but also generate important practical contributions for smoking cessation therapy.&lt;ref name="Brandon"/&gt;

'''Manana''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मनन) is the deep state of thinking without joy or grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads|author=Srisa Chandra Vasu|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=30|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=QvEfRSnayf0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA30&amp;dq=manana+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ICOaVLvgNZGVuATeiIGQCg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=manana%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Yajnavalkya]] in the context of the ''[[mahāvākyas|mahavakya]]'' – ''[[Tat Tvam Asi]]'', told Paingala that whereas ''[[Shravana (hearing)|shravana]]'' ('hearing') is the inquiry into the real significance of this ''[[Shabda|vākya]]'', to inquire in solitude into the significance of ''shravana'' is ''manana'' (consideration or reflection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thirty-Minor –Upanishads|publisher=Islamkotob|page=49|url= https://books.google.co.in/booksid=CvXZ0j1UyAAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=manana+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ICOaVLvgNZGVuATeiIGQCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=manana%20upanishad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Patanjali]] terms ''manana'' as ''[[Dhāraṇā|dharana]]'', &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Call of the Upanishads|author=Rohit Mehta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=262|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=_aGXsz4C2z8C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=manana+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OSiaVKm2IYzmuQTSjYGQBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=manana%20upanishad&amp;f=false}} &lt;/ref&gt; the unshakeable mental conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thought and Faith|author=Vassilis Vitsaxis|publisher=Somerset Hall Press|page=195|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sC0--0ZUfBkC&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=manana+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8y-aVKiaK9HIuAS6iYD4DA&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBTge#v=onepage&amp;q=manana%20upanishad&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In [[Advaita Vedanta]], ''manana'', the deep reflection on what is heard from the teacher, is a part of the three-fold process of ''shravana-manana-nididhyasana'', the three stages of religious life which combined acting as the path of knowledge, lead to the attainment of ''[[moksha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indra’s Net: Defending Hinduism|author=Rajiv Malhotra|publisher=Harper Collins|page=182|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=M7TlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182&amp;dq=manana+upanishad&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mCmaVPnuKoGzuAS2y4DACA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=manana%20upanishad&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Echoes of Ancient Indian Wisdom|author=Shantha S.

''Manana'' means – 'thinking', 'reflection', 'meditation', 'cogitation';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|page=1233|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panchadasi]] (Sloka I.53) reads as follows:-

:इत्थं वाक्यैस्तदर्थानुसन्धानं श्रवणं भवेत् |
:युक्त्या संभावितत्वानुसंधानं मन्नन्तु तत् ||

:"The finding out or discovery of the true significance of the identity of the individual self and the supreme Universal Self with the great sayings is what is known as shravana; and to arrive at the possibility of its validity through logical reasoning is what is called manana."

In this context, [[Vidyaranya]] had previously stated that the Self is untouched by doubts about the presence or absence of associates etc; that are superimposed on it phenomenally. In the afore-cited sloka, [[Swami Swahananda]] in his commentary explains that whatever be the relation between two ''vikalpas'' ('alternatives'), relation itself has to be understood which even though not an attribute is to be related, for the domain of ''bheda'' ('difference') is riddled with contradictions. [[Vedanta]] considers [[vikalpa]] as ''kalpana'' or 'contrary imagination' that invariably leads to [[anavastha]] ('infinite regress'). The identity alluded to by the great sayings (''[[mahavakyas]]'') conveyed by a [[Guru]] to his disciples i.e. sown in the mind of his [[sisya]], have logical support for their validity which support is revealed through manana which process reveals true knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi of Sri Vidyaranya Swami|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=25-27|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pancadasi-of-sri-vidyaranya-swami/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is through deep meditation that the knowledge of Brahman is gained, and [[Katha Upanishad]] (I.iii.15) declares that one becomes free from the jaws of death by knowing that which is ever constant; [[Badarayana]] states that what is mentioned in that Upanishad is meant for deep meditation on [[Purusha]] - आध्यानाय प्रयोजनाभावात् ([[Brahma Sutras]] III.iii.14), during which process the differing attributes are not to be combined but only non-different attributes which exist collectively in all the contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=662-664|url= http://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">A '''Martian scientist''' or '''Martian researcher''' is a hypothetical [[Martian]] frequently used in [[thought experiment]]s as an outside observer of conditions on [[Earth]]. The most common variety is the '''Martian [[anthropology|anthropologist]]''', but Martians researching subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and [[biology]] have also been invoked.

The following extract from an essay by [[Richard Dawkins]] is more or less typical.
:''A Martian [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] who didn't know that all human [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] happily interbreed with one another, and didn't know that most of the underlying [[genetics|genetic]] variance in our [[species]] is shared by all races might be tempted by our regional differences in skin colour, facial features, hair, body size and proportions to split us into more than one species.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins R]]. ''A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays''. Phoenix, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; 2003. {{ISBN|0-297-82973-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[linguistics]], the Martian approach is recommended for [[Descriptive linguistics|language description]]:
:''The descriptive analyst must be guided by certain very fixed [[principle]]s if he is to be [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] in describing accurately any [[language]] or part of any language. It would be excellent if he could adopt a completely man-from-Mars attitude toward any language he analyzes and describes.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Nida|Nida E]]. ''Morphology: the descriptive analysis of words''. 2nd ed. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; 1949. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical Martian anthropologist is described in the writings of [[Noam Chomsky]] as one who, upon studying the world's languages, would conclude that they are all dialects of a single language embodying a "[[universal grammar]]" reflecting a hardwired, genetically determined linguistic module inherent in the human brain.

In [[philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of language]] and [[philosophy of mind]], the Martian is often invoked as an example of an intelligent being with a cognitive apparatus that differs from that of humans, e.g. the following example given by [[Saul Kripke]]:

:''I will not here argue that simplicity is relative, or that it is hard to define, or that a Martian might find the quus function simpler than the plus function.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke|Kripke, Saul]].  ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language: An Elementary Exposition'', Harvard University Press. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common [[rhetoric]]al turn, invoking the Martian scientist forces the reader to observe an obvious state of affairs that is ordinarily overlooked:
:''If a Martian graced our planet, it would be struck by one remarkable similarity among Earth's living creatures and a key difference.''&lt;ref&gt;Hauser MD, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky N]], Fitch WT. The Faculty of Language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? ''Science''. 2002;298(5598):1569-79. {{DOI|10.1126/science.298.5598.1569}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(NB: The similarity Chomsky et al. mean is the universal hereditary language of DNA, while the difference is the lack of a universal language of communication.)

The conception of a '''maternal impression''' rests on the belief that a powerful mental (or sometimes physical) influence working on the mother's mind may produce an impression, either general or definite, on the child she is carrying.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock Ellis, ''Studies in the Psychology of Sex'', vol. 5 p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;  The child might be said to be "marked" as a result.

==Medicine==
Maternal impression, according to a [[obsolete scientific theory|long-discredited]] [[medicine|medical]] theory, was a phenomenon that explained the existence of [[birth defect]]s and congenital disorders. The theory stated that an [[emotion]]al [[stimulation|stimulus]] experienced by a [[pregnancy|pregnant]] woman could influence the development of the [[fetus]]. For example, it was sometimes supposed that the mother of the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]] was frightened by an [[elephant]] during her pregnancy, thus "imprinting" the memory of the elephant onto the gestating fetus. Mental problems, such as [[schizophrenia]] and [[clinical depression|depression]], were believed to be a manifestation of similar disordered feelings in the mother. For instance, a pregnant woman who experienced great [[sadness]] might imprint depressive tendencies onto the fetus in her womb.

The theory of maternal impression was largely abandoned by the 20th century, with the development of modern [[genetics|genetic theory]].

==Folklore==
In [[folklore]], maternal imprinting, or '''Versehen'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} (a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "inadvertance" or as a verb "to provide") as it is usually called, is the belief that a sudden fear of some object or animal in a pregnant woman can cause her child to bear the mark of it.

[[Oswald Spengler]] understood maternal imprinting to be a folkloric understanding of what he called "blood feeling" or the formation of a group aesthetic of a bodily ideal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is called the ''Versehen'' of a pregnant woman is only a particular and not very important instance of the workings of a very deep and powerful formative principle inherent in all that is of the race side. It is a matter of common observation that elderly married people become strangely like one another, although probably Science with its measuring instruments would "prove" the exact opposite. It is impossible to exaggerate the formative power of this living pulse, this strong inward feeling for the perfection of one's own type. The feeling for race-beauty—so opposite to the conscious taste of ripe urbans for intellectual-individual traits of beauty—is immensely strong in primitive men, and for that very reason never emerges into their consciousness. But such a feeling is race-forming. It undoubtedly molded the warrior- and hero-type of a nomad tribe more and definitely on ''one bodily ideal'', so that it would have been quite unambiguous to speak of the race-figure of Romans or Ostrogoths.&lt;ref&gt;Spengler, Oswald, The Decline of the West, Knopf, NYC, 1928, vol. 2 p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Pliny the Elder]] also comments at length about the phenomenon of ''postpartum'' maternal impression in bears, i.e., the folk belief that newborn bears must be licked and molded into bear-shape by their mothers.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny Natural History VIII:126&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1762">The '''Observatorio Venezolano de Prisiones''' '''(OVP,''' in English '''Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons)''' is a Venezuelan [[NGO]] working to improve [[human rights]] for prisoners. Its offices are located in [[Caracas]].
Several media have quoted the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons: [[New York Times]] and [[Associated Press]].

== History ==
The OVP was founded in 2002. Among its members there are political scientists, criminologists, sociologists, architects and experts in the prison system.

The organisation was very vocal when in 2014 when 34 inmates at the Uribana prison died during protests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/12/01/venezuela-deaths-prison-protest HRW reports on Uribana]&lt;/ref&gt; This was in the wake of the [[2013 Uribana prison riot]] in which over 60 prisoners died.

The IACHR expressed concerns after government official [[Diosdado Cabello]] informed on his TV program Hitting with the Hammer when several representatives of the OVP were arriving in Venezuela after an international tour. The IACH considered Cabello was threatening them by notifying what were private details of a trip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2015/032.asp IACH expresses concerns for the safety of OVP representatives]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">The '''Optional Prisoner's Dilemma''' (OPD) game models a situation of conflict involving two players in [[game theory]]. It can be seen as an extension of the standard [[prisoner's dilemma]] game, where players have the option to "reject the deal", that is, to abstain from playing the game.&lt;ref name="cardinot1"&gt;{{Cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot | first2 = Maud |last2= Gibbons |first3= Colm |last3= O'Riordan |first4= Josephine |last4= Griffith | chapter = Simulation of an Optional Strategy in the Prisoner’s Dilemma in Spatial and Non-spatial Environments | doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-43488-9_14 | title = From Animals to Animats 14 | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 9825 | pages = 145-156 | year = 2016 | isbn =  978-3-319-43487-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of game can be used as a model for a number of real world situations in which agents are afforded the third option of abstaining from a game interaction such as an election. &lt;ref name="batali"&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = John |last1= Batali |first2= Philip |last2= Kitcher |year= 1995 |title= Evolution of altriusm in optional and compulsory games |journal = [[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |pages = 161–171| volume= 175 |issue= 2 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1995.0128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Payoff matrix==

The structure of the Optional Prisoner's Dilemma can be generalized from the standard prisoner's dilemma game setting. In this way, suppose that the two players are represented by the colors, red and blue, and that each player chooses to "Cooperate", "Defect" or "Abstain". &lt;ref name="cardinot2"&gt;{{cite book |first1 = Marcos |last1= Cardinot |first2= Colm |last2= O'Riordan |first3= Josephine |last3= Griffith |chapter= The Optional Prisoner's Dilemma in a Spatial Environment: Coevolving Game Strategy and Link Weights |doi=10.5220/0006053900860093 | title = ECTA | series = Proceedings of the 8th International Joint Conference on Computational Intelligence |pages = 86-93 |volume=1  |year= 2016  | isbn=978-989-758-201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

|+ Canonical OPD payoff matrix

!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Cooperate
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Defect
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|Abstain

|}

* If both players cooperate, they both receive the reward ''R'' for mutual cooperation.
* If both players defect, they both receive the punishment payoff ''P''.
* If Blue defects while Red cooperates, then Blue receives the temptation payoff ''T'', while Red receives the "sucker's" payoff, ''S''.
* Similarly, if Blue cooperates while Red defects, then Blue receives the sucker's payoff ''S'', while Red receives the temptation payoff ''T''.
* If one or both players abstain, both receive the loner's payoff ''L''.

The following condition must hold for the payoffs:

''T'' &gt; ''R'' &gt; ''L'' &gt; ''P'' &gt; ''S''

{{Hinduism}}
{{Hindu philosophy}}
The [[Upanishadic]] '''philosophy of experience''' expounded by [[Gaudapada]] is based on the cryptic references made by the sage of the [[Mandukya Upanishad]] to the experience of the individual self of its own apparent manifestations in the three fundamental states of consciousness, and to the Fourth known as [[Turiya]]. Turiya is identified with “that goal which all the Vedas declare” - सर्वे वेदा यत् पदमानन्ति ([[Katha Upanishad]] I.ii.15), and whose characteristics are not dissimilar to those of the non-dual [[Brahman]] ([[Mandukya Upanishad]] 7).

==Background==
[[Philosophy]], according to [[Gaudapada]] and [[Adi Sankara]], is an interpretation of the totality of human experience (''bhoga'') or of the whole of life from the standpoint of truth, and the object it seeks is the happiness (''sukham'') and welfare (''hitam'') of all beings (''sarva sattva'') in this world (''ihaiva''). Experience is participation in an event or connecting with a product of one’s own activities; an individual creates the world of his own experiences (''dristisristivada'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intercultural Philosophy|author=Richard King|publisher=SUNY Press|page=61|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1bASTAOhjoC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=experience+in+vedanta&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lO8rU5b3EYLrrQfrkYDACg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20vedanta&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi Kutsa Angirasa ([[Rig Veda]] I.102.2) draws attention to the fact that no happiness can be derived as relating to the material world of objects without knowing each of the constituents of creation endowed with name, form and colour that have made all objects of faith and devotion. Rishi Kakshivan ([[Rig Veda]] I.116.11) points out the subtlety involved in these matters consisting in the fact that the happiness experienced or to be experienced is in the mind and not in the object of faith or pleasure. Participation involves work (effort) and knowledge. Therefore, a [[Rishi]] of the Rig Veda prays:-
: आ त्वां विश्न्त्वाशवः सोमास इन्द्र गिर्वणः |
: शन्ते सन्तु प्रचेतसे || (R.V. I.v.7)
: "May the objects possessed of active qualities required for accomplishing various aims and gains or results prove beneficial to those learned ones who are the doers of praise-worthy deeds, who factually know the objects as to their qualities, means or utility, and their scope."
Here, the Rishi refers to the experiencing of things (active qualities) and inevitable consequences (beneficial results), and also to the mental modes (factually know) . In a mantra ([[Rig Veda]] I.164.32),
: य ईं चकार न सो अस्य वेद य ईं ददर्श हिरुगिन्नु तस्मात् |
: स मातुर्योना परिवीतो अन्तर्बहुप्रजा निर्ऋतिमा विवेश ||
[[Rishi]] [[Dirghatamas]] tells us that he who is engaged in works alone does not know his own form, but he who does and sees actions and knows his form, nature etc., is different who remaining different re-enters protectively in his mother’s womb returns to earth and re-engages again and again in auspicious works and actions. In this manner the Rishi speaks of two distinct experiences – one which is yet to be experienced and the other which is already being experienced repeatedly; the experience which is yet to be experienced is what the Creator does, who creates for creation sake without being concerned about the results of his actions because His actions do not bind Him to anything, who continues to behave as though He is not aware of anything else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|author=Ravinder Kumar Soni|publisher=GBD Books|pages=199–200,17,252|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/illumination-of-knowledge-a-brief-reflection-on-the-role-of-agni-the-vedic-god-of-fire/oclc/470877223 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient concept of [[Ṛta]] expresses the idea of a regulative principle in nature and human society; the cosmic energies ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]]), hostile forces ([[Asura]]s) and different spirits ([[Gandharva]]s and [[Apsara]]s), all are subject to Rta. All actions contribute to maintaining the cosmic order in balance through liturgy; the cosmic order is the manifestation of the Ultimate Reality ([[Brahman]]) which is Truth ([[Satya]]). The Rig Veda (X.85.1-2) celebrates the relationship between truth and cosmic law (Ṛta). The Rig Veda (VII.56.12) also gives the equation of cosmic law (Ṛta) and truth (Satya), it was by observing the cosmic law the rishis reached the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads Vol.I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jj8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Satya'' signifies that which is eternal, the supreme, Existence in its own form ''Sat''; ''rtam'' signifies that which is evident or perceptible, manifested out of the ''satya'', what has come to be in accordance with ''satya'' or that which represents ''satya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|author=IslamKotob|publisher=Islamic Books|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ONHwyglLcAMC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=satya+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=o7xEU8LECIWQrgfS7IDwBQ&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=satya%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The entire philosophy of the [[Upanishads]], is based on the direct experience of the Vedic people; it is concerned with that knowledge which is common to all experience, everywhere, and not only to some specialized exclusive area of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads: An Introduction|author=Ananda Wood|publisher=Islamic Books|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N6Y7MTBjWOEC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=experience+in+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wvIrU4-GJcKOrgfOioHoCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=experience%20in%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada, who rediscovered the '''Philosophy of Experience''' and wrote his ''Karika'' on the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], too emphasises upon the impossibility of reaching the highest truth unless the totality of human experience or knowledge are taken into consideration and that the experiences in the waking state are required to be matched with the experiences in the other states of consciousness so that the individual inquiry is extended to the possible source of all consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Companion Encyclopaedia of Hindu Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|page=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZWdEymxyp4C&amp;pg=PA390&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s interpretation of Maya==
[[Ajativada]], doctrine that there is no birth or production of substantial or fully real things anywhere or at any time, and therefore no real objective world outside consciousness, is central to Gaudapada who holds that all sensory and mental experience, except the experience of content-less consciousness, is illusion or ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'', which doctrine of ''Maya'' is in conformity with the [[Vedanta|Vedantic reaches and conclusions]] regarding the sole ever-existing eternal real entity (''paramarthatah''), [[Brahman]], which has nothing different from it, and none whatever outside it (''[[Nondualism|advaita]]''), whose reality can be known ('experienced') through the cultivated meditative experience of non-dual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dispelling Delusion|author=Douglas A. Fox|publisher=SUNY Press|pages=24,40–41|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W4uQY3666I4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintains the doctrine that the universe was not created at all but takes some cognisance at least of the world as real, though it may be for the perfection of mystical endeavour or ethical conduct even though, philosophically, he may regard it as not having been created at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya vidya Bhavan|page=166|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s concept of experience==
[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (II.iii.4-5) tells us that the essence of that which is gross, mortal, limited and defined is the eye, which means that the mental mode associated with comparison is connected with the eye which perceives things and qualities and gives rise to duality and multiplicity i.e. separateness; the eye is the Sun which is the defined but the defined is that which moves within the eye. Gaudapada explores the transcendences by the Self of the three states detailed by the Upanishads and speaks about [[Vaishvanara]], the all-pervading and met with the eye, experiencing the external things; [[Taijasa]] which is inside the mind, as experiencing the inner things and [[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]] is the mass of consciousness in the space within the heart, all three interlinked by memory as "I". In this context, [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] explains that on cessation of the activity called memory Prajna becomes free from diversity and there is no functioning of the mind; perception and recollection are merely vibrations of the mind; in the absence of these there is merely existence of an un-manifested state in the heart. Therefore, the indescribable state of Turiya, is neither a void nor an unreal illusion without a substratum, and is held to be the all-pervasive source of all entities. Vaishvanara and Taijasa are held to be conditioned by cause and effect; Prajna is conditioned by cause, but cause and effect do not exist in Turiya. Cause and effect spring into being so long as there is mental preoccupation with cause and effect; there is no origination of cause and effect when engrossment with cause and effect becomes attenuated. As long as there is mental preoccupation with causality so long does the worldly state continue; when engrossment with causality is exhausted, one does not attain the worldly state. Everything seems to be born because of the empirical outlook; therefore there is nothing eternal; from the standpoint of Reality, everything is the birthless Self; therefore there is no such thing as annihilation (Karika VI.55-57).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=193–203,212–213,369–371|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Apparent manifestations of the self==
Gaudapada begins with the three apparent manifestations of the self – 1) as the 'experiencer' of the external world in the '''Waking state''' (''visva'' or ''[[Vaishvanara]] atman''), 2) as the 'experiencer' in the '''Dream state''' (''[[Taijasa]] atman'') and as the 'experiencer' in '''Deep sleep state''' or ''susupti'' ([[Prajna (Vedic)|Prajna]]) when there is no determinate knowledge, but pure consciousness and pure bliss or ''[[Ānanda (Hindu philosophy)|ananda]]''; the person who knows these three as one is never attached to these experiences. He also describes the Fourth state of the self ([[Turiya]]) which is ''advaita'' ('non-dual') and the All. In the Waking state things are imagined as if existing outside, and in the Dream state, things are imagined internally, both of them are illusory creations of the self; truth is that reality which is perceived as the imagination-less cessation of all appearances (''nirvikalpah prapancopasamah''). The thing that has beginning and an end is false; the existing of things is illusory; things exist only as far as they merely appear or are related to experience and as merely thoughts with which fools are deluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=424,426,428|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaudapada’s examination of the experience of the experiencing self==
Gaudapada points out that the unchangeable reality is the witness behind the three states of consciousness, waking, dreaming, and dreamless sleep, in all these states the Self is ever-present, and though remaining unknown is the unaffected 'experiencer' of all actions and thoughts in these three states. In deep sleep the mind is withdrawn and does not know anything, but it is disciplined and not withdrawn in ''turiya'', existent and all-seeing. When the individual self, sleeping under the influence of ''maya'' ('ignorance'), is awakened, it then realizes non-duality which is beginning-less and endless; this is the way to illumination within one’s own soul to realize supreme bliss. Gaudapada insists that the mind should not be allowed to enjoy the bliss that arises out of the condition of absorption. It should be freed from attachment to such happiness through the exercise of discrimination. When the mind does not lose itself in inactivity and oblivion, or is not distracted by desires, when the mind achieves quietness and does not give rise to appearances, it verily becomes Brahman. The waking and the dreaming states are equally real and equally unreal, real only in relative sense and unreal as compared with the transcendental in which there is identification with Reality, the unchangeable Self. There is no absolute reality of creation, the one infinite Existence appears to be the manifold universe which universe is not a reality but something superimposed upon the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]. Bondage and liberation, the individual soul and the world, are all unreal. The supreme bliss is the very nature of the Atman, an absolute reality which persists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Spiritual Heritage of India|author= Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Vedanta Press|pages=276–278|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=zupDCwE73O0C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patanjali’s concept of experience==
[[Patanjali]] tells us that experiences of pleasure and pain are the fruits of merit and demerit, respectively; pain is caused by false identification of the experiencer with the object of experience, and the pain which is yet to come may be avoided. The "experiencer" is the Atman, the real human nature, and the "object of experience" is the totality of the apparent world, including the mind and the senses; so long as the experiencer is falsely identified with the object of experience the Atman cannot be known. [[Patanjali]] states – अभाव – प्रत्ययालम्बना वृत्तिर्निद्रा ([[Yoga Sutra]] I.10) that "sleep is a wave of thought about nothingness", which means sleep is a positive experience of nothingness, when the already perceived objects are not forgotten but as experiences unite themselves to the system which existed at the time of going to sleep, in that state there is continuity of experience and the function of remembering is not reduced to utter confusion. He explains that the mind having innumerable impressions and desires acts only to serve the Atman and is able to perceive because it reflects both the Atman and the objects of perception, it cannot act independently for its own sake. The man of discrimination ceases to regard the mind as the Atman, and moves towards liberation. Distractions due to past impressions may arise if the mind relaxes its discrimination, even a little but can be overcome in the same manner as obstacles to enlightenment, that is, by resolving the mind back into its primal cause through meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=9,160–162,83–85|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali tells us – तस्य सप्तधा प्रान्तभूमिः प्रज्ञा ([[Yoga Sutras]] II.27) that the experiencer gains the knowledge of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] in seven stages, advancing towards the highest beginning with - a) the realization that the source of all spiritual wisdom is inside us, and proceeding to b) when attachments and aversions lose their power, to c) complete realization of, and union with the Atman when the objective universe disappears, to d) when the man of illumination no longer identifies the external world with the Atman, to e) when the mind and the objective world ends their services to the experiencer, to f) when the stored-up impressions within the mind and the [[guna]]s fall away forever, and finally to g) when the state of eternal existence in union with the Atman is reached. [[Swami Prabhavananda]] in connection with Yoga Sutra II.50 tells us that [[Prana]] is the vital energy by which we live and all the powers of the body and all the functions of the senses  and the mind are expressions of the force of Prana; when the [[Kundalini]] is aroused it produces various degrees of enlightenment experienced by the experiencer at seven centers  – according to [[Raja yoga]] when the mind is attached to worldliness, when it dwells in three lower centers, it has no higher spiritual ambitions or visions and stays immersed in the cravings of lust and greed; the fourth center is the heart dwelling wherein the mind makes one experience the first spiritual awakening and is filled with wonder and awe; the mind reaching the fifth center, the throat, makes one freed from ignorance and delusion; with the mind reaching the sixth center, the forehead, there is the direct vision of the Lord; and when the mind reaches the seventh center at the top of the head, [[Samadhi]] is attained. These are the seven gradual yogic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patanjali Yoga Sutras|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=92–95, 115–116|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/patanjali-yoga-sutras/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==
In response to his query – "Which is the deity who experiences dream?" – Surya was told - अत्रैष देवः स्वप्ने महिमानमनुभवति – "In the dream state the deity, the mind, experiences greatness (consisting in assuming diverse forms of subject and object)" ([[Prasna Upanishad]] IV.5); the mind is the instrument of the perceiver in the matter of experiencing greatness, and Sankara explains that the individual soul conditioned by the mind only appears to experience things in its wakefulness and in the dream-state. The body and senses depend on ignorance, desire, and the result of past actions, when these become quiet the nature of the Self becomes non-dual, auspicious and calm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eight Upanishads Vol.2|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=456–462|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/eight-upanishads-vol-2-gambhirananda/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common experience of Duality, which contains truth and untruth, is produced by the power of illusion (''Maya''), it is only through religious activities that are features of duality – based experiences that the understanding and attainment of the supreme non-dual becomes possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy|author=Oliver Leaman|publisher=Routledge|page=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aWwptHSgGhoC&amp;pg=PA217&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada and Sankara relate ''māyā'' to the Vedic metaphor of hidden (''gūdha'') Brahman ([[Katha Upanishad]] (I.iii.12)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shankara and Indian Philosophy|author=N.V.Isaeva|publisher=SUNY Press|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hshaWu0m1D4C&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TV0qU43HF8GGrgepyICIBQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada shows that it is only the existent that can appear, the non-existent cannot appear. Sankara tells us that the common experience depends on ''[[adhyasa]]'' (cognition of 'that' in 'not-that'), on something superimposed, and which is a transcendental error or ''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]''. ''[[Dvaita]]'' in whatever form is perceived by the mind, duality ceases when the mind ceases to exist and function as the mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Jaina Philosophy|author=Nathmal Tatia|publisher=Jain Publishing|pages=119–120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZ7IwbORbLgC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JmIqU8ylJNHRrQfq8oCgCg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; And, Sankara concedes that the ''[[Samadhi]]''  experience ('Transcendental Consciousness'), which describes the state devoid of cognitive functioning, will not be established, if the phenomenal self is not considered distinct from the cognitive faculty which faculty cannot be an agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Free Will, Agency and Selfhood in Indian Philosophy|author=|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=philosophy+of+experience+gaudapada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=IWMqU4ynIcbsrAeLroHABg&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=philosophy%20of%20experience%20gaudapada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankara insists:

:सङ्घातोऽपि तथा नाहमिति दृश्यविलक्षणम् |
:दृष्टारमनुमानेन निपुणं सम्प्रधारय ||

:"Similarly be sure that you are not the complex of the gross and the subtle-bodies, and intelligently determine, by inference, that you, the ‘seer’, are entirely distinct from the seen" ([[Vakya Vritti]].Sl. 17)

which means that a person should firmly ascertain that in himself he is something other than the gross and the subtle bodies. In his commentary on this statement, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] tells us that the misapprehension that the products of matter, such as body, mind and intellect, are the Self, is an experience caused by the non-apprehension of the Spiritual Essence; the non-apprehension of the Supreme Self in all its supreme transcendental resplendency, generates endless misapprehensions which are to be removed by invoking knowledge, the direct apprehension of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vakya Vritti of Adi Sankara 1991 ed.|publisher=Central Chinmaya Mission Trust|page=39|url= http://www.worldcat.org/title/vakya-vritti-of-adi-sankara-text-with-translation-and-commentary-by-swami-chinmayananda/oclc/248649509/editions?referer=di&amp;editionsView=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Sankara, [[Ramanuja]] does not admit a distinction between illusory perception and true perception, for he declares that even in illusory perception, so-called, there is some perception of reality. Thus all experience has its validity. The immediate intuition of God is not the highest transcendental consciousness (Turiya) but rather it is the transcendental experience of God in which there remains the ego as distinct from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Spiritual Heritage of India|author=Swami Prabhavananda|publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=308|url= http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/spiritual-heritage-of-india/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|R.D.Ranade]] states that the Upanishadic seers throw hints and suggest the way for realizing the Self, only too cognizant of the fact that any description of the great mystic experience by word of mouth would fall short of reality, as much as any mediate, intellectual, or expressible knowledge would fall short of immediate, intuitive, first-hand experience. There is the same gulf between the expression of an experience and the enjoyment of it, as there is between knowledge and being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher= Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=239|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Template:Law enforcement in the United States}}
The history of [[law enforcement in the United States]] includes many efforts at police reform.

==Early history==
Early efforts at police reform often involved external commissions, such as the [[Wickersham Commission]], that spelled out reforms but left implementation to the police, often with limited success.&lt;ref name="rumbaut-1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bittner|first2=Egon|last-author-amp=yes|date=1979|title=Changing Conceptions of the Police Role: A Sociological Review|journal=Crime and Justice: A Review of Research|volume=1|pages=239–288|doi=10.1086/449063|jstor=1147453|last1=Rumbaut|first1=Rubén G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s: the Johnson Administration and the Warren Court==
In the 1960s, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] created the [[President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice]]. The Commission's final report, issued in 1967,&lt;ref name="McGarrell1988"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DZCtPhhx944C&amp;pg=PA8|title=Juvenile Correctional Reform: Two Decades of Policy and Procedural Change|last=McGarrell|first=Edmund F.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=1988|isbn=978-1-4384-1243-6|page=8|via=Google Books|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been described as "the most comprehensive evaluation of crime and crime control in the United States at the time".&lt;ref name="GreeneGabbidon2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6gT7dL11OsC|title=Encyclopedia of Race and Crime|last2=Gabbidon|first2=Shaun L.|date=April 14, 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5085-5|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=Helen Taylor|last1=Greene|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It laid out reorganization plans for [[police department]]s&lt;ref name="DempseyForst2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PmUwsHp8m1wC&amp;pg=PA80|title=An Introduction to Policing|last2=Forst|first2=Linda S.|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-111-13772-4|page=80|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=John S.|last1=Dempsey|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested a range of reforms.&lt;ref name="Giles2002"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hq3Wy-DkXI4C&amp;pg=PA35|title=Law Enforcement, Communication and Community|last=Giles|first=Howard|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58811-255-2|page=35|via=Google Books|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several of the Commission's findings related to the poor treatment of juvenile offenders.&lt;ref name="HessDrowns2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fM-klUeEqEQC&amp;pg=PA49|title=Juvenile Justice|last2=Drowns|first2=Robert W.|date=June 26, 2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-50437-5|pages=49–|last-author-amp=yes|via=Google Books|first1=Kären M.|last1=Hess|accessdate=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] decisions under the [[Warren Court]] led to important changes in policing, with respect to [[civil right]]s and [[constitutional law]].  ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]'' in 1961 and ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'' in 1966 were two highly influential court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New World of Police Accountability |last=Walker |first= Samuel |date=2005 |publisher=Sage |page= 29 |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Mapp v. Ohio'' found that evidence obtained in violation of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] protection against "unreasonable searches and seizures" may not be used in criminal prosecutions.  ''Miranda v. Arizona'' required that criminal suspects must be informed of their right to consult with an attorney and of their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]  right against self-incrimination prior to questioning by police.  These decisions began to set national standards for policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s and 1980s==
Special commissions, such as the [[Knapp Commission]] in [[New York City]] during the 1970s, have been used to bring about changes in law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Civilian review boards (permanent external oversight agencies) have also been used as a means for improving police accountability.  Civilian review boards tend to focus on individual complaints, rather than broader organizational issues that may result in long-term improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1990 to 2010==
The 1994 [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]] authorized the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division|Civil Rights Division]] to bring [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] ("pattern or practice") suits against local law enforcement agencies, to rein in abuses and hold agencies accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/faq.htm#pppmp.htm |title=Department of Justice Police Misconduct Pattern or Practice Program (FAQ) |publisher=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=November 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, numerous departments have entered into [[consent decree]]s or [[memorandum of understanding|memoranda of understanding]], requiring the agencies to make organizational reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Walker|2005|p= 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach shifts focus from individual officers to police organizations.

The Department of Justice also has a component called the Community Relations Service. Over the years, the Community Relations Service (CRS) has helped police departments and communities all over the country come to grips with the difficult task of maintaining law and order in a complex and changing multicultural society. Frequently, these efforts have involved minority citizens' complaints about police behavior, use of force, and hate groups.

To reduce the potential for violence, police executives must inculcate the values articulated by policy and procedure into two levels of the police department: the administrative level and the "line" or operational level. To accomplish the task of value-transition on one level without doing so on the other is futile, for no change in police behavior will result. In addition to the two levels of the organization which the police executive must address, two ''dimensions'' of law enforcement must also be addressed: the police culture and various community cultures. Thus, to effect change in police-community violence, police executives must take a multidimensional approach. Traditional approaches to reform have been one-dimensional, and have met with little success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.justice.gov/archive/crs/pubs/principlesofgoodpolicingfinal092003.htm|title = Principles of Good Policing: Avoiding Violence Between Police and Citizens |website = www.justice.gov|access-date = 2016-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2010 to present==
Some law enforcement agencies in the United States in the early 2000s and 2010s began to emphasize [[de-escalation]] as a method of [[conflict resolution]] and obtaining voluntary compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Federal judge approves key step in SPD reforms|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/federal-judge-approves-key-step-in-spd-reforms/|accessdate = 2015-04-17|website = |publisher = Seattle Times|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police training turning warriors into guardians|url = http://www.yakimaherald.com/photosandvideos/statephotos/1299430-8/police-training-turning-warriors-into-guardians|accessdate = 2015-04-17|website = Yakima Herald Republic|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also emphases on [[community policing]] to build relationships and community trust in law enforcement; the [[evidence-based policing]] approach of using of data to assist with decision-making; and the importance of civilian oversight of police work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://nij.gov/journals/269/Pages/evidence.aspx|title = Being Smart on Crime With Evidence-based Policing|last = Bueermann|first = Jim|date = March 26, 2012|journal = Being Smart on Crime With Evidence-based Policing|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Issues in Policing|last=Cordner|first=G.W.|publisher=Waveland Press Inc.|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=432–449|chapter=Community Policing Elements and Effects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=111&amp;issue_id=102003|title = Citizen Oversight of Law Enforcement:Challenge and Opportunity|date = October 2003|accessdate = |website = The Police Chief|publisher = The International Association of Chiefs of Police|last = Farrow|first = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police use of force and issues of race===

In the 2010s, a series of shootings of unarmed individuals by police officers correlated with calls for police and law enforcement reform, especially regarding the diversity of police officers and the treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system.

In the specific case of the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in Ferguson in August 2014, an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division]] concluded that, while there were not sufficient grounds to charge the police officer who shot Brown with a criminal offense, the Ferguson Police Department as a whole "was routinely violating the constitutional rights of its black residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apuzzo|first1= Matt |date= March 3, 2015 |title=Ferguson Police Routinely Violate Rights of Blacks, Justice Dept.

President [[Barack Obama]] created the [[President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/policingtaskforce|title = President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing|date = |accessdate = |website = www.cops.doj.gov|publisher = United States Department of Justice Community Oriented Policing Services|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission issued a report on March 2, 2015, that made numerous recommendations.

[[Sue Rahr]], when she was sheriff of [[King County]], had introduced a new policing model called L.E.E.D. (Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity) in 2011, which influenced her later work on the "guardian model" of training police candidates when she became the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission; Obama appointed Rahr to the President's Task Force, where the "guardian model" received support as a desirable alternative to the "warrior model" of training officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police Academy 2.0: Less military training, more empathy|url = http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/police-academy-20-less-military-training-more-empathy/|accessdate = 2015-05-27|date = July 13, 2013|publisher = The Seattle Times|last = Miletich|first = Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Police: From Warriors to Guardians|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-wallis/police-from-warriors-to-g_b_6816726.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-05-27|last = Wallis|first = Jim|date = March 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.stltoday.com/news/opinion/columns/the-platform/editorial-the-hammer-of-justice-falls-on-ferguson/article_72140bc3-9761-5385-a586-5e814bba8b11.html|title = Editorial: The hammer of Justice falls on Ferguson|date = March 4, 2015|accessdate = May 26, 2015|website = |publisher = St. Louis Post-Dispatch|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Four Pillars of Justice Based Policing: Listen and Explain with Equity and Dignity|url = https://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?a=368336&amp;c=56523|website = www.portlandonline.com|accessdate = 2015-05-27|date = |last = Rahr|first = Sue|last2 = Diaz|first2 = John|last3 = Hawe|first3 = Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rahr said in a U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee hearing that, "When I talk about a guardian mindset... this is not a more kind and gentle way of doing the job. It's the opposite. We have increased firearms training and defensive tactics training, because we want to create strong, effective police officers who have the confidence that they don't [need] to behave in an intimidating manner. When someone has confidence, that helps deescalate as well. I think that when we were too focused on the boot camp method of training, it detracted away from our ability to train officers to be [[critical thinking|critical thinkers]]... What we have tried to shift towards is [[officer training]], where you focus on critical thinking and confidence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Policing Strategies|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?326139-1/hearing-community-policing|website=c-span.org|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesperson for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] said that the ideas in the report of the President's Commission "will significantly improve the relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve" and that "For us to see meaningful change, local authorities must first implement data collection systems to improve transparency, use of force policies that emphasize de-escalation, eradicate all forms of biased policing, and improve community engagement and oversight to provide accountability."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bacon|first1=Perry, Jr.|date= March 2, 2015 |title=Obama Police Commission Sidesteps Most Controversial Reforms|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/obama-police-commission-sidesteps-most-controversial-reforms-n315801|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2015 Baltimore protests]], President [[Barack Obama]] said that "It's in [the interest of police officers] to root out [police] who aren't doing the right thing, to hold accountable people when they do something wrong, instead of just the closing-ranks approach that all too often we see that ends up just feeding greater frustration and ultimately, I think, putting more police officers in danger." Obama also said, "Unfortunately we've seen these police-related killings or deaths too often now, and obviously everybody is starting to recognize that this is not just an isolated incident in Ferguson or New York, but we've got some broader issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pickler|first1=Nedra|title=Obama: police must hold officers accountable for wrongdoing|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/obama-police-must-hold-officers-accountable-for-wrongdoing/|website=seattletimes.com|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police leaders responded on January 29, 2016, with "Use of Force: Taking Policing to a Higher Standard" (http://www.policeforum.org/assets/30%20guiding%20principles.pdf). According to ''The New York Times'', the new guideline call for police to use higher standards for use of force than those set by the U.S. Supreme Court (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/30/nyregion/police-leaders-unveil-principles-intended-to-shift-policing-practices-nationwide.html?_r=0). "This is a defining moment for us in policing," said Charles Ramsey, the recently-retired commissioner of the Philadelphia Police Department, according to The Washington Post (https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/29/police-chiefs-consider-dramatic-reforms-to-officer-tactics-training-to-prevent-so-many-shootings/).

On July 7, 2016, after police shootings of black individuals in [[Shooting of Philando Castile|St Paul, Minnesota]] and [[Shooting of Alton Sterling|Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], Obama said that "When incidents like this occur, there's a big chunk of our fellow citizenry that feels as if it's because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same... This is not just a black issue, not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we all should care about." That same day, at a protest in [[Dallas, Texas]], an attacker [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|shot and killed multiple officers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas protest: Three police officers dead in sniper shooting|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36742835|website=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Furber|first2=Matt|last3=Perez-Penajuly|first3=Richard|title=11 Officers Shot, 4 Fatally, During Dallas Protest of Police Shootings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-falcon-heights-shooting.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 17, [[2016 shooting of Baton Rouge police officers|multiple officers were shot and killed in Baton Rouge]] amid tensions after the shooting of Alton Sterling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bloom|first1=Julie|last2=McPhate|first2=Mike|title=Three Police Officers Killed and Several Wounded in Baton Rouge Shooting|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/us/baton-rouge-shooting.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama and Black Lives Matter leaders condemned the violence. Obama said, "We may not yet know the motives for this attack, but I want to be clear: there is no justification for violence against law enforcement. None. These attacks are the work of cowards who speak for no one. They right no wrongs. They advance no causes. The officers in Baton Rouge; the officers in Dallas – they were our fellow Americans, part of our community, part of our country, with people who loved and needed them, and who need us now – all of us – to be at our best."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Live Updates: Baton Rouge Police Officers Shot|url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/police-shooting-in-baton-rouge/black-lives-matter-leader-calls-for-peace/|website=The New York Times|accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police use of force on mentally ill individuals===
Another dimension of police work receiving scrutiny in the 2010s is the interactions between police officers and individuals with mental illness. "Twenty-five percent or more of people fatally shot by the police have had a mental disorder, according to various analyses." Experts in criminal justice say that funding for mental health services in many parts of the country is insufficient, so police are likely to encounter mentally ill people. In response to negative reactions from the public to high-profile violent interactions between police and mentally ill individuals, some police departments are increasing their specialized training and changing their tactics for their interactions with mentally ill people. For example, all officers in Portland, Oregon receive 40 hours of "crisis intervention training". Officers in some departments may specialize in this type of work, similar to how other officers specialize in SWAT, narcotics, or K-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goode|first1=Erica|title=For Police, a Playbook for Conflicts Involving Mental Illness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/26/health/police-mental-illness-crisis-intervention.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2016|accessdate=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gunter|first1=Joel|title=Are US police too quick to shoot knife-wielding suspects?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-41314562|accessdate=September 20, 2017|work=BBC News, Washington DC|date=September 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reform of law enforcement agencies with other forms of misconduct===

====Oakland, California Police Department====
The [[Oakland Police Department|Oakland, California Police Department]] had three police chiefs in nine days amid revelations that some Oakland officers had shared inappropriate text messages and emails, that a police sergeant allowed his girlfriend to write his reports, and that there had been sexual misconduct among officers of multiple law enforcement agencies and at least one [[U.S. Department of Defense]] employee. [[Oakland, California|Oakland's]] mayor, Libby Schaaf, said at a news conference, "I am here to run a police department, not a frat house," and that she wants "to root out what is clearly a toxic, macho culture." Peter Keane, a former [[San Francisco]] police commissioner and law professor at [[Golden Gate University]], said, "I think she can find someone who is really ruthless about instituting reforms of these kinds of things" but "You can't do any of this stuff with an internal candidate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matier|first1=Phil|last2=Swan|first2=Rachel|last3=Ross|first3=Andy|title=Oakland police bombshells: Racist texts, latest chief steps down|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Latest-Oakland-police-chief-is-out-after-two-days-8310286.php|website=sfgate.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Los Angeles County Jails and Sheriff's Department====
On June 27, 2016, a federal judge sentenced Paul Tanaka, a former second-in-command of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]], to five years in prison. The Court found him guilty of conspiracy and of obstructing an [[FBI]] investigation of abuses at the [[Los Angeles County Jails|county jails]]. Judge [[Percy Anderson (judge)|Percy Anderson]] said, "Not only did (Tanaka) fail to identify and address problems in the jails, he exacerbated them." The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that "Prosecutors accused him of overseeing a scheme in which underlings tried to intimidate the lead FBI agent on the inquiry, concealed the whereabouts of an inmate who was working as a federal informant and pressured deputies not to cooperate with the investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Joel|title=Former top L.A.

===Firings and resignations of police chiefs===
Police chiefs of Chicago, San Francisco, Baltimore, and Oakland were fired or resigned in 2015 and 2016 after various controversies, often involving issues of race and allegations of use of excessive force by officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berman|first1=Mark|last2=Guarino|first2=Mark|title=Chicago police superintendent fired by mayor amid outcry over video of shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2015/12/01/chicago-police-superintendent-fired|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glover|first1=Scott|last2=Simon|first2=Dan|title=Embattled San Francisco police chief resigns after shooting|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/19/us/san-francisco-police-chief-resigns/index.html|website=cnn.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's chief was fired after a judge ordered the city to make a video public that showed the [[Shooting of Laquan McDonald|shooting of an individual by a police officer]], and after public criticism of the city's handling of the video. Baltimore's chief was fired after a [[death of Freddie Gray|citizen died in police custody in controversial circumstances]], riots after the death, and amidst a crime surge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolberg|first1=Sheryl|last2=Oppel, Jr.|first2=Richard|title=Baltimore Fires Police Chief in Wake of Unrest and Crime Surge|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/09/us/baltimore-police-commissioner-is-fired-by-mayor.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Praise of the Dallas, Texas Police Department===
After the [[2016 shooting of Dallas police officers|2016 shooting of multiple officers in Dallas, Texas]] during what had been a peaceful protest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dallas protest: Three police officers dead in sniper shooting|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36742835|website=BBC News|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fernandez|first1=Manny|last2=Furber|first2=Matt|last3=Perez-Penajuly|first3=Richard|title=11 Officers Shot, 4 Fatally, During Dallas Protest of Police Shootings|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/08/us/philando-castile-falcon-heights-shooting.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were reports in the media that Dallas had one of the most progressive police departments in the nation. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said, "We did community policing before anybody, we had de-escalation training before anyone. We had this year the lowest number of police involved shootings than any major city in the country, and so it's very ironic that our police were protecting those that were exercising their freedom of speech and they lost their lives doing their jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Song|first1=Jean|title=Dallas police praised for community outreach efforts|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/dallas-shooting-police-ambush-department-praised-community-outreach/|website=www.cbsnews.com|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police Chief David Brown received widespread praise for his leadership in the aftermath of the shooting of his officers, although in the past he has faced criticism for the low pay of Dallas officers compared to neighboring jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heinz|first1=Frank|title=Dallas Chief of Police David Brown Announces Retirement|url=http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Dallas-Chief-of-Police-David-Brown-Announces-Retirement-392046861.html|website=www.nbcdfw.com|accessdate=25 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown addressed protestors in a speech, saying "Become a part of the solution. Serve your community, don't be a part of the problem. We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we'll put you in your neighborhood and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about." Job applications for the police department rose significantly in the days following the officers' shootings and Brown's statement, and the department received demonstrations of public appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dart|first1=Tom|title=Dallas police department applications triple after fatal shooting of five officers|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/25/dallas-police-applications-rise-officers-protest-shooting|website=The Guardian|accessdate=25 December 2016|date=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''politics of outer space''' includes space treaties, [[space law|law in space]], international cooperation and conflict in [[space exploration]], and the hypothetical political impact of any contact with extraterrestrial intelligence.

'''Astropolitics''', also known as '''astropolitik''', has its foundations in [[geopolitics]] and is a theory that is used for [[outer space|space]] in its broadest sense. Astropolitics is often studied as an aspect of the [[security studies]] and [[international relations]] subfields of [[political science]]. This includes the role of space exploration in [[diplomacy]] as well as the [[military]] uses of satellites, for example, for [[surveillance]] or [[cyber warfare]].

An important aspect of the [[geopolitics]] of space is the prevention of a military threat to Earth from outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/3046250/Meta-Geopolitics_of_Outer_Space-_Press_Release_June_14_2012 promotional material for "Meta-Geopolitics of Outer Space" by N. Al-Rodhan]&lt;/ref&gt; 

International cooperation on space projects has resulted in the creation of new national space agencies. By 2005 there were 35 national civilian space agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265964606000245 | doi=10.1016/j.spacepol.2006.02.007 | volume=22 | issue=2 | title=The changing geopolitics of space activities | year=2006 | journal=Space Policy | pages=100–109 | last1 = Peter | first1 = Nicolas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], the '''positivity effect''' is the ability to constructively analyze a situation where the desired results are not achieved; but still obtain positive feedback that assists our future progression. When a person is considering people they like (including themselves), the person tends to make situational attributions about their negative behaviors and dispositional attributions about their positive behaviors. The reverse may be true for people that the person dislikes. This may well be because of the [[cognitive dissonance|dissonance]] between liking a person and seeing them behave negatively.
Example: If a friend hits someone, one would tell them the other guy deserved it or that he had to defend himself.

== In attribution==
{{Main article|Selective perception}}
The positivity effect pertains to the tendency of people, when evaluating the causes of the behaviors of a person they like or prefer, to attribute the person's inherent disposition as the cause of their positive behaviors and the situations surrounding them as the cause of their negative behaviors. The positivity effect is the inverse of the ''[[negativity effect]]'', which is found when people evaluate the causes of the behaviors of a person they dislike.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11769">'''Pregroup grammar (PG)''' is a [[Formal grammar|grammar formalism]] intimately related to [[categorial grammar]]s. Much like categorial grammar (CG), PG is a kind of [[type logical grammar]]. Unlike CG, however, PG does not have a distinguished function type. Rather, PG uses inverse types combined with its monoidal operation.

== Definition of a pregroup ==

A pregroup is a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[universal algebra|algebra]] &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot, -^l, -^r, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monoid]], satisfying the following relations:

* &lt;math&gt;x^l \cdot x \leq 1 \qquad x \cdot x^r \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(contraction)
* &lt;math&gt;1 \leq x \cdot x^l \qquad 1 \leq x^r \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(expansion)

The contraction and expansion relations are sometimes called  [[Ajdukiewicz]] laws.

From this, it can be proven that the following equations hold:

* &lt;math&gt;1^l = 1 = 1^r&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^{lr} = x = x^{rl}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(x\cdot y)^l = y^l \cdot x^l \qquad (x\cdot y)^r = y^r \cdot x^r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^r&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[left adjoint|left]] and [[right adjoint]]s of ''x'', respectively.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; are also written &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In [[category theory]], pregroups are also known as [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

== Definition of a pregroup grammar ==

A pregroup grammar consists of a [[lexicon]] of words (and possibly [[morphemes]]) ''L'', a set of atomic types ''T'' which [[free object|freely generates]] a pregroup, and an relation &lt;math&gt;:&lt;/math&gt; that relates words to types. In simple pregroup grammars, typing is a function that maps words to only one type each.

=== Examples ===

Some simple, intuitive examples using English as the language to model demonstrate the core principles behind pregroups and their use in linguistic domains.

Let ''L'' = {John, Mary, the, dog, cat, met, barked, at}, let ''T'' = {''N, S, N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}, and let the following typing relation holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{John} : N \qquad \text{Mary} : N \qquad \text{the} : N \cdot N_0^l \qquad \text{dog} : N_0 \qquad \text{cat} : N_0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{met} : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \qquad \text{barked} : N^r \cdot S \qquad \text{at} : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l&lt;/math&gt;

A sentence ''S'' that has type ''T'' is said to be grammatical if &lt;math&gt;T \leq S&lt;/math&gt;. We can prove this by use of a chain of &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we can prove that &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; is grammatical by proving that &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N \leq S&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S&lt;/math&gt;

by first using contraction on &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r&lt;/math&gt; and then again on &lt;math&gt;N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt;. A more convenient notation exists, however, that indicates contractions by connecting them with a drawn link between the contracting types (provided that the links are nested, i.e. don't cross). Words are also typically placed above their types to make the proof more intuitive. The same proof in this notation is simply

[[File:PregroupGrammar-Example-JohnMetMary.png|center|frameless]]

A more complex example proves that ''the dog barked at the cat'' is grammatical:

== Historical notes ==

Pregroup grammars have been introduced by [[Joachim Lambek]] in 1993 as a development of his [[Categorial grammar|syntactic calculus]], replacing the quotients by adjoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such adjoints had already been used earlier by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]] but without iterated adjoints and expansion rules.
Adding such adjoints was interesting to handle more complex linguistic cases, where the fact that &lt;math&gt;a^{ll} \neq a&lt;/math&gt; is needed. It was also motivated by a more algebraic viewpoint: the definition of a pregroup is a weakening of that of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], introducing a distinction between the left and right inverses and replacing the equality by an order. This weakening was needed because using types from a [[free group]] would not work: an adjective would get the type &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, hence it could be inserted at any position in the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Semantics of pregroup grammars ==

Because of the lack of function types in PG, the usual method of giving a semantics via the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]] or via function denotations is not available in any obvious way. Instead, two different methods exist, one purely formal method that corresponds to the λ-calculus, and one denotational method analogous to (a fragment of) the tensor mathematics of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Purely formal semantics ===

The purely formal semantics for PG consists of a logical language defined according to the following rules:

* Given a set of atomic terms ''T'' = {''a'', ''b'', ...} and atomic function symbols ''F'' = {''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ...} (where subscripts are meta-notational indicating arity), and variables ''x'', ''y'', ..., all constants, variables, and well-formed function applications are basic terms (a function application is well-formed when the function symbol is applied to the appropriate number of arguments, which can be drawn from the atomic terms, variables, or can be other basic terms)
* Any basic term is a term
* Given any variable ''x'', [''x''] is a term
* Given any terms ''m'' and ''n'', &lt;math&gt;m \cdot n&lt;/math&gt; is a term

Some examples of terms are ''f''(''x''), ''g''(''a'',''h''(''x'',''y'')), &lt;math&gt;g(x,b) \cdot [x]&lt;/math&gt;. A variable ''x'' is free in a term ''t'' if [''x''] does not appear in ''t'', and a term with no free variables is a closed term. Terms can be typed with pregroup types in the obvious manner.

The usual conventions regarding α conversion apply.

For a given language, we give an assignment ''I'' that maps typed words to typed closed terms in a way that respects the pregroup structure of the types. For the English fragment given above we might therefore have the following assignment (with the obvious, implicit set of atomic terms and function symbols):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I(John : N) &amp;= j : E
\\
I(Mary : N) &amp;= m : E
\\
I(the : N \cdot N_0^l) &amp;= \iota(p) \cdot [p] : E \cdot E_0^l
\\
I(dog : N_0) &amp;= dog : E_0
\\
I(cat : N_0) &amp;= cat : E_0
\\
I(met : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot met(x,y) \cdot [y] : E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\\
I(barked : N^r \cdot S) &amp;= [x] \cdot barked(x) : E^r \cdot T
\\
I(at : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot y \cdot [y] \cdot at(x,z) \cdot [z] : T^r \cdot E^{rr} \cdot E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the type of entities in the domain, and ''T'' is the type of truth values.

Together with this core definition of the semantics of PG, we also have a reduction rules that are employed in parallel with the type reductions. Placing the syntactic types at the top and semantics below, we have

[[File:PregroupGrammar-LeftAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

[[File:PregroupGrammar-RightAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

For example, applying this to the types and semantics for the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot (N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; (emphasizing the link being reduced)

[[File:SemanticCalculation-JohnMetMary.png|center|frameless|upright=1.25]]

For the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{the dog barked at the cat} : (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0 \cdot (N^r \cdot S) \cdot (S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0&lt;/math&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11656">'''Privacy for research participants''' is a concept in [[research ethics]] which states that a person in [[human subject research]] has a [[right to privacy]] when participating in [[research]]. Some examples of typical scenarios are that a surveyor doing [[social research]] conducts an interview where the research participant is a respondent, or when a researcher for a [[clinical trial]] asks for a blood sample from a participant to see if there is a relationship between something which can be measured in blood and a person's health. In both cases, the ideal outcome is that any participant can join the study and neither the researcher nor the study design nor the publication of the study results would ever identify any participant in the study.

People decide to participate in research for any number of different reasons, such as a personal interest, a desire to promote research which benefits their community, or for other reasons. Various [[guidelines for human subject research]] protect study participants who choose to participate in research, and the international consensus is that the rights of people who participate in studies are best protected when the study participant can trust that researchers will not connect the identities of study participants with their input into the study.

Many study participants have experienced problems when their privacy was not upheld after participating in research. Sometimes privacy is not kept because of insufficient study protection, but also sometimes it is because of unanticipated problems with the study design which inadvertently compromise privacy. The privacy of research participants is typically protected by the research organizer, but the [[institutional review board]] is a designated overseer which monitors the organizer to provide protection to study participants.

==Information privacy==
{{main|Information privacy}}
Researchers publish data that they get from participants. To preserve participants' privacy, the data goes through a process to [[De-identification|de-identify]] it. The goal of such a process would be to remove [[protected health information]] which could be used to connect a study participant to their contribution to a research project so that the participants will not suffer from [[Data Re-Identification|data re-identification]].

===Privacy attacks===
A privacy attack is the exploitation of an opportunity for someone to identify a study participant based on public research data.&lt;ref name="identifiability"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Malin | first1 = B. | last2 = Loukides | first2 = G. | last3 = Benitez | first3 = K. | last4 = Clayton | first4 = E. W. | title = Identifiability in biobanks: Models, measures, and mitigation strategies | doi = 10.1007/s00439-011-1042-5 | journal = Human Genetics | volume = 130 | issue = 3 | pages = 383–392 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21739176| pmc = 3621020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The way that this might work is that researchers collect data, including confidential identifying data, from study participants. This produces an identified dataset.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt; Before the data is sent for research processing, it is "de-identified", which means that personally identifying data is removed from the dataset. Ideally, this means that the dataset alone could not be used to identify a participant.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt;

In some cases, the researchers simply misjudge the information in a de-identified dataset and actually it is identifying, or perhaps the advent of new technology makes the data identifying.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt; In other cases, the published de-identified data can be cross-referenced with other data sets, and by finding matches between an identified dataset and the de-identified data set, participants in the de-identified set may be revealed.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt;

===Risk mitigation===
The ideal situation from the research perspective is the free sharing of data.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt; Since privacy for research participants is a priority, though, various proposals for protecting participants have been made for different purposes.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt; Replacing the real data with [[synthetic data]] allows the researchers to show data which gives a conclusion equivalent to the one drawn by the researchers, but the data may have problems such as being unfit for repurposing for other research.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt; Other strategies include "noise addition" by making random value changes or "data swapping" by exchanging values across entries.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1145/76894.76895 | volume=21 | title=Security-control methods for statistical databases: a comparative study | journal=ACM Computing Surveys | pages=515–556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still another approach is to separate the identifiable variables in the data from the rest, aggregate the identifiable variables and reattach them with the rest of the data. This principle has been used successfully in creating maps of diabetes in Australia &lt;ref name=Mazumdar&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mazumdar S, Konings P, Hewett M |title= Protecting the privacy of individual general practice patient electronic records for geospatial epidemiology research |journal= Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health |year=2014|volume=38|issue=6|pages=548–552| doi=10.1111/1753-6405.12262|pmid=25308525|display-authors=etal}} http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1753-6405.12262/full&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom &lt;ref name=Nobel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nobel |first1=D |last2=Smith |first2=D |last3=Mathur |first3=R |last4=Robson |first4=J |last5=Greenhalgh |first5=T |authorlink5=Trisha Greenhalgh |title= Feasibility study of geospatial mapping of chronic disease risk to inform public health commissioning |url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000711 |journal= [[BMJ Open]] |date=15 February 2012 |volume=2| doi=10.1136/bmjopen-2011-000711 | pmid=22337817 |pages=e000711 |pmc=3282296}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; using confidential General Practice clinic data.

==Biobank privacy==
A [[biobank]] is a place where human biological specimens are kept for research, and often where [[genomics]] data is paired with [[phenotype]] data and personally-identifying data. For many reasons, biobank research has created new controversies, perspectives, and challenges for satisfying the rights of student participants and the needs of the researchers to access resources for their work.&lt;ref name="identifiability"/&gt;

One problem is that if even a small percentage of genetic information is available, that information can be used to uniquely identify the individual from which it came. Studies have shown that a determination of whether an individual participated in a study can be made even from reporting of aggregate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clayton | first1 = D. | title = On inferring presence of an individual in a mixture: A Bayesian approach | journal = Biostatistics | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 661–673 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20522729 | pmc = 2950790 | doi = 10.1093/biostatistics/kxq035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative consequences==
When research participants have their identities revealed they may have problems. Concerns include facing [[genetic discrimination]] from an [[insurance company]] or [[employer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lemke | first1 = A. A. | last2 = Wolf | first2 = W.

The '''quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns''' ({{lang-fr|querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}}) began overtly as a [[literature|literary]] and artistic debate that heated up in the early 17th century and shook the [[Académie française]].

==Origins of the debate==
It was an essential feature of the European Renaissance to praise recent discoveries and achievements as a means to assert the independence of modern culture from the institutions and wisdom inherited from Classical (Greek and Roman) authorities. From the first years of the sixteenth century, one of the major reasonings used to this end by the most eminent [[Humanism|humanists]] ([[François Rabelais]], [[Girolamo Cardano]], [[Jean Bodin]], [[Louis LeRoy]], [[Tommaso Campanella]], [[Francis Bacon]], etc.) was that of the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" – the printing press, firearms, and the nautical compass – which together allowed the Moderns to communicate, exert power, and travel at distances never imagined by the Ancients.&lt;ref&gt;Boruchoff, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; When the quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns later arose in France, the "Three Greatest Inventions of Modern Times" would almost invariably be adduced as evidence of the Moderns' superiority.

The debate became known as 'a quarrel' after the frequently made [[pun]] on [[Charles Perrault]]'s title ''Parallel of the Ancients and the Moderns'', the French word 'querelle' being substituted for 'parallele'.

==Debate in France==
On one side of the debate were the Ancients (''Anciens''), led by [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]. The Ancients supported the merits of the ancient authors, and contended that a writer could do no better than imitate them. On the other side were the Moderns (''Modernes''), who opened fire first with [[Charles Perrault|Perrault]]'s ''Le siècle de Louis le Grand'' ("The Century of Louis the Great," 1687), in which he supported the merits of the authors of the century of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and expressed the Moderns' stance in a nutshell:

{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
::''La docte Antiquité dans toute sa durée
::''A l'égal de nos jours ne fut point éclairée.''
{{col-break}}
Learned [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], through all its extent, &lt;br /&gt;Was never [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightened]] to equal our times.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault's poem was published in 1687 in [[François de Callières]]'s ''Histoire poetique de la guerre nouvellement declarée entre les anciens et les modernes'' ("Poetic history of the war recently declared between the ancients and the moderns"),  which was not itself strictly partisan of one side or the other..&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]] quickly followed with his ''Digression sur les anciens et les modernes'' (1688), in which he took the Modern side, pressing the argument that modern scholarship allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge.

In the opening years of the next century, [[Marivaux]] was to show himself a Modern by establishing a new genre of theatre, unknown to the Ancients, the sentimental comedy (''[[comédie larmoyante]]''). In it the impending tragedy was resolved at the end, amid reconciliations and floods of tears. By constraining his choice of subjects to those drawn from the literature of [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], [[Jean Racine]] showed himself one of the Ancients. He also restricted his tragedies by the [[classical unities]], derived by the [[classicism|classicists]] from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': the unities of place, time, and action (one scene location, 24 hours, and consistent actions respectively).

==Assessment==
The Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns was a cover, often a witty one, for deeper opposed views. The very idea of Progress was under attack on the one side, and [[Authority]] on the other.  The new [[Antiquary|antiquarian interests]] led to critical reassessment of the products of Antiquity that would eventually bring Scripture itself under the magnifying glass of some Moderns.  The attack on authority in literary criticism had analogues in the rise of scientific inquiry, and the Moderns' challenge to authority in literature foreshadowed a later extension of challenging inquiry in systems of politics and religion.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Analogous 17th–20th century debates==
In the 17th century, [[William Temple (British politician)|Sir William Temple]] argued against the Modern position in his essay ''On Ancient and Modern Learning''; therein he repeated the [[literary topos|commonplace]], originally from [[Bernard of Chartres]], that we see more only because we are dwarves [[standing on the shoulders of giants]].   Temple's essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were classicist and editor [[Richard Bentley]] and critic [[William Wotton]].

The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, but it was revisited by [[Jonathan Swift]], who saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general orientations or ways of life. He articulated his discussion most notably in his [[satire]] ''[[A Tale of a Tub]]'', composed between 1694 and 1697 and published in 1704 with the famous prolegomenon ''[[The Battle of the Books]]'', long after the initial salvoes were over in France. Swift's polarizing satire provided a framework for other satirists in his circle of the [[Scriblerus Club|Scriblerian]]s.

Two other distinguished 18th-century philosophers who wrote at length concerning the distinction between moderns and ancients are [[Giambattista Vico]] (cf. e.g. his ''[[De nostri temporis studiorum ratione]]'') and [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (for whom the moderns see 'more,' but the ancients see 'better').

In 19th-century England, highlighting the distinction between Hellenism ("Athens"/reason or "sweetness and light") and Hebraism ("Jerusalem"/faith), [[Matthew Arnold]] defended the ancients (most notably Plato and Aristotle) against the dominant progressive intellectual trends of his times.  Arnold drew attention to the fact that the great divide between ancients and modernists pertained to the understanding of the relation between liberty/reason and authority.

Countering the thrust of much of 20th-century intellectual history and literary criticism, [[Leo Strauss]] has contended that the debate between ancients and moderns (or the defenders of either camp) is ill understood when reduced to questions of progress or regress.  Strauss himself revived the old "querelle," siding with the ancients (against the modernist position advocated, e.g., by Strauss's friend [[Alexandre Kojève]]).{{cn|date=April 2015}}

{{inconsistent citation style|date=August 2013}}
'''Reverence''' ({{IPA|/ˈrɛvərəns/}}) is "a feeling or attitude of deep [[respect]] tinged with [[awe]]; veneration".&lt;ref&gt;Reverence | Define Reverence at Dictionary.com. (n.d.). Dictionary.com | Free Online Dictionary for English Definitions. Retrieved April 28, 2011, from http://dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;  The word "reverence" in the modern day is often used in relationship with [[religion]].  This is because religion often stimulates the emotion through recognition of [[God]], the [[supernatural]], and the [[ineffability|ineffable]].  Reverence involves a humbling of the self in respectful recognition of something perceived to be greater than the self.  Thus religion is commonly a place where reverence is felt.

However, similar to [[awe]], reverence is an emotion in its own right, and can be felt outside of the realm of [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Gibbons|first= Kendyl   |date=  May 15, 2012 |title= Primal reverence |journal= UU World |volume=   XXVII No. 2 |issue= Summer 2012 |pages=  |publisher= [[Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations]] |id=   |doi= |url=  http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/199598.shtml |quote= Reverence is an organic human experience that requires no supernatural explanations.'|accessdate= July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas awe may be characterized as an overwhelming "[[sensitivity (human)|sensitivity]] to greatness," reverence is seen more as "acknowledging a [[subjectivity|subjective]] response to something [[excellence|excellent]] in a personal ([[moral]] or [[spirituality|spiritual]]) way, but qualitatively above oneself" &lt;ref&gt;Roberts, R. C. (2003). Emotions: An essay in aid of moral psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press. p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon describes awe as passive, but reverence as active, noting that the [[feeling]] of awe (i.e., becoming awestruck) implies [[paralysis]], whereas feelings of reverence are associated more with active [[engagement]] and responsibility toward that which one reveres.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, R. C. (2002). Spirituality for the skeptic: The thoughtful love of life. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nature]], [[science]], [[literature]], [[philosophy]], great [[philosophers]], [[leaders]], [[artists]], [[art]], [[music]], [[wisdom]], and [[beauty]] may each act as the stimulus and focus of reverence.

== Religion and music ==
David Pugmire’s article, "The Secular Reception of Religious Music" explores the unique experience of reverence through music.  In particular he looks at how religious music has the capacity to instill emotions of reverence, awe, wonder, and veneration in secular people who lack the context to fully understand the transcendent through religion.  "Sacred music seems to have a surprising power over unbelievers not just to quicken or delight them as other music does, but also to ply them, as little else can, with what might be called devotional feelings".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"&gt;Pugmire, D. (2006). The Secular Reception of Religious Music. Philosophy, 81(315), 65-79. {{doi|10.1017/S0031819106000040}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this though, Pugmire argues that the secularist cannot fully comprehend the nature of sacred art including sacred music.  "Its undoubted expressiveness can lead him at most to accesses of feeling, not to emotion in the fullest sense, i.e., emotion with appropriate objects sustained by appropriate judgments".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;

Pugmire believes that reverence belongs to the range of emotions that can be classified in their devotional or [[sacred]] forms, "Emotions of reverence, solemnity, agape, hope, serenity, and ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this classification of emotions poses an interesting question: can any emotion be purely religious?  "A central candidate for a distinctively religious emotion would be reverence".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But it is not entirely distinct from the rest of the emotions that are not related to transcendence or religion.  "Reverence is indeed graver, and an attitude in which one is more given over, than its secular approximations in the shape of approval or esteem or respect".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  But this does not make it purely religious.  In fact, "[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] was able to claim reverence as our principal moral emotion without invoking any grounding theological basis for this".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  "Similarly for its bracing sibling, awe: it figures in our experience of the sublime, of which Kant purports to find an entirely secular account".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  To connect the secular and the sacred emotions Pugmire looks at the emotions which can be experienced equally in both contexts.  These are, "Love, humility, sorrow, pity, joy, serenity, ecstasy".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Pugmire then suggests that devotional emotion is: "The transfiguring of mundane emotion into what one might call emotion of the last instance, to the reception and expression of which religious imagery is especially well-suited, and not accidentally".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  The emotion of the last instance refers to the capacity of the emotional imagination to lose the sense of self and engage in the infinite and the ineffable.  Pugmire is suggesting that religion, "Provides a strikingly apt vocabulary for the expression of emotion of the last instance".&lt;ref name="PD 65-79"/&gt;  Reverence is perhaps the most critical of these "emotions of the last instance" and can be adequately accessed through religious music.

==Major Theorists of Reverence ==

=== Paul Woodruff ===
[[Paul Woodruff]] in his book, ''Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue'', assesses the current understanding of the emotion reverence in the modern era.  He assesses that a true understanding of reverence is missing from both modern society and the "modern discussions of the ancient cultures that prized it" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;3).  Specifically these ancient cultures include [[Greece]] and [[China]].  Woodruff’s best definition of Reverence is, "The well-developed capacity to have the feelings of [[awe]], [[respect]], and [[shame]] when these are the right feelings to have" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;8).  Thus Woodruff’s definition of reverence includes the combination of three other emotions: respect, shame, and awe.  "Respect is for other people, shame is over one’s own shortcomings, and awe is usually felt toward something transcendent" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).
Although Woodruff acknowledges the relationship between reverence and religion he argues that, "Reverence has more to do with politics than with religion" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;4).  Woodruff in his book is trying to separate the common misunderstanding that reverent emotions can only be related to religion.

Woodruff sees [[ceremony]] and [[ritual]] as key elements in meaningful human life when practiced with reverence.  "Without reverence, rituals are empty" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;19).  Ceremony and ritual are found at home, in meetings, in voting, and in religion and these acts provide the context for feeling reverence.  But often these situations are so common the emotion reverence disappears from human consciousness. "Ritual and reverence in common life are so familiar that we scarcely notice them until they are gone" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;35).  Woodruff argues that, "Reverence, ceremony and respect do not disappear, they cannot disappear from a functioning society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  He states that "What we are losing is not reverence, but the idea of reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;36).  It is his hope that the importance of reverence will be recognized in society again and that this recognition will better humanity. He proposes to "Restore the idea of reverence to its proper place in ethical and political thought" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;38).

Woodruff understands true reverence to be for things beyond human control.  "The object of reverence is the ideal of unity, because that transcends politics altogether" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;28).  Thus reverence focuses on an ideal that transcends the scope of humankind.  This ideal can vary from God, to unity, to anything else that transcends human capacity.  "Reverence sets a higher value on the truth than on any human product that is supposed to have captured the truth" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;39). He goes on to say that, "The principal object of reverence is Something that reminds us of human limitations" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;65).  Reverence therefore is related to truth and the recognition that mankind cannot acquire absolute truth and that human life is finite.

Woodruff describes how reverence is often activated through [[music]].  Woodruff claims that "Reverence cannot be expressed in a creed; its most apt expression is in music" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;123).  He gives the analogy of a quartet of varying skill levels playing a piece by [[Mozart]].  They embody reverence because: "(1) The musicians have been engaged, more or less harmoniously, on a project as a group; (2) their project involved ceremony; (3) they have felt themselves largely without ego; (4) they have felt themselves to be part of a clearly defined hierarchy that was painless for all of them; and (5) they have achieved in the end a shared feeling of inarticulate awe" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;48-49).  This coincides with his belief that "Art speaks the language of reverence better than philosophy does, and speak(s) it to the reverence that is already in the town" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;25).  By "in the town" Woodruff is referring to the recognition of reverence that is already present.

"In the presence of death we expect ourselves and others to be reverent; the expectation feels natural, and yet the ceremonies through which we express reverence at such times take very different forms in different cultures" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  In his conversation on funerals as times of reverence he makes the point that reverence transcends faith and that it is constant throughout human history even when religions change (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;54.).  "You need not believe in God to be reverent, but to develop an occasion for reverence you must share a culture with others, and this must support a degree of ceremony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;50).  Reverence is not dependent on religion, but true religious experience is dependent on the emotion reverence.

Paul Woodruff builds his case on reverence by analyzing the historical significance of reverence as a virtue.  In Ancient Greek and Chinese civilizations, "Both cultures celebrate reverence in the belief that it is reverence above all that maintains social order and harmony" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;60).  For the Greeks reverence was rooted in [[mythology]]. "[[Protagoras]] invented a myth in which the highest god gave reverence and justice to human beings as means for the survival of society" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;57).  This foundation was critical because "Emotions affect action; they are motivators" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;62).  Reverence in classical Greek society then motivated the populous to act rightly and be humble to improve society.  "We feel awe for what we believe is above us all as human beings, and this feeling helps us to avoid treating other human beings with contempt" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;63).

Woodruff uses the Greek heroes and Athenian tragedies to illustrate his conception of reverence.  He uses the story of [[Croesus]] by [[Herodotus]] to help shape an understanding of reverence that includes respect for those lower in hierarchical status.  "A reverent soul listens to other people even when they are inferior; that is a large part of remembering that you are human together with them" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;83).  He also illustrates reverence with the [[Iliad]], [[Antigone]], [[Pentheus]], [[Pericles]], [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Oedipus]], and the [[Odyssey]].  Through these figures he shows that reverence was quite significant in Greek culture.  In Oedipus, Woodruff asserts that, "[[Hubris]] is best understood simply as the opposite of reverence, in action or attitude" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;91).

After building his case with a look at classical Greek culture he looks at classical Chinese [[Confucian]] society.   "[[Filial piety]] expresses reverence within the family" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;103).  The most important part of his connection between reverence and the Chinese is his understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|li]].  "Li refers also to civility or reverence" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;105).  One interesting connection between Greek and Chinese societies is that, "Both conceptions of reverence blossom with the passing away of polytheism and the rise of agnosticism.  Reverence survives and flourishes in these circumstances because it is something that human beings need in order to face the most obvious, common, and inevitable facts of human life – [[family]], [[hierarchy]], and [[death]]" (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;110).  Most of his information on reverence in Chinese culture derives from the [[Analects]]. Woodruff believes that a break in tradition is not necessarily irreverent and that [[relativism]] is flawed.  People should be critical of all cultures and forms of reverence (Woodruff, p.&amp;nbsp;155).

=== Abraham Maslow ===

[[Abraham Maslow]] in his significant work, ''Religions, Values, and Peak-Experiences'', deals extensively with reverence.  Reverence is critical in having a peak-experience.  He makes the case that peak-experiences happen for the religious and non-religious alike and that they are critical to having a fulfilling life.  For Maslow the distinction between the secular and the profane is unfortunate.  Maslow points out that, "Religionizing only one part of life secularizes the rest of it".&lt;ref name="MAH"&gt;Maslow, A. H. (1964). Religions, values, and peak-experiences, . Columbus: Ohio State University Press&lt;/ref&gt;  Maslow contends that religion seeks to make the emotion reverence possible through ritual, but that the familiarity of it often negates any reverent feelings.&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  In defining peak-experiences Maslow states that, "Such emotions as wonder, awe, reverence, humility, surrender, and even worship before the greatness of the experience are often reported".&lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt;  Reverence therefore is a key ingredient in the peak-experiences that make life worth living and make mankind feel fully human.

=== Albert Schweitzer ===

[[Albert Schweitzer]], winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and holder of four PhD degrees, sought for years for the basis of a new worldview. One day, while in a boat on the river in Gabon, it struck him with great force and clarity: "Reverence for life" (In German: Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben).

== Empirical Studies ==

=== Reverence and Patient Recovery ===
Empirical studies on reverence are scarce.  However, one intriguing study on reverence is, "Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass," conducted by Ai ''et al.'' (2009).&lt;ref name="AAL et al."&gt;Ai, A. L., Wink, P., Tice, T. N., Bolling, S. F., &amp; Shearer, M. (2009). Prayer and reverence in naturalistic, aesthetic, and socio-moral contexts predicted fewer complications following coronary artery bypass. Journal of Behavioral Medicine, 32(6), 570-581. {{doi|10.1007/s10865-009-9228-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These researchers looked at reverence following a coronary artery bypass.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009) examined a "sense of reverence in religious and secular contexts" by interviewing 177 patients.&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Specifically they were investigating the faith-health relationship and seeking to find if religious forms of reverence practiced through faith and prayer yielded similar results to secular forms of reverence in patient recovery.  Ai ''et al.'' (2009)state that, "Because reverence includes an affective as well as a cognitive component, we see it as a form of positive feeling/emotion associated with injection of the sacred into various worldviews".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  These positive emotions were believed to help in patient recovery.  The first finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was consistent with other research that found "Positive influences of traditional religious involvement on health outcomes".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  The second finding of Ai ''et al.'' (2009) was the "Positive effect of secular reverence on postoperative no-complication".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  From this Ai ''et al.'' (2009) inferred that, "The capacity to sense reverence in significant naturalistic, moralistic, and aesthetic contexts seems to enhance recovery following bypass".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  Strangely, "Religious reverence did not have the same beneficial effect as secular reverence on bypass recovery".&lt;ref name="AAL et al."/&gt;  This inconsistency suggests that more research needs to be done on reverence in patient recovery.

=== Awe ===
Keltner and Haidt’s extensive study on awe focuses on the importance of vastness and accommodation in experiencing awe.  "Vastness refers to anything that is experienced as being much larger that the self".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"&gt;Keltner, D., &amp; Haidt, J. (2003). Approaching awe, a moral, spiritual, and aesthetic emotion. Cognition and Emotion, 17(2), 297-314. {{doi|10.1080/02699930302297}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accommodation refers to the "Process of adjusting mental structures that cannot assimilate a new experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;  Their research on awe, which is a part of reverence, and how it is experienced through moral, spiritual, and aesthetic means, sheds light on the greater understanding of reverence.  Their study also consists of a comprehensive summary on what has been "Written about awe in religion, philosophy, sociology, and psychology" and their own addition of "Related states such as admiration, elevation, and the epiphanic experience".&lt;ref name="KD % HJ 297-314"/&gt;

Haidt (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000). The positive emotion of elevation. Prevention and Treatment, 3 Article 3. p 287. Available online at: http://journals.apa.org/prevention/volume3/pre0030003c.html&lt;/ref&gt; notes that since Maslow (1964) &lt;ref name="MAH"/&gt; studied the changes that [[actualizing]] experiences can bring about in people's identities and in their [[moral]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] lives, little [[empirical research]] has been done to examine the peak experiences and moral transformations associated with positive moral emotions such as [[gratitude]], [[elevation]], [[awe]], admiration, and reverence.  Haidt’s own work in these areas suggests that potent feelings of reverence may be associated with the peak experiences accompanying moral transformations, where, "Powerful moments of elevation sometimes seem to push a mental ‘reset button,’ wiping out feelings of [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] and replacing them with feelings of [[hope]], [[love]], and [[optimism]], and a sense of moral inspiration." &lt;ref&gt;Haidt, J. (2000), p 287&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Art and Mortality ===
Great artists in the creation of their art sometimes give concrete form to the culturally derived [[beliefs]], [[values]], and group identities that provide meaning and purpose to [[existence]]. Moreover, reverence for artwork that instantiates these central aspects of [[culture]] can provide a means of buffering the [[existential]] [[anxiety]] that follows from reminders of the inevitability of human mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, M. J., Sullivan, D., &amp; Solomon, S. (2010) On graves and graven images: A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of art. European Review of Social psychology, 21, 114-154&lt;/ref&gt;  Across history, cultures have revered art as a "forum for representing in an enduring medium those individuals who are held up as embodiments of [[virtue]] and lasting significance." &lt;ref&gt;Landau et al. (2010), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transpersonal Reverence ===
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer in, "A Place for the Aesthetic in Experiential Personal Construct Psychology," look at reverence through the lens of experiential personal construct psychology (EPCP).   Leitner &amp; Pfenninger, in 1994, theorized this form of psychology in "Sociality and optimal functioning."  Under this umbrella of psychology, "Reverence felt in meaningful interpersonal connectedness is one starting point for the development of a larger sense of connection with the world and the many others (human and nonhuman) in it".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"&gt;Thomas, J. C., &amp; Schlutsmeyer, M. W. (2004). A place for the aesthetic in experiential personal construct psychology. Journal of Constructivist Psychology, 17(4), 313-335. {{doi|10.1080/10720530490483239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is referred to as transpersonal reverence.
Thomas and Schlutsmeyer make the case for reverence in therapy: "In EPCP, reverence, as we stated earlier, is a goal of therapy, a sign of optimal functioning".&lt;ref name="TJC &amp; SMW"/&gt;  The therapist must revere the patient and the patient must learn to revere others and themselves in order for the therapy to be effective.

[[File:Riparian strip.jpg|thumb|right|A well-preserved natural riparian strip on a tributary to [[Lake Erie]]]]

A '''riparian zone''' or '''riparian area''' is the interface between land and a [[river]] or [[stream]]. '''Riparian''' is also the proper nomenclature for one of the fifteen terrestrial [[biome]]s of the Earth. Plant habitats and communities along the river margins and [[Bank (geography)|banks]] are called riparian vegetation, characterized by [[Aquatic plant|hydrophilic plants]]. Riparian zones are important in [[ecology]], [[environmental resource management]], and [[civil engineering]] because of their role in [[soil conservation]], their habitat [[biodiversity]], and the influence they have on [[fauna]] and [[aquatic ecosystem]]s, including [[grassland]]s, [[woodland]]s, [[wetland]]s, or even non-vegetative areas.  In some regions the terms '''riparian woodland''', '''[[riparian forest]]''', '''[[riparian buffer]] zone,''' '''riparian corridor''' and '''riparian strip''' are used to characterize a riparian zone. The word ''riparian'' is derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wiktionary:ripa|ripa]]'', meaning river bank.

==Characteristics==
Riparian zones may be natural or engineered for soil stabilization or [[Land rehabilitation|restoration]]. These zones are important natural [[biofilter]]s, protecting aquatic environments from excessive [[sediment]]ation, polluted [[surface runoff]] and [[erosion]]. They supply shelter and food for many [[aquatic animal]]s and shade that limits stream temperature change. When riparian zones are damaged by [[construction]], [[agriculture]] or [[silviculture]], biological restoration can take place, usually by human intervention in [[erosion control]] and revegetation. If the area adjacent to a watercourse has standing water or saturated soil for as long as a season, it is normally termed a [[wetland]] because of its [[hydric soil]] characteristics. Because of their prominent role in supporting a [[biodiversity|diversity of species]], riparian zones are often the subject of national protection in a [[biodiversity action plan]]. These are also known as a "Plant or Vegetation Waste Buffer".

Research shows that riparian zones are instrumental in [[water quality]] improvement for both surface runoff and water flowing into streams through subsurface or [[groundwater]] flow. Riparian zones can play a role in lowering nitrate contamination in surface runoff, such as manure and other [[fertilizer]]s from [[Field (agriculture)|agricultural fields]], that would otherwise damage [[ecosystem]]s and human health. Particularly, the attenuation of [[nitrate]] or [[denitrification]] of the nitrates from [[fertilizer]] in this buffer zone is important. The use of wetland riparian zones shows a particularly high rate of removal of nitrate entering a stream and thus has a place in agricultural management.

==Roles and functions==
[[File:Pisuerga2.JPG|thumb|right|Thick riparian vegetation along the [[Pisuerga|Pisuerga River]] in [[Spain]]]]
Riparian zones dissipate stream energy. The [[meander]]ing curves of a river, combined with vegetation and root systems, slow the flow of water, which reduces soil erosion and flood damage. Sediment is trapped, reducing suspended solids to create less [[turbidity|turbid]] water, replenish soils, and build stream banks. Pollutants are filtered from surface runoff, enhancing water quality via biofiltration.

The riparian zones also provide [[wildlife]] [[habitat]], increased biodiversity, and [[wildlife corridor]]s, enabling aquatic and riparian organisms to move along river systems avoiding isolated communities. Riparian vegetation can also provide [[Fodder|forage]] for wildlife and livestock.

Riparian zones are also important for the fish that live within rivers, such as brook and charr. Impacts to riparian zones can affect fish, and restoration is not always sufficient to recover fish populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sievers |first1=Michael |last2=Hale |first2=Robin |last3=Morrongiello |first3=John R. |title=Do trout respond to riparian change? A meta-analysis with implications for restoration and management |journal=Freshwater Biology |date=March 2017 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=445–457 |doi=10.1111/fwb.12888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They provide native [[landscape]] irrigation by extending seasonal or perennial flows of water. Nutrients from terrestrial vegetation (e.g. [[plant litter]] and insect drop) are transferred to aquatic food webs. The vegetation surrounding the stream helps to shade the water, mitigating [[thermal pollution|water temperature changes]].  The vegetation also contributes wood debris to streams, which is important to maintaining [[geomorphology]].

From a social aspect, riparian zones contribute to nearby property values through amenity and views, and they improve enjoyment for footpaths and bikeways through supporting [[Greenway (landscape)#Foreshoreway|foreshoreway]] networks. Space is created for riparian sports such as fishing, swimming and launching for vessels and paddlecraft.

The riparian zone acts as a sacrificial erosion buffer to absorb impacts of factors including [[climate change]], increased runoff from [[urbanization]] and increased [[Wake#Wake pattern of a boat|boat wake]] without damaging structures located behind a setback zone.

==Role in logging==
The protection of riparian zones is often a consideration in [[logging]] operations.  The undisturbed soil, soil cover, and vegetation provide shade, plant litter, and woody material, and reduce the delivery of [[soil erosion|soil eroded]] from the harvested area. Factors such as soil types and [[root]] structures, [[Climate|climatic]] conditions and vegetative cover determine the effectiveness of riparian buffering.

==Vegetation==
[[File:Willow Creek, Trout Creek Mountains, Oregon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Riparian zone along Trout Creek in the [[Trout Creek Mountains]], part of the Burns Bureau of Land Management District in southeastern [[Oregon]]. The creek provides critical habitat for [[trout]].]]

The assortment of riparian zone trees varies from those of wetlands and typically consists of plants that are either emergent aquatic plants, or [[herb]]s, [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s that thrive in proximity to water.

==Repair and restoration==
Land clearing followed by floods can quickly erode a riverbank, taking valuable grasses and soils downstream, and later allowing the sun to bake the land dry. [[Natural Sequence Farming]] techniques have been used in the [[Upper Hunter Shire|Upper Hunter]] Valley of [[New South Wales]], Australia, in an attempt to rapidly restore eroded farms to optimum productivity.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The Natural Sequence Farming technique involves placing obstacles in the water's pathway to lessen the energy of a flood, and help the water to deposit soil and [[Seep (hydrology) |seep]] into the flood zone. Another technique is to quickly establish [[ecological succession]] by encouraging fast-growing plants such as "weeds" ([[pioneer species]]) to grow. These may spread along the watercourse and cause environmental degradation, but may stabilize the soil, place carbon into the ground, and protect the land from drying. The weeds will improve the streambeds so that trees and grasses can return, and later ideally replace the weeds. There are several other techniques used by government and non-government agencies to address riparian and streambed degradation, ranging from the installation of bed control structures such as log sills to the use of pin groynes or rock emplacement.

{{Distinguish|Sanitation engineering}}
'''Sanitary engineering''', also known as '''public health engineering''', is the application of engineering methods to improve [[sanitation]] of human communities, primarily by providing the removal and disposal of human waste, and in addition to the supply of safe [[potable water]]. Traditionally a branch of civil engineering, in the mid-19th century, the discipline concentrated on the reduction of disease, then thought to be caused by [[Miasma theory|miasma]]. This was accomplished mainly by the collection and segregation of sewerage flow in [[London]] specifically, and Great Britain generally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/hasrg/ablit/britlit/sanitary.html Sanitary Reform of London], The Working Collection of [[Sir Joseph Bazalgette]], British and Commonwealth Literary Studies, [[Green Library]], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;  These and later regulatory improvements were reported in the United States as early as 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1865/07/31/news/european-sanitary-reform-the-british-sanitary-legislation.html EUROPEAN SANITARY REFORM.; The British Sanitary Legislation], [[The New York Times]], July 31, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is not concerned with environmental factors that do not have an immediate and clearly understood effect on public health.  Areas outside the purview of sanitary engineering include [[traffic]] management, concerns about [[noise pollution]] or [[light pollution]], aesthetic concerns such as [[landscaping]], and [[environmental conservation]] as it pertains to [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.

Skills within this field are usually employed for the primary goal of [[disease]] prevention within [[human beings]] by assuring a supply of healthy [[drinking water]], treatment of waste water, removing [[Waste|garbage]] from inhabited areas, and so on.

Compared to (for example) [[electrical engineering]] or [[mechanical engineering]] which are concerned primarily with [[closed system]]s, sanitary engineering is a very [[interdisciplinary]] field which may involve such elements as [[hydraulics]], constructive modelling, [[information technology]], project design, [[microbiology]], [[pathology]] and the many divisions within [[environmental science]] and [[environmental technology]].  In some cases, considerations that fall within the field of [[social sciences]] and urban planning must be factored in as well.

Although sanitary engineering may be most associated with the design of [[sanitary sewer|sewers]], [[sewage treatment]] and [[waste water treatment]] facilities, [[recycling]] centers, [[landfill|public landfills]] and other things which are constructed, the term applies equally to (for example) a plan of action to reverse the effects of [[water pollution]] or [[soil contamination]] in a specific area.

==History==
{{Further information|History of water supply and sanitation}}
Irrigation systems were invented five to seven thousand years ago as a means of supplying water to agriculture-based societies. Aqueducts and irrigation systems were among the first forms of wastewater engineering.  As population centers became more dense, they were used to remove sewage from settlements. The Romans were among the first to demonstrate the effectiveness of the aqueduct.  The Dark Ages marked a period where progress in water management came to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Steinbeck|first1=SG|title=An Abridged History of  Onsite Wastewater: Early Years to Present|url=http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/oet/docs/cit/oswpmod/HistoryOfOSWW.pdf|website=REHS Onsite Water Protection Branch|publisher=Environmental Health Section, Division of Public Health, NC Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=April 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew, the management of human waste became a growing concern and a public health threat.  By the 1850s in London more than 400,000 tons of sewage were flushed into the Thames River each day - around 150 million tons a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London's Victorian sewer system|url=http://www.thameswater.co.uk/about-us/10092.htm|website=Thames Water|publisher=Tames Water|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, measles, scarlet fever, typhus, cholera and typhoid  were spread via the contaminated water supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardy|first1=Anne|title=Water and the Search for Public Health in London in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|journal=Medical History|date=1984|volume=28|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1139446/pdf/medhist00078-0028.pdf|pmc=1139446|pmid=6390024|pages=250–82|doi=10.1017/s0025727300035936}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 19th century major cities started building sewage systems to remove human waste out of cities and into rivers.

During the 1900s the activated sludge process was invented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Matsuo|first1=Tomonori|title=Civil Engineering Vol. I|url=http://www.eolss.net/sample-chapters/c05/E6-37-01-03.pdf|website=Wastewater Management Engineering|publisher=Encyclodedia of Life Support Systems|accessdate=April 3, 2015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The activated sludge process is a form of water purification that uses bacteria to consume human feces.  Chlorine is used to kill off the bacteria.

Over the centuries much has changed in the field of wastewater engineering. Advancements in microbiology, chemistry, and engineering have drastically changed the field. Today wastewater engineers work on the collection of clean water for drinking, chemically treating it, and using UV light to kill off micro-organisms. They also treat [[Water Pollution]] in wastewater (blackwater and greywater) so that this water may be made safe for use without endangering the population and environment around it.

==Municipalities==
Generally, sanitary engineers work for municipalities and are highly trained professionals with a diverse range of engineering skills.  Some are involved with a specific area of concern such as [[waste collection]] or the maintenance of [[waste water]] facilities and  [[storm water]] [[drainage]] systems within a district.

Others cover a broader scope of activities that might include the two just listed as well as such maintenance of the public [[water supply]], collection of residential yard waste program, disposal of  [[hazardous waste]], recycling strategies and even community programs where individuals or businesses "adopt" an area and either maintain it themselves or donate funds for doing so.

==Wastewater==
'''Wastewater engineering''' is not usually its own degree course but a specialization from degrees such as [[civil engineering]], [[environmental engineering]], Bio-chemical engineering or [[chemical engineering]]. Wastewater engineering deals with the transportation and cleaning of [[Blackwater (waste)|blackwater]], [[greywater]], and irrigation water. [[Wastewater treatment]] and [[water reclamation]] are areas of concern in this field.

Wastewater engineers map out topographical and geographical features of Earth to determine the best means of collection, design pipe and pumped collection systems, and design treatment processes for collected wastewater.

===Job description and typical tasks===
Wastewater engineers use a variety of skills and must have knowledge of  mechanical and environmental engineering. They are required to perform tasks and demonstrate knowledge in design, mathematics, English, construction, physics, chemistry, biology, management, and personnel. Wastewater engineers must have skills in complex problem solving, critical thinking, mathematics, active listening, judgement, reading comprehension, speaking, writing, science, and system analysis.&lt;ref name=Onet&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary Report for: 17-2081.01 - Water/Wastewater Engineers|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01|website=O*net Online|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical work activities include problem solving, communication with management and staff, gathering information, analyzing data, evaluating standards and complying with them, and communicating with others in the field.

Wastewater engineers perform these activities by combining their knowledge and skills to perform tasks. These tasks are to understand computer-aided design programs, and to conduct studies for the  construction of facilities, water supply systems and collection systems.  They may design systems for wastewater collection machinery, as well as system components.  They may perform water flow analysis, then select designs and equipment based on government and industry standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fairfax County Department of Human Resources|title=Wastewater Plant Operations Manager Classification Specification|url=http://agency.governmentjobs.com/fairfaxcounty/default.cfm?action=viewclassspec&amp;classSpecID=969985&amp;viewOnly=yes|website=Fairfax County Classifications|publisher=Fairfax County, VA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical employers===
Wastewater engineers work for private companies, state and local governments, and special districts. As of 2012 there were 53,000 wastewater engineers employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bureau of Labor Statistics|title=Water and Wastewater Treatment Plant and System Operators|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/production/water-and-wastewater-treatment-plant-and-system-operators.htm|website=Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014-15 Edition|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern challenges: climate change===
Today the wastewater managers confront new challenges and the need for new technology as water levels decrease due to increasingly frequent and extended droughts. Technologies such as sonar mapping are being used in wells to determine the volume of water that they can hold. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the State of New York worked together to map underground aquifers since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ground Water Resource Mapping|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/36118.html|website=New York State Department of Resource Conservation|publisher=State of New York|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today they have thorough maps of these aquifers to assist in water management.

Wastewater treatment contributes to global warming in many ways. One of the factors that contributes to global warming is wastewater treatment facilities and their emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of those gases are carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases occur because of the decomposition of organic material from the anaerobic bacteria. These bacteria clean the leftover waste. Even if the anaerobic bacteria decomposition produces these gases, the percentage of greenhouse gases that other equipment produce is still greater than the contribution of the anaerobic bacteria. Also, the power usage from those machinery is very high. That is why many facilities are undergoing renovation to use higher levels of anaerobic bacteria compared to other types of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cakir|first1=FY|title=Greenhouse gas production: A comparison between aerobic and anaerobic wastewater treatment technology|journal=Water Research|date=September 26, 2005|volume=39|issue=17|pages=4197–4203|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2005.07.042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[effects of global warming]] on waste water treatment facilities vary from location to location. In the Northeast there has been increased rainfall causing treatment plants to be too small relative to the amount coming in. In the West there is a lack of rainfall and water sources are being depleted. This means the facilities will need to be updated to meet modern and future environmental changes such as the increased use of recycled and [[reclaimed water]] Climate change also affects piping and increases the rate of corrosion, adding to facility cost.

Desalination plants may be required in the future for those regions hardest hit by [[water scarcity]]. Desalination is a process of cleaning water by means of evaporation. Water is evaporated and it passes through membranes. The water is then cooled and condenses allowing it to flow either back into the main water line or out to sea. Desalination is not completely "green" since the plants require energy to run and due to the fact that the brine waste must managed to avoid ecological damage to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lattemann|first1=Sabine|title=Environmental impact and impact assessment of seawater desalination|journal=Desalination|date=2008|volume=220|issue=1|pages=1–15|accessdate=April 20, 2015
|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Th_Hoepner/publication/222564177_Environmental_impact_and_impact_assessment_of_seawater_desalination/links/54129baa0cf2bb7347daecf2.pdf||display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.desal.2007.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education necessary for the job===
Formal education for wastewater engineers begins in high school with students taking classes such as chemistry, biology, physics, and higher mathematics including calculus. After high school most jobs require certification from a state agency. Those wanting to advance in the industry should pursue a civil engineering, [[mechanical engineering]], environmental engineering, or a [[facilities engineering]] degree. Gaining experience through internships and working while in college is a common pathway toward advancement.

Education about waste treatment requires course work in systems design, machinery design principles, water chemistry, and similar coursework. Other classes may include Chemistry of Plant Processes, and various plant operations courses.

Initial employment in wastewater engineering can be obtained by those with and without advanced formal education. The California State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB), for example, shows how individuals can advance through a progression of certifications as Waste Water Treatment Operators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=California Environmental Protection Agency|title=Operator Certification Requirements TABLE|url=http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_table.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=March 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board uses a five level classification system to classify
water treatment facilities into categories I-V according to the population served
and the complexity of the treatment system.

The Operator Certification requirements for water treatment operators and waste water treatment operators are described in detail by State law. To meet certification requirements, operators must submit an application to SWRCB, have the necessary work experience, meet the educational requirements, and pass an examination based on the knowledge, skill,and abilities described in the regulations. Operators are required to renew their certificates every three years.  To be elibible for renewal, certified operators must complete a specified number of continuing education hours after the previous issuance of a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wastewater Treatment Plant Classification, Operator Certification, and Contract Operator Registration |url=http://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/operator_certification/docs/ocr_clean.pdf|website=State Water Resources Control Board|publisher=State of California|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wastewater engineers may advance in their careers through additional education and experience. With additional knowledge and experience one can become the manager of an entire plant. The accreditation body certifying the education for the degree and license is the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).  Over time some companies may require the wastewater engineer to continue their education to keep up with any changes in technology.

Obtaining one’s master's degree is encouraged since many companies list it as a preference in selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer|url=http://www.sciencebuddies.org/science-engineering-careers/engineering/environmental-engineer#education|website=Science Buddies|publisher=Science Buddies, Inc.|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Engineer: Career Profile|url=http://study.com/articles/Environmental_Engineer_Career_Profile.html|website=Study.com|publisher=Study.com, Mountain View, CA|accessdate=March 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this field 76 percent of those employed have a bachelor's degree, 17 percent have a master's degree and three percent have a post-doctoral degree as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Onet"/&gt;  The average annual salary is approximately $83,360.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wages and Employment Trends|url=http://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/17-2081.01#WagesEmployment|website=Onetonline.org|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sensation Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection at the Brooklyn Museum 15.jpg|thumb|267x267px|''Sensation'' installed at [[Brooklyn Museum]] (October 1999  – January 2000)]]
'''''Sensation''''' was an exhibition of the collection of contemporary art owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], including many works by [[Young British Artists]], (YBAs), which first took place 18 September – 28 December 1997 at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London and later toured to the [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] in Berlin and the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in New York City. A proposed showing at the [[National Gallery of Australia]] was cancelled when the gallery's director decided the exhibition was "too close to the market."

The show generated controversy in London and New York City due to the inclusion of images of [[Myra Hindley]] and the [[Virgin Mary]]. It was criticised by New York City mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]] and others for attempting to boost the value of the work by showing it in institutions and public museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/093099brooklyn-museum.html |title=Brooklyn Museum Accused of Trying to Lift Art Value |first=David M. |last=Herszenhorn |date=30 September 1999 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Marcus-Harvey-Myra.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'': 1995 depiction of the child killer [[Myra Hindley]] by the YBA [[Marcus Harvey]]|left]]
The artworks in ''Sensation'' were from the collection of [[Charles Saatchi]], a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. [[Norman Rosenthal]], the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists.  Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, [[Damien Hirst]]'s [[shark]] suspended in [[formaldehyde]] titled ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'', [[Tracey Emin]]'s tent titled ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''), [[Marc Quinn]]'s self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and [[Sarah Lucas]]'s explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from [[Gillian Wearing]]'s photographs. ''Sensation'' was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry:
{{quote|There will be works of art on display in the Sensation exhibition which some people may find distasteful. Parents should exercise their judgment in bringing their children to the exhibition. One gallery will not be open to those under the age of 18.''&lt;ref name="Dalry"/&gt;}}

==London==
[[File:Burlington House-Courtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Academy of Arts]], London|306x306px]]The opening of ''Sensation'' at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both [[broadsheet]] and [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]] journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about.  Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory.  They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]], which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus.

However, the biggest media controversy was over ''[[Myra (painting)|Myra]]'', an image of the murderer [[Moors murders|Myra Hindley]] by [[Marcus Harvey]].&lt;ref name="Dalry"&gt;{{citation |last=Dalrymple |first=Theodore |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_1_urbanities-trash.html |title=Trash, Violence, and Versace: But Is It Art? |magazine=City Journal |date=Winter 1998 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mothers Against Murder and Aggression protest group picketed the show, accompanied by Winnie Johnson, the mother of one of Hindley's victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Alberge |first=Dalya |title=Attacks force Hindley portrait to be moved |newspaper=The Times |date=19 September 1997 |url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F924CA724CFF0B6&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=1054640702C8DBC0 |subscription=yes |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was "a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Lyall |first=Sarah |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CEEDD1F38F933A1575AC0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Art That Tweaks British Propriety] |newspaper=New York Times |date=20 September 1997 |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, Alison. "Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law". Routledge, January, 2005. p. 34. {{ISBN|0-415-30183-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all the protest the painting remained hanging.  Windows at Burlington House, the Academy's home, were smashed and two demonstrators hurled ink and eggs at the picture as a result, requiring it to be removed and restored. It was put back on display behind [[Perspex]]&lt;ref name=storm&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/455902.stm "Sensation sparks New York storm"], [[BBC]], 23 September 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and guarded by security men.

In a press conference on 16 September 1997, David Gordon, Secretary of the Royal Academy commented on the controversial portrait: "The majority view inside the Academy was that millions and millions of images of Myra Hindley have been reproduced in newspapers and magazines. Books have been written about the murders. Television programmes have been made. Hindley’s image is in the public domain; part of our consciousness; an awful part of our recent social history; a legitimate subject for journalism – and for art."

The show was extremely popular with the general public, attracting over 300,000 visitors during its run,&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; helped by the media attention which the strong subject matter had received.  The BBC described it as "gory images of dismembered limbs and explicit pornography".&lt;ref name=limbs&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/43401.stm "Entertainment Sensational hit for Royal Academy"], [[BBC]], 30 December 1997. Retrieved 22 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin==
''Sensation'' was shown at the Berlin's [[Hamburger Bahnhof]] museum (30 September 1998 – 30 January 1999) and proved so popular that it was extended past its original closing date of 28 December 1998. For art critic Nicola Kuhn from ''Der Tagesspiegel'', there was "no sensation about Sensation". She claimed that the Berlin audience found the yBa's work "more sad and serious than irreverent, funny and dazzling"&lt;ref name="Hatton"&gt;Hatton, Rita and Walker, John.

==New York City==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum June 2008 sunset jeh.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
The exhibition was shown in New York City at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] from 2 October 1999 to 9 January 2000. The New York City show was met with instant protest, centring on ''[[The Holy Virgin Mary]]'' by [[Chris Ofili]], which had not provoked this reaction in London. While the press reported that the piece was "smeared", "splattered" or "stained" with elephant dung,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-pPe2HVNb08C&amp;pg=PA38 Judging the image: art, value, law], Alison Young, Routledge, 2005, {{ISBN|0-415-30184-X}}, p.38-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedlander&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym1ADWLrWmwC&amp;pg=PA88 Feminine look: sexuation, spectatorship, subversion], Jennifer Friedlander, SUNY Press, 2008 {{ISBN|0-7914-7295-7}}, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Ofili's work in fact showed a carefully rendered black Madonna decorated with a resin-covered lump of elephant dung. The figure is also surrounded by small collaged images of female genitalia from pornographic magazines; these seemed from a distance to be the traditional [[cherubim]].

New York City Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], who had seen the work in the catalogue but not in the show, called it "sick stuff" and threatened to withdraw the annual $7&amp;nbsp;million City Hall grant from the [[Brooklyn Museum]] hosting the show, because "You don't have a right to government subsidy for desecrating somebody else's religion."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; [[Cardinal John O'Connor]], the [[Archbishop of New York]], said, "one must ask if it is an attack on religion itself," and the president of America's biggest group of Orthodox Jews, Mandell Ganchrow, called it "deeply offensive".&lt;ref name=whiff&gt;{{citation |last1=Davies |first1=Hugh |last2=Fenton |first2=Ben |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1999/10/02/wsen02.html |title=Whiff of sensation hits New York |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=2 October 1999 |accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William A. Donohue]], President of the [[Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights]], said the work "induces revulsion".&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; Giuliani started a lawsuit to evict the museum, and Arnold Lehman, the museum director, filed a federal lawsuit against Giuliani for a breach of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

[[Hillary Clinton]] spoke up for the museum, as did the New York Civil Liberties Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/092899brooklyn-hillary.html |title=First Lady Assails Mayor Over Threat to Museum |first=Adam |last=Nagourney |publisher=New York Times |date=28 September 1999 |accessdate=19 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial board of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, Giuliani's stance "promises to begin a new Ice Age in New York's cultural affairs."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;Rapp, Christopher. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_20_51/ai_56220691 "Dung Deal – Brooklyn Museum of Art's "Sensation" exhibition"], ''[[National Review]]'', 25 October 1999. Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The paper also carried a full-page advertisement in support signed by over 100 actors, writers and artists, including [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Norman Mailer]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]] and [[Susan Sontag]].&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; Ofili, who is Roman Catholic, said, "elephant dung in itself is quite a beautiful object."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

The [[United States House of Representatives]] passed a nonbinding resolution to end federal funding for the museum on 3 October 1999, and New York City did stop funding to the Brooklyn Museum.  On 1 November, federal judge [[Nina Gershon]] ordered the City not only to restore the funding that was denied to the Museum, but also to refrain from continuing its ejectment action.  On 16 December 1999, a 72-year-old man was arrested for criminal mischief after smearing the Ofili painting with white paint, which was soon removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |magazine=Art in America |title=Vandal Attacks Ofili Madonna |date=February 2000 |accessdate=20 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120055422/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_2_88/ai_59450150/ |archive-date=20 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The museum produced a yellow stamp, saying the artworks on show "may cause shock, vomiting, confusion, panic, euphoria and anxiety."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt; and Ofili's painting was shown behind a Plexiglass screen, guarded by a museum attendant and an armed police officer.&lt;ref name=nat/&gt; Jeffrey Hogrefe, art critic for the ''[[New York Observer]]'', commented about the museum, "They wanted to get some publicity and they got it. I think it was pretty calculated."&lt;ref name=storm/&gt; The editor-in-chief of the New York City ''[[Art &amp; Auction]]'' magazine, Bruce Wolmer,said: "When the row eventually fades the only smile will be on the face of Charles Saatchi, a master self-promoter."&lt;ref name=whiff/&gt;

==Australia==
The show was scheduled to open in June 1999 at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], but was cancelled with the director, Brian Kennedy, saying that, although it was due to be funded by the Australian government, it was "too close to the market" since finance for the Brooklyn exhibition included $160,000 from Saatchi, who owned the work; $50,000 from [[Christie's]], who had sold work for Saatchi; and $10,000 from dealers of many of the artists.&lt;ref name=vogeloz&gt;Vogel, Carol.

Retrieved 17 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy said he was unaware of this when he accepted the show. Saatchi's contribution, the largest single one, was not disclosed by the [[Brooklyn Museum]], until it appeared in court documents.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt; Similarly, when the show opened in London at the Royal Academy, there had been criticisms that it would raise the value of the work.&lt;ref name=vogeloz/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13437">'''Sensitivity auditing''' is an extension of [[sensitivity analysis]] for use in policy-relevant modelling studies. Its use is recommended - e.g. in the European Commission Impact assessment guidelines &lt;ref name=IA /&gt; - when a [[sensitivity analysis]] (SA) of a model-based study is meant to demonstrate the robustness of the evidence provided by the model, but in a context where the inference feeds into a policy or decision-making process.&lt;ref name="Latinorum"&gt;Saltelli, A., van der Sluijs, J., Guimarães Pereira, Â., 2013, Funtowiz, S.O., What do I make of your Latinorum? Sensitivity auditing of mathematical modelling, International Journal Foresight and Innovation Policy, 9 (2/3/4), 213–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach==
In these cases, the framing of the analysis itself, its institutional context, and the motivations of its author may become highly relevant, and a pure SA - with its focus on parametric (i.e. quantified) uncertainty - may be insufficient. The emphasis on the framing may, among other things, derive from the relevance of the policy study to different constituencies that are characterized by different norms and values, and hence by a different story about `what the problem is' and foremost about `who is telling the story'. Most often the framing includes implicit assumptions, which could be political (e.g. which group needs to be protected) all the way to technical (e.g. which variable can be treated as a constant).

In order to take these concerns into due consideration, sensitivity auditing extends the instruments of [[sensitivity analysis]] to provide an assessment of the entire knowledge- and model-generating process. It takes inspiration from [[NUSAP]],&lt;ref name="NUSAP"&gt;Van der Sluijs JP, Craye M, Funtowicz S, Kloprogge P, Ravetz J, Risbey J (2005) Combining quantitative and qualitative measures of uncertainty in model based environmental assessment: the NUSAP system. Risk Analysis 25(2):481-492&lt;/ref&gt; a method used to qualify the worth (quality) of quantitative information with the generation of `Pedigrees' of numbers. Likewise, sensitivity auditing has been developed to provide pedigrees of models and model-based inferences.&lt;ref name="Latinorum" /&gt; Sensitivity auditing is especially suitable in an adversarial context, where not only the nature of the evidence, but also the degree of certainty and uncertainty associated to the evidence, is the subject of partisan interests. These are the settings considered in [[Post-normal science]] &lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O. &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1993. Science for the post-normal age. Futures, 25(7), 739–755.&lt;/ref&gt; or in [[Mode 2]]&lt;ref name="Gibbons1993"&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges; Helga Nowotny; Simon Schwartzman; Peter Scott; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage. {{ISBN|0-8039-7794-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; science. [[Post-normal science]] (PNS) is a concept developed by [[Silvio Funtowicz]] and [[Jerome Ravetz]],&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1991"&gt;Funtowicz, S.O. and Jerome R. Ravetz (1991). "A New Scientific Methodology for Global Environmental Issues." In Ecological Economics: The Science and Management of Sustainability. Ed. Robert Costanza. New York: Columbia University Press: 137–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992"&gt;Funtowicz, S. O., &amp; Ravetz, J. R. 1992. Three types of risk assessment and the emergence of postnormal science. In S. Krimsky &amp; D. Golding (Eds.), Social theories of risk (pp. 251–273). Westport, CT: Greenwood.&lt;/ref&gt; which proposes a methodology of inquiry that is appropriate when “facts are uncertain, values in dispute, stakes high and decisions urgent” (Funtowicz and Ravetz, 1992:&lt;ref name="F&amp;R1992" /&gt; 251–273). [[Mode 2]] Science, coined in 1994 by Gibbons et al., refers to a mode of production of scientific knowledge that is context-driven, problem-focused and interdisciplinary. Carrozza (2015)&lt;ref name="Carrozza2015"&gt;Carrozza, C., 2015. “Democratizing Expertise and Environmental Governance: Different Approaches to the Politics of Science and their Relevance for Policy Analysis”, Journal of Environmental Policy &amp; Planning, 17(1), 108-126.&lt;/ref&gt; offers a discussion of these concepts and approaches.

Sensitivity auditing is recommended by the [[European Commission]] for use in [[impact assessment]]s in order to improve the quality of model-based evidence used to support policy decisions.&lt;ref name="IA"&gt;European Commission. (2015). Guidelines on Impact Assessment - European Commission [http://ec.europa.eu/smart-regulation/guidelines/tool_56_en.htm European Commission Better Regulation Guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The rules==
Sensitivity auditing is summarised by seven rules or guiding principles:
# Check against the rhetorical use of mathematical modeling. Question addressed: is the model being used to elucidate or to obfuscate?;
# Adopt an `assumption hunting' attitude. Question addressed: what was `assumed out'? What are the tacit, pre-analytical, possibly normative assumptions underlying the analysis?;
# Detect Garbage In Garbage Out (GIGO). Issue addressed: artificial deflation of uncertainty operated in order to achieve a desired inference at a desired level of confidence. It also works on the reverse practice, the artificial inflation of uncertainties, e.g. to deter regulation;
# Find sensitive assumptions before they find you. Issue addressed: anticipate criticism by doing careful homework via sensitivity and uncertainty analyses before publishing results.
# Aim for transparency. Issue addressed: stakeholders should be able to make sense of, and possibly replicate, the results of the analysis;
# Do the right sums, which is more important than `Do the sums right'. Issue addressed: is the viewpoint of a relevant stakeholder being neglected? Who decided that there was a problem and what the problem was?
# Focus the analysis on the key question answered by the model, exploring the entire space of the assumptions holistically. Issue addressed: don't perform perfunctory analyses that just `scratch the surface' of the system's potential uncertainties.

The first rule looks at the instrumental use of mathematical modeling to advance one's agenda. This use is called rhetorical, or strategic, like the use of Latin to confuse or obfuscate an interlocutor.

The second rule about `assumption hunting' is a reminder to look for what was assumed when the model was originally framed. Modes are full of [[ceteris paribus]] assumptions. For example, in economics, the model can predict the result of a shock to a given set of equations, assuming that all the rest - all other input variables and inputs - remain equal, but in real life "ceteris" are never "paribus", meaning that variables tend to be linked with one another, so they cannot realistically change independently of one another.

Rule three is about artificially exaggerating or playing down uncertainties wherever convenient. The tobacco lobbies exaggerated the uncertainties about the health effects of smoking according to Oreskes and Conway,&lt;ref name="Merchant"&gt;Oreskes N, Conway EM (2010) Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming. Bloomsbury Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; while advocates of the death penalty played down the uncertainties in the negative relations between capital punishment and crime rate.&lt;ref name="Leamer"&gt;Leamer EE (2010) Tantalus on the road to asymptopia. Journal of Economic Perspectives 4(2):31-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the latter wanted the policy, in this case the death penalty, and were interested in showing that the supporting evidence was robust. In the former case the lobbies did not want regulation (e.g. bans on tobacco smoking in public places) and were hence interested in amplifying the uncertainty in the smoking-health effect causality relationship.

Rule four is about `confessing' uncertainties before going public with the analysis. This rule is also one of the commandments of applied econometrics according to
Kennedy:&lt;ref name="Kennedy"&gt;Kennedy, P. (2007) A Guide to Econometrics, 5th ed., p.396, Blackwell Publishing, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; `Thou shall confess in the presence of sensitivity. Corollary: Thou shall anticipate criticism'. According to this rule, a [[sensitivity analysis]] should be performed before the results of a modeling study are published. There are many good reasons for doing this, one being that a carefully performed [[sensitivity analysis]] often uncovers plain coding mistakes or model inadequacies. The other is that, more often than not, the analysis reveals uncertainties that are larger than those anticipated by the model developers.

Rule five is about presenting the results of the modeling study in a transparent fashion. Both rules originate from the practice of impact assessment, where a modeling study presented without a proper SA, or as originating from a model which is in fact a black box, may end up being rejected by stakeholders.&lt;ref name="Issues"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2014, When all models are wrong: More stringent quality criteria are needed for models used at the science-policy interface, Issues in Science and Technology, Winter 2014, 79-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both rules four and five suggest that reproducibility may be a condition for transparency and that this latter may be a condition for legitimacy.&lt;ref name="Cartesian"&gt;Saltelli, A., Funtowicz, S., 2015 Evidence-based policy at the end of the Cartesian Dream: The case of mathematical modelling, in "The end of the Cartesian dream", Edited by Ângela Guimarães Pereira, and Silvio Funtowicz, Routledge, p. 147-162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rule six, about doing the right sum, is not far from the `assumption-hunting' rule; it is just more general. It deals with the fact that often an analyst is set to work on an analysis arbitrarily framed to the advantage of a party. Sometime this comes via the choice of the discipline selected to do the analysis. Thus an environmental impact problem may be framed through the lenses of economics, and presented as a cost benefit or risk analysis, while the issue has little to do with costs or benefits or risks and a lot to do with profits, controls, and norms. An example is in Marris et al.&lt;ref name="Marris"&gt;Marris, C., Wynne, B., Simmons, P., and Weldon, Sue. 2001. Final Report of the PABE Research Project Funded by the Commission of European Communities, Contract number: FAIR CT98-3844 DG12-SSMI) Dec, Lancaster: University of Lancaster.
&lt;/ref&gt; on the issue of GMOs, mostly presented in the public discourse as a food safety issue while the spectrum of concerns of GMO opponents - including lay citizens - appears broader.

Rule seven is about avoiding a perfunctory [[sensitivity analysis]]. A SA where each uncertain input is moved at a time while leaving all other inputs fixed is perfunctory.&lt;ref name="OAT"&gt;Saltelli, A., Annoni, P., 2010, How to avoid a perfunctory sensitivity analysis, Environmental Modeling and Software, 25, 1508-1517&lt;/ref&gt; A true SA should make an honest effort at exploring all uncertainties simultaneously, leaving the model free to display its full nonlinear and possibly non-additive behaviour. A similar point is made in Sam L. Savage's book `The flaw of averages'.&lt;ref name="Savage"&gt;Savage SL (2009) The Flaw of Averages: Why We Underestimate Risk in the Face of Uncertainty, Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Questions addressed by sensitivity auditing ==

In conclusion, these rules are meant to help an analyst to anticipate criticism, in particular relating to model-based inference feeding into an impact assessment. What questions and objections may be received by the modeler? Here is a possible list:
* You treated X as a constant when we know it is uncertain by at least 30%
* It would be sufficient for a 5% error in X to make your statement about Z fragile
* Your model is but one of the plausible models - you neglected model uncertainty
* You have instrumentally maximized your level of confidence in the results
* Your model is a [[black box]] - why should I trust your results?
* You have artificially inflated the uncertainty
* Your framing is not socially robust
* You are answering the wrong question

== Sensitivity auditing in the European Commission Guidelines ==

Sensitivity auditing is described in the European Commission Guidelines for impact assessment &lt;ref name=IA /&gt;. Relevants excerpts are (pp. 392): 

:"[… ]where there is a major disagreement among stakeholders about the nature of the problem, … then sensitivity auditing is more suitable but sensitivity analysis is still advisable as one of the steps of sensitivity auditing."

:"Sensitivity auditing, […] is a wider consideration of the effect of all types of uncertainty, including structural assumptions embedded in the model, and subjective decisions taken in the framing of the problem." 

:"The ultimate aim is to communicate openly and honestly the extent to which particular models can be used to support policy decisions and what their limitations are."
 
:"In general sensitivity auditing stresses the idea of honestly communicating the extent to which model results can be trusted, taking into account as much as possible all forms of potential uncertainty, and to anticipate criticism by third parties."

Potential examples of special rights include [[affirmative action]] policies or [[hate crime]] legislation with regard to ethnic, religious or sexual minorities or state recognition of marriage as a group with different taxation from those who are not married.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Concepts of ''special rights'' are closely aligned with notions of [[group rights]] and [[identity politics]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Other uses==
More recently, [[social conservatism|social conservatives]] have used the term to more narrowly refer to measures that extend existing rights for heterosexual couples to gays and lesbians, such as in the case of [[same sex marriage]], or that include sexual orientation as a civil rights minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Amy|title=Gay Rights At The Ballot Box|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80iFUEYi8Q4C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22gay+rights%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gay%20rights%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|location=Minneapolis|page=25|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tashman|first=Brian|title=Perkins Labels LGBT-Rights Initiative a 'Radical' Push for 'Special Rights for Homosexuals and Homosexuality'|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/perkins-labels-lgbt-rights-initiative-radical-push-special-rights-homosexuals-and-homosexual|publisher=People for the American Way|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb|first=Michael|title=God Hates Fags: The Rhetorics of Religious Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHmSAL3UryQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22colorado+for+family+values%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9FS1UdnDL_Pd4APe8oGgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22colorado%20for%20family%20values%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|pages=41|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used internationally, for example ''Sonderrechte'' in [[Germany]], but it is used also about special [[right-of-way (traffic)#Priority (right of way)|traffic right-of-way]] exceptions given to emergency response and military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flashing blue and yellow lights | publisher=German Federal Ministry of Justice | url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stvo/__38.html | accessdate=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal argument==
The basis behind the argument of the term is based on whether it should be considered just and legal for a law to treat various parties unequally. For example, in the [[US Constitution]] the prohibition on [[bills of attainder]] require that laws do not single out a single person or group of persons for specific treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Constitution of the United States: Article 1, Section 9 | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html#1.9.3 | accessdate=2008-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[equal protection clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Both sides argue that the other side is or has traditionally been singled out and so the law is either needed or unnecessary.

In some cases, such as those with social implications, the universal definition of rights also often conflict with other, often more regional or local, laws that require certain public standards or behavior based on cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ioanna | last=Kucaradi | title=Universality Versus Particularity?

==Libertarianism on rights and special rights==
In ''The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism'', Eric Mack states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A too-ready acceptance of alleged rights leads to an oppressive list of enforceable obligations. As the list of others' rights grows, each of us is subject to a growing burden made up of the obligations correlative to those rights; correspondingly the ability of rights to be protective of individual choice dissolves. Moreover, as the list of rights grows, so too does the legitimate role of political and legal institutions, and the libertarian case for radically limiting the scope and power of such institutions withers away. Libertarian theories of rights avoid generating an oppressive list of obligations through the employment of two crucial distinctions – the distinction between negative and positive rights and the distinction between general and special rights.&lt;ref name="Hamowy"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition of minorities==
[[Minority rights]] advocacy groups often contend that such protections confer no special rights, and describe these laws instead as protecting [[Civil rights|equal rights]],&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php|title=Offensive Terminology to Avoid|publisher=GLAAD|accessdate=2006-05-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060301110310/http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to past conditions or legal privileges for specific groups.

A '''system''' is a regularly interacting or interdependent group of units forming an integrated whole.&lt;ref name=merriam-webster-system&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Every system is delineated by its spatial and temporal boundaries, surrounded and influenced by its environment, described by its structure and purpose and expressed in  its functioning.

==Etymology==
The term "system" comes from the [[Latin]] word ''systēma'', in turn from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|σύστημα}} ''systēma'': "whole concept made of several parts or members, system", literary "composition".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

According to [[Marshall McLuhan]],
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"System" means "something to look at". You must have a very high visual gradient to have systematization. But in philosophy, prior to Descartes, there was no "system". Plato had no "system". Aristotle had no "system".&lt;ref name ="Marshall1967"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]], who studied [[thermodynamics]], pioneered the development of the concept of a "system" in the [[natural science]]s. In 1824 he studied the system which he called the ''working substance'' (typically a body of water vapor) in [[steam engine]]s, in regards to the system's ability to do work when heat is applied to it. The working substance could be put in contact with either a boiler, a cold reservoir (a stream of cold water), or a piston (to which the working body could do work by pushing on it). In 1850, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]] generalized this picture to include the concept of the [[environment (systems)|surroundings]] and began to use the term "working body" when referring to the system.

The biologist [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] (1901–1972) became one of the pioneers of the [[Systems theory|general systems theory]]. In 1945 he introduced ''models, principles, and laws that apply to generalized systems or their subclasses, irrespective of their particular kind, the nature of their component elements, and the relation or 'forces' between them.''&lt;ref name="Bertalanfy1945"&gt;1945, ''Zu einer allgemeinen Systemlehre,'' Blätter für deutsche Philosophie, 3/4. (Extract in: Biologia Generalis, 19 (1949), 139–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Wiener]] (1894–1964) and [[William Ross Ashby|Ross Ashby]] (1903–1972), who pioneered the use of mathematics to study systems, carried out significant development in the concept of a ''system''.&lt;ref name="Wiener1948"&gt;
1948, ''Cybernetics: Or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.'' Paris, France: Librairie Hermann &amp; Cie, and Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ashby1950"&gt;
1956. ''[http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/ASHBBOOK.html An Introduction to Cybernetics]'', Chapman &amp; Hall.
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s [[John Henry Holland]] (1929–2015), [[Murray Gell-Mann]] (1929–) and others coined the term "[[complex adaptive system]]" at the interdisciplinary [[Santa Fe Institute]].

==Concepts==
;Environment and boundaries
:[[Systems theory]] views the world as a complex system of interconnected parts. One scopes a system by defining its [[Boundary (topology)|boundary]]; this means choosing which entities are inside the system and which are outside—part of the [[environment (systems)|environment]]. One can make simplified representations ([[Scientific modelling|models]]) of the system in order to understand it and to predict or impact its future behavior. These models may define the [[structure]] and [[behavior]] of the system.

;Natural and human-made systems
:There are natural and human-made (designed) systems. Natural systems may not have an apparent objective but their behavior can be interpreted{{by whom?|date=April 2016}} as purposeful by an observer. Human-made systems are made to satisfy an identified and stated need with purposes that are achieved by the delivery of wanted outputs. Their parts must be related; they must be "designed to work as a coherent entity"—otherwise they would be two or more distinct systems.

[[File:OpenSystemRepresentation.svg|thumb|252px|''Open systems'' have input and output flows, representing exchanges of matter, energy or information with their surroundings.]]
;Theoretical framework
:Most systems are [[Open system (thermodynamics)|open systems]], exchanging matter and energy with its surroundings; like a car, a [[coffeemaker]], or [[Earth]]. A [[closed system]] exchanges energy, but not matter, with its environment; like a computer or the project [[Biosphere 2]]. An [[isolated system]] exchanges neither matter nor energy with its environment. A theoretical example of such system is the [[Universe]].

;Process and transformation process
:An [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] can also be viewed as a bounded transformation process, that is, a [[black box]] that is a process or collection of processes that transforms inputs into outputs.{{cn|date=April 2016}} Inputs are consumed; outputs are produced. The concept of input and output here is very broad. For example, an output of a passenger ship is the movement of people from departure to destination.

;System model
:A system comprises [[view model|multiple views]]. Man-made systems may have such views as [[concept]], [[systems analysis|analysis]], [[Systems design|design]], [[implementation]], deployment, structure, behavior, input data, and output data views. A [[system model]] is required to describe and represent all these views.

;Systems architecture
:A [[systems architecture]], using one single integrated model for the description of [[view model|multiple views]], is a kind of [[system model]].

===Subsystem===
A ''subsystem'' is a set of elements, which is a system itself, and a component of a larger system.

A subsystem description is a system object that contains information defining the characteristics of an operating environment controlled by the system.&lt;ref&gt;IBM's definition @ http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_i5_54/rzaks/rzakssbsd.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Evidently, there are many kinds of systems that can be analyzed both [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] and [[Qualitative research|qualitatively]]. For example, in an analysis of urban [[System dynamics|systems dynamics]], A .W. Steiss&lt;ref&gt;Steiss, 1967, pp. 8–18.&lt;/ref&gt; defined five intersecting systems, including the physical subsystem and behavioral system. For sociological models influenced by systems theory, where [[Kenneth D. Bailey (sociologist)|Kenneth D. Bailey]]&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; defined systems in terms of [[conceptual system|conceptual]], [[Concrete (philosophy)|concrete]], and abstract systems, either [[Isolated system|isolated]], [[Closed system|closed]], or [[Open system (systems theory)|open]]. [[Walter F. Buckley]]&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; defined systems in sociology in terms of [[Mechanics|mechanical]], [[organic (model)|organic]], and [[process modeling|process]] models. [[Bela H. Banathy]]&lt;ref&gt;Banathy, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; cautioned that for any inquiry into a system understanding its kind is crucial, and defined "natural" and "designed", i. e. artificial, systems.

Artificial systems inherently have a major defect: they must be premised on one or more fundamental assumptions upon which additional knowledge is built. These fundamental assumptions are not inherently deleterious, but they must by definition be assumed as true, and if they are actually false then the system is not as structurally integral as is assumed. For example, in [[geometry]] this is very evident in the postulation of [[theorem|theorems]] and extrapolation of proofs from them.

It is important not to confuse these abstract definitions. Theorists include in natural systems subatomic systems, [[living systems theory|living systems]], the [[solar system]], [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and the [[Universe]]. Artificial systems include our physical structures, hybrids of natural and artificial systems, and conceptual knowledge. The human elements of organization and functions are emphasized with their relevant abstract systems and representations. A cardinal consideration in making distinctions among systems is to determine how much freedom the system has to select its purpose, goals, methods, tools, etc. and how wide is the freedom to select itself as distributed or concentrated.

[[George J. Klir]]&lt;ref&gt;Klir, 1969, pp. 69–72&lt;/ref&gt; maintained that no "classification is complete and perfect for all purposes", and defined systems as abstract, [[The Real|real]], and [[conceptual system|conceptual]] [[physical systems]], bounded and [[unbounded system]]s, discrete to continuous, pulse to [[hybrid system]]s, etc. The interactions between systems and their environments are categorized as relatively closed and [[open system (systems theory)|open systems]]. It seems most unlikely that an absolutely closed system can exist or, if it did, that it could be known by man. Important distinctions have also been made&lt;ref&gt;Checkland, 1997; Flood, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; between ''hard'' systems – technical in nature and amenable to methods such as [[systems engineering]], operations research, and quantitative systems analysis – and ''soft'' systems that involve people and organisations, commonly associated with concepts developed by [[Peter Checkland]] and [[Brian Wilson (systems scientist)|Brian Wilson]] through [[Soft systems methodology|Soft Systems Methodology]] (SSM) involving methods such as [[action research]] and emphasis of participatory designs. Where hard systems might be identified as more "scientific", the distinction between them is often elusive.

===Cultural system===
A cultural system may be defined as the interaction of different elements of [[culture]]. While a cultural system is quite different from a [[social system]], sometimes both together are referred to as a "sociocultural system". A major concern of the social sciences is the [[Social order|problem of order]].

===Economic system===
{{Main article|Economic system}}
An economic system is a mechanism ([[social institution]]) which deals with the [[Economic production|production]], [[distribution (business)|distribution]] and [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] of [[Good (economics)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|services]] in a particular [[society]]. The economic system is composed of [[person|people]], [[institutions]] and their relationships to resources, such as the [[Convention (norm)|convention]] of [[property]]. It addresses the problems of [[economics]], like the allocation and scarcity of resources.

The international sphere of interacting states is described and analysed in systems terms by several international relations scholars, most notably in the [[Neorealism (international relations)|neorealist school.]] This systems mode of international analysis has however been challenged by other schools of international relations thought, most notably the [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist school]], which argues that an over-large focus on systems and structures can obscure the role of individual agency in social interactions. Systems-based models of international relations also underlies the vision of the international sphere held by the [[Institutional liberalism|liberal institutionalist]] school of thought, which places more emphasis on systems generated by rules and interaction governance, particularly economic governance.

==Application of the system concept==
Systems modeling is generally a basic principle in engineering and in social sciences. The system is the representation of the entities under concern. Hence inclusion to or exclusion from system context is dependent on the intention of the modeler.

No model of a system will include all features of the real system of concern, and no model of a system must include all entities belonging to a real system of concern.

===In information and computer science===
In [[computer science]] and [[information science]], '''system''' is a [[software system]] which has [[Component (UML)|components]] as its structure and observable [[inter-process communication]]s as its behavior. Again, an example will illustrate: There are systems of counting, as with [[Roman numerals]], and various systems for filing papers, or catalogues, and various library systems, of which the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] is an example. This still fits with the definition of components which are connected together (in this case to facilitate the flow of information).

System can also refer to a framework, aka [[platform (computing)|platform]], be it software or hardware, designed to allow software programs to run.

===In engineering and physics===
In [[engineering]] and [[physics]], a physical system is the portion of the universe that is being studied (of which a [[thermodynamic system]] is one major example). Engineering also has the concept of a system referring to all of the parts and interactions between parts of a complex project. [[Systems engineering]] is the branch of engineering that studies how this type of system should be planned, designed, implemented, built, and maintained.

===In social and cognitive sciences and management research===
Social and [[Cognitive science|cognitive sciences]] recognize systems in human person models and in human societies. They include human brain functions and mental processes as well as normative ethics systems and social/cultural behavioral patterns.

In [[management science]], [[operations research]] and [[organizational development]] (OD), human organizations are viewed as '''systems''' (conceptual systems) of interacting components such as subsystems or system aggregates, which are carriers of numerous complex [[business processes]] ([[organizational behavior]]s) and organizational structures. Organizational development theorist [[Peter Senge]] developed the notion of organizations as systems in his book ''The Fifth Discipline''.

[[Systems thinking]] is a style of thinking/[[reasoning]] and problem solving. It starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem. It can be a leadership competency. Some people can ''think globally while acting locally''. Such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems. This is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology.

[[Organizational studies|Organizational theorists]] such as [[Margaret Wheatley]] have also described the workings of organizational systems in new metaphoric contexts, such as [[quantum physics]], [[chaos theory]], and the [[self-organizing systems|self-organization of systems]].

===Pure logical systems===

There is also such a thing as a logical system. The most obvious example is the calculus developed simultaneously by [[Leibniz]] and [[Isaac Newton]]. Another example is [[George Boole]]'s Boolean operators. Other examples have related specifically to philosophy, biology, or cognitive science. [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs]] applies psychology to biology by using pure logic. Numerous psychologists, including [[Carl Jung]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] have developed systems which logically organize psychological domains, such as personalities, motivations, or intellect and desire. Often these domains consist of general categories following a [[corollary]] such as a [[theorem]]. Logic has been applied to categories such as [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]], [[ontology]], [[educational assessment|assessment]], and [[hierarchies]].

===Applied to strategic thinking===
In 1988, military strategist, [[John A. Warden III]] introduced the [[Warden's Five Rings|Five Ring System]] model in his book, ''The Air Campaign'', contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings. Each ring—Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units—could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Warden |first=John A.

Participants are invited to structure their shared problems with the current system and develop shared visions and goals which are then tested for practicality through the use of experimentation, learning and reflexivity. The model is often discussed in reference to [[sustainable development]] and the possible use of the model as a method for change.

* takes a '''long-term''' perspective (between 1-3 generations) creating a '''basket of visions''' in which '''short-term objectives''' can be identified
* focused on '''learning''' at the niche level, experiments are used to identify how successful a particular pathway could be and uses the concept of "Learn by doing, doing by learning"&lt;ref name="loorbach2007"/&gt;

== History ==

There have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to motorised cars and the change from physical [[telegraphy]] to the electric [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzen|first=B|title=System innovation and the transition to sustainability: theory, evidence and policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within [[population dynamics]] and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=K|title=The world demographic transition cited by Rotmans et al 2001 "More Evolution than Revolution: Transition Management in Public Policy"|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1945|volume=237|issue=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within [[systems theory]] and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shove|first=E|author2=Walker, G |title=Caution! Transitions ahead: politics, practice and sustainable transition management|journal=Environment and Planning|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=763–770|doi=10.1068/a39310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management for Sustainable Development: A prescriptive, complexity-based governance framework|journal=Governance|year=2010|volume=23|issue=1|pages=161–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt; It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.&lt;ref name=rotmans2001 /&gt;

== Definition ==

Transition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux.&lt;ref name="kemp78"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R |author2=Loorbach, D |author3=Rotmans, J|title=Transition management as a model for managing processes of co-evolution towards sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology|year=2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=78–91|doi=10.1080/13504500709469709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics consider that the current [[political system]] is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="kemp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Loorbach, D |title=Governance for sustainability through transition management|journal=IHDP-conference|year=2003|url=http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/openmtg/docs/kemp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society&lt;ref name="loorbach2007"/&gt; (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging [[Grassroots|bottom-up]] approaches that are supported in a [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.

Unlike traditional forms of regulation that use [[command and control]] techniques, transition management does not seek to '''control''' the uncertainties of change but '''steer''', indirectly '''influence''' and '''redirect''' the choices of actors towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management: New mode of governance for Sustainable Development|year=2007|publisher=International Books|location=Utrecht, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of [[creative destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpter|first=J|title=The Theory of Economic Development|year=1934|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.
&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verbong|first=G|author2=Geels, F |title=Exploring sustainability transitions in the electricity sector with socio-technical pathways|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|year=2010|volume=77|issue=8|pages=1214–1221|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2010.04.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levels within sociotechnical systems ===
Most literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.&lt;ref name="kemp2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foxon|first=J |author2=Geoffrey P. Hammond |author3=Peter J. Pearson |author4=Jacquelin Burgess |author5=Tom Hargreaves|title=Transition pathways for a UK low carbon energy system: exploring different governance patterns|journal=Paper for 1st European Conference on Sustainability Transitions: "Dynamics and Governance of Transitions to Sustainability", Amsterdam|year=2009|url=http://www.lowcarbonpathways.org.uk/lowcarbon/publications/Sust_Transitions_Conf_paper_Foxon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Landscape''' (Macro) refers to the overall socio-technical setting that encompasses both the intangible aspects of social values, political beliefs and world views and the tangible facets of the built environment including institutions and the functions of the marketplace such as prices, costs, trade patterns and incomes.

These processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.

* '''Regime''' (Meso) refers to the dominant practices, rules and technologies that provide stability and reinforcement to the prevailing socio-technical systems.

Technological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp106/sewp106.pdf Berkhout, F., Smith A. and Stirling, A. (2003). Socio-technological regimes and transition contexts.] SPRU Electronic Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt; The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Niche''' (Micro) is the level or 'area' at which the space is provided for radical innovation and experimentation. This level is less subject to market and regulation influences and can facilitate the interactions between actors that support product innovation.

Radical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;

Multi-level Perspective
Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.

Figure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png
Geels and [[Johan Schot|Schot]]: 2007&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and [[Johan Schot|Schot, J.W.]], 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass.  The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt;

=== Actors ===

Each level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:

* '''[[Government]]''' which creates top-down pressure from regulation, and the use of market incentives, while also encouraging the 'collective learning process' by supporting innovation financially and providing access to information provided by advisory boards&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotmans|first=J |author2=René Kemp |author3=Marjolein van Asselt|title=More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy|journal=Foresight|year=2001|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=874125&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;
* '''Market-based actors,''' who interact both vertically through the [[supply chain]] and horizontally with other industry leaders to share [[best practice]] and create innovative ideas.
* '''[[Civil society]]''' which is both the user of the end product provided by the market but also [[non-governmental organisations]] which can also provide pressure for change and space for innovation

=== Power and relationships ===

Power within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual [[adaptation]] towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Parto, S |title=Governance for sustainable development: moving from theory to practice|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development|year=2005|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://kemp.unu-merit.nl/pdf/IJSD%208(1)%2002%20Kemp%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== A multi-level framework ==

Kemp ''et al.''&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.

'''Strategic activities''' encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations)&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.

'''Tactical activities''' relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.

Finally the '''operational activities''' constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0–5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform "societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).

A further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change.  One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).

== Practice ==

There are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon ''et al.'' 2009) constitutes the following methodology:

A problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape '''pressures'''. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the '''shared visions''' and goals of the actors.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; The visions outlined are '''long term''' in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and [[blueprints]]. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a [[carbon-neutral]] future include; the [[hydrogen economy]], the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"/&gt;
Although each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.

Once the pathways have been created '''short-term 'interim' objectives''' can be formed through [[Backcasting]] (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt; Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. '''Experiments''' within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options [[snowball]] down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==

Although being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong [[lock-in (decision-making)|lock-in]], socially, politically and technically.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as [[offshore wind power|offshore wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[tidal power]].

At the regime level, institutions such as the [[European Investment Bank]] are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the [[Renewables Obligation]] channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More [[Renewable Obligation Certificates]] are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC|title=Renewables Obligation|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/eligibility/eligibility.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919160717/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/Eligibility/Eligibility.aspx|archivedate=2010-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC |title=The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314173910/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |archivedate=March 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt;

'''Untouchability''', in its literal sense, is the practice of [[Social rejection|ostracising]] a minority group by segregating them from the mainstream by social custom or legal mandate. The term is most commonly associated with treatment of the [[Dalit]] communities in the [[Indian subcontinent]] who were considered "polluting", but the term has also been loosely used to refer to other groups, such as the [[Cagots]] in Europe, and the [[Al-Akhdam]] in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|title=The last untouchable in Europe|publisher=|date=2008-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the groups characterized as untouchable were those whose occupations and habits of life involved ritually polluting activities, such as fishermen, [[Manual_scavenging|manual scavengers]], sweepers and washermen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Untouchable - Encyclopaedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/untouchable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Untouchability has been outlawed in India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, "untouchability" has not been legally defined.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The origin of untouchability and its historicity are still debated, but it is believed to have existed at least as far back as 400 CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, Writings and Speeches, Volume 7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vYhDAAAAYAAJ|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Bhimrao Ramji|last2=Moon|first2=Vasant|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study of a sample of households in India concludes that "Notwithstanding the likelihood of under-reporting of the practice of untouchability, 70 percent of the population reported not indulging in this practice. This is an encouraging sign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Continuing Practice of Untouchability in India: Patterns and Mitigating Influences |journal=India Human Development Survey |url=https://ihds.umd.edu/sites/ihds.umd.edu/files/publications/papers/ThoratJoshi3.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
[[B. R. Ambedkar]], a social reformer and politician who came from a social group that was considered untouchable, theorized that untouchability originated because of the deliberate policy of the upper-caste [[Brahmins|Brahmanas]]. According to him, the Brahmanas despised the people who gave up the [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] in favour of [[Buddhism]]. Later scholars such as Vivekanand Jha have successfully refuted this theory.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=218}}

Nripendra Kumar Dutt, a professor of history, theorized that the concept of untouchability originated from the "[[outcast (person)|pariah]]"-like treatment accorded to the [[adivasi|aboriginies]] of India by the early [[Dravidian people|Dravidians]], and that the concept was borrowed by the [[Indo-Aryans]] from the Dravidians. Scholars such as [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R. S. Sharma]] have rejected this theory, arguing that there is no evidence that Dravidians practised untouchability before coming into contact with the Indo-Aryans.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=218}}

Austrian ethnologist [[Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf]] theorized that untouchability originated as [[class stratification]] in urban areas of the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]]. According to this theory, the poorer workers involved in 'unclean' occupations such as [[street sweeper|sweeping]] or [[leather work]] were historically segregated and banished outside the city limits. Over time, personal cleanliness came to be identified "purity", and the concept of untouchability eventually spread to rural areas as well. After the decline of the Indus Valley towns, these untouchables probably spread to other parts of India.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=219}} Scholars such as [[Suvira Jaiswal]] reject this theory, arguing that it lacks evidence, and does not explain why the concept of untouchability is more pronounced in rural areas.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=219-220}}

American scholar [[George L. Hart]], based on his interpretation of [[Old Tamil language|Old Tamil]] texts such as ''[[Purananuru]]'', traced the origin of untouchability to ancient [[Tamilakam|Tamil]] society. According to him, in this society, certain occupational groups were thought to be involved in controlling the malevolent supernatural forces; as an example, Hart mentions the [[Paraiyar]]s, who played drums during battles and solemn events such as births and deaths. People from these occupational groups came to be avoided by others, who believed that they were "dangerous and had the power to pollute the others".{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=220}} Jaiswal dismisses the evidence produced by Hart as "extremely weak" and contradictory. Jaiswal points out that the authors of the ancient Tamil texts included several Brahmanas (a fact accepted by Hart); thus, the society described in these texts was already under Brahmanical influence, and could have borrowed the concept of untouchability from them.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=221-222}}

British anthropologist [[John Henry Hutton]] traced the origin of untouchability to the taboo on accepting food cooked by a person from a different caste. This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one's caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=223}} Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different [[varna in Hinduism|varna]] or [[Rigvedic tribes|tribe]]. For example, some [[Śrauta#Śrauta Sutras|Shrauta Sutras]] mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit [[yajna|sacrifice]] must live with the [[Nishada]]s (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=224}}

Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal, R. S. Sharma, and Vivekanand Jha characterize untouchability as a relatively later development after the establishment of the varna and caste system.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|pp=225-227}} Jha notes that the earliest Vedic text ''[[Rigveda]]'' makes no mention of untouchability, and even the later Vedic texts, which revile certain groups such as the [[Chandala]]s, do not suggest that untouchability existed in the contemporary society. According to Jha, in the later period, several groups began to be characterized as untouchable, a development which reached its peak during 600-1200 CE. Sharma theorizes that institution of untouchability arose when the aboriginal tribes with "low material culture" and "uncertain means of livelihood" came to be regarded as impure by the privileged classes who despised manual labour, and regarded associated impurity with "certain material objects".{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=226}} According to Jaiswal, when the members of aboriginal groups were assimilated into the Brahmanical society, the privileged among them may have tried to assert their higher status by disassociating themselves from their lower-status counterparts, who were gradually branded as untouchables.{{sfn|Suvira Jaiswal|1978|p=227}}

Untouchability is believed to have been first mentioned in ''[[Dharmashastra]]''. According to the text, untouchables were not considered a part of the [[varna]] system because of their grievous sins, barbaric or unethical acts such as murder, harassment etc. Therefore, they were not treated like the [[savarna]]s ([[Brahmin]]s, [[Kshatriya]]s,[[ Vaishya]]s and [[Shudra]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/DharmasutrasTheLawCodesOfAncientIndiaPatrickOlivelleOUP/Dharmasutras%20The%20Law%20Codes%20of%20Ancient%20India%20%20Patrick%20Olivelle%20OUP_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Dharmasutras The Law Codes Of Ancient India Patrick Olivelle OUP"|website=archive.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2018}}

According to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, modern untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to "meat, and bodily fluids".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Where There Is No Midwife: Birth and Loss in Rural India |first=Sarah |last=Pinto |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-85745-448-5 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5V-_NssEMSsC&amp;pg=PA47 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the name of untouchability,  Dalits have faced work and descent-based discrimination at the hands of the [[Sanskritisation|dominant castes]]. Based on the punishments prescribed in The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 the following practices could be understood to have been associated with Untouchability in India&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE UNTOUCHABILITY (OFFENCES) ACT, 1955 |url=http://theindianlawyer.in/statutesnbareacts/acts/u14.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

==Government action in India==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
At the time of Indian independence, [[Dalit]] activists began calling for [[Reserved_political_positions_in_India|separate electorates]] for untouchables in India to allow fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for [[Sikhs]], [[Muslims]], [[Christian]]s, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. According to the textbook,''Religions in the Modern World'', B.R. Ambedkar, who was also a supporter of the Act, was considered to be the “untouchable leader” who made great efforts to eliminate caste system privileges that included participation in public festivals, access to temples, and wedding rituals. In 1932, Ambedkar proposed that the untouchables create a separate electorate that ultimately led [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]] to fast until it was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, David (2016). Woodhead, Linda; Partridge, Christopher; Kawanami, Hiroko, eds. Hinduism. New York: Routledge. p. 38-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

A separation within [[Hindu]] society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as Gandhi, although he took no exception to the demands of the other minorities. He began a [[hunger strike]] to protest this type of [[affirmative action]], citing that it would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the [[Round Table Conferences (India)|Round Table Conferences]], he provided this explanation for his reasoning:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don't know their India, don't know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Ravinder. "Gandhi, Ambedkar and the Poona pact, 1932." ''South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies'' 8.1-2 (1985): 87-101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Gandhi achieved some success through his hunger strike. Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be reduced, but not totally eliminated.

The 1950 national [[constitution of India]] legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for [[Reservation in India|positive discrimination]] in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes]].

Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the [[Kherlanji massacre]].
