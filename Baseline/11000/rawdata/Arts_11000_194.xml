      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Anchor Graphics''' is a non-profit fine art printshop and gallery in [[Chicago, Illinois]] that is part of the Art + Design Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]]. It was founded in 1990 by David Jones and Marilyn Propp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-07/entertainment/9606070202_1_drawings-etching-prints|title=Anchor Shows Printmaking Process As Well As Product|publisher=Chicago Tribune|first=Barbara B. |last=Buchholz|date=7 June 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is known for the quality of its prints as well as its educational programming.&lt;ref&gt;Second Sight: Printmaking in Chicago 1935-1995," by James Yood. Essays by Mark Pascale, James Yood, and David Mickenberg (Mary and Leigh Block Gallery, Northwestern University, 1996), p. 50 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=demo3&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://issuu.com/columbiacollegepubs/docs/demo3|first=Anne|last=Wiens|title=The Fine Print|journal=Demo3|publisher=Columbia College|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
For twenty years, Anchor provided free classes for high school students, and had an outreach program called Press on Wheels (POW) which brought [[printmaking]] into schools, galleries, museums, and community centers.&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt; Workshops were open to students of all ages who learned to create handmade prints. During the Toulouse-Lautrec and Rembrandt exhibitions at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], a press was brought to the museum, and Anchor staff demonstrated the print processes and tools used by both artists. Ann Weins writes in DEMO 3, pages 24–28: "Anchor Graphics maintains an impressive schedule of classes, workshops, residencies, and lectures, all the while publishing exquisite, hand-pulled prints."&lt;ref name=demo3 /&gt;

The Artist-in-Residence Program was created to provide uninterrupted use of the shop by national and international printmakers for research and the development of new work.

Located in [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|Ukrainian Village]], and then Chicago's [[Ukrainian Village, Chicago|River North]], Anchor moved to the [[Chicago Loop|South Loop]] upon becoming a part of the Art + Design Department at [[Columbia College Chicago]] in 2006. According to [[David Mickenberg]], former director of the David Museum and Cultural Center, and of the [[Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art|Block Museum]] at [[Northwestern University]], " [Anchor's reputation] has to do with. . .  the balancing act between education and collaborative printmaking. . .

'''Angelo Vergecio''' ({{lang-el|Άγγελος Βεργέκιος}}, {{lang-fr|Ange Vergèce}}; 1505–1569) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] copyist from [[Crete]] active in [[Venice]] and [[France]]. He became a royal scribe for [[Francis I of France]] and his successors, was responsible for copying over fifty Greek manuscripts, and played a role in the dissemination of Greek among the humanist circles in France. His handwriting formed the basis of the ''[[grecs du roi]]'' typeface designed by [[Claude Garamond]].

'''Art Apart Fair''' is Singapore's first&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dev.stcommunities.sg/entertainment/show/st-review/more-art-fairs-are-being-launched |title=More art fairs are being launched |date=11 January 2014 |website=The Straits Times |last=Shetty |first=Deepika |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216095717/http://dev.stcommunities.sg/entertainment/show/st-review/more-art-fairs-are-being-launched |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hotel-based boutique art fair. Initially called Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013, the success of the fair encouraged a second edition, later renamed as Art Apart Fair as part of a series of "Apart Fairs".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sea.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/920838/art-apart-hotel-fair-returns-at-parkroyal-on-pickering|title = Art Apart hotel fair returns at Parkroyal on Pickering|date = 25 June 2013|website = Blouin Art Info|publisher = Blouin Art Info Southeast Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art Apart coincides with Singapore Art Week, an initiative launched by the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]], along with the [[Singapore Tourism Board]] and [[Economic Development Board|Singapore Economic Development Board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nac.gov.sg/art-forms/visual-arts/festivals-events/singapore-art-week-2015 |title=Singapore Art Week 2015 |website=National Arts Council |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213033328/http://www.nac.gov.sg/art-forms/visual-arts/festivals-events/singapore-art-week-2015 |archivedate=13 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fairs take place twice biannually – during January and July – in Singapore. Art Apart made its international debut in London in October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/london/about-art-apart-fair/|title = About Art Apart Fair|website = Art Apart Fair London}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Town Hall Hotel. It will be setting its stage in New York in October 2016.

Art Apart Fair serves as a platform to provide support towards emerging artists with the potential to become established. The fair gives artists the opportunity to showcase their works&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/about-art-apart-fair/|title = About Art Apart Fair|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gain recognition among art lovers and collectors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ssphere.com/news/latest-blogs/entry/art-apart-fair-2013-presents-a-canvas-for-the-next-wave-of-asian-artists-to-the-rest-of-the-world.html|title = Art Apart Fair 2013 presents a canvas for the next wave of Asian artists to the rest of the world|date = 15 June 2013|website = SSphere Online|last = Tan|first = Billy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2014, some 33 galleries and 1,500 artists' work from countries such as Taiwan, China, Australia, Kazakhstan, Croatia, Japan, Vietnam, Austria, Cambodia, South Korea, Russia, Spain and Germany, were featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/arts/art-apart-fair-go-international|title = Art Apart Fair to go international|date = 8 January 2014|website = TODAY Online|last = Aljaru|first = Mysara Bte Mohamad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the galleries that have exhibited with Art Apart are South Korea's [[Seoul Arts Centre]], Shanghai's Nancy Gallery, Madrid's Jorge &amp; Fernando Alcolea Gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.herworldplus.com/lifestyle/stuff-do/art-apart-fair-2013 |title=Art Apart Fair 2013 |website=Her World Plus |publisher=Singapore Press Holdings |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025955/http://www.herworldplus.com/lifestyle/stuff-do/art-apart-fair-2013 |archivedate=24 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russia's Gallery 11.12.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.expatliving.sg/Things_to_do/whats_on_calendar/art-and-culture/Art-Fair-Art-Apart-Fair-2015-76210.ece|title = Art Apart Fair 2015|website = Expat Living}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comparison to other art fairs, Art Apart focuses on selecting galleries with emerging artists with a possibility of becoming established in their national or international market.

Due to the high costs of exhibiting at art fairs and the presence of many artists struggling to succeed financially,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/london/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/pressrelfinallogo.pdf|title = Art Apart Fair – Singapore returns for its fourth edition|date = 8 May 2014|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an "Adopt An Artist" initiative, where a Patron of the Arts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/patrons/|title = Patron of the Arts|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sponsors help to fund these artists. Galleries that are invited to showcase new works at Art Apart also help support the emerging artists by paying for the exhibiting fee. Works have to be new and not shown at other art fairs before.

Besides providing support for emerging artists, part of the revenue generated from the sales of art works and tickets goes towards helping the young and elderly in Singapore. One of the beneficiaries includes [[Halogen Foundation (Singapore)|Halogen Foundation]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://main.artapartfair.com/assets/uploads/files/aaf_jan_catalogue.pdf |title=Art Apart Fair 3rd Edition Catalogue |website=Art Apart Fair |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216102258/http://main.artapartfair.com/assets/uploads/files/aaf_jan_catalogue.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an educational charity that helps to develop young leaders and entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.halogen.sg/home/about-us/|title = About Us|publisher = Halogen Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another beneficiary is the Lions Befrienders Service Association,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Singapore's largest direct service voluntary welfare organisation, that assists the elderly and helps them engage with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/aboutlbsa_ourhistory.html |title=Our History |website=Lions Befrienders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216103049/http://www.lionsbefrienders.org.sg/aboutlbsa_ourhistory.html |archivedate=16 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The idea of holding an art fair in a hotel first originated in 1994 as the [[The Armory Show (art fair)|Gramercy International Art Fair]] in the rooms of [[Gramercy Park Hotel]] in New York City. The fair was highly successful, and it is now renamed "[[The Armory Show (art fair)|The Armory Show]]".

The concept of a hotel-based art fair breaks the conventional presentation of art in a whitewashed gallery space.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sg.asia-city.com/events/news/art-apart-fair-2014-brings-art-hotel-third-time-jan-17-19|title = Art Apart Fair is set to take place at PARKROYAL hotel this month|date = 14 January 2014|website = The Insider's Guide to Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are provided with a good idea of how these works would look like in a home setting, as they are being displayed in a more informal setting, such as on beds, table tops, chairs and even bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artitute.com/2013/01/24/a-new-art-fair-worlds-apart-singapore/|title = A new art fair – Worlds Apart Singapore|date = 24 January 2013|website = Artitute|last = Anthony|first = Nicola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by this layout, Art Apart founder and director Rosalind Lim decided to bring the idea over to Singapore. With over 38 years of experience in diverse fields, such as Public Relations, Branding, Marketing and Event Management, she built the foundation for the first successful hotel art fair – the Worlds Apart Fair in January 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/about-the-organizer/|title = About the Organizer|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Conrad Centennial Singapore]]. The fair was later renamed Art Apart Fair&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and moved to [[Parkroyal|Parkroyal on Pickering]], where the entire 14th floor – rooms, lobbies and corridors – is converted into art galleries.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://artapartfair.com/welcome/|title = Welcome|website = Art Apart Fair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singapore Editions ==

Some of the featured artists include emerging Russian artists [[Rinat Voligamsi]] and [[Maxim Bashev]], German artist Kaja el Attar and French artist Bruno Tanquerel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sg.asia-city.com/events/singapore-art/art-apart-5th-edition?page=2|title = Art Apart 5th Edition|website = The Insider's Guide to Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artraker''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based [[Community Interest Company]] established in 2012 and the brain-child of political artist, [[Manali Jagtap]]. Artraker annually recognizes artworks that helps shape and inspire through [[visual arts]] how people and organisations understand, engage and respond to [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/#/about/4571166102/ “About Artraker”], Artraker Official Website, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Artraker Annual Award ==
Artraker celebrates and awards art works and art projects that make a direct positive change in countries which have experienced [[war]], violent conflict and social upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2013/sep/20/artraker-artists-conflict-zones-in-pictures/ |title=Artraker award: artists in conflict zones fight back – in pictures |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2013-09-20 |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Artraker Awards differ from other awards such as the [[Turner Prize]] or the [[Deutsche Börse Photography Prize]]. Although like them, Artraker awards [[contemporary art]], it is not primarily interested in the significance of the artists’ contribution to the disciplines of [[art]] or [[photography]], but is focused instead on the ability of art to create opportunities for change and to co-create experiences of freedom even in the midst of conflict.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artraker.org/ “Dr Bernadette Buckley, Artraker Jury and Advisory Member”], Unseen, Unknown, and Unsung – Artraker Story, 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Artraker Annual Awards are announced during the week of International Peace Day each year and include three [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 2500 cash prizes.

Cambridge University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-521-36815-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Asimakopulos was born in Montreal in 1930.  He was educated at [[McGill University]] earning a B.A. in 1951 and an M.A. in 1953. In September 1953 Tom went to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]; his research topic was a three-commodity, three-country study in international trade theory entitled ''Productivity Changes, the Trade Balance and the Terms of Trade''.&lt;ref name=TERMS&gt;Asimakopulos, A. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2661902 ''A Note on Productivity Changes and the Terms of Trade'']. Oxford Economic Papers, New Series, Vol. 9, No. 2 (Jun., 1957), pp. 225–233.&lt;/ref&gt; With his classmate [[Keith Frearson]], the Australian economist, Tom went to [[Joan Robinson|Joan Robinson's]] lectures on what would become ''The Accumulation of Capital''&lt;ref name=ACCUMCAP&gt;Robinson, Joan. [https://www.questia.com/library/book/the-accumulation-of-capital-by-joan-robinson.jsp ''The Accumulation of Capital'']. London: Macmillan Company, 1965. First published 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; – Robinson's ''magnum opus'', which sought to extend [[Keynesian economics|Keynes's theory]] to account for long-run issues of growth and [[capital accumulation]]. Initially Asimakopulos was irritated by Robinson's criticisms  of the orthodox theories of value and distribution and [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical methodology]] on which he had been brought up. Asimakopulos also went regularly to research students's seminars run by [[Piero Sraffa]], [[Robin Marris]], and [[Nicholas Kaldor]].

Asimakopulos was a Lecturer in Economics and Political Science from 1956 to 1957 at McGill. From 1957 to 1959 he worked as an Assistant Professor at the Royal Military College. In 1959 he returned to McGill and became an assistant professor, working close to [[J.C. Weldon]]. Promoted to the position of associate professor in 1963, he became a full professor in 1966. In 1988 he was appointed ''"William Dow Professor of Political Economy"'' on Weldon's vacancy. He served as Chairman of the Department of Economics from 1974 to 1978. Teaching was his top priority; Asimakopulos loved teaching the microeconomics course to the Honours Students at McGill. Even though he had an assistant, Asimakopulos made sure that, from time to time, he gave tutorials himself, on which he would emphasize, ''ad nauseam'' the importance of the ''assumptions'' of the analysis and its implications on the results of the theoretical model studied.  He wrote extensively on the work of such economic theorists as J. M. Keynes, Joan Robinson, and [[Michał Kalecki]]. He was active in many professional associations and organizations. He held numerous fellowships and was a Visiting Professor and a Fellow at universities in the United States, England and Australia. From 1976 to 1990 he was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

Athanasios Asimakopulos died of leukemia in 1990.&lt;ref name=harcourt/&gt;

==Contributions to economic theory==
Asimakopulos was a [[Post Keynesian]] / "[[Michał Kalecki|Kaleckian]]" scholar, who elaborated upon Michał Kalecki's theories.&lt;ref name=KALECIANMODEL&gt;Lavoie, Marc. [http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/19/6/789 ''The Kaleckian model of growth and distribution and its neo-Ricardian and neo-Marxian critiques'']. Cambridge Journal of Economics 19 (6), 1993, pp. 789–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Asimakopulos wrote mainly around and on Keynesian themes and on growth, distribution and technical progress (the latter often with Weldon). Over time Kalecki's contributions came to be a major influence and interest; Tom came back to Kalecki, influenced by Joan Robinson. Kalecki stresses on determinants of income distribution, determinants of economic activity, determinants of profits, long-run growth, prospects of economy, or impact of imperfect competition on growth of income has been an important inspiration to many economists we call [[Post Keynesian]]s, including Asimakopulos.&lt;ref name= KALECKI1&gt;Nuti, D. M. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n5_v39/ai_6123769 ''Michal Kalecki – excerpts from a paper entitled Michal Kalecki's Contributions to the Theory and Practice of Socialist Planning'']. Monthly Review, Oct. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=POSTKEYNES2&gt;[http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm The American Post Keynesians] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418155213/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/schools/postk.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An advantage of theories that originate from Kalecki is that they are closer to what can be called "normal" theories. Kalecki's papers are acceptably formalized and not as extensively open to various interpretations as Keynes' ''General Theory''.&lt;ref name=KALECKINAMOD2&gt;Lavoie. Marc. [http://rrp.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/28/4/113 ''Traverse, Hysteresis, and Normal Rates of Capacity Utilization in Kaleckian Models of Growth and Distribution'']. Review of Radical Political Economics 28 (4), 1996, 113–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Post Keynesians]] treat production side of the economy in their models, they usually inhabit their models with firms, which operate within neither perfectly competitive environment, nor within perfect monopoly setting. Post Keynesian firms usually set their prices as mark-ups above their prime costs. Profits of those firms usually, along with ''"animal spirits and expectations"'', have pronounced impact on investment decisions and therefore determine profits in the future. This double-sided relationship between profits and investment is clearly in spirit of Asimakopulos (1971)&lt;ref name=DETKEY&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journals/00084239.html Asimakopulos, Athanasios. ''The Determination of Investment in Keynes's Model'', Canadian JE, 1971, vol. 4, issue 3, pp. 382–88.]&lt;/ref&gt; The most succinct definition of post-Keynesian economics comes from Joan Robinson:

::To me, the expression '''''post-Keynesian''''' has a definite meaning; it applies to an economic theory or method of analysis which takes account of the difference between the future and the past. {{small|(emphasis in the original)}} {{small|(1978; CEP, vol. V, 1979b, 210)}}

===Post Keynesianism===
The principal concern of [[Post Keynesians]] is to have a more complex and realistic aggregate [[supply and demand]] framework that includes mark-up pricing, the trend to monopoly, the workings of [[endogenous money]] and credit, circular and cumulative causation, and a pragmatic guide to policy. The workings of uncertainty lead to an unstable capitalistic system that requires the making of agreements and accords to promote stability. At the global level, it requires a fairer distribution of power such that the onus is on nations with trade surpluses to adjust their policies. More than anything, Post Keynesians eschew the quantity theory of money, since money and credit are seen to affect output and employment in both the short and long term. Indeed, like the institutionalists and Marxists, they see the capitalist economy as a monetary system of production, where money and [[creative financing]] are essential aspects of its functioning.&lt;ref name=POSTKEY1&gt;[http://hetsa.fec.anu.edu.au/review/ejournal/pdf/37-RA-2.pdf O'Hara, Phillip Anthony. ''The Revival of Political Economy and its Main Protagonists: 1960s to the Present''.

They all moved well and truly outside it, attempting to create either a revolutionary alternative or to rehabilitate the [[Marxist Socialism|classical Marxian tradition]], in most cases in the light of the [[Keynesians|Keynesian revolution]]. The one exception is Michał Kalecki, whose personal history and independent mind combined to place him virtually always outside the mainstream.

Asimakopulos however viewed himself as a [[Neoclassical economics|mainstream]] economist. He even declined an invitation to be included in the first edition of Philip Arestis and Malcolm Sawyer's ''A Biographical Dictionary of Dissenting Economists'',&lt;ref name=DICTDISSENT&gt;Arestis, Philip and Sawyer, Malcolm.

Edward Elgar Publishing, 2000, pp. 7–11. First published 1992. {{ISBN|1-85898-560-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he regarded his views and contributions as belonging fully within the tradition of economics proper, not in a dissenting stream (he was included in the second edition).&lt;ref name=POSTKEY&gt;Harcourt, G.

====Asimakopulos' critique of Keynes' ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment''====
In his ''General Theory'', John Maynard Keynes proposed an investment function of the sort &lt;  I = I0 + I(r)  &gt; where the relationship between investment and interest rate was of a rather naive form. Firms were presumed to "rank" various investment projects depending on their ''"[[internal rate of return]]"'' (or ''"marginal efficiency of investment"'') and thereafter, faced with a given rate of interest, chose those projects whose internal rate of return exceeded the rate of interest. With an infinite number of projects available, this amounted to arguing that firms would invest until their marginal efficiency of investment was equal to the rate of interest, i.e. &lt;  MEI = r  &gt;.

Asimakopulos (1971, 1991), Piero Garegnani (1978) and several Post Keynesians offered a troublesome critique to Keynes' original formulation. Asimakopulos et al. questioned the very possibility of a downward-sloping ''Marginal Efficiency of Investment (MEI)'' function in the presence of unemployment. In particular, we can note that Keynes's multiplier story implies that if investment is undertaken then, by the multiplier, aggregate demand and output rises. But if the marginal efficiency of investment function is dependent on expected future returns, then should not the increased income and thus aggregate demand from the multiplier imply higher future returns? If so, then the MEI function ought to shift outwards to the right. This, in turn, implies that investment ought to increase  which leads to another increase in aggregate demand and thus the ''MEI'' curve shifts out again, raising investment, etc.&lt;ref name=KEYNESIRR&gt;Asimakopulos et al., [http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm ''J. M. Keynes's Internal Rate of Return''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418015246/http://cepa.newschool.edu/het/essays/capital/keynesreturn.htm |date=April 18, 2009 }}, at HET website.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, it is easy to conceive that, in situations of unemployment where the multiplier works its magic, investment is actually indeterminate&amp;nbsp;– or rather, an ever-shifting ''MEI'' curve could imply that all investment projects will be eventually undertaken and not merely those that are profitable at the given rate of interest since the profitability of projects is itself a function of aggregate demand and thus endogenous to the problem.

::Tom Asimakopulos was a great Kaleckian scholar. His knowledge of the nuances and innuendos of Kalecki's approach to macroeconomics had no equal. {{small|Paul Davidson, Journal of Economic Issues.}}

::This book (''Keynes's General Theory and Accumulation'') is the legacy of a dedicated and tough-minded scholar who did his heroes the compliment of taking their work seriously, rather than just praising it. {{small|Robert W. Dimand, History of Political Economy.}}

'''''Barbershop''''' is a 2002 American [[comedy film]] [[film director|directed]] by [[Tim Story]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbershop (2002)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303714/combined|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced by State Street Pictures and released by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] on September 13, 2002. Starring [[Ice Cube]], [[Cedric the Entertainer]], and [[Anthony Anderson]], the movie revolves around social life in a [[barber]]shop on the [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] of [[Chicago]]. ''Barbershop'' also proved to be a star-making vehicle for acting newcomers [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Michael Ealy]]. It is the first film in the [[Barbershop (film series)|''Barbershop'' film series]].

==Plot==
On a cold winter day, Calvin Palmer Jr. ([[Ice Cube]]) decides he has had enough of trying to keep open the [[barber]]shop his father handed down to him. He cannot borrow, revenues are falling, and he seems more interested in [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s to bring in easy money. Without telling his employees or the customers, he sells the barbershop to a greedy loan shark, Lester Wallace ([[Keith David]]), who secretly plans to turn it into a [[striptease|strip club]].

After spending a day at work, and realizing just how vital the barbershop is to the surrounding community, Calvin rethinks his decision and tries to get the shop back - only to find out Wallace wants double the $20,000 he paid Calvin to return it, and before 7 pm that day. Right after he admits to the employees that he sold the barber shop, and that it would be closing at the end of the day, the police arrive to arrest one of the barbers, Ricky ([[Michael Ealy]]). He is accused of driving his pickup truck into a nearby market to steal an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], but it's revealed that Ricky's cousin J.D. ([[Anthony Anderson]]) committed the crime after borrowing Ricky's truck. As this would be Ricky's '[[Three strikes law|third strike]]', he could be sentenced to life in prison. Calvin uses the $20,000 from Lester to bail Ricky out of jail, but because J.D. set him up, Ricky is still angry.

Calvin reveals that he found a gun in Ricky's locker in the barbershop and shows it to him. They stop the car and Ricky throws the gun into the river, proving that he does not want to get into any more trouble. Then they both go to confront Lester, as well as J.D. and Billy (Lahmard Tate), who took the ATM to Lester's place without his knowledge, still trying to pry it open. Calvin and Ricky demand that Lester give the barbershop back. Angered, Lester orders his bodyguard Monk to pull out his gun. The police arrive just in time to save Calvin and Ricky and arrest J.D. and Billy. Calvin and Ricky see the ATM, and get a $50,000 reward for returning it to police. They get the money, and the barbershop reopens with even better business than before. In the meantime, Calvin's wife Jennifer ([[Jazsmin Lewis]]) has given birth to a baby boy.

==Production==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Produced on a $12 million budget, ''Barbershop'', with a story by Mark Brown and a screenplay by Brown, Marshall Todd, and Don D. Scott, was filmed in Chicago during the winter of 2001 to early 2002. The filmmakers used a storefront in the [[South Chicago, Chicago|South Chicago community area]] (79th Street and Exchange Avenue) that was once a [[laundromat]] to build the set for Calvin's barbershop, and the set was duplicated on a [[soundstage]]. Similar to what he achieved with his 1997 film ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'', producer [[George Tillman Jr.]] wanted to portray African Americans in a more positive and three-dimensional light than many other [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]] films had in the past. This film also features three original songs by [[R&amp;B]] singer/songwriter Sherod Lindsey.

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=November 2012}}&lt;!-- needs comments from individual critics, with references --&gt;
The film received positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a "Certified Fresh" rating and a score of 82% based on 124 reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barbershop/|title=Barbershop|date=13 September 2002|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the critical consensus "Besides bringing on the laughs, ''Barbershop'' displays a big heart and demonstrates the value of community." Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 66% based on reviews from 29 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/barbershop|title=Barbershop|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels, spin-off and television series==
{{Anchor|Sequels}}
In 2004, MGM released the [[sequel]], ''[[Barbershop 2: Back in Business]]''. All of the original cast returned, but director [[Tim Story]] did not. This film was directed by [[Kevin Rodney Sullivan]]. In the same year, [[Billie Woodruff]] directed a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] film entitled ''[[Beauty Shop]]'', with [[Queen Latifah]] as the lead (Latifah's character made her debut in ''Barbershop 2''). ''Beauty Shop'' was pushed back from a late summer 2004 release, and finally reached theaters in March 2005.

During the fall of 2005, State Street and Ice Cube debuted ''[[Barbershop: The Series]]'' on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[cable television|cable]] [[television network|network]], with [[Omar Gooding]] taking over [[Ice Cube]]'s role of Calvin. The character "Dinka" is renamed "Yinka" on ''Barbershop: The Series'', as "Dinka" is not a typical Nigerian name (although a certain tribe in the Nigerian middle belt bears the name "Dimka"). In addition, Isaac's last name is changed from "Rosenberg" to "Brice", and the character Ricky has been replaced by a more hardened ex-con, Romadal.

In 2014, a third ''Barbershop'' film was announced, titled ''[[Barbershop: The Next Cut]]''. In late March of that year, MGM executives revealed that they have been negotiating deals with Ice Cube to appear in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/03/mgm-re-opens-barbershop-for-business-with-ice-cube-deal/|title='Barbershop' Sequel In Works With Ice Cube At MGM - Deadline|author=Mike Fleming Jr|work=Deadline}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, MGM announced that the studio has been setting up deals with Cedric the Entertainer, Queen Latifah, [[Lisa Maffia]], and [[Nicki Minaj]] to appear in the film. [[Malcolm D. Lee]] directed the film and [[New Line Cinema]] distributed it.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming Jr., Mike (March 25, 2015). [http://deadline.com/2015/03/barbershop-3-new-line-ice-cube-mgm-1201398929/ New Line Joins MGM And Will Release ‘Barbershop 3.′] ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released on April 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barbershop: The Next Cut - ComingSoon.net|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movie/barbershop-the-next-cut-2016|website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Barbershop (soundtrack)}}
A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on August 27, 2002 by [[Epic Records]]. It peaked at #29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and #9 on the [[Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums]].

== History ==

=== Early Years: San Diego ===
While Bill Silva was a student at University of San Diego he started a concert promotion company for university parties.  This led him to expand into the San Diego area and establish Bill Silva Presents in 1979. Over the next two decades the company brought acts such as [[The Who]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Devo]], [[The Police]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[INXS]], [[Diana Ross]], and [[Willie Nelson]] to the area.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"&gt;http://digitalmediasummit.ca/wp-content/plugins/cmw-speakers/speaker_details.php?id=25&lt;/ref&gt;

After securing a foothold in San Diego, Silva branched out into other parts of the southwest, promoting smaller shows in Arizona, Texas, Nevada, and Idaho. In 1982 he partnered with Feyline Productions and became the promoter for any of Feyline's shows outside of Colorado.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

In 1992 Silva teamed up with Andrew Hewitt to obtain exclusive rights to produce rock concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-23/news/mn-7298_1_hollywood-bowl "Hollywood Bowl Deal Questioned by Promoters"]. ''latimes''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 Silva started representing the band [[Unwritten Law]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bill-silva-mn0001881067 "Bill Silva"]. ''AllMusic''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; after promoting one of their shows and BSE's management division, Bill Silva Management, was founded. Soon after, BSM added [[Blink-182]] to its artist roster.&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;

=== The Move To Los Angeles and the Start of the Jason Mraz Era ===

Bill Silva Entertainment moved from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1999.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt; He was introduced to [[Jason Mraz]], who he managed until 2017.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2017/sep/12/blurt-jason-mraz-breaks-manager-bill-silva/&lt;/ref&gt;

Silva also sold his concert division, Bill Silva Presents, to Universal Studios's concert division, which was later purchased by House of Blues Concerts. In March 2003 Andrew Hewitt and Silva left that venture, parting ways in concert promotion with the exception of their partnership at the Hollywood Bowl.&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt;

Silva went on to re-establish Bill Silva Presents with a touring division that was kicked off by 2000's "Up In Smoke Tour" with [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Eminem]].&lt;ref name="celebrityaccess.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="renmanmb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="digitalmediasummit.ca"/&gt; In 2005 Silva hired Eric Herz, a former executive at Avalon Attractions and Metropolitan Entertainment, to oversee Bill Silva Presents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/3501/herz-joins-bill-silva-presents "Herz Joins Bill Silva Presents"]. ''All Access''. Retrieved on 25 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent Years: Expansion and Diversification ===
In 2011 Silva merged Bill Silva Presents with Live Nation Entertainment, placing Silva and Andrew Hewitt in charge of overseeing the company's concerts in the southwest region of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;George Varga (26 October 2011).

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine literature''' is the [[Greek literature]] of the [[Middle Ages]], whether written in the territory of the [[Byzantine Empire]] or outside its borders.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica - "Greek literature: Byzantine literature"&lt;/ref&gt; It forms the second period in the history of Greek literature after [[Ancient Greek literature]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Although ''popular'' Byzantine literature and early [[Modern Greek literature]] both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek", [[E. M. Geldart]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Many of the classical Greek genres, such as drama and choral lyric poetry, had been obsolete by late antiquity, and all medieval literature in the [[Greek language]] was written in an archaizing style, which imitated the writers of [[ancient Greece]]. This practice was perpetuated by a long-established system of Greek education where [[rhetoric]] was a leading subject.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; A typical product of this Byzantine education was the Greek [[Church Fathers]], who shared the literary values of their pagan contemporaries. Consequently, the vast Christian literature of the 3rd to 6th centuries established a synthesis of [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] and [[Christian]] thought. As a result, Byzantine literature was largely written in a style of [[Atticism|Atticistic]] Greek, far removed from the popular [[Medieval Greek]] that was spoken by all classes of Byzantine society in their everyday lives. In addition, this literary style was also removed from the [[Koine Greek]] language of the [[New Testament]], reaching back to [[Homer]] and the writers of ancient [[Athens]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

In this manner, the culture of the [[Byzantine Empire]] was marked for over 1000 years by a [[diglossia|diglossy]] between two different forms of the same language, which were used for different purposes.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; However, the relations between the "high" and "low" forms of Greek changed over the centuries. The prestige of the Attic literature remained undiminished until the 7th century AD, but in the following two centuries when the existence of the Byzantine Empire was threatened, city life and education declined, and along with them the use of the classicizing language and style. The political recovery of the 9th century instigated a literary revival, in which a conscious attempt was made to recreate the Hellenic-Christian literary culture of late antiquity.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Simple or popular Greek was avoided in literary use and many of the early saints' lives were rewritten in an archaizing style. By the 12th century the cultural confidence of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] led them to develop new literary genres, such as romantic fiction, in which adventure and love are the main elements.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Satire made occasional use of elements from spoken Greek. The period from the [[Fourth Crusade]] to the [[Fall of Constantinople]] saw a vigorous revival of imitative classicizing literature, as the Greeks sought to assert their cultural superiority over the militarily more powerful West.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; At the same time there was the beginning of a flourishing literature in an approximation to the vernacular [[Modern Greek]]. However the vernacular literature was limited to poetic romances and popular devotional writing. All serious literature continued to make use of the archaizing language of learned Greek tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

Byzantine literature has two sources: [[ancient Greece|Classical Greek]] and [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt; Each of those sources provided a series of models and references for the Byzantine writer and his readers. In occasion, both sources were referred to side by side, for example when emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius Comnenus]] justified his actions of seizing church property to pay his soldiers by referring to the earlier examples of [[Pericles]] and the biblical king [[King David|David]].&lt;ref name="britannica"/&gt;

=== Greek ===
The oldest of these three civilizations is the Greek, centered not in [[Athens]] but in [[Alexandria]] and Hellenistic civilization. Alexandria through this period is the center of both Atticizing scholarship and of Graeco-Judaic social life, looking towards Athens as well as towards [[Jerusalem]]. This intellectual dualism between the culture of scholars and that of the people permeates the Byzantine period. Even Hellenistic literature exhibits two distinct tendencies, one rationalistic and scholarly, the other romantic and popular: the former originated in the schools of the Alexandrian [[Sophism|sophists]] and culminated in the rhetorical romance, the latter rooted in the idyllic tendency of [[Theocritus]] and culminated in the idyllic novel. Both tendencies persisted in Byzantium, but the first, as the one officially recognized, retained predominance and was not driven from the field until the fall of the empire. The reactionary linguistic movement known as [[Atticism]] supported and enforced this scholarly tendency. Atticism prevailed from the 2nd century BC onward, controlling all subsequent Greek culture, so that the living form of the Greek language was obscured and only occasionally found expression in private documents and popular literature.

=== Roman ===
Alexandria, the intellectual center, is balanced by Rome, the center of government. It is as a Roman Empire that the Byzantine state first entered history; its citizens were known as Romans (''Rhomaioi''), its capital as New Rome (Constantinople). Its laws were Roman; so were its government, its army, and its official class, and at first also its language and its private and public life. The organization of the state was very similar to that of the Roman imperial period, including its hierarchy and bureaucratic elite.

=== Christian ===
It was in Alexandria that Graeco-Oriental Christianity had its birth. There the [[Septuagint]] translation had been made; there that that fusion of Greek philosophy and Jewish religion took place which culminated in [[Philo]]; there flourished the mystic speculative [[Neoplatonism]] associated with [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry of Tyros|Porphyry]]. At Alexandria the great Greek ecclesiastical writers worked alongside pagan rhetoricians and philosophers; several were born here, e.g. [[Origen]], [[Athanasius]], and his opponent [[Arius]], also [[Cyril of Alexandria|Cyril]] and [[Synesius]]. On Egyptian soil [[monasticism]] began and thrived. After Alexandria, [[Antioch]] held great prestige, where a school of Christian commentators flourished under [[St. John Chrysostom]] and where later arose the Christian universal chronicles. In surrounding Syria, we find the germs of Greek ecclesiastical poetry, while from neighboring [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] came [[St. John of Damascus]], one of the [[Church Fathers|Greek Fathers]].

=== Oriental ===
Greek Christianity had of necessity a pronounced Oriental character; [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] and [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid Syria]] are the real birthplaces of the Graeco-Oriental church and Byzantine civilization in general. Egypt and Syria, with [[Asia Minor]], became for the autochthonous Greek civilization a place where hundreds of flourishing cities sprang into existence, where energies confined or crippled in the impoverished homeland found release; not only did these cities surpass in material wealth the mother country, but soon also cultivated the highest goods of the intellect ([[Karl Krumbacher|Krumbacher]]). Under such circumstances it is not strange that about nine-tenths of all the Byzantine authors of the first eight centuries were natives of Egypt, Syria, Palestine, and Asia Minor.

== Genres ==
The following account classifies Byzantine literature into five groups. The first three include representatives of those kinds of literature which continued the ancient traditions: historians and [[chronicle]]rs, encyclopedists and essayists, and writers of secular poetry. The other two include new literary genres, ecclesiastical and theological literature, and popular poetry.

=== Historians and annalists ===
{{further information|Greek historiography|List of Greek historiographers}}
The two groups of secular prose literature show clearly the dual character of Byzantine intellectual life in its social, religious, and linguistic aspects. From this point of view historical and annalistic literature supplement each other; the former is aristocratic and secular, the latter ecclesiastical and monastic; the former is classical, the latter popular. The works of the historians belong to scholarly literature, those of the annalists (or chroniclers) to the literature of the people. The former are carefully elaborated, the latter give only raw material, the former confine themselves to the description of the present and the most recent past, and thus have rather the character of contemporary records; the latter cover the whole history of the world as known to the Middle Ages. The former are therefore the more valuable for political history; the latter for the history of civilization.

==== Historians ====

Classical literary tradition set the standard for Byzantine historians in their grasp of the aims of history, the manner of handling their subjects, and in style of composition. Their works are thoroughly concrete and objective in character, without passion, and even without enthusiasm. Ardent patriotism and personal convictions are rarely evident. They are diplomatic historians, expert in the use of historical sources and in the polished tact called for by their social position; they are not cIoset-scholars, ignorant of the world, but men who stood out in public life: jurists like [[Procopius]], [[Agathias]], [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]], [[Michael Attaliates]], statesmen like [[John Kinnamos|Joannes Cinnamus]], [[Nicetas Acominatus]], [[Georgius Pachymeres]], [[Laonicus Chalcondyles]]; generals and diplomats like [[Nicephorus Bryennius the Younger]], [[George Acropolites]], [[Georgius Phrantzes]]; and even crowned heads, like [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]], [[Anna Comnena]], [[John VI Cantacuzene]], and others. The Byzantine historians thus represent not only the social but also the intellectual flower of their time, resembling in this their Greek predecessors, [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]], [[Xenophon]], and [[Polybius]], who became their guides and models. Sometimes a Byzantine chooses a classic writer to imitate in method and style. The majority, however, took as models several authors, a custom which gave rise to a peculiar mosaic style, quite characteristic of the Byzantines. While often the result of a real community of feeling, it effectively prevented development of an individual style.

Had such a preëminent historian as Procopius modeled his work after Polybius rather than Thucydides, Byzantine histories may have followed a natural continuity in style and method with the Hellenic era. The Hellenistic "Atticists" however had impressed their tastes thoroughly on later centuries, celebrating the style of the Athenian golden age. It is no accident that military characters like Nicephorus Bryennius (11th and 12th centuries) and Joannes Cinnamus (12th century) emulated Xenophon in the precision of their diction, or that a philosopher like Nicephorus Gregoras (13th century) took [[Plato]] as his model. On the other hand, it is doubtless due to chance that writers trained in theology like [[Leo Diaconus]] and Georgius Pachymeres chose to emulate [[Homer]]ic turns. On the whole it is in the later historians that the dualism of Byzantine civilization—ecclesiastico-political matter in classical form—becomes most apparent.

While Byzantine historians were mostly dependent on foreign models, and seem to form a continuous series in which each succeeds the last, they do not blend into a uniform whole. Most of the historians come in either the period embracing the 6th and 7th centuries during the reigns of the East-Roman emperors, or that extending from the 11th to the 15th century under the [[Comneni]] and the [[Palaeologi]]. At its zenith under the [[Byzantine Empire#Golden era|Macedonian dynasty]] (the 9th and 10th centuries) the Byzantine world produced great heroes, but no great historians, excepting the solitary figure of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]].

The first period is dominated by Procopius because of his subject matter and his literary importance. Typically Byzantine, his ''[[Anekdota]]'' depreciates Emperor [[Justinian I]] as emphatically as his ''[[Peri Ktismaton]]'' apotheosizes him. In literature and history though, he follows classical models, as is evident in the precision and lucidity of his narrative acquired from Thucydides, and in the reliability of his information, qualities of special merit in the historian. Procopius and to a great degree his successor Agathias remain the models of descriptive style as late as the 11th century. Procopius is the first representative of the ornate Byzantine style in literature and in this is surpassed only by [[Theophylaktos Simokattes]] in the 7th century. Despite their unclassical form, however, they approach the ancients in their freedom from ecclesiastical and dogmatic tendencies.

Between the historical writings of the first period and those of the second, there is an isolated series of works which in matter and form offer a strong contrast to both the aforesaid groups. These are the works under the name of the Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] (10th century), dealing respectively with the administration of the empire, its political division, and the ceremonies of the Byzantine Court. They treat of the internal conditions of the empire, and the first and third are distinguished by their use of a popular tongue. The first is an important source of ethnological information, while the last is an interesting contribution to the history of civilization.

The second group of historians present a classical eclecticism veiling an unclassical partisanship and theological fanaticism. Revelling in classical forms, the historians of the period of the Comneni and Palaeologi were devoid of the classical spirit. While many had stronger, more sympathetic personalities than the school of Procopius, the very vigor of these individuals and their close ties to the imperial government served to hamper their objectivity, producing subjective, partisan works. Thus the "[[Alexiad]]", the pedantic work of Princess [[Anna Comnena]], glorifies her father [[Alexius I Comnenus|Alexius]] and the imperial reorganization he began; the historical work of her husband, Nicephorus Bryennius, describes the internal conflicts that accompanied the rise of the Comneni in the form of a family chronicle (late 11th century); John VI Cantacuzene self-complacently narrates his own achievements (14th century). This group exhibits striking antitheses both personal and objective. Beside Cinnamus, who honestly hated everything Western, stand the broad-minded [[Nicetas Acominatus]] (12th century) and the conciliatory but dignified [[Georgius Acropolites]] (13th century); beside the theological polemicist Pachymeres (13th century), stands the man of the world, Nicephorus Gregoras (14th century), well versed in philosophy and the classics. Though subjective in matters of internal Byzantine history, these and others of this period are trustworthy in their accounts of external events, and especially valuable as sources for the first appearance of the Slavs and Turks.

==== Chroniclers ====
[[Image:Musee du Moyen Age A09.JPG|thumb|right|A Byzantine [[Gospel]] of the 13th century, it shows the increasing trend towards the use of [[Ivory]] as an artistic tool.]]
Unlike the historical works, Byzantine chronicles were intended for the general public; hence the difference in their origin, development, and diffusion, as well as in their character, method, and style. While the roots of the chronicle have not yet been satisfactorily traced, their comparatively late appearance (6th century) and total remove from Hellenistic tradition places their origins as fairly recent. The chronicle literature is originally foreign to Greek civilization, the first of which was composed by uneducated Syrians. Its presumable prototype, the "Chronography" of [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], points to an Oriental Christian source. Unconnected with persons of distinction and out of touch with the great world, it follows models bound within its own narrow sphere. The 9th century saw the zenith of the Byzantine chronicle, during the nadir of historical literature. Afterwards it declines abruptly; the lesser chroniclers, seen as late as the 12th century, draw partly from contemporary and partly, though rarely, from earlier historians. In the Palaeologi period no chroniclers of note appear.

Not only important sources for the history of Byzantine civilization, the chronicles themselves contributed to the spread of civilization, passing Byzantine culture to the arriving Slavic, [[Hungarian people|Magyar]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Depicting as they did what lay within the popular consciousness—events wonderful and dreadful painted in glaring colours and interpreted in a Christian sense—their influence was considerable. The method of handling materials is primitive—beneath each section lies some older source only slightly modified, so that the whole resembles a patchwork of materials rather than the ingenious mosaic of the historians. They are a rich store for comparative linguistics, as their diction is purely the popular tongue, bespeaking the poor education of author and audience.

Representative Byzantine chronicles are the three of [[Joannes Malalas]], [[Theophanes Confessor]], and [[Joannes Zonaras]], respectively. The first is the earliest Christian Byzantine monastic chronicle, composed in the Antioch in the 6th century by a hellenized Syrian and [[Monophysite]] theologian. Originally a city chronicle, it was expanded into a world-chronicle. It is a popular historical work, full of historical and chronological errors, and the first monument of a purely popular Hellenistic civilization. The chief source for most of the later chroniclers as well as for a few church historians, it is also the earliest popular history translated into [[Old Church Slavonic]] (c. early 10th century). Superior in substance and form, and more properly historical, is the ''Chronicle'' of Theophanes, a 9th-century monk of Asia Minor, and in its turn a model for later chronicles. It contains much valuable information from lost sources, and its importance for the Western world is due to the fact that by the end of the 9th century it had to be translated into Latin. A third guide-post in the history of Byzantine chronicles is the 12th-century ''Universal Chronicle'' of [[Joannes Zonaras|Zonaras]]. It reflects somewhat the atmosphere of the Comneni renaissance; not only is the narrative better than that of Theophanes, but many passages from ancient writers are worked into the text. It was translated not only into Slavic and Latin, but into [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[French language|French]] as well (16th century).

=== Encyclopedists and essayists ===
[[Image:Suda.jpg|thumb|right|A page from a 16th-century edition of the vast Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]], the ''[[Suda]]''.]]
The spirit of antiquarian scholarship awoke in Byzantium earlier than in the West, but begun by lay theologians, not laymen. For this reason it always had a scholastic flavor; the Byzantine [[Humanism|humanistic]] spirit savored of antiquity and the Middle Ages in equal proportion. Primarily directed to the systematic collection and sifting of [[manuscript]]s, a pronounced interest in the literature of Greek antiquity first manifested at Constantinople in the late 9th century. With the 12th century begins the period of original works imitating antique models, a revival of the [[Alexandrian essay]] and [[rhetoric]]al literature, a number of writers showing vigorous originality. Quite isolated between the two periods stands [[Michael Psellus]] (11th century), a universal genius who bridges the periods. While the humanism of the 9th and 10th centuries retained a theological coloring and a hostile attitude towards the West, the 12th to the 14th century saw several writers seeking to break away from orthodox classicism to attain a true humanism, becoming the forerunners of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

The new spirit first found expression in an academy founded for classical studies at Constantinople in 863. About the same time the broadly trained and energetic [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]], patriarch of the city and the greatest statesman of the Greek Church (820-897), enthusiastically collected forgotten manuscripts, revived forgotten works of antiquity, and re-discovered lost works; his attention was chiefly directed to prose works, indicative of his pragmatism. Photius made selections or excerpts from all the works he discovered, forming the beginning of his celebrated ''Bibliotheca'' ("Library"), which while dry and schematic remains the most valuable literary compendium of the Middle Ages, containing trustworthy summaries of many ancient works now lost, together with good characterizations and analyses such as those of [[Lucian]] and [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]]. This encyclopedic activity was more assiduously pursued in the 10th century, particularly in the systematic collecting of materials associated with Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]]. Scholars also formed great compilations, arranged by subject, on the basis of older sources. Among these was a now-fragmentary encyclopedia of political science containing extracts from the classical, Alexandrian, and Roman Byzantine periods. These, with the collection of ancient epigrams known as the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and the scientific dictionary known as the ''[[Suda]]'', make the 10th century that of the encyclopedias.

A typical representative of the period appears in the following century in the person of the greatest encyclopedist of Byzantine literature, Michael Psellus. Standing between the Middle Ages and modern times, he is a jurist and a man of the world with a mind both receptive and productive. Unlike Photius, who was more concerned with individual philosophic arguments, Psellus does not undervalue the old philosophers, and is himself of a philosophic temperament. He was the first of his intellectual circle to raise the philosophy of Plato above that of Aristotle and to teach philosophy as a professor. Surpassing Photius in intellect and wit, he lacks that scholar's dignity and solidity of character. A restless brilliance characterized his life and literary activity. At first a lawyer, then a professor; now a monk, now a court official; he ended his career the prime minister. He was equally adroit and many-sided in his literary work; in harmony with the polished, pliant nature of the courtier is his elegant [[Platonism|Platonic]] style of his letters and speeches. His extensive correspondence furnishes endless material illustrating his personal and literary character. The ennobling influence of his Attic models mark his speeches and especially his funerary orations; that delivered on the death of his mother shows deep sensibility. Psellus had more of a poetic temperament than Photius, as several of his poems show, though they owe more to satirical fancy and occasion than to deep poetic feeling. Though Psellus exhibits more formal skill than creativity, his endowments shone forth in a time particularly backward in aesthetic culture. The intellectual freedom of the great scholars (''[[polyhistor]]es''), both ecclesiastical and secular, of the following centuries would be inconceivable without the triumph of Psellus over Byzantine [[scholasticism]].
[[Image:Horologe1.jpg|thumb|left|A Modern copy of a Byzantine [[Horologion]], showing the daily cycle of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].]]
While among his successors—such as [[Nicephorus Blemmydes]] and [[Hyrtakenos]]—are natures as corrupt as Psellus' own, the majority are marked by their rectitude of intention, sincerity of feeling, and their beneficently broad culture. Among these great intellects and strong characters of the 12th century several theologians are especially conspicuous, for example [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], [[Michael Italicus]], and [[Michael Acominatus]]; in the 13th and 14th centuries several secular scholars, like [[Maximus Planudes]], [[Theodore Metochites|Theodorus Metochites]], and above all, [[Nicephorus Gregoras]].

The three theologians may best be judged by their letters and minor occasional writings. Eustathius seems to be the most important, writing learned commentary on Homer and [[Pindar]] alongside original works that are candid, courageous, and controversial, intent upon the correction of every evil. In one of his works he attacks the corruption and intellectual stagnation of the monastic life of that day; in another polemic, he assails the hypocrisy and sham holiness of his time; in a third he denounces the conceit and arrogance of the Byzantine priests.

The rhetorician Michael Italicus, later a bishop, attacks the chief weakness of Byzantine literature, external imitation; this he did on receiving a work by a patriarch, which was simply a disorderly collection of fragments from other writers, so poorly put together that the sources were immediately recognizable.

The pupil and friend of Eustathius, Michael Acominatus (12th and 13th centuries) Archbishop of Athens and brother of the historian [[Nicetas Acominatus]]. His inaugural address, delivered on the Acropolis, exhibits both profound classical scholarship and high enthusiasm despite the material and spiritual decay of his times. These pitiful conditions moved him to compose an elegy, famous because unique, on the decay of Athens, a sort of poetical and antiquarian apostrophe to fallen greatness. [[Gregorovius]] compared the inaugural address with [[Gregory the Great]]'s to the Romans, and this with the lament of Bishop [[Hildebert of Tours]] on the demolition of Rome by the [[Normans]] (1106). His funeral orations over Eustathius (1195) and his brother Nicetas, though wordier and rhetorical, still evinced a noble disposition and deep feeling. Michael, like his brother, remained a fanatical opponent of the Latins. They had driven him into exile at [[Ceos]], whence he addressed many letters to his friends illustrating his character. Stylistically influenced by Eustathius, his otherwise classical diction sounded an ecclesiastical note.

With [[Theodore Metochites]] and [[Maximus Planudes|Maximos Planoudes]] we come to the universal scholars (polyhistores) of the time of the Palaeologi. The former displays his humanism in his use of hexameter, the latter in his knowledge of the Latin; both of which are otherwise unknown in Byzantium, and foreboding a broader grasp of antiquity. Both men show a fine sense of poetry, especially of nature poetry. Metochites composed meditations on the beauty of the sea; Planudes was the author of a long poetic idyll, a genre uncultivated by Byzantine scholars. While Metochites was a thinker and poet, Planudes was chiefly an imitator and compiler. Metochites was more speculative, as his collection of philosophical and historical miscellanies show; Planudes was more precise, as his preference for mathematics proves. Contemporary progress in philosophy was at a point where Metochites could openly attack Aristotle. He deals more frankly with political questions, such as his comparison of democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. While his breadth of interest was large, Metochites's culture rests wholly on a Greek basis, though Planudes, by his translations from the Latin ([[Cato the Elder|Cato]], [[Ovid]], [[Cicero]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], and [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]), vastly enlarged the Eastern intellectual horizon.

This inclination toward the West is most noticeable in Nicephorus Gregoras, the great pupil of Metochites. His project for a reform of the calendar ranks him among the modern intellects of his time, as will be proven if ever his numerous works in every domain of intellectual activity are brought to light. His letters, especially, promise a rich harvest. His method of exposition is based on that of Plato, whom he also imitated in his ecclesiastico-political discussions, e.g. in his dialogue "Florentius, or Concerning Wisdom." These disputations with [[Barlaam of Calabria|Barlaam]] dealt with the question of church union, in which Gregoras took the Unionist part. This brought him bitter hostility and the loss of his teaching living; he had been occupied chiefly with the exact sciences, whereby he had already earned the hatred of orthodox Byzantines.

While the Byzantine essayists and encyclopedists stood wholly under the influence of ancient rhetoric, still they embodied in the traditional forms their own characteristic knowledge, and thereby lent it a new charm.

=== Secular poetry ===
Poetry likewise had its prototypes, each genre tracing its origins to an ancient progenitor. Unlike the prose, these new genres do not follow from the classical Attic period, for the Byzantines wrote neither Iyrics nor dramas, imitating neither Pindar nor Sophocles. Imitating the literature of the Alexandrian period, they wrote romances, [[panegyric]]s, [[epigram]]s, [[satire]]s, and didactic and hortatory poetry, following the models of [[Heliodorus of Emesa|Heliodorus]] and [[Achilles Tatius]], [[Asclepiades of Samos|Asclepiades]] and [[Posidippus]], Lucian and [[Longus]]. Didactic poetry looks to an earlier prototype by [[Isocrates]]' ''Ad Demonicum''. The poetic temperament of the Byzantines is thus akin to that of the Alexandrian writers. Only one new type evolved independently by the Byzantines—the begging-poem. The six genres are not contemporaneous: the epigram and the panegyric developed first (6th and 7th centuries), then, at long intervals, satire, next didactic and begging poetry, finally the romance. Only after the 12th century, the period of decay, do they appear side by side. The epigram was the only form of secular poetry that had an independent revival in Byzantine literature, and this at the very time when ecclesiastical poetry also reached its highest perfection, in the 6th and 7th centuries. This age is therefore the most flourishing period of Byzantine scholarly poetry; its decline in the 12th century is contemporary with the rise of popular poetry. The chief kinds of poetry during the period of the decline (11th to 13th century) were satire and parody, didactic and hortatory poetry, the begging-poem, and the erotic romance. In form this literature is characterized by its extensive use of the popular forms of speech and verse, the latter being the "political" verse (Greek ἡμαξευμένοι στίχοι, called "that abominable make-believe of a metre" by [[Charles Peter Mason]] in [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]]'s ''Dictionary''), an iambic verse of fifteen syllables, still the standard verse of modern Greek popular poetry &lt;!-- as of 1913 --&gt;. In content, however, all this literature continues to bear the imprint of Byzantine erudition.

==== Epigram ====
The epigram suited the Byzantine taste for the ornamental and for intellectual ingenuity. It corresponded exactly to the concept of the minor arts that attained high development in the Byzantine period. Making no lofty demands on the imagination of the author, its chief difficulty lay rather in technique and the attainment of the utmost possible pregnancy of phrase. Two groups may be distinguished among the Byzantine epigrammatists: one pagan and humanistic, the other Christian. The former is represented chiefly by [[Agathias]] (6th century) and [[Christophorus of Mitylene]] (11th century), the latter by the ecclesiastics [[Georgius Pisides]] (7th century) and [[Theodorus Studites]] (9th century). Between the two groups, in point of time as well as in character, stands [[Joannes Geometres]] (10th century).

The chief phases in the development of the Byzantine epigram are most evident in the works of these three. Agathias, who has already been mentioned among the historians, as an epigrammatist, has the peculiarities of the school of the semi-Byzantine Egyptian [[Nonnus]] (about AD 400). He wrote in an affected and turgid style, in the classical form of the [[hexameter]]; he abounds, however, in brilliant ideas, and in his skillful imitation of the ancients, particularly in his erotic pieces, he surpasses most of the epigrammatists of the imperial period. Agathias also prepared a collection of epigrams, partly his own and partly by other writers, some of which afterwards passed into the ''[[Anthologia Palatina]]'' and have thus been preserved. The abbot Theodorus Studites is in every respect the opposite of Agathias, a pious man of deep earnestness, with a fine power of observation in nature and life, full of sentiment, warmth, and simplicity of expression, free from servile imitation of the ancients, though influenced by Nonnus. While touching on the most varied things and situations, his epigrams on the life and personnel of his monastery offer special interest for the history of civilization. Joannes Geometres combines aspects of the previous two. During the course of his life he filled both secular and ecclesiastical offices and his poetry had a universal character; of a deeply religious temper, still he appreciated the greatness of the ancient Greeks. Alongside epigrams on ancient poets, philosophers, rhetoricians, and historians stand others on famous Church Fathers, poets, and saints. Poetically, the epigrams on contemporary and secular topics are superior to those on religious and classic subjects. His best works depict historical events and situations he himself experienced, and reflect his own spiritual moods (Krumbacher).
[[File:Porphyrogenetus.jpg|right|thumb|The Scholar Emperor [[Constantine VII]], being crowned by Christ.]]

==== Panegyrics ====
Even the best writers often could not escape composing the official panegyrics on emperors and their achievements. Typical of this kind of literature are the commemorative poem of [[Paulus Silentiarius]] on the dedication of the [[Hagia Sophia|church of St. Sophia]], and that of [[Georgius Pisides]] on the glory of the prince. Unfavorable conclusions must not be drawn as to the character of these poets, for such eulogies were composed by not only courtiers like Psellus and [[Manuel Holobolos]] (13th century), but also by independent characters like Eustathius and Michael Acominatus. It had become traditional, and so handed down from imperial Rome to Byzantium as a part of ancient rhetoric with all the extravagance of a thoroughly decadent literature (F. Gregorovius). It was a sort of necessary concession to despotism; popular taste was not in general offended by it.

==== Satires ====
The father of Byzantine satire is [[Lucian]]. His celebrated "Dialogues of the Dead" furnished the model for two works, one of which, the "[[Timarion]]" (12th century) is marked by more rude humour, the other, "[[Mazaris]]" (15th century), by keen satire. Each describes a journey to the underworld and conversations with dead contemporaries; in the former their defects are lashed with good-natured raillery; in the latter, under the masks of dead men, living persons and contemporary conditions, especially at the Byzantine Court, are sharply stigmatized. The former is more a literary satire, the latter a political pamphlet, with keen personal thrusts and without literary value, but with all the greater interest for the history of civilization; the former is in a genuinely popular tone, the latter in vulgar and crude [Cf. [[Henry Fanshawe Tozer|Tozer]] in ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' (1881), II.233-270; [[Krumbacher]], op. cit., 198-211.]

Two popular offshoots of the "Timarion", the "Apokopos" and the "Piccatoros" are discussed below. Another group of satires takes the form of dialogues between animals, manifestly a development from the Christian popular book known as the ''[[Physiologus]]''. Such satires describe assemblages of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes, and recite their [[parody|lampoon]]ing remarks upon the clergy, the bureaucracy, the foreign nations in the Byzantine Empire, etc. See also ''[[An Entertaining Tale of Quadrupeds]]''

Here belong also the parodies in the form of church poems, and in which the clergy themselves took part, e.g. Bishop [[Nicetas of Serræ]] (11th century). One example of this sacrilegious literature, though not fully understood, is the "Mockery of a Beardless Man," in the form of an obscene [[liturgy]] (14th century).

==== Didactic ====
Didactic poetry found its model in the "To Demonikos" ascribed to Isocrates. The greatest example of this type of literature in Byzantium is the "Spaneas" (12th century), a hortatory poem addressed by an emperor to his nephew, a sort of "[[Mirror for Princes]]". Some few offshoots from this are found in the popular literature of Crete in the 15th and 16th centuries, handed down under the names of [[Stephanos Sahlikis|Sahlikis]] and Depharanus. Here also belong the ranting theological exhortations resembling those of the Capuchin in [[Schiller]]'s "Wallenstein". Such, for instance, are that of Geogillas after the great plague of Rhodes (1498) and the oracular prophecies on the end of the Byzantine empire current under the name of [[Leo VI the Wise|Emperor Leo]] (886-911). (Krumbacher, 332, 336, 343, 352, 366.) &lt;!-- Huh? --&gt;

==== Begging-poem ====
A late Byzantine variety of the laudatory poem is the begging-poem, the poetical lament of hungry authors and the parasites of the court. Its chief representatives are [[Theodorus Prodromus]] and the grossly flattering [[Manuel Philes]], the former of whom lived under the Comneni (12th century), the latter under the Palaeologi (13th century). For historians such poetical wails of distress as Prodromus addressed to the emperor are of value because they give interesting pictures of street and business life in the capital. (Cf. Krumbacher, 324, 333.)

====Romance novel====
{{main article|Byzantine novel}}
The ancient Greek novel was imitated by four writers of the 12th century: [[Eustathios Makrembolites]], [[Theodore Prodromos]], [[Niketas Eugenianos]], and [[Constantine Manasses]].

=== Ecclesiastical and theological literature ===
The first flowering of ecclesiastical literature of Byzantium is Hellenistic in form and Oriental in spirit. This period falls in the 4th century and is closely associated with the names of the Greek Fathers of Alexandria, Palestine, Jerusalem, Cyrene, and [[Cappadocia]]. Their works, which cover the whole field of ecclesiastical prose literature—dogma, [[exegesis]], and [[homiletics]]—became canonical for the whole Byzantine period; the last important work is the ecclesiastical history of [[Evagrius Scholasticus|Evagrius]]. Beyond controversial writings against sectarians and the [[iconoclasm|Iconoclasts]], later works consist merely of compilations and commentaries, in the form of the so-called ''Catenae''; even the ''Fountain of Knowledge'' of [[John of Damascus]] (8th century), the fundamental manual of Greek theology, though systematically worked out by a learned and keen intellect, is merely a gigantic collection of materials. Even the homily clings to a pseudo-classical, rhetorical foundation, and tends more to external breadth, not to inwardness and depth.

Only three kinds of ecclesiastical literature, which were as yet undeveloped in the 4th century, exhibit later an independent growth. These were the ecclesiastical poetry of the 6th century, popular lives of the saints of the 7th, and the mystic writings of the 11th and 12th centuries. The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' suggests that classical forms were insufficient to express Christian thought to best effect: in several collections of early Christian correspondence it is not the rhythmic laws of Greek rhetorical style which govern the composition, but those of Semitic and Syriac prose. [[Cardinal Pitra]] hypothesizes that the rhythmic poetry of the Byzantines originates in the Jewish Psalms of the Septuagint. This rhythmic principle accords with the linguistic character of the later Greek, which used a stress accent as it had already been developed in Syriac poetry rather than the classical tonal accent.

[[Romanos the Melodist]] was the first great ecclesiastical poet of the Greeks to fully embrace the stress accent as a rhythmic principle. A contemporary and countryman of the chronicler Malalas, also a reformer of the Greek literary language, Romanos was a Syrian of Jewish descent, Christianized at an early age. What Malalas is to prose, Romanos is to the Christian poetry of the Greek Middle Ages. Though he did not go so far as Malalas, he released poetry from meters based on quantitative and tonal scansion; he brought it into harmony with the latest poetics prevailing in Syria as well as with the evolving character of the Greek language. Romanos soon went to Constantinople, where he became a deacon of the [[Hagia Sophia]], and where he is said to have first developed his gift for hymn-writing.

[[Image:RossanoGospelsFolio007vGoodSamaritan.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] from the Rossano Gospels, believed to be the oldest surviving illustrated New Testament.]]

Romanos borrowed the form of his poems, the material, and many of their themes partly from the Bible and partly from the (metrical) homilies of the Syrian Father [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] (4th century). He wrote hymns on the Passion of the Lord, on the betrayal by Judas, Peter's denial, Mary before the Cross, the Ascension, the Ten Virgins, and the Last Judgment, while his Old Testament themes mention the history of Joseph and the three young men in the fiery furnace. He is said to have composed about a thousand hymns, of which only eighty have survived, evidently because in the 9th century the so-called ''canones'', linguistically and metrically more artistic in form, replaced much of his work in the Greek Liturgy. Thenceforth his hymns held their own in only a few of the remoter monasteries. Characteristic of his technique is the great length of his hymns, which are regularly composed of from twenty to thirty stanzas (τροπαρια) of from twelve to twenty-one verses each, very finely wrought and varied in metrical structure, and in construction transparent and diverse. They do not resemble contemporary Latin hymns so much as the oratorios of the early 20th century, also using antiphonal rendering by alternative choirs. This also explains the dramatic character of many hymns, with their inserted dialogues and choric songs, as in "Peter's Denial", a little drama of human boastfulness and weakness, and the last part of the "History of Joseph", the "Psalm of the Apostles", and the "Birth of Jesus". Other pieces, like the hymn on the [[Last Judgment]], are purely descriptive in character, though even in them the rhetorical and dogmatic elements seriously impair the artistic effect.

Some, like Bouvy and Krumbacher, place him among the greatest hymn-writers of all times; others, like Cardinal Pitra, are more conservative. For a final judgment a complete edition of the hymns is needed. Compared to Latin church poets such as Ambrose and Prudentius, his surviving works tend towards a more rhetorically flowery, digressive, and dogmatic verse. He is fond of symbolic pictures and figures of speech, antitheses, assonances, especially witty ''jeux d'esprit'', which contrast with his characteristic simplicity of diction and construction. These embellishments interrupt the smooth flow of his lines, and often the sequence of thought in his hymns is clouded by the dragging in of dogmatic questions—in the celebrated Christmas hymn the question of the miraculous birth of Jesus is discussed four times, with a comfortable amplitude that betrays the theologian thrusting the poet aside. The theologian is also too evident in his allusions to the Old Testament when dealing with New Testament incidents; Mary at the birth of Jesus compares her destiny to that of Sarah, the Magi liken the star that went before the Israelites in the wilderness, and so on. The frequent citation of passages from the prophets seem more like unimpassioned paraphrases than like inspired poetry. In fact Romanos does not possess the abundant and highly coloured imagery of the earliest Greek church poets, nor their fine grasp of nature. The reader also gathers the impression that the height of the poet's imagination is not in proportion with the depth of his piety—there often appears in him something naive, almost homely, as when Mary expresses her pleasure in the Magi and calls attention to their utility for the impending Flight into Egypt. There are passages, however, in which devout fervor carries the imagination along with it and elevates the poetic tone, as in the jubilant invitation to the dance (in the Easter-song), in which thoughts of spring and of the Resurrection are harmoniously blended:

:Why thus faint-hearted?
:Why veil ye your faces?
:Lift up your hearts!
:Christ is arisen!
:Join in the dances,
:And with us proclaim it:
:The Lord is ascended,
:Gleaming and gloried,
:He who was born
:Of the giver of light.
:Cease then your mourning,
:Rejoice in blessedness:
:Springtime has come.
:So bloom now, ye lilies,
:Bloom and be fruitful!
:Naught bringeth destruction.
:Clap we our hands
:And shout: Risen is He
:Who helpeth the fallen ones
:To rise again.

Ecclesiastical poetry did not long remain on the high level to which Romanos had raised it. The "Hymnus Acathistus" (of unknown authorship) of the 7th century, a sort of [[Te Deum]] in praise of the Mother of God, is the last great monument of Greek church poetry, comparable to the hymns of Romanos, which it has even outlived in fame. It has had numerous imitators and as late as the 17th century was translated into Latin.

The rapid decline of Greek hymnology begins as early as the 7th century, the period of [[Andrew of Crete]]. Religious sentiments in hymns were choked by a classical formalism which stifled all vitality. The overvaluation of technique in details destroyed the sense of proportion in the whole. This seems to be the only explanation for the so-called canones first found in the collection of Andrew of Crete. While a canon is a combination of a number of hymns or chants (generally nine) of three or four strophes each, the "Great Canon" of Andrew actually numbers 250 strophes, a "single idea is spun out into serpentine arabesques".

Pseudo-classical artificiality found an even more advanced representative in [[John of Damascus]], in the opinion of the Byzantines the foremost writer of canones, who took as a model [[Gregory of Nazianzus]], even reintroducing the principle of quantity into ecclesiastical poetry. Religious poetry was in this way reduced to mere trifling, for in the 11th century, which witnessed the decline of Greek hymnology and the revival of pagan humanism, Michael Psellus began parodying church hymns, a practice that took root in popular culture. Didactic poems took this form without being regarded as blasphemous.

Religious drama did not thrive in the Byzantine era. The only example is the ''Suffering of Christ'' (''Christus Patiens'', ''Χριστὸς пάσχων ''), written in the 11th or 12th century; of its 2,640 verses, about one-third are borrowed from ancient dramas, chiefly from those of [[Euripides]], and Mary, the chief character, sometimes recites verses from the "Medea" of Euripides, again from the "Electra" of [[Sophocles]], or the "Prometheus" of [[Aeschylus]]. The composition is evidently the production of a theologian trained in the classics, but without the slightest idea of dramatic art. It is made up chiefly of lamentations and reports of messengers. Even the most effective scenes, those which precede the Crucifixion, are described by messengers; almost two-thirds of the text are given to the descent from the Cross, the lament of Mary, and the apparition of Christ. (Cf. Van Cleef, "The Pseudo-Gregorian Drama ''Christos paschon'' in its relation to the text of Euripides" in ''Transactions of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences'', VIII, 363-378; Krumbacher, 312.)

Between ecclesiastical poetry and ecclesiastical prose stands the theologico-didactic poem, a favorite species of ancient Christian literature. One of its best examples is the "Hexaemeron" of Georgius Pisides, a spirited hymn on the universe and its marvels, i.e. all living creatures. Taken as a whole, it is somewhat conventional; only the description of the minor forms of life, especially of the animals, reveals the skill of the epigrammatist and nature-lover's gift of affectionate observation.

Besides sacred poetry, [[hagiography]] flourished from the 6th to the 11th century. This species of literature developed from the old [[Martyrology|martyrologies]], and became the favorite form of popular literature. It flourished from the 8th to the 11th century, and was concerned principally with monastic life. Unfortunately, the rhetorical language was in violent contrast with the simple nature of the contents, so that the chief value of this literature is historical.

More popular in style are the biographers of saints of the 6th and 7th centuries. The oldest and most important of them is [[Cyril of Scythopolis]] (in Palestine), whose biographies of saints and monks are distinguished for the reliability of their facts and dates. Of great interest also for their contributions to the history of culture and of ethics and for their genuinely popular language are the writings of Leontius, Archbishop of Cyprus (7th century), especially his life of the Patriarch John (surnamed The Merciful), Eleemosynarius of Alexandria. (Cf. [[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Kleine Schriften'', Leipzig, 1907.) This life describes for us a man who in spite of his peculiarities honestly tried "to realize a pure Biblical Christianity of self-sacrificing love", and whose life brings before us the customs and ideas of the lower classes of the people of Alexandria.

The romance of Balaam and Joasaph (also [[Barlaam and Josaphat]]) was another popular work of Byzantine origin now elevated to universal literature. It is the "Song of Songs" of Christian asceticism, illustrated by the experience of the Indian prince Joasaph, who is led by the hermit Barlaam to abandon the joys of life, and as a true Christian to renounce the world. The material of the story is originally Indian, indeed [[Buddhism|Buddhistic]], for the origin of Joasaph was [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The Greek version originated in the Sabbas monastery in Palestine about the middle of the 7th century. It did not circulate widely until the 11th century, when it became known to all Western Europe through the medium of a Latin translation [Cf. [[F. C. Conybeare]], "The Barlaam and Josaphat legend," in ''Folk-lore'' (1896), VII, 101 sqq.]

The ascetic conception of life was embedded in the Byzantine character and was strengthened by the high development of monastic institutions. The latter in turn brought forth a broad ascetic literature, though it does not further deepen the asceticism of its great exponent, St. [[Basil of Caesarea]].

Less extensively cultivated, but excelling in quality, are Byzantine mystical writings. The true founder of a distinctively ''Byzantine'' [[mysticism]] was [[Maximus the Confessor]] (7th century), who deepened the tradition of Christian Neoplatonism, as found in the Pseudo-Dionysius, with the resources of Orthodox Christology. No other writer in Eastern Christian tradition surpasses Maximus in speculative range and originality. Later representatives of this mystical tradition were [[Symeon the New Theologian]] and [[Nicetas Stethatos]] in the 11th, and [[Nikolaos Kavasilas]] in the 14th century. The Byzantine mystical writers differ from those of Western Europe chiefly in their attitude to ecclesiastical ceremonies, to which they adhered implicitly, seeing in it a profound symbol of the spiritual life of the church, where Occidentals see an attempt to displace the inner life with external pomp. Accordingly, Symeon strictly observed the ceremonial rules of the church, regarding them, however, only as a means to the attainment of ethical perfection. His principal work (published only in Latin) is a collection of prose pieces and hymns on communion with God. He is akin to the chief [[German mystic]]s in his tendency towards pantheism. Of Symeon's equally distinguished pupil, Nicetas Stethatos, we need only say that he cast off his teacher's [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies. The last great mystic Kavasilas, Archbishop of Saloniki, revived the teaching of [[Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite]], but in the plan of his principal work, "Life in Christ", exhibits a complete independence of all other worlds and is without a parallel in Byzantine asceticism.

=== Popular poetry ===
The [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|capture of Constantinople]] and establishment of the [[Latinokratia|Latin kingdoms]] in the year 1204 displaced or supplanted aristocratic and ecclesiastic controls on literary taste and style. In response to new influences from the [[Greek East and Latin West|Latin West]], Byzantine popular literature moved in different directions. Whereas literary poetry springs from the rationalistic, classical atmosphere of the Hellenistic period, popular poetry, or folk-song, is an outgrowth of the idyllic, romantic literature of the same period. As the literary works had their prototypes in Lucian, Heliodorus, Achilles Tatius, and Nonnus, the popular works imitated [[Apollonius of Rhodes]], [[Callimachus]], [[Theocritus]], and [[Musaeus of Athens|Musaeus]].

The chief characteristic of folk-song throughout the Greek Middle Ages is its lyric note, which constantly finds expression in emotional turns. In Byzantine literature, on the other hand, the refinement of erotic poetry was due to the influence of the love-poetry of [[chivalry]] introduced by Frankish knights in the 13th century and later. The Byzantines imitated and adapted the romantic and legendary materials these westerners brought. Italian influences led to the revival of the drama. That celebration of the achievements of Greek heroes in popular literature was the result of the conflicts which the Greeks sustained during the Middle Ages with the border nations to the east of the empire. Popular books relating the deeds of ancient heroes had long-standing and widespread currency throughout the East; these too revived heroic poetry, though imparted with a deep romantic tinge. The result was a complete upheaval of popular ideals and a broadening of the popular horizon as Atticist tendencies were gradually eroded.

There was, consequently, a complete reconstruction of the literary types of Byzantium. Of all the varieties of artistic poetry there survived only the romance, though this became more serious in its aims, and its province expanded. Of metrical forms there remained only the political (fifteen-syllable) verse. From these simple materials there sprang forth an abundance of new poetic types. Alongside of the narrative romance of heroism and love there sprang up popular love lyrics, and even the beginnings of the modern drama.
[[Image:Troodos mountains.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Troodos Mountains]], from which [[Digenis Akritas]] used to jump to [[Asia Minor]] in the epic poem]]
The only genuine heroic epic of the Byzantines is the ''[[Digenis Akritas]]'', a popular poetic crystallization of the 10th- and 11th-century conflicts between the Byzantine wardens of the [[marches]] (ακρίτης, [[akrites]]) and the [[Saracens]] in Eastern Asia Minor. The nucleus of this epic goes back to the 12th or 13th century, its final literary form to the 15th. Though the [[schoolmen]] edited the original poems beyond recognition, an approximate idea of the original poem may be gathered from the numerous echoes of it extant in popular poetry. The existing versions exhibit a blending of several cycles, modeled after the Homeric poems. Its principal subjects are love, adventures, battles, and a patriarchal, idyllic enjoyment of life; it is a mixture of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', the majority of the material being drawn from the latter, suffused with a Christian atmosphere. Genuine piety and a strong family feeling combine with an intimate sympathy with nature. Artistically, the work lacks the dramatic quality and diverse characters of the Germanic and classical Greek epics; it must be compared with the Slavic and Oriental heroic songs, among which it properly belongs.

The love-romance of the Greek Middle Ages is the result of the fusion of the sophistical Alexandro-Byzantine romance and the medieval French popular romance, on the basis of a Hellenistic view of life and nature. This is proved by its three chief creations, composed in the 13th and 14th centuries. ''[[Kallimachos and Chrysorrhoe]]'', ''[[Belthandros and Chrysantza]]'', ''[[Lybistros and Rhodamne]]''. While the first and the last of these are markedly influenced by Byzantine romance in thought and manner of treatment, the second begins to show the aesthetic and ethical influence of the Old-French romance; indeed, its story often recalls the [[Tristan]] legend. The style is clearer and more transparent, the action more dramatic, than in the extant versions of the Digenis legend. The ethical idea is the romantic idea of knighthood—the winning of the loved one by valour and daring, not by blind chance as in the Byzantine literary romances. Along with these independent adaptations of French material, are direct translations from "Flore et Blanchefleur", "Pierre et Maguelonne", and others, which have passed into the domain of universal literature.

To the period of [[Frangokratia|Frankish conquest]] belongs also the metrical ''[[Chronicle of the Morea]]'' (14th century). It was composed by a Frank brought up in Greece, though a foe of the Greeks. Its object was, amid the constantly progressing hellenization of the Western conquerors, to remind them of the spirit of their ancestors. Therefore, it is only Greek in language; in literary form and spirit it is wholly Frankish. The author "describes minutely the feudal customs which had been transplanted to the soil of Greece, and this perhaps is his chief merit; the deliberations of the High Court are given with the greatest accuracy, and he is quite familiar with the practice of feudal law" (J. Schmitt). As early as the 14th century the Chronicle was translated into Spanish and in the 15th into French and Italian.

About the same time and in the same locality the small islands off the coast of Asia Minor, appeared the earliest collection of neo-Greek love songs, known as the "''Rhodian Love-Songs''". Besides songs of various sorts and origins, they contain a complete romance, told in the form of a play on numbers, a youth being obliged to compose a hundred verses in honor of the maiden whom he worships before she returns his love, each verse corresponding to the numbers one to one hundred.

Between the days of the French influence in the 13th and 14th centuries and those of Italian in the 16th and 17th, there was a short romantic and popular revival of the ancient legendary material. There was neither much need nor much appreciation for this revival, and few of the ancient heroes and their heroic deeds are adequately treated. The best of these works is the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', based on the story of [[Alexander the Great]], a revised version of the [[Pseudo-Callisthenes]] of the Ptolemaic period, which is also the source of the western versions of the ''Alexander Romance''. The ''[[Achilleis byzantina|Achilleis]]'', on the other hand, though written in the popular verse and not without taste, is wholly devoid of antique local colour, and is rather a romance of French chivalry than a history of Achilles. Lastly, of two compositions on the [[Trojan War]], one is wholly crude and barbarous, the other, though better, is a literal translation of the old French poem of [[Benoît de Sainte-More]].

To these products of the 14th century may be added two of the 16th, both describing a descent into the lower world, evidently popular offshoots of the Timarion and Mazaris already mentioned. To the former corresponds the ''Apokopos'', a satire of the dead on the living; to the latter the ''Piccatores'', a metrical piece decidedly lengthy but rather unpoetic, while the former has many poetical passages (e.g. the procession of the dead) and betrays the influence of Italian literature. In fact [[Italian literature]] impressed its popular character on the Greek popular poetry of the 16th and 17th centuries, as [[French literature]] had done in the 13th and 14th.

==== Cretan popular poetry ====
As a rich popular poetry sprang up during the last-mentioned period on the islands off the coast of Asia Minor, so now a similar literature developed on the island of [[Crete]]. Its most important creations are the romantic epic ''[[Erotokritos]]'' and the dramas ''[[Erophile]]'' and ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' with a few minor pictures of customs and manners. These works fall chronologically outside the limits of Byzantine literature; nevertheless, as a necessary complement and continuation of the preceding period, they should be discussed here.

The ''Erotokritos'' is a long romantic poem of chivalry, lyric in characters and didactic in purpose, the work of [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]], a hellenized Venetian of the 16th century. It abounds in themes and ideas drawn from the folk-poetry of the time. In the story of Erotokritos and Arethusa the poet glorifies love and friendship, chivalric courage, constancy, and self-sacrifice. Although foreign influences do not obtrude themselves, and the poem, as a whole, has a national Greek flavour, it reveals the various cultural elements, Byzantine, Romance, and Oriental, without giving, however, the character of a composite.

The lyrical love tragedy ''Erophile'' is more of a mosaic, being a combination of two Italian tragedies, with the addition of lyrical intermezzos from [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'', and choral songs from his ''Aminta''. Nevertheless, the materials are handled with independence, and more harmoniously arranged than in the original; the father who has killed his daughter's lover is slain not by his daughter's hand, but by the ladies of his palace, thus giving a less offensive impression. Owing to the lyric undertone of the works some parts of it have survived in popular tradition until the present time.

The [[mystery play]] of ''The Sacrifice of Abraham'' is a little psychological masterpiece, apparently an independent work. The familiar and trite Biblical incidents are reset in the patriarchal environment of Greek family life. The poet emphasizes the mental struggles of Sarah, the resignation of Abraham to the Divine will, the anxious forebodings of Isaac, and the affectionate sympathy of the servants, in other words, a psychological analysis of the characters. The mainspring of the action is Sarah's fore-knowledge of what is to happen, evidently the invention of the poet to display the power of maternal love. The diction is distinguished by high poetic beauty and by a thorough mastery of versification.

Other products of Cretan literature are a few adaptations of Italian pastorals, a few erotic and idyllic poems, like the so-called "''Seduction Tale''" (an echo of the Rhodian Love-Songs), and the lovely, but ultra-sentimental, pastoral idyll of the ''Beautiful Shepherdess''.

== The legacy of Byzantine literature ==
The Roman supremacy in governmental life did not disappear. The subjection of the Church to the power of the State led to a governmental ecclesiasticism, causing friction with [[Roman Catholic Church]], which had remained relatively independent.

Greek eventually overtook [[Latin]] as the [[official language]] of the government, the "Novellae" of [[Justinian I]] being the last Latin monument. As early as the 7th century [[Greek language]] had made great progress, and by the 11th Greek was supreme, though it never supplanted the numerous other languages of the empire.

The Eastern Roman Empire divided European civilization into two parts: one [[Romance languages|Romance]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]], the other Greek and [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]]. These cultures differed ethnographically, linguistically, ecclesiastically, and historically. Imperial [[Russia]], the [[Balkans]], and [[Ottoman Empire]] were the direct heirs of Byzantine civilization; the first two particularly in ecclesiastical, political, and cultural respects (through the translation and adaptation of sacred, historical, and popular literature); the third in respect to civil government.

Indirectly, the Empire protected western Europe for centuries from war, fighting off various invaders and migratory populations. Byzantium was also a treasury of ancient Greek literature. During the Middle Ages, until the capture of the Constantinople, the West was acquainted only with Roman literature. Greek antiquity was first carried to Italy by the treasures brought by fugitive Greek humanists, many of whom were delegates at the [[Council of Florence]] from 1431 to 1449.

Byzantine culture had a direct influence upon southern and central Europe in church music and church poetry, though this was only in the very early period (until the 7th century).

Byzantine culture had a definite impact upon the Near East, especially upon the [[Persian people|Persians]], and the [[Arabs]].

There is no comprehensive history of Byzantine literature written in English, although the [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] provides excellent coverage of individual authors and topics. The chapters of Horrocks that cover the medieval period are useful for the "language question." The ''History'' of Kazhdan covers only the early period. Beaton and Lauxtermann are useful on "low" and "high" verse, respectively.

The study of Byzantine literature as a self-sufficient discipline originated in the German-speaking world, and the most important general surveys are written in this language. Beck and Hunger remain the standard works on theological and secular literature, respectively, although Krumbacher and Moravcsik are still valuable. Rosenqvist is a recent and useful introduction to the subject.

'''Colombian [[folklore]]''' are beliefs, customs and [[Culture of Colombia|cultural traditions]] in [[Colombia]].

==Cultural influences==
[[Colombia]] has traditional [[Folklore|folk tale]]s and stories about [[legendary creatures]], which are transmitted orally and passed on to new [[generation]]s. Some of them are common with other [[Latin American]] countries. The Colombian folklore has strong influences from [[Spanish culture]], with elements of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American cultures]].

==Relevancy==
These folkloric entities are present in [[Festivals in Colombia|carnivals and festivals]] countrywide.  The “Desfiles de Mitos y Leyendas” ([[parade]]s of [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s) are an important part of these events in most of the Colombian cities and municipalities.  Examples of these parades are the [[Barranquilla Carnival]], [[Cali Fair]] and [[Festival of the Flowers]], where the legendary creatures parade takes place in [[Medellín]]'s Pueblito Paisa, at the top of [[Nutibara hill]]. Legendary creatures have also been accepted into many facets of [[popular culture]] and the [[collective memory]].  There are those who believe in their existence, claiming to have heard or even encountered them.

==Legendary figures==
[[File:Illustration Lonicera caprifolium0.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Lonicera]] plant is associated to the spirit of Madremonte]]
*The [[Tunda]] (La Tunda) is a myth of the [[Pacific Region of Colombia]], and particularly popular in the [[Afro-Colombian]] community, about a [[vampire]]-like [[doppelganger]] monster woman
*The [[Patasola]] or "one foot" is one of many myths in [[Latin American folklore]] about woman monsters from the jungle.
*The Boraro (The Pale Ones),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mythicalcreatureslist.com/mythical-creature/Boraro&lt;/ref&gt; is a more monstrous version of The [[Curupira]] from [[Brazilian Folklore]] in the mythology of the [[Tucano people]]. Much like the "Curupira" it has backwards facing feet to confuse it's foes and is a protector of wildlife. Beyond its feet however, it is far more grotesque in appearance. It is very tall to the extent it is tree sized, pale skinned but covered in black fur, has large forward facing ears, fangs and huge pendulous genitals. It has no joints in its knees, so if it falls down it has great trouble getting up. It uses two main ways to kills its victims, first its urine is a lethal poison .&lt;ref&gt;′′The Rainbow Serpent: AChromatic Piece′′-Ira R Buchler (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, if it catches a victim in its embrace it will crush them without breaking skin or bones, until their flesh is pulp. Then it drinks the pulp through a small hole made in the victims head, after which the victims empty skin is inflated like a balloon and are then sent home in a daze, where they subsequently die. It can be placated by tobacco, but to escape it one can either place their hands in its footprints which will cause its legs to stiffen and temporarily fell the monster, or alternatively run backwards while facing it, which confuses the monster.&lt;ref&gt;′′Latin American myths and legends′′-Javier Ocampo Lopez (2006), p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Mohan (legendary)|Moan]] is a forest and river creature that protects the forests, steals women and disturbs fishing and hunting activities.
*The [[Llorona]] or the Weeping Woman is the [[ghost]] of a woman crying for her dead children that she drowned. Her appearances are sometimes held to presage [[death]].
*The Madremonte (Mother of the forest) or [[Marimonda]] is usually regarded as protective of nature and the [[forest]] animals and unforgiving when humans enter their domains to alter or destroy them. She can be identified with [[Mother Nature]] and [[Mistress of the Animals]].
*The Hombre Caiman, or Alligatorman, is a legendary creature that possesses both [[Alligator]] and human features. This South American folk tale is particularly popular in [[Plato, Magdalena]], especially in rural and less populated areas.  He is said to have been a [[fisherman]] converted by the spirit of the [[Magdalena river]] into an alligator, that returns every year on [[St. Sebastian]]´s day to hunt human victims, much like the [[werewolf]].
[[File:Inia.png|thumb|200px|1883 drawing of [[Boto]]. The [[Amazon river dolphin|pink dolphin]] is feared by the indigenous people as a mischievous spirit of water]]
*The Mohana (La Mojana) Mother of water or [[Mami Wata]] is a [[shapeshifting]] [[water]] spirit who usually appear in human form to seduce and take away the humans.  In the [[Amazon basin]] this features are applied to the [[Amazon river dolphin|Pink dolphin]]s representing the spirit of [[Amazon river]]. The discography of [[Music of Colombia#Traditional music|Colombian folkloric singer]] [[Totó la Momposina]] includes works about the Mohana.
*The evil chicken ("pollo maligno") is an [[evil spirit]] of the forest in the form of a bird that haunts the [[hunter]]s, attracting them to the deepest forest in order to devour them.
*The Candileja is said to be the spirit of a vicious old woman, who was in charge of her grandchildren but neglected to teach them any moral principles, so they grew up as murderers and thieves. In the [[afterlife]] she was damned to travel around the world surrounded by flames. It is related to the [[Will-o'-the-wisp]] phenomenon.
*The dark [[mule]] or Mula Retinta is an evil spirit that appears before [[arriero]]s as a [[pack animal]], causing violent winds and storms that make people fall off the precipices at the side of the pathways.
*The Viruñas or Mandingas (the Evil One), is considered a representation of [[Satan]], and appears as a handsome man who steals the souls of the people.

'''Colour Me Wednesday''' is an [[indie pop]]/[[pop punk]] band from [[West London (sub region)|West London]], [[UK]], built around sisters Jen Doveton and Harriet Doveton. The band are noted for their melodic guitar [[pop music|pop]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upsetmagazine.com/read/listen-to-colour-me-wednesdays-brilliant-anyone-and-everyone-ep/&lt;/ref&gt; politicised lyrics and [[DIY culture|DIY]] punk method, including producing their own recordings, artwork and promotional videos.&lt;ref name="tga1"&gt;[http://www.thegirlsare.com/2012/02/19/reviewcolour-me-wedneday/ "Colour Me Wednesday live review/Odd Box Records showcase"]. 19 February 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.killyourstereo.com/reviews/1024255/colour-me-wednesday-i-thought-it-was-morning "Colour Me Wednesday - I Thought It Was Morning | Reviews | Killyourstereo.com"]. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Colour Me Wednesday formed in [[Uxbridge]] in 2007, initially performing local gigs with various line-ups, and settled as a permanent band in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.50thirdand3rd.com/diy-feminist-vegan-indie-pop-punk-band-fronted-sisters-meet-color-wednesday/ "DIY feminist vegan indie pop punk band fronted by sisters - Meet , Color Me Wednesday - 50thirdand3rd"]. 29 March 2016. &lt;/ref&gt; with Danny Gardner on bass and Sam Brackley on drums.

In 2010/2011 a series of self-produced [[YouTube]] videos for tracks from their follow up ''Sampler'' EP brought them to wider attention in DIY punk and [[indiepop]] circles,&lt;ref name="tga1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegirlsare.com/2010/08/04/read-all-about-it-colour-me-wednesday/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://afogofideas.blogspot.com/2011/11/colour-me-wednesday.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://alayerofchips.blogspot.com/2011/11/colour-me-wednesday.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the band was invited to play the [[Indietracks]] festival in 2012 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indietracks.co.uk/indietracks-interview-10-colour-me-wednesday/ "Indietracks interview #10: Colour Me Wednesday"]. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Consecration of Aloysius Gonzaga as patron saint of youth''''' is a c.1763 painting attributed to [[Francisco de Goya]] and now owned by the town of [[Jaraba]] but stored in the Saragossa Museum in [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]].

==History==
It resulted from a commission by the [[Jesuit]] church of [[Virgin of the Pillar|Santa María del Pilar de Calatayud]], now known as San Juan el Real. After the Jesuits were expelled from Spain in 1767, the painting went to the sanctuary of the Virgin of Jaraba, where it was rediscovered in 1985.

==Description==
It shows saint [[Aloysius Gonzaga]] being consecrated as the patron saint of young people by [[pope Benedict XIII]], who taught young Italians to take the saint as their example, as indicated by the Latin words on the pope's speech-bubble "Inspice, FAC ET secundum EXEMPLAR" (Look and follow his example).  The pope points at the saint, who appears in glory in Jesuit robes among angels and bearing a bouquet of lilies, alluding to his purity.

Goya was probably influenced by his tutor Joseph Luzán. The painting is in line with the Italian rococo school and can be seen to be youthful in the lack of skill in some of the figure drawing.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

'''''Daisy-Head Mayzie''''' is a [[children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and illustrated in his style. It was published in 1995, as Seuss's last book before his death. It was republished on July 5, 2016 with Seuss's original drawings.

==Plot==
The book is about a 12-year-old warmhearted schoolgirl named Mayzie who one day suddenly sprouts a bright white daisy from her head. It causes alarm in her classroom, family, and town, until an agent makes her a celebrity. [[The Cat in the Hat]] who serves as the narrator to this story helps Mayzie to understand her problem and persuade her to go back home. The book has a mini-song titled "Daisy-Head Mayzie" which her classmates chant.

== Adaptations==
In 1995, prior to its actual publication, the book was adapted into a special for television on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. The special, which was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]], can be found as a bonus feature on the ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' Deluxe Edition DVD.

In 2011, Daisy-Head Mayzie was made a meetable character at [[Seuss Landing]] at Universal's Islands of Adventure.

===Cast===
*[[Francesca Marie Smith|Francesca Smith]] - Mayzie McGrew
*[[Henry Gibson]] - [[The Cat in the Hat]]
*[[Tim Curry]] - Finagle
*[[George Hearn]] - Mayor
*[[Lewis Arquette]] - Principal
*[[Jonathan Winters]] - Dr. Eisenbart

*[[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J. Ward]] - Mrs. McGrew
*[[Paul Eiding]] - Mr. McGrew
*[[Robert Ridgely]] - Finch
*Benjamin Smith - Butch
*John Graas - Einstein

==Differences in the 2016 edition==
In 2016, after the popularity of ''[[What Pet Should I Get?]]'', the book was republished with Seuss' original text and illustrations. As such, there are several differences between the editions.

*The Cat in the Hat does not appear as the narrator. 
*The characters are all designed differently and are given normal hairstyles, as opposed to the wild hairstyles in the 1995 edition.
*The principal is named Grumm instead of McGrumm.
*Instead of catching all of the bees in his hat, the police officer puts a fishbowl over Mayzie's head to protect her from the bees.
*Mrs. McGrew is a housewife instead of a welder.
*The plot in which the agent gives Mayzie a contract to be rich and famous is completely absent.
*Because of the absence of the Cat in the Hat, the daisy instead assures Mayzie that everyone loves her, and her flight with the Cat on the flying umbrella is not present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45608">{{History of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant}}
Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]]. The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL had plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIS attack |author=Khalid al-Taie |publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com |date=13 February 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01 |archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIS activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

ISIL uses a unit called the ''Kata'ib Taswiyya'' (settlement battalions) to select targets for demolition.&lt;ref name="gi"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/4973/destruction-middle-east-antiquities |title=The Destruction of the Middle East |author=Denis MacEoin |publisher=[[Gatestone Institute]] |date=27 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] branded the ISIS activities in this respect as "a form of [[cultural cleansing]]"&lt;ref name="gi"/&gt; and launched the [[Unite4Heritage]] campaign to protect heritage sites threatened by extremists.

==Motivation==
{{See also|Aniconism in Islam}}
ISIL justifies the destruction of cultural heritage sites with its extreme following of [[Salafism]] which, according to its followers, places "great importance on establishing [[tawhid]] (monotheism)", and "eliminating [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]] (polytheism)." While it is often assumed that the group's actions are mindless acts of vandalism, there is an ideological underpinning to the destruction. ISIL views its actions in sites like Palmyra and Nimrud as being in accordance with Sunni [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/religion-geopolitics/commentaries/glance/dont-be-surprised-isis-destroying-history |title=Don't Be Surprised by ISIS Destroying History |publisher=Tony Blair Faith Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond the ideological aspects of the destruction, there are other, more practical, reasons behind ISIL's destruction of historic sites. Grabbing the world's attention is easily done through the destruction of such sites, given the extensive media coverage and international condemnation that comes afterwards. Destroying historic ruins also allows ISIL to wipe the slate clean and to start afresh, leaving no traces of any previous culture or civilization, while also providing an ideal platform for the group to establish its own identity and leave its mark on history. Despite the images showing extreme destruction, ISIL has also been making use of the looted antiquities to finance their activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/15/iraq-isis-arrest-jihadists-wealth-power |title=How an arrest in Iraq revealed Isis's $2bn jihadist network |author=Martin Chulov |work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the UN's ban on the trade of artifacts looted from Syria since 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/02/12/us-mideast-crisis-un-idUSKBN0LG1YN20150212 |title=U.N.

===Mosques and shrines===

On 7 March 2015, Kurdish sources reported that ISIL had begun the bulldozing of [[Hatra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riyadhvision.com/2015/03/07/reports-isis-bulldozed-ancient-hatra-city-in-mosul |title=Reports: ISIS bulldozed ancient Hatra city in Mosul |work=RiyadhVision |date=7 March 2015 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yacoub |first=Sameer N. |agency=Associated Press |date=7 March 2015 |title=IS destroying another ancient archaeological site in Iraq |url=http://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2015/03/07/is-destroying-another-ancient-archaeological-site-in-iraq/24556625 |newspaper=ArmyTimes |location=USA|access-date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-hatra"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31779484 |title=Islamic state 'demolish' ancient Hatra site in Iraq |accessdate=15 August 2015 |publisher=BBC |date=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been under threat of demolition after ISIL had occupied the adjacent area. The next day ISIL sacked [[Dur-Sharrukin]], according to a Kurdish official from Mosul, Saeed Mamuzini.&lt;ref name="star"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/03/08/ancient-site-khorsabad-attacked-by-islamic-state-reports.html |title=Ancient site Khorsabad attacked by Islamic State: reports |work=[[Toronto Star]] |date=8 March 2015 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi Tourism and Antiquities Ministry launched the related investigation on the same day.&lt;ref name="star"/&gt; On 8 April 2015, the Iraqi Ministry of Tourism reported that ISIL destroyed the remnants of the 12th-century [[Bash Tapia Castle]] in Mosul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/1889000 |title=Боевики "Исламского государства" взорвали древний замок Баш Тапия в иракском Мосуле |publisher=[[Russian News Agency "TASS"]] |language=Russian |date=8 April 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of early July 2015, 20% of Iraq's 10,000 archaeological sites has been under ISIL control.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33369701 |title=Islamic State militants 'destroy Palmyra statues' |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=2 July 2015 |accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Palmyra====
[[File:Temple of Bel, Palmyra 02.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Bel]] in [[Palmyra]], which was blown up by ISIL in August 2015]]
Following the [[Tadmur offensive (2015)|capture of Palmyra]] in Syria, ISIL was reported as not intending to demolish the city's World Heritage Site (while still intending to destroy any statues deemed '[[Polytheism|polytheistic]]').&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/27/isis-releases-footage-of-palmyra-ruins-intact |title=Syria: Isis releases footage of Palmyra ruins intact and 'will not destroy them' |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2015, ISIL released a 87-second video showing parts of the apparently undamaged ancient [[colonnade]]s, the [[Temple of Bel]] and the [[Roman Theatre at Palmyra|Roman theatre]].&lt;ref name="theguardian"/&gt; On 27 June 2015, however, ISIL demolished the ancient [[Lion of Al-lāt]] statue in Palmyra. Several other statues from Palmyra reportedly confiscated from a smuggler were also destroyed by ISIL.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; On 23 August 2015, it was reported that ISIL had blown up the 1st-century [[Temple of Baalshamin]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34036644 Palmyra's Baalshamin temple 'blown up by IS'], BBC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/23/isis-blows-up-temple-dating-back-to-17ad-in-unesco-listed-syrian-city Isis 'blows up temple dating back to 17AD' in Syrian city of Palmyra], TheGuardian.com; accessed 25 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 August 2015, ISIL demolished the [[Temple of Bel]] with explosives. Satellite imagery of the site taken shortly after showed almost nothing remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palmyra's Temple of Bel 'destroyed' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34111092 |website=BBC News |publisher=BBC |accessdate=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report issued on September 3, 2015 by ASOR Syrian Heritage initiative, ISIL also destroyed seven ancient tower tombs in Palmyra since the end of June over two phases.&lt;ref name="natpost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/world/intolerable-crime-against-civilization-isil-destroys-three-ancient-tower-tombs-in-palmyra |title=In latest round of destruction, ISIL reduces three ancient tower tombs in Palmyra to rubble |work=[[National Post]] |date=September 4, 2015 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last phase of destruction occurred between August 27 and September 2, 2015, including the destruction of the 2nd-century AD [[Tower of Elahbel]], called "the most prominent example of Palmyra's distinct funerary monuments".&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; Earlier, the ancient tombs of Iamliku and Atenaten were also destroyed.&lt;ref name="natpost"/&gt; The [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]] was also blown up in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaheen |first1=Kareem |title=Isis blows up Arch of Triumph in 2,000-year-old city of Palmyra |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/05/isis-blows-up-another-monument-in-2000-year-old-city-of-palmyra |accessdate=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Palmyra was [[Palmyra offensive (March 2016)|recaptured]] by Syrian government forces in March 2016, retreating ISIL fighters blew up parts of the 13th-century [[Palmyra Castle]], causing extensive damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Said |first1=H. |last2=Raslan |first2=Rasha |last3=Sabbagh |first3=Hazem |title=Palmyra Castle partially damaged due to ISIS acts, plans to restore it to its former glory |url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=72903 |work=[[Syrian Arab News Agency]] |date=26 March 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327133431/http://sana.sy/en/?p=72903 |archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISIL has also looted and demolished the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]]/[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city of [[Dura-Europos]] in east of Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2014/09/232028.htm |title=We're sorry, that page can't be found. |website=www.state.gov |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicknamed "the [[Pompeii]] of the desert", the city was of particular archaeological significance.

====Hatra====
[[Hatra]] (Arabic: الحضر al-Ḥaḍr) was an ancient city in the Ninawa Governorate and al-Jazira region of Iraq. A large fortified city and capital of the first Arab Kingdom, Hatra withstood invasions by the Romans in A.D. 116 and 198 thanks to its high, thick walls reinforced by towers.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"&gt;http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/277&lt;/ref&gt; However about 240 ce,  the city fell to Shāpūr I (reigned c. 240–272), the ruler of the Persian Sāsānian dynasty, and was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/place/Hatra&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the city, especially the temples where Hellenistic and Roman architecture blend with Eastern decorative features, attest to the greatness of its civilization.&lt;ref name="whc.unesco.org"/&gt; The city lies 290&amp;nbsp;km (180&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of Baghdad and 110&amp;nbsp;km (68&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of Mosul.
On 7 March 2015, various sources including Iraqi officials reported that the militant group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) had begun demolishing the ruins of Hatra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-03-08/islamic-state-militants-raze-iraq-ancient-hatra-city/6288618 |title=IS continues cultural cleansing of Iraq with Hatra's destruction: UNESCO |date=8 March 2015 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video released by ISIL the next month showed destruction of the monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bcdd18ddfe5143f08e5e2335e19e5af9/video-islamic-state-group-shot-hammered-away-iraqs-hatra |title=Video: Islamic State group shot, hammered away Iraq's Hatra |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient city was recaptured by the [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] on 26 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39726244 |title=IS conflict: Iraqi force 'retakes ancient city of Hatra' |date=26 April 2017 |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===

ISIL has burned or stolen collections of books and papers from various locations, including the [[Central Library of Mosul]] (which they rigged with explosives and burned down),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-burns-down-mosul-library-destroys-8000-rare-books-manuscripts-624375 |title=Isis Burns Down Mosul Library, Destroys 8,000 Rare Books and Manuscripts |first=Johnlee |last=Varghese |publisher= |accessdate=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the library at the [[University of Mosul]], a Sunni Muslim library, a 265-year-old Latin Church and Monastery of the Dominican Fathers, and the Mosul Museum Library. Some destroyed or stolen works date back to 5000 BC and include "Iraq newspapers dating to the early 20th century, maps and books from the Ottoman Empire, and book collections contributed by about 100 of Mosul’s establishment families." The stated goal is to destroy all non-Islamic books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-hijacks-mosul-university-chemistry-lab-for-making-bombs-1459503003 |title=Islamic State Hijacks Mosul University Chemistry Lab for Making Bombs |last=London |first=Margaret Coker in |date=2016-04-01 |last2=Baghdad |first2=Ben Kesling in |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |issn=0099-9660|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
On 22 September 2014, the United States Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] announced that the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]] had partnered with the American Schools of Orient Research Cultural Heritage Initiatives to "comprehensively document the condition of, and threats to, cultural heritage sites in Iraq and Syria to assess their future restoration, preservation, and protection needs".&lt;ref name="usdep"/&gt; In 2014, the [[UNESCO]]'s Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict condemned at the Ninth Meeting "repeated and deliberate attacks against cultural property... in particular in the Syrian Arab Republic and the Republic of Iraq".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/syria-crisis-response/regional-response/single-view/news/reinforce_the_immunity_of_our_common_heritage_under_threat/#.VPDhTY6rEYJ |title=Reinforce the immunity of our common heritage under threat |publisher=UNESCO |date=21 December 2014 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO Director-General [[Irina Bokova]] called the destructions in Mosul a violation of the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2199]],&lt;ref name="news"/&gt; and the destruction of Nimrud a [[war crime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Nimrud: Outcry as IS bulldozers attack ancient Iraq site |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31760656 |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=BBC News |date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister of Iraq [[Nouri al-Maliki]] reported that the local parliamentary tourism and antiquities committee had "filed complaints with the UN to condemn all ISIL crimes and abuses, including those that affect ancient places of worship".&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt; On 28 May 2015, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] unanimously passed a resolution, initiated by Germany and Iraq and sponsored by 91 UN member states, stating that ISIL's destruction of cultural heritage may amount to a war crime and urging international measures to halt such acts, which it described as a "tactic of war".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/69/281|UNGA Resolution 69/281], un.org; accessed 15 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Palmyra temple's destruction in August 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] (IDA) announced plans to establish a digital record of historical sites and artifacts threatened by ISIL advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sparpointgroup.com/news/vol13no35-oxford-3d |title=Oxford Deploying 5,000 Modified 3D Cameras to Fight ISIS |author=Sean Higgins |work=sparpointgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sputniknews.com/middleeast/20150902/1026494356/Middle-East-ruins-digital-preservation.html#ixzz3kgt8e2xo |title=Protecting History: The Digital Project Preserving Artifacts From ISIL Ruin |author=Sputnik |date=2 September 2015 |work=sputniknews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCToday&gt;{{cite news |title=The digital race against IS |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p030ys68 |accessdate=24 September 2015 |work=BBC Radio 4 "Today" programme |agency=BBC |date=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArchDaily&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rosenfield |first1=Karissa |title=Harvard and Oxford Take On ISIS with Digital Preservation Campaign |url=http://www.archdaily.com/772902/harvard-and-oxford-take-on-isis-with-digital-preservation-campaign |accessdate=24 September 2015 |work=Arch Daily |date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; To accomplish this goal, the IDA, in collaboration with [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|UNESCO]], will deploy 5,000 3D cameras to partners in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last1=Mackay |first1=Mairi |title=Indiana Jones with a 3-D camera?

The general director of the [[National Museum (Prague)|Czech National Museum]], Michal Lukeš, signed an agreement in June 2017 committing the institution to help Syria save, preserve and conserve much of its cultural and historical heritage damaged by war, including the ancient site of Palmyra; he met with Maamoun Abdulkarim and discussed plans for the works that are said to last until 2019.&lt;ref name=czradio&gt;{{cite news |last1=Johnstone |first1=Chris |title=Czechs sign up to help save Syrian cultural heritage |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/czechs-sign-up-to-help-save-syrian-cultural-heritage |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=Radio Praha |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, The World Monuments Fund (WMF) announced launching a £500,000 scheme to train Syrian refugees near the Syrian-Jordanian border in traditional stone masonry. The aim is teaching them to develop skills necessary to be able to help in restoring cultural heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed during the Syrian Civil War once peace is restored to Syria.&lt;ref name=theart&gt;{{cite news |last1=Shaw |first1=Anny |title=Syrian refugees to be trained to rebuild Palmyra and other heritage sites |url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |accessdate=24 June 2017 |work=The Art Newspaper |date=21 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624090053/http://theartnewspaper.com/news/news/syrian-refugees-to-be-trained-in-traditional-stone-masonry-to-rebuild-palmyra-and-other-heritage-sit/ |archive-date=2017-06-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lovejoy Monument''', also known as the '''Elijah Lovejoy Monument''', '''Elijah Parrish Lovejoy Shaft''', '''Lovejoy Monument''', and '''Lovejoy State Memorial''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!8322~!0#focus&lt;/ref&gt;  is a memorial in the United States to the advocate of free speech and the abolition of slavery, who died fighting for these ideas when his newspaper, the ''[[Alton Observer]]'', was attacked and destroyed by pro-slavery fanatics.

==History==
[[Elijah P. Lovejoy]] was an [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] in the 1830s, running a newspaper called the ''[[St Louis Observer]]'', in [[Missouri]], a slave state. Slavery advocates attacked and destroyed his presses a number of times, driving him to move across the river to [[Alton, IL]] in 1837, where he renamed it the Alton Observer. Although Illinois was a free state, in November 1837, his presses were attacked for what would have been the fourth time. He and some supporters were in the warehouse where they were stored, and as the building was stormed, the attackers apparently began firing guns. Lovejoy and his men returned fire, but in the conflict Lovejoy was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatriverroad.com/cities/alton/Lovejoy.htm Great River Road page on the monument.]&lt;/ref&gt;

His death garnered national attention, and was viewed by abolitionists and others as a tragic martyrdom in the cause of both freedom of speech and the abolition of slavery. Abraham Lincoln is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Lovejoy's tragic death for freedom in every sense marked his sad ending as the most important single event that ever happened in the new world&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=JGcdAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20&amp;dq=%22Lovejoy's+tragic+death+for+freedom+in+every+sense+marked+his+sad+ending+as+the+most+important+single+event+that+ever+happened+in+the+new+world%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3sGaCh3RT8&amp;sig=dr2GGXClT_5ByH209Q5GUJD0AAc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6FxgTa6gH5Cctwerv5zPCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Lovejoy's%20tragic%20death%20for%20freedom%20in%20every%20sense%20marked%20his%20sad%20ending%20as%20the%20most%20important%20single%20event%20that%20ever%20happened%20in%20the%20new%20world%22&amp;f=false Uncollected letters of Abraham Lincoln.]&lt;/ref&gt;
:''- Abraham Lincoln, letter to friend Lemen, in 1857''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1850, plans were made for a monument to Lovejoy's efforts and death, but it was not completed until 60 years after his death, when it was officially opened to the public on its anniversary.

Having been buried in an unmarked grave, Lovejoy's remains were exhumed years later, and placed in the cemetery that is now overlooked by his monument.

In the 1890s, work began in earnest on his monument. It was designed by R. P. Bringhurst, a St. Louis sculptor, and built by Culver Stone Company of [[Springfield, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.il.us/hpa/lovejoy/monument.htm Historic Parks Association site of Illinois State.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

The monument consists of a 93 foot tall main shaft topped by a 17-foot-tall winged statue of [[victory]], which therefore stands over 300 feet above the Mississippi river below, with two side spires mounted by eagles, as well as two bronze lion chalice statues, and a stone [[whispering wall]] bench that wraps all the way around the central spire, allowing you to hear someone whispering completely out of sight on its opposite side.

Because it is based on the top of the river bluffs, the monument is easily seen from the distance, even when crossing the bridge over the Mississippi, from Missouri into Illinois, a considerable distance away.

The four sides of the central spire's pedestal contain quotes by Lovejoy, focusing on each aspect of his life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Champion of Free Speech.'''

:''But, gentlemen, as long as I am an American citizen, and as long as American blood runs in these veins, I shall hold myself at liberty to speak, to write, to publish whatever I please on any subject--being amenable to the laws of my country for the same.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Salve, Victores!'''

:This monument commemorates the valor, devotion and sacrifice of the noble Defenders of the Press, who, in this city, on Nov. 7, 1837, made the first armed resistance to the aggressions of the slave power in America.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Minister of the Gospel.

Moderator of Alton Presbytery,'''

:''If the laws of my country fail to protect me I appeal to God, and with him I cheerfully rest my cause. I can die at my post but I cannot desert it.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Elijah P. Lovejoy,

Editor Alton Observer,'''

Albion, Maine, Nov. 8, 1802

Alton, Ill., Nov. 7, 1837.

A Martyr to Liberty.

:''I have sworn eternal opposition to slavery, and by the blessing of God, I will never go back.''

'''Fontana delle Api''' (''Fountain of the Bees'') is a fountain located in the [[Piazza Barberini]] in [[Rome]] where the Via Veneto enters the piazza. It was sculpted by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] and completed in April 1644. 

''Fontana delle Api'' consists of a marble bi-valve shell with three bees of the same material resting on it. The fountain was intended to be a watering [[Watering trough|trough]] for horses. An inscription on the shell reads, "Urban VIII Pont. Max., having built a fountain for the public ornamentation of the City, also built this little fountain to be of service to private citizens. In the year 1644, XXI of his pontificate."  The "public ornamentation" referred to in the inscription is the [[Fontana del Tritone]] (''Triton Fountain''), which Bernini had completed the year before.

[[File:Frederic George Stephens.jpg|thumb|''F.G. Stephens'', by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
'''Frederic George Stephens''' (10 October 1827 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1907) was a British [[art critic]], and one of the two 'non-artistic' members of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=36272|title=Stephens, Frederic George|first=Dianne Sachko|last=Macleod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Stephens was born to Septimus Stephens of [[Aberdeen]] and Ann (née Cook) in [[Walworth, London]] and grew up in nearby [[Lambeth]]. Because of an accident in 1837, he was physically disabled and was educated privately.  He later attended [[University College School]], London. In 1844 he entered the [[Royal Academy]] Schools where he first met [[John Everett Millais]] and [[William Holman Hunt]].  He joined their Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in 1848, often modelling for them in pictures including Millais's ''[[Ferdinand Lured by Ariel]]'' (1849) and [[Ford Madox Brown]]'s ''Jesus Washing Peter's Feet''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1581&amp;searchid=24138|title='Jesus Washing Peter’s Feet', Ford Madox Brown - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1852–56; Tate, London). There is a pencil portrait of Stephens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/live/search/portrait.asp?LinkID=mp04284&amp;rNo=0&amp;role=sit|title=NPG 2363; Frederic George Stephens - Portrait - National Portrait Gallery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Millais dated 1853 in the collection of the [[National Portrait Gallery (London)|National Portrait Gallery]]. He was so disappointed by his own artistic talent that he took up art criticism and stopped painting. In later life he claimed to have destroyed all his paintings, but three of them are now in the [[Tate Gallery]], London:  ''The Proposal (The Marquis and Griselda)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=13820|title='The Proposal (The Marquis and Griselda)', Frederic George Stephens - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1850–1), ''Morte d'Arthur''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=13822&amp;searchid=14886|title='Morte d’Arthur', Frederic George Stephens - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1849), and ''Mother and Child''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=13821&amp;searchid=14886|title='Mother and Child', Frederic George Stephens - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; (circa 1854–6), along with a pencil drawing of his stepmother Dorothy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=13819&amp;searchid=14886|title='The Artist’s Mother', Frederic George Stephens - Tate|work=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1850), a study for an oil portrait he exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1852. He also exhibited a portrait of his father (1852–3) at the Academy in 1854. A large pen-and-ink drawing illustrating a subject from Geoffrey Chaucer's ''The Pardoner's Tale'', ''Dethe and the Riotours'' (1848–54), which he gave to Dante Gabriel Rossetti in 1854, is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford.

[[File:'Portrait of Clare Stephens' by Frederic George Stephens, c. 1865, watercolor.jpg|thumb|left|''Portrait of Clare Stephens'' by F.G. Stephens, c. 1865, watercolor and gouache with scraping and selectively applied glaze on wove paper [[National Gallery of Canada]]]]
He communicated the aims of the Brotherhood to the public.  He became the art critic and later the art editor of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' from 1860–1901, while also writing freelance for other art-history periodicals including ''[[The Art Journal]]'' and ''[[The Portfolio]]''. He also wrote for journals on the continent and the United States – notably, the pro-Pre-Raphaelite journal ''The Crayon'', from 1856–9. His contributions to the Brotherhood's magazine ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'' were made under the pseudonyms Laura Savage and John Seward. During this time he was heavily influenced by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], whom he allowed to write reviews of his own work under Stephens's name.

Stephen's first work of art history, ''Normandy: its Gothic Architecture and History'' was published in 1865, and ''Flemish Relics'', a history of Netherlandish art, appeared in 1866. Monographs on [[William Mulready]] (1867) and on [[Edwin Landseer]] (1869) followed. In 1873 he started writing series of almost 100 articles on British collecting for the ''Athenaeum''; these treated major collections and small collectors alike thus encouraging middle-class art patronage and the growing Victorian interest for contemporary art.

He was also Keeper of the Prints and Drawings in the [[British Museum]] and wrote most entries in the first volumes of the ''Catalogue of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum'', Division I: Political and Personal Satires, from 1870 onward. In 1875, Stephens began to characterise himself as an art historian rather than a critic and in 1877 he started to write contributions for the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] catalogues, which he continued to do until 1890.  When Rossetti died Stephens co-wrote his obituary for the ''Athenaeum'' published on 15 April 1882.

Stephens was loyal supporter of his former tutor Holman Hunt over many years, but the two fell out over Hunt's painting ''The Triumph of the Innocents'' (1885), which Hunt had asked Stephens to box and transport for him, and which had been lost for some time in transit and damaged. Hunt became increasingly paranoid, and interpreted a money gift from Stephens for his newborn son to be a slight, sending it back. The friendship between the two was broken when Stephens reviewed ''The Triumph of the Innocents'' and criticised it for its mixing of hyper-realism and fantasy. Almost twenty years later Hunt retaliated by launching a scathing attack on Stephens in the second edition of his ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'' (1914). In 1894, Stephens published a ''Portfolio'' monograph on Rossetti.  He contributed essays on art to [[Henry Duff Traill]]'s ''Social England: a Record of the Progress of the People'' (1893–97) placing Pre-Raphaelitism in a continuing tradition of British art.  This contradicted the Brotherhood's view that they had flowered uniquely from a pallid past.  In 1895 he published a book on [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]] and his review of the posthumous exhibition of Millais in 1898 took the painter to task for poorly thought-out works.

Other artists about whom he wrote include [[Thomas Bewick]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]], [[George Cruikshank]], [[Thomas Gainsborough]], [[William Hogarth]], [[Edwin Landseer]], [[William Mulready]], [[Samuel Palmer]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Thomas Rowlandson]], Sir [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Thomas Woolner]].

Stephens' conservative views on modern art and his strong dislike of [[Impressionism]] ended his forty-year association with the ''Athenaeum''.

Stephens married the artist [[Rebecca Clara Dalton]] in 1866. From 1866–1905, the couple lived at 10 Hammersmith Terrace, Hammersmith. Their son was the railway engineer [[Holman Fred Stephens]] (1868–1931). Stephens died at home on 9 March 1907 and is buried in [[Brompton Cemetery]]. Much of his collection of art and books was auctioned at Fosters in 1916, after his widow's death, but his son bequeathed several works of art to the Tate Gallery.

He is sometimes cited {{where|date=August 2011}} as the great exponent of [[writer's block]]: He started to write a political [[sonnet]] for the first number of ''The Germ'' magazine. On 13 October 1849 he had completed 11½ lines, which he showed to [[James Collinson]], who said they were "the best of all." By 12 November it had "attained the length of 12 lines, with the reservation of a tremendous idea for the final two." The magazine appeared in January 1850 but the poem was never published.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6867">'''Frescography''' (from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''fresco'' – ''painting onto "fresh" plaster'' + [[greek language|Greek]] ''graphein'' - to write) is a method for producing murals digitally on paper, canvas, glass or tiles, invented in 1998 by  German muralist [[Rainer Maria Latzke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patent-de.com/20000203/DE19829627C1.html |title=Patent information for mural-reproduction technique |publisher=Patent-de.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frescography uses [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] and [[digital printing]] methods to create murals.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Frescography Mediterranean1.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Frescography adapted to the actual architectural properties of the project wall (into the picture integrated door)]] --&gt;
[[File:Comersee Spalier rgb.jpg|thumb|right|300px|With CAM-program created Frescography]]

==History of mural reproduction techniques==
[[File:'Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique', panels 1-10 of woodblock printed wallpaper designed by --Jean-Gabriel Charvet-- and manufacturered by --Joseph Dufour--.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'Sauvages de la Mer Pacifique' - Unlike this woodblock print consisting of 10 stripes, the frescography is produced on a single piece of canvas, allowing a seamless mural tailor-fit to the wall's dimensions.]]
The frescography is based on a similar technique as the [[woodblock printing]]  method of the French Papier Peints wallpapers, used by manufacturers like [[Zuber et cie]] or [[Joseph Dufour et Cie]], who began developing the procedure during the end of the 18th century. These [[wallpaper]] manufacturers used thousands of engraved woodblocks for the creation of the panorama sceneries, to create wall paper such as the 20-panel  [[Sauvages de la Mer du Pacifique]] which [[Jean-Gabriel Charvet]] designed for [[Joseph Dufour et Cie]] or the “du Vue de l'Amérique Nord” designed in 1834 by [[Zuber et cie]] for the [[Diplomatic Reception Room]] of the [[White House]], where it is still today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm |title=Murals in the 'Diplomatic Reception Room' of the White House |publisher=Whitehousemuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of frescography==
[[File:Frescography.jpg|thumb|left|Screenshot of a CAM program for the design of frescographies.]]Unlike [[woodblock printing]], the frescography is based on digitally cut-out motifs which are stored in a [[database]]. To avoid having to work with high-resolution files on software such as [[Photoshop]] (resulting in long rendering and processing time), new [[Computer aided mural|CAM]] software programs like the Dreamworlds Design Studio allow the composition of mural designs by working with preview files which are later converted to the original resolution. By adding the exact measurements of a wall when starting a new project and even taking architectural elements such as doors windows or beams into consideration, the design will result in an accurately and tailor-fit wall mural.
Once a design is finished, the low-resolution motifs are converted into the original high-resolution images and are printed on [[wide-format printer]]s. Unlike the woodblock print consisting of stripes, the frescography is printed on a single piece of 
canvas, allowing a seamless mural tailor-fit to the walls dimensions. Once produced, the canvas is applied to the wall in a [[wall-paper]]-like procedure.

Since the motifs can be placed freely and scaled to the individual wall measurements, the finished piece will look like it was created on-site.

==Institute of Frescography==
In 2009 the inventor of the frescography technique, Professor [[Rainer Maria Latzke]], founded the [[Institute]] of Frescography (IOF) at [[Utah State University]] in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], [[Utah]]. The IOF is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] institution whose mission is the improvement of public knowledge and interest in the art of mural and [[fresco]] [[painting]]. It also researches on [[Art history]], [[Digital data|digital]] [[reproduction]], [[printing]] processes and materials, and [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]] techniques of mural art.

In cooperation with the German Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte, the IOF provides online access to the collection a 40,000 images [[archive]] of European wall and mural [[painting]]s which have been compiled in the last years of World War II on direct order of Adolf Hitler to preserve the images for a later reconstruction in case of war damages. It also offers free online access to the Institute´s 5,000 image archive “World of Ornaments”.  
The archive of European wall and mural paintings covers the period between the [[Gothic art|Gothic]] ages to the end of the 19th century.  
The archive of the World of Ornaments consists of 5,000 motifs based on the two greatest [[encyclopedic]] collections of ornament from the 19th-century [[Chromolithography|chromo-lithographic]] tradition: Auguste Racinet's  L“'Ornement [[polychrome]] Volumes I and II“ from 1875–1888 and “M. Dupont-Auberville's L'Ornement des tissus” from 1877.

The IOF also is  participating  in [[museum]] and  exhibition projects of mural and [[fresco]] art.

==Applications of frescographies==
[[File:Royal Clipper Lobby.jpg|thumb|left| Frescographies in the lobby of the ''Royal Clipper''.]]Frescographies can be found in the Lanner Lehar Hall of the [[Vienna town hall]] or the world's largest cruising ship, ''[[Royal Clipper]]''.

==Material and printers==
Since frescography is based on digital printing methods, various materials ranging from canvas, ceramics, or glass to [[PVC]], depending on the material the printer supports. One of the most commonly used materials is Digimura FINO 300gsm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourwalls.com/paper-types |title=Digimura FINO 300gsm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is mainly due to its fine-grain surface finish, which is ideal for both high-end graphics and art photography. The paper's fine raised rivulets also make it extremely well-suited to frescographies in large spaces and ambient backdrops. Commonly frescographies are printed on [[Wide-format printer]]s such as Efi's Vutek printer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efi.com/products/production/superwide/vutek/ |title=Vutek wide-format printer |publisher=Efi.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gomorrah''''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: '''''Gomorra''''') is a [[non-fiction]] [[Investigative journalism|investigative]] book by [[Roberto Saviano]] published in 2006, which documents Saviano's infiltration and investigation of various areas of business and daily life controlled or affected by [[Organized crime in Italy| criminal organization]] [[Camorra]].

==The book==
The book describes the clandestine particulars of the [[business]] of the [[Camorra]], a powerful [[Naples|Neapolitan]] [[mafia]]-like organization. In this book Saviano employs [[prose]] and news-reporting style to narrate the story of the Camorra, exposing its territory and business connections.

Since 2006, following the publication of the book, Saviano has been threatened by several Neapolitan “[[Capo di tutti capi|godfathers]]”. The Italian Minister of the Interior has granted him a permanent [[police escort]], but he's been often attacked by politicians of [[Silvio Berlusconi|Berlusconi]]'s cabinet. Also, his escort has been questioned.

As of December 2008, the book has sold almost 4 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/174278 |title=Streets of ‘Gomorrah’|work= Newsweek|date=December 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the book comes from a text by [[Giuseppe Diana]], a parish priest in Casal di Principe who was killed by the Camorra in March 1994: "time has come to stop being a Gomorrah."&lt;ref name=varese&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a913746680&amp;fulltext=713240928 |title=The Camorra closely observed], by Federico Varese|journal=Global Crime|volume= 10|issue= 3 |date=August 2009 |pages= 262 – 266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception ==
''Gomorrah'' won numerous literary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Viareggio-Repaci Prize for best [[debut novel]], Premio Giancarlo Siani, Premio Dedalus, Premio "Lo Straniero", Premio Letterario Edoardo Kihlgren for best debut novel, Premio Tropea, the Vittorini Prize for civic engagement and the Guido Dorso literary prize&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2009 the number of copies sold in Italy surpassed 2,000,000.

''Gomorrah'' has been translated in 51 countries. It appeared in the best sellers’ lists of Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Sweden and Finland. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has placed it amongst the most important books of 2007, while ''[[The Economist]]'' has included it among the hundred books of the year. Saviano is the only Italian to be placed in both lists.

''Gomorrah'' was described by some critics and other Italian authors (such as [[Wu Ming]], [[Carlo Lucarelli]] and [[Valerio Evangelisti]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/english/outtakes/NIE_have_to_be_the_parents.htm A Reflection on ''Gomorrah'' in the context of the New Italian Epic ], opening talk at the conference "The Italian Perspective on metahistorical fiction: The New Italian Epic", IGRS, University of London, October 2nd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html a single webpage regrouping two articles by major Italian authors published on two important daily newspapers: Carlo Lucarelli, "Noi scrittori della nuova epica", ''La Repubblica'', May 3rd, 2008 and Valerio Evangelisti, "Literary Opera", ''L'Unità'', May 6th, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316065856/http://www.carmillaonline.com/archives/2008/05/002632.html |date=2009-03-16 }}. 
Lucarelli wrote: "I agree with enthusiasm and great interest to Wu Ming's reflections on the New Italian Epic, and I practically identify myself with many of their observations. By "practically" I mean in terms of a literary praxis, a research done by means of books and novels [...] by means of history, which for us Italians has never become past and is always present and contemporary [...], also by means of telling the hidden everyday life of the camorra, as Saviano did...'"

According to Evangelisti, "''Gomorrah'', which is far from being a mere journalistic report, makes a statement which [[Jean-Patrick Manchette]] would have appreciated: crime is not a secondary element of capitalism, a perversion of its principles. On the contrary, crime is at the core of capitalism, it's one of the main pillars of the system [...] This unidentified object – is it a report or a novel? – has a choral nature that links it to epic, in this case an epic that has no heroes but is capable to embrace a whole world."&lt;/ref&gt; as part of a turbulent, heterogeneous stream in Italian writing called the [[New Italian Epic]], whose representatives are particularly keen on producing not only novels and non-fiction narratives, but also real UNOs, Unidentified Narrative Objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/suoni/audiotheque.htm#allegorithms Italian novelist Wu Ming  explains the concept of New Italian Epic] in a conference at Middlebury College, VT, March 31st, 2008 - audio, English, 50:00&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gomorrah'' itself was described as a UNO by several critics, readers and  writers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wumingfoundation.com/italiano/Giap/gomorra.htm "Appunti sul come e il cosa di Gomorra], on wumingfoundation.com, June 2006 (Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatrical, cinematic and television adaptations==
''Gomorrah''  has been made into a play written by Saviano with Mario Gelardi and [[Gomorrah (film)|a 2008 film]] directed by [[Matteo Garrone]] and produced by Fandango. On September 24, 2008, the film was picked by ANICA (Italy's Association of the Cinematic and Audiovisual Industry) to represent Italy in the race for the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] Oscar nomination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic06d5fa4f707358585ba55a4294ccd82 Eric J. Lyman, "''Gomorrah'' in Oscar's foreign-language gang: Italian organized crime drama joins list of contenders"], Hollywood Reporter, September 24th, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Garrone's film adaptation of the book, Christoph Huber wrote: "With its interest in moving beyond the categories of novel or non-fiction, Saviano's work has been identified as part of a heterogeneous strain of national literature, subsumed as the New Italian Epic. A term that certainly isn't disgraced by ''Gomorrah'', the film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html Christop Huber, "Gomorrah", Cinemascope #35] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514052128/http://www.cinema-scope.com/cs35/spot_huber_gomorrah.html |date=May 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the book was also loosely adapted as an [[Gomorrah (TV series)|eponymous television series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rees |first=Jasper |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11011682/Gomorrah-Sky-Atlantic-review-ugly-in-a-good-way.html |title=Gomorra, Sky Atlantic, review: 'ugly, in a good way' |work=Telegraph |date=2014-08-04 |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== i Light Marina Bay 2016: In Praise of Shadows ==
The fourth edition of i Light Marina Bay, held from 4 to 27 March 2016, featured 25 innovative and environmentally sustainable light art installations by creative talents from around the world, including Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, United Kingdom and the USA. Beyond its spectacular showcase of visual art and urban space, the festival also offers a dynamic line-up of events and programmes over four weekends.

=== Theme &amp; Curatorial Team ===
The 2016 theme, “In Praise of Shadows”, challenges the obsession that brighter is better and seeks to reframe [[perception]]s of light and sustainability. The festival invites artists and visitors to re-imagine and reconsider sustainability issues in a new light, and to contemplate upon larger issues of light, beauty and the city in relation to the bigger community.

The curatorial direction was driven by Randy Chan, Principal Architect at Zarch Collaboratives, Singapore and Khairuddin Hori, Deputy Director of Artistic Programming at the Palais de Tokyo, Paris.

To promote an environmentally-responsible behavior for a sustainable future, participating artists have incorporated the use of recyclable materials and adopted energy-efficient lighting in the creation of their stunning light art installations.

=== Theme ===
The theme Light+HeART seeks to convey the message that “in the heart of the sustainability matters, is the matter of the heart”.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch off, Turn up Campaign '' ====
i Light Marina Bay once again conducted the “Switch Off, Turn Up” Campaign, where stakeholders around Marina Bay were invited to switch off non-essential lighting and turn up [[air conditioning]] temperatures whenever possible during the festival period. The energy saving campaign was designed to offset the energy used by the light art installations and associated power use in Asia’s only sustainable light art festival which ran from 7 to 30 March.

52 buildings committed in this third edition to put in place measures to save energy during the festival period. Key developments involved include [[Marina Bay Sands]], [[Marina Bay Financial Centre]], and [[One Fullerton]]. Their participation signified their commitment to play a part in working towards a more sustainable future together. The campaign in 2014 achieved energy savings of 268,890 kWh.

== 2012 i Light Marina Bay: Light Meets Asia ==
The second edition of the light festival, Light Meets Asia, returned in 2012 and ran from 9 March 2012 to 1 April 2012.

In line with the theme, the festival showcased 31 innovative and environmentally sustainable light installations by multidisciplinary artists, with strong focus on works from Asian artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mhisham.org/2012/01/16/i-light-marina-bay-2012/ I Light Marina Bay 2012] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419145003/http://mhisham.org/2012/01/16/i-light-marina-bay-2012/ |date=19 April 2012 }} Mhisham. 16 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  11 of the works were by Singaporeans and 12 were from regional artists.

=== Sustainability ===
A key objective of i Light Marina Bay was to advocate environmentally-responsible behaviour for a sustainable future, and to promote Marina Bay as a culturally vibrant and sustainable urban waterfront precinct. From encouraging artists to use recyclable materials as well as adopt energy-efficient lighting technology in the creation of their light art installations, to working with event and programme partners to more effectively manage resources and minimise waste, sustainability was promoted through all aspects of the festival.

==== ''Switch Off, Turn Up ''Campaign ====
In 2012, the initiative successfully extended its reach well beyond the Marina Bay precinct, with buildings across the island pledging their support.&lt;ref name="Switch Off, Turn Up Campaign"&gt;[http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html "Switch Off, Turn Up" Campaign] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414010255/http://www.ilightmarinabay.sg/switchoff_campaign.html |date=14 April 2012 }} i Light Marina Bay. Retrieved 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign saved more than 200,000 kWh, four times the energy saved in 2010.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt; This equates to 100 tonnes of CO2 equivalent, enough to generate electricity for 762 4-bedroom HDB flats for three-weeks.&lt;ref name="Lighting-up for sustainability"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ i Light Marina Bay 2012 closed on a successful note] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131200446/https://adlibmagazine.wordpress.com/2012/04/11/ |date=31 January 2016 }} Adlib Magazine Singapore. 11 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ivy League''' is a style of men's dress, popular during the late 1950s in the [[Northeastern United States]], and said to have originated on college campuses, particularly those of the [[Ivy League]]. It was the predecessor to the [[preppy]] style of dress.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4oO1sxv8jBwC&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fashion design]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Subcultures of the 1950s}}
[[File:John F. Kennedy, White House color photo portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy]], a style icon for followers of the Ivy League look.]]
Ivy League clothing is derived from the casual attire worn by the British and American upper classes during the [[1920s in fashion|1920s]], for sporting pursuits such as [[golf]], [[polo]], [[sailing]], [[rugby football]], [[hunting]], and [[tennis]]. Typical summer attire for this time included navy two button blazers with gold buttons, striped college blazers, [[Ascot tie]]s, cable knit [[tank top]]s, [[Oxford shirt]]s, Breton striped shirts, and wingtip shoes. For fall, trendsetters such as the [[Duke of Windsor]] combined the latest American fashions with traditional [[British country clothing]] such as [[brogue boot]]s, [[Argyle socks]] and jumpers, and [[tweed cloth]] [[sportcoat]]s, [[Irish walking hat]]s and [[plus fours]] in [[houndstooth]], [[Herringbone (cloth)|herringbone]], or the [[Prince of Wales check]] popularized by [[Edward VII of England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2259269/How-dress-like-Downton-Abbey-Savile-Row-tailors-showcase-outfits-1920s-London-Menswear-Fashion-Week.html 1920s menswear]&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the mid to late 1950s, many young college men adopted the Ivy League look due to its association with the upper classes at leisure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/ivy-style-primer/ Gentlemans Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing stores [[J. Press]] and [[Brooks Brothers]] represented perhaps the quintessential Ivy League dress manner, the former with two of its four locations found at [[Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] universities (the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] branch closed in 1943).  The Ivy League style was epitomized by the sack suit, which is defined as being a 3-to-2 (3 buttons with the top button "rolled" back to reveal only two usable buttons) jacket without [[Dart (sewing)|darts]] and a single "hooked" vent.  The pants were typically cuffed and without pleats. It was also characterized by the use of natural fabrics, shirts with button-down collars, and [[penny loafers]]. In suits, the Ivy League style was promoted by clothier Brooks Brothers and included natural shoulder single-breasted suit jackets. In 1957 and 1958, about 70% of all suits sold were in the "Ivy League" style.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sears"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elements"/&gt; 

Typical hairstyles included the [[crew cut]], [[Harvard clip]], and [[regular haircut]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UUksHG783IcC&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=ivy%20league&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;q=ivy%20league&amp;f=false Boys Life 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; and common clothing items included [[cardigan sweater]]s, [[sweater vest]]s, [[Nantucket reds]], [[khaki]] [[chino pants]], knitted ties, white [[Oxford shirt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g0gEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=ivy%20league&amp;pg=PA61#v=onepage&amp;q=ivy%20league&amp;f=false Life Magazine 1959]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tootal]] or [[Brooks Brothers]] ties, [[Ascot necktie]]s, tartan, grey [[tweed cloth]] or flannel [[sportcoat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KUgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=ivy%20league&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q=ivy%20league&amp;f=false Life Magazine 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[seersucker]] blazers in the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivy-style.com/removing-the-ivy-league-stigma-plimpton-on-brooks.html Removing the Ivy League stigma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mainstream popularity and decline==
[[File:Small Faces (1965).png|thumb|right|Mod band the [[Small Faces]] wearing Ivy League inspired [[Glen plaid]] sportcoats.]]
From the late 1950s until the [[1960s in fashion|mid 1960s]], Ivy League clothing was considered desirable mainstream apparel for middle class adults in the US. In Britain during the mid and late 60s, the [[Mod subculture]] combined the latest Italian fashions with the attire worn by the heroes in contemporary American films such as [[Steve McQueen]], [[James Dean]] or [[Paul Newman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/league-of-gentlemen-how-to-get-the-effortlessly-cool-style-of-paul-newman-and-steve-mcqueen-2080204.html Newman and McQueen]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular were the grey flannel, [[Tonic suit|Tonic]], or [[houndstooth]] suits, [[polo shirt]]s, [[chino pants]], [[Argyle socks]], [[sweater vest]]s, [[cardigan sweater]]s, basketweave loafers, Madras plaid, and narrow brimmed [[Irish walking hat]]s and [[Trilby]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modculture.co.uk/claudio-de-rossi-talks-ivy-with-jimmy-frost-mellor/ Claudio De Rossi]&lt;/ref&gt; The style remained fashionable in America until it was supplanted by more casual everyday clothing influenced by the [[hippie]] [[counterculture]] during the late 1960s and [[1970s in fashion|early 1970s]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/ivy-style-primer/ Gentlemans Gazette]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2018}}
An American style known as [[preppy]] is similar to Ivy League but intended for today's mainstream culture. Preppy style tends to be more colorful, especially in spring and summer, and incorporates more [[casual chic]] attire. It was [[1980s in fashion#Preppy|first popularized in the early 1980s]] as a return to Ivy League styles after a decade of more modern trends, but [[Airhead (subculture)|today, preppy differs from historic Ivy League]]. Preppy fashion is influenced by traditional collegiate trends, rather than reproducing them exactly, and various clothing items can be considered preppy based on how they are worn or accented. During the [[1990s in fashion|1990s]] and [[2000s in fashion|2000s]] [[Polo Ralph Lauren]], [[Vineyard Vines]], [[J. Crew]] and J. Press were large marketers of preppy clothing, modernised to accommodate new trends inspired by [[indie pop]] and [[urban fashion]]. Controversially, in a recently revised form, a version of this style is sometimes promoted and marketed as "American Trad" or simply "Trad," although there are marked differences between the two styles. Trad is considerably narrower in scope than the original Ivy League style.&lt;ref name="pompeo"/&gt;

By the [[2010s in fashion#Classic preppy|2010s]], many American preps opted to dress in a more classic, tailored style closer to the original Ivy League look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pompeo |first=Joe |url=http://www.observer.com/2009/fashion/trad-men |title=American Trad |publisher=Observer.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular clothings include loafers, [[Sperry Top-Sider]] [[boat shoes]], [[Aran sweater]]s, [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]s, [[Oxford shirt]]s, Cricket [[Sweater|pullovers]], [[Brogue shoe|wingtip]]s, stripy [[polo shirt]]s, hats like the [[fedora]], khaki or pastel colored [[Vineyard Vines]], [[Nantucket Reds]], white or bright pastel color socks worn with sneakers and [[Sperry Top-Sider boat shoes]], colored jeans, [[baseball jacket]]s, khaki [[cargo shorts]], and tapered [[chinos]]. Blazers, especially those made from seersucker, had made a comeback as informal or [[smart casual]] wear by the mid 2010s, and the traditional two button style was updated with [[throwback style|throwback]] styling inspired by [[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-american-fashion-staples_9.html |title=American fashion staples |access-date=2016-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412135613/http://uk.askmen.com/top_10/entertainment/top-10-american-fashion-staples_9.html |archive-date=2016-04-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The style was parodied in [[Clark Gesner]]'s musical ''The Ivy League Look''.

'''''Jet Pilot''''' is a 1962 [[pop art]] work done in [[pencil|graphite pencil]] by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. Like many of Lichtenstein's works from this time period, it was inspired by a comic book image, but he made notable modifications of the source in his work.

== Background ==

[[File:Jet Pilot source.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The source of ''Jet Pilot'' was All American Men of War #89 (l), January–February 1962, National Periodical Publications (DC)]]

In the mid-1970s the work was owned by Richard Brown Baker, who had acquired the work in May 1963.&lt;ref name="Stebbins 1976"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldrich 1965"/&gt;
As of 2013 it is owned by the [[Yale University Art Gallery]], which also hosts the related work ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]''.&lt;ref name="LFO Museums"/&gt;

Lichtenstein was a trained [[United States Army]] pilot, draftsman and artist as well as a [[World War II]] (WWII) veteran who never saw active combat.&lt;ref name="LFO Chronology"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McCarthy 2004"/&gt;
His list of aeronautical themed works is extensive. Within that genre, Lichtenstein has produced several works featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as ''Jet Pilot'' (1962), ''[[Brattata]]'' (1962), ''[[Bratatat!]]'' (1963), and ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003"/&gt;

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
''Jet Pilot'' is one of several drawings that Lichtenstein has done in a [[Frottage (art)|frottage]] technique, in a time before he routinely used the [[Ben-Day dots]] for which he is better known.&lt;ref name="Wood 1988"/&gt; This work has been on a worldwide tour of Lichtenstein's 1961&amp;ndash;68 black-and-white sketches, accompanied by [[DC Comics]] artwork.&lt;ref name="Vogel 2010-07-09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rolnick 2010-09-29"/&gt;

The source of ''Jet Pilot'' was ''All American Men of War'' #89 (January–February 1962, [[DC Comics]]).&lt;ref name="ID 3163"/&gt; ''Jet Pilot'' is one of several comics-based works, including ''[[Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!]]'' and ''Von Karp'', inspired by the [[World War II]] [[Navajo people|Navajo]] [[U.S. Air Force]] fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]''.&lt;ref name="YaleUP 2012-06-26"/&gt;  The same ''All American Men of War'' issue was the inspiration for several other Lichtenstein paintings, ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', ''[[Brattata]]'', ''[[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]'', ''[[Whaam!]]'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

Lichtenstein usually simplified from his source material, but in ''Jet Pilot'' the [[gun sight]] is more detailed than in the source.&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002"/&gt; In Lichtenstein's image the line of enemy bullets follows a different path, thereby reducing the suspense caused in the source as the bullets ruptured the pilot's [[air hose]].&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002"/&gt; The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of "machine and embodied vision" as exhibited in works such as ''[[Crak!]]'', ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', and ''Bratatat!''.&lt;ref name=RLGB&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|date=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|pages=118&amp;ndash;20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4307">'''Landscape mythology''' and '''anthropology of landscape''' (''Landschaftsmythologie'', ''Landschaftsethnologie'') are terms for a field of study advocated since about 1990 by Kurt Derungs (born 1962 in [[St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]). Derungs describes the field as an interdisciplinary approach to [[landscape]] combining [[archaeology]], [[ethnology]] and [[mythography|mythology]]. 

Derungs interprets landscape features in terms of "[[totemism]], [[shamanism]] and [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] mythology", claiming that his approach qualifies as neither [[esotericism]] nor as [[positivism]] but as a "sound alternative" to both. His interpretations are strongly influenced by the hypothesis of a [[matriarchal]] structure of society and a cult of the [[Great Goddess hypothesis|Great Goddess]] in [[Neolithic Europe]], and he associates [[megalithic]] monuments and elements of traditional [[fairy tale]]s with these ideas.

Since 1994, Derungs manages the ''edition amalia'' publishing house, where his books appear besides publications on related topics (matriarchy, Great Goddess) by other authors. Derungs is popular in [[Neopaganism in Germany|German Neopagan]] circles, but has received little attention in academic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Derungs (1996) is mentioned favourably as forwarding a feminist critique of [[C. G. Jung]]'s depiction of femininity in Kocku von Stuckrad, ''Constructing Femininity—the Lilith Case'', LAUD paper Universität Essen, Linguistic Agency: Series A; 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Meditation by the Sea''''' is an American [[folk art]] [[oil painting]] by an unknown artist from the early 1860s.

The painting is derived from a wood engraving of [[Gay Head]], [[Martha's Vineyard]] by [[David H. Strother]] in the September 21, 1860 issue of ''[[Harper's|Harper's New Monthly]]''.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

==Description==
Though the receding cliff suggests the artist's familiarity with [[one-point perspective]], the rest of the view is distorted to suggest the vastness of the scene.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  The artist creates a surreal image by juxtaposing the lone, brooding foreground figure with tiny silhouettes in the distance.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt; Though solitary figures are common in the contemporary [[Luminism (American art style)|luminist]] paintings of the [[Hudson River school]] (to which the artist was likely exposed), the artist's approach to the subject is markedly different.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  They create a sense of foreboding using a vast horizon and an ominous hanging branch.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;  Based on the date of the Strother engraving, this painting was probably painted near the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; a sense of dread is visible in the figure's "confrontation with the omnipotence of nature and God".&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

[[Image:Gay Head.jpg|thumb|left|The engraving in ''[[Harper's|Harper's New Monthly]]'' that inspired ''Meditation by the Sea'']]

==Acquisitions==
Art collector [[Maxim Karolik]] bought the painting from J.B. Neumann for $650 in 1943; it was one of the first 19th-century paintings he acquired.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=antiques/&gt;  In 1945 Karolik donated the piece to the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] to inaugurate the M. and M. Karolik Collection of American Art, 1815-1865.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;&lt;ref name=antiques&gt;Troyen, Carol. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1026/is_4_159/ai_73410728 "Maxim Karolik folk art"].

'''''Octopussy and The Living Daylights''''' (sometimes published as '''''Octopussy''''') is the fourteenth and final [[James Bond]] book written by [[Ian Fleming]] in the [[James Bond novels|Bond series]]. The book is a collection of short stories published [[Posthumous work|posthumously]] in the United Kingdom by [[Jonathan Cape]] on 23 June 1966.

The book originally contained just two stories, "[[#"Octopussy"|Octopussy]]" and "[[#"The Living Daylights"|The Living Daylights]]", with subsequent editions also carrying firstly "[[#"The Property of a Lady"|The Property of a Lady]]" and then "[[#"007 in New York"|007 in New York]]". The stories were first published in different publications, with "Octopussy" first serialised in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' in October 1965. "The Living Daylights" had first appeared in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 4 February 1962; "The Property of a Lady" was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for the 1963 edition of their journal, ''The Ivory Hammer''; whilst "007 in New York" first appeared in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963.

The two original stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", were both adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format in the ''Daily Express'' in 1966–1967. Elements from the stories have also been used in the [[Eon Productions]] Bond films. The first, ''[[Octopussy]]'', starring [[Roger Moore]] as James Bond, was released in 1983 as the thirteenth film in the series and provided the [[back story]] for the film [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy's]] family, while "The Property of a Lady" was more closely adapted for an auction sequence in the film. ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', released in 1987, was the fifteenth Bond film produced by Eon and starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first appearance as Bond. "007 in New York", meanwhile, provided character and plot elements for the first two films starring [[Daniel Craig]] as Bond, ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[Quantum of Solace (film)|Quantum of Solace]]''.

==Plots==

==="Octopussy" {{anchor|Octopussy}}===
[[Secret Intelligence Service|Secret Service]] operative [[James Bond]], code name 007, is assigned to apprehend a hero of the [[World War II|Second World War]] implicated in a murder involving a cache of [[Nazi gold]]. Bond appears only briefly in this story, which is told mostly in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] from the perspective of Major Dexter Smythe, the man Bond has been sent to bring in. Smythe remained in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, after the war, found the gold with the help of a mountain guide, and killed him in order to keep it for himself. Bond was put on the case after the guide's body fell out of a glacier and he recognized the man as a ski instructor and father figure from his youth. Smythe is now a melancholy alcoholic living alone on the beach, interacting mainly with the residents of its coral reef – including the titular Octopussy, a beloved 'pet' [[octopus]] that Smythe feeds and talks to.

Bond chooses not to take Smythe into custody immediately, but leaves him to contemplate his options – suicide or a [[court martial]]. As Smythe hunts for [[Scorpaenidae|scorpion fish]] to feed Octopussy, he suffers a sting which triggers a fatal heart attack, during which Octopussy pulls him under. Deciding to spare Smythe's reputation, Bond classifies the death as an accidental drowning.

==="The Living Daylights" {{anchor|The Living Daylights}}===
An unusually morose James Bond is assigned sniper duty to help British agent 272 escape from [[East Berlin]]. Bond's duty is to safeguard his crossing into [[West Berlin]] by eliminating a top [[KGB]] [[Assassination|assassin]] codenamed "Trigger" who has been dispatched to kill him. Bond takes up a position on the western edge of the border, in a hotel overlooking the [[no man's land]] of broken, brightly lit ground that 272 will have to cross. On each of three nights, he sees a female orchestra arrive for rehearsal and leave, taking particular notice of a beautiful blonde cellist. Once 272 starts to cross the border, Bond sees Trigger get in position to kill him and realizes that it is the cellist. He adjusts his aim at the last moment and shoots her rifle instead of killing her, allowing 272 to reach safety.

Afterward, Bond admits to his spotter that he did not try for a kill shot only because Trigger had been a woman. He muses that even though 272 is safe, the mission will be considered a failure because he did not kill Trigger, and he hopes that [[M (James Bond)|M]] will fire him for it.

==="The Property of a Lady" {{anchor|The Property of a Lady}}===
The Secret Service learns that Maria Freudenstein, an employee known to be a double agent working for the Soviet Union, has just received a valuable item of jewelry crafted by [[Peter Carl Fabergé]] and is planning to auction it at [[Sotheby's]]. Bond suspects that the Resident Director of the KGB in London will attend the auction and underbid for the item, in order to drive the price up to the value needed to pay Maria for her services. Bond attends the auction, spots the man, and leaves to make arrangements for his expulsion from London as ''[[persona non grata]]''.

==="007 in New York" {{anchor|007 in New York}}===
A brief tale in which Bond muses about New York City and his favourite recipe for [[scrambled eggs]], during a quick mission to the titular city to warn a female [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] employee that her new boyfriend is a KGB agent. It is notable for including a rare humorous conclusion and for its mention of Solange, a young lady of Bond's intimate acquaintance who works in a shop, [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch|Abercrombie's]], "appropriately employed in their Indoor Games Department".

==Characters and themes==
The author of the "continuation" Bond stories, [[Raymond Benson]], noted that in "The Living Daylights" Bond's thoughts on killing are examined once again, showing that although 007 did not like doing it, he considered that he must as part of his duty to complete an assignment.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=144}} Once the mission is completed, with Bond deliberately not killing the assassin, there is an attitude of complacency with Bond shrugging off his colleague's complaints about the incident.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=145}} Academic [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] sees the colleague, the officious Captain Spender, as the antithesis of Bond and an echo of Colonel Schreiber, the head of security at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), who appeared in "[[From a View to a Kill]]".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}}

In the act of not killing the assassin, the theme of disobedience is raised in "The Living Daylights",{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=82–84}} with Bond calling what he has to do "murder" and subsequently dismissing his actions by saying "with any luck it will cost me my Double-0 number".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=84}} Raymond Benson considered "Octopussy" to be a morality tale, with greed bringing repercussions years later to the main protagonist, Dexter Smythe.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=143}}

==Background==
On the morning of 12 August 1964, Fleming died of a heart attack;&lt;ref name="Times obit (1965)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary: Mr. Ian Fleming|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=13 August 1964|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; eight months later, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was published.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} The rights to Fleming's works were held by [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] (now Ian Fleming Publications) and it was decided by the company that two short stories, "Octopussy" and "The Living Daylights", would be published in 1966.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=445}}

==="Octopussy"===
The story "Octopussy" was written in early 1962 at Fleming's [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in Jamaica.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The story is told in the manner of "Quantum of Solace", with Bond as catalyst for story told in flashback, rather than as a main character for action.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} The topics chosen for Fleming were familiar ground for him to cover, with hidden gold, tropical fish and the wartime exploits of commandos all coming from elements of his past.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=408}} Also from the past, or from his acquaintance, were other references used in the story and Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau was a fictional version of Fleming's [[No. 30 Commando|30 AU unit]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=409}} One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica, and later his lover, was Blanche Blackwell, mother of [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]]. Fleming had previously used Blackwell's name as the guano-collecting ship in ''Dr. No'', calling it ''Blanche''.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} Blackwell had given Fleming a [[coracle]] called ''Octopussy'', the name of which Fleming used for the story.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=93}} ''Octopussy'' was posthumously [[Serial (literature)|serialised]] in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper, 4–8 October 1965.{{sfn|Gilbert|2012|p=443}}

==="The Living Daylights"===
Fleming originally titled "The Living Daylights" as "Trigger Finger",{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} although when it first appeared, in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' colour supplement of 4 February 1962,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}} it was under the title of "Berlin Escape".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} It was also published in the June 1962 issue of the American magazine [[Argosy (magazine)|''Argosy'']] under the same name.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} For ''The Sunday Times'', Fleming had commissioned [[Graham Sutherland]] to undertake the artwork to accompany the piece, at a cost of 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=395}} although the artwork wasn't used in the published edition.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=396}}

As background research to the story, Fleming corresponded with Captain E.K. Le Mesurier, secretary of the [[National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom|National Rifle Association]] at [[Bisley Camp|Bisley]] for information and to correct some of the more specialist areas of knowledge required for [[sniper]] shooting. Part of the background to the plot, of using the noise of the orchestra to cover the crossing over no man's land, was inspired by [[Pat Reid]]'s escape from [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz]] prisoner of war camp, with two escapers having to run across a courtyard under the cover of the noise from an orchestra.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The conductor of the Colditz orchestra was [[Douglas Bader]], who played golf with Fleming on a number of occasions.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The assassin, Trigger, was partly based on [[Amaryllis Fleming]], Ian's half-sister, a concert cellist with blonde hair, and Fleming managed to get a passing reference to her in the story, saying: "Of course Suggia had managed to look elegant, as did that girl Amaryllis somebody."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}}

==="Property of a Lady"===
"Property of a Lady", which was written in early 1963, was commissioned by [[Sotheby's]] for use in their annual journal, ''The Ivory Hammer'',{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}}&lt;ref name="Benson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Benson|first=Raymond|authorlink=Raymond Benson|title=[[The James Bond Bedside Companion]]|year=1988|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Boxtree Ltd]]|location=London|isbn=978-1-85283-233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was published in November 1963 and later in ''[[Playboy]]'';{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=25}} Sotheby's chairman [[Peter Wilson (auctioneer)|Peter Wilson]] is mentioned by name in the story. Fleming was so unhappy with the final piece he wrote to Wilson and refused payment for something he considered so lacklustre.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=422}} Nonetheless, it was adapted as the auction sequence in the film ''[[Octopussy]]''.&lt;ref name="Benson" /&gt;

==="007 in New York"===
In 1959 Fleming was commissioned by ''The Sunday Times'' to write a series of articles based on world cities, material for which later was collected into a book entitled ''[[Thrilling Cities]]''; whilst travelling through New York for material, Fleming wrote "007 in New York" from Bond's point of view.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=60}} "007 in New York" was originally titled "Reflections in a Carey Cadillac"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} and it contains a recipe for scrambled eggs which came from May Maxwell,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=240}} the housekeeper to friend Ivar Bryce who gave her name to Bond's own housekeeper, May.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} The story was first published in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' in October 1963 as "Agent 007 in New York", but was subsequently renamed as "007 in New York" for the 1964 US editions of ''Thrilling Cities''.{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=381}}

==Release and reception==
''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' was published in Britain on 23 June 1966{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} by [[Jonathan Cape]] and cost 10s.6d.&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|title=New Fiction|newspaper=[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]|date=14 July 1966|authorlink=Anthony Burgess}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardback edition of the book contained only the two stories mentioned in the title, although when the paperbacks editions were published, "The Property of a Lady" was also included.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} Once again artist [[Richard Chopping]] provided the cover art, although his fee rose, to 350 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].&lt;ref name="Midwinter (2010)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Midwinter|first=Janet|title=The Man with the Golden Grudge|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1263359/The-Man-Golden-Grudge-How-illustrator-Ian-Flemings-novels-felt-conned-vast-royalties.html|accessdate=14 October 2011|newspaper=[[Mail on Sunday]]|date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in US by [[New American Library]] with illustrations from [[Paul Bacon (designer)|Paul Bacon]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} By 2002, "007 in New York" had been added to the book by [[Penguin Books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Octopussy &amp; The living daylights / Ian Fleming|url=http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?dscnt=1&amp;elementId=1&amp;recIdxs=1&amp;vl(174399379UI0)=any&amp;frbrVersion=5&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A(BLCONTENT)&amp;tab=local_tab&amp;dstmp=1323028327575&amp;srt=rank&amp;mode=Basic&amp;tb=t&amp;indx=2&amp;renderMode=poppedOut&amp;vl(freeText0)=%22007%20in%20new%20york%22&amp;vid=BLVU1&amp;fn=search&amp;frbg=&amp;displayMode=full&amp;ct=display&amp;dum=true&amp;recIds=BLL01006731954&amp;doc=BLL01006731954&amp;tabs=moreTab&amp;fromLogin=true|work=The British Library Catalogue|publisher=[[The British Library]]|accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
[[Philip Larkin]] wrote in ''[[The Spectator]]'' that "I am not surprised that Fleming preferred to write novels. James Bond, unlike Sherlock Holmes, does not fit snugly into the short story length: there is something grandiose and intercontinental about his adventures that require elbow room and such examples of the form as we have tend to be eccentric or muted. These are no exception."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} The critic for ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that the book was "slight and predictable, and usual sex and violence yield to a plausible use of ballistics and marine biology".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=241}} Writing in [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']], [[Anthony Burgess]] thought that "in their fascinated poring on ''things''...remind us that the stuff of the anti-novel needn't necessarily spring from a thought-out aesthetic",&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; going on to note that "it is the mastery of the world that gives Fleming his peculiar literary niche".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt; On a personal note, Burgess added "I admired all the Bond books and I'm sorry there'll be no more. A sad farewell to Fleming".&lt;ref name="Burgess (1966)"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
{{main article|James Bond (comic strip)|Octopussy}}

;Comic strip adaptation (1966–1967)
Two of the short stories were adapted for publication in [[comic strip]] format, which were published daily in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper and syndicated worldwide. ''The Living Daylights'' ran from 12 September to 12 November 1966, adapted by Jim Lawrence and illustrated by [[Yaroslav Horak]]; the same pair also worked on ''Octopussy'', which ran from 14 November 1966 to 27 May 1967.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} The story lines for the strips were altered from the original Fleming version to ensure that they contained a glamorous reason for being Bond involved and to include Bond in action.{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=4}} The strips were reprinted by [[Titan Books]] in 1988{{sfn|Fleming|Gammidge|McLusky|1988|p=6}} and then again in ''The James Bond Omnibus Vol. 2'', published in 2011.{{sfn|McLusky|Gammidge|Hern|Fleming|2011|p=6}}

In 1983 [[Eon Productions]] loosely adapted elements of two of the stories, "Octopussy" and "The Property of a Lady" for the [[Octopussy|thirteenth]] film in their [[James Bond in film|Bond series]], starring [[Roger Moore]] as Bond.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=151}} "Octopussy" provided the title of the film and the background for the character [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy]], the daughter of a character Bond had allowed to commit suicide, rather than face the shame of arrest and imprisonment.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}} The film also used the plot device of auctioning of a [[Fabergé egg]] at Sotheby's from "The Property of a Lady" and, as with the story, the auction item was described as being the same "property of a lady".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}}

;''The Living Daylights'' (1987)
In 1987 Eon used the plot of "The Living Daylights", almost unchanged, for a section of their 1987 [[The Living Daylights|film of the same name]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=168}} The film starred [[Timothy Dalton]] in his first role as Bond, whilst the character of Trigger became that of cello player [[Kara Milovy]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=173}}

;''Casino Royale'' (2006)
In 2006 Eon used the plot of Fleming's first novel, ''Casino Royale'', for its 21st film of the same name.  However, a main character was named Solange, after the woman featured in "007 in New York."

;''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)
In 2008 Eon used the basic premise from the short story "007 in New York" as part of the film ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'', in which Bond warns a female intelligence employee that her boyfriend is an enemy agent.

;''Spectre'' (2015)
In ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', Hans Oberhauser, a background character in "Octopussy" is revealed to be the father of [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]] and a former caretaker of Bond in his youth. In the film it is strongly hinted that Blofeld killed Oberhauser because he felt that Oberhauser loved Bond more than him, his own son.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to guitars:

A '''[[guitar]]''' is a [[plucked string instrument]], usually played with fingers or a [[guitar pick|pick]]. The guitar consists of a body with a rigid neck to which the strings, generally six in number, are attached. Most guitar necks have metal frets attached (the exception is fretless bass guitars). Guitars are traditionally constructed of various woods and strung with animal gut or, more recently, with either nylon or steel strings. Some modern 2010-era guitars are made of [[polycarbonate]] materials. Guitars are made and repaired by [[luthier]]s. There are two primary families of guitars: acoustic and electric. An acoustic guitar has a wooden top and a hollow body. An electric guitar may be a solid-body or hollow body instrument, which is made louder by using a pickup and plugging it into a [[guitar amplifier|guitar amplifier and speaker]]. Another type of guitar is the low-pitched [[bass guitar]].

'''''Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)''''' is a large [[Acrylic paint|acrylic]]-on-canvas [[pop art]] painting by British artist [[David Hockney]], completed in May 1972. It measures {{cvt|7|x|10|ft|m}},&lt;ref name=Christies-auction&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Paintings/david-hockney-portrait-of-an-artist-6171867-details.aspx?lid=1&amp;from=relatedlot&amp;intobjectid=6171867|title=David Hockney (b.1937), ''Portrait of an artist (Pool with Two Figures)''|publisher=Christies|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and depicts two figures: one swimming underwater and one clothed male figure looking down at the swimmer. In November 2018, it sold for US$90.3&amp;nbsp;million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a work by a living artist.

== Background ==
Hockney visited [[California]] for the first time in January 1964 after a successful first solo exhibition at the [[John Kasmin]] gallery.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The United States fascinated him, and Los Angeles in particular, partly because of the influence of Hollywood cinema but also because of the modernist building [[Bailey House – Case Study House|Case Study House #21]]. As a gay man, he was also a fan of the [[beefcake magazine]] ''Physique Pictorial'', which was published in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt; "I instinctively knew I was going to like it," Hockney said, "and as I flew over San Bernardino and saw the swimming pools and the houses and everything and the sun, I was more thrilled than I have ever been in arriving in any city."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20170210-the-bewitching-allure-of-hockneys-swimming-pools|publisher=BBC|title=The bewitching allure of Hockney's swimming pools|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hockney painted the first of his pool paintings ''California Art Collector'' in 1964, and the swimming pool became a recurring theme in his paintings, such as ''[[Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool]]'' (1966, [[Walker Art Gallery]], [[Liverpool]]) and most notably ''[[A Bigger Splash]]'' (1967, [[Tate Gallery]]).&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;  He painted a series of double portraits from 1968 to 1977, including ''[[American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman)]]'' (1968, [[Art Institute of Chicago]]), and ''[[Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy]]'' (1971, Tate Gallery).

== Composition ==
This work brings together two of Hockney's themes from his paintings of the late 1960s and early 1970s: the swimming pool, and the double portrait.  It depicts a male figure in white trunks swimming [[breaststroke]] underwater, and the painter [[Peter Schlesinger]], Hockney's former lover and muse, fully clothed and standing at the edge of the pool looking down at the swimmer.&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; The painting is set in southern France, near [[Saint-Tropez]].&lt;ref name="Apollo"/&gt; In characteristic Hockney style, the foreground is simplified and flattened with a view of tree-clad hills in the background.

The composition was inspired by a serendipitous combination of photographs that Hockney noticed on his studio floor: one of a man swimming underwater, taken in California in 1966, and the other of a man standing looking at the ground.  Juxtaposed, it appeared as if the standing person was looking at the swimmer.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thedavidhockneyfoundation.org/chronology/1972|title=1972|publisher=David Hockney Foundation|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger had ended abruptly in 1971, following a fight in [[Cadaqués]].  "By showing another young man swimming towards Peter, the artist acknowledges lost love and his boyfriend’s desire for a new partner".&lt;ref&gt;M. Livingstone and K. Haymer, ''Hockney's People'', London, 2003, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting can be viewed as fitting into a European tradition since the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] of depicting the nude bathing, washing off the stain of pollution amid the peace of nature.&lt;ref name=Christies-auction/&gt;

Hockney worked on the painting for four months in late 1971, but dissatisfied with the composition, in particular with the angle of the pool, abandoned the work and started afresh.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"/&gt; He then travelled for several months with Mark Lancaster, and returned to the work in early 1972. The year 1972 was a very productive year for Hockney, as he threw himself into his work to escape from his unhappiness, often working 14 or 15 hours a day.  Around the same time, he was working on his (unfinished) double portrait of ''George Lawson and Wayne Sleep'' (1972-5, Tate).

In April 1972, Hockney flew to the south of France to better visualise the figure swimming underwater, using the pool at film director [[Tony Richardson]]'s villa at Le Nid du Duc near Saint-Tropez to do so. Hockney's studio assistant, Mo McDermott, recreated the pose of the downcast man, while a young photographer, John St Clair, was the swimmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gerryco23.wordpress.com/tag/painting/page/6/?iframe=true&amp;preview=true/feed/ |title=David Hockney: Early Reflections at the Walker |website=That's How The Light Gets In |publisher=gerryco23.wordpress.com |accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney took hundreds of photographs based on his original composition.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/features/David-Hockney-Portrait-of-an-Artist-Pool-with-Two-Figures-9372-3.aspx|title=Hockney's Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)|publisher=Christies|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Back at his London studio, Hockney assembled the photos along with photographs of Peter Schlesinger taken in [[Kensington Gardens]] wearing the same pink jacket.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/cultural-capital/2012/01/hazan-film-hockney-splash|title=Gilbey on Film:The truth about David Hockney|work=New Statesman|accessdate=17 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney worked on the painting for two weeks, working 18-hour days, completing and varnishing it only the night before it was due to be shipped to New York for the exhibition at [[André Emmerich]] Gallery.&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt; It was first shown in the exhibition ''Paintings and Drawings'', which ran from 13 to 31 May 1972.&lt;ref name="Hockney1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-46232870|title=Hockney painting sells for record $90m|date=16 November 2018|accessdate=16 November 2018|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hockney said of the painting, "I must admit I loved working on that picture, [...] working with such intensity; it was marvellous doing it, really thrilling"&lt;ref name="Christiesbio"/&gt;

The creation of the painting and the breakdown of Hockney's relationship with Schlesinger were featured in the semi-fictional 1974 documentary ''[[A Bigger Splash (1974 film)|A Bigger Splash]]'', named after the 1967 Hockney painting.&lt;ref name=Apollo&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/david-hockney-pool-paintings/|title=The Pull of Hockney's Pool Paintings|work=Apollo|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Rolf on Art''''' was a British [[art]] television series made by the [[BBC]]. It was hosted by [[Rolf Harris]], the Australian television presenter. The series began in 2001, and the most recent episode was made in 2007. It was followed by Harris's other art programme, ''[[Star Portraits with Rolf Harris]]'', which was released after the success of ''Rolf on Art''.

Each episode revolved around Harris looking at a various notable artist from history, and both investigating their life as well as imitating their style of art.

==Rolf Harris's style==
Unlike many other art presenters, Harris did not just look and talk about an artist's work: he created works in their own style. This was a key part of the shows' success. For each episode, he usually painted two pictures in their style, normally in the same place where they created their works. Some episodes were big events, which were held in a public place, such as [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. Harris presented these but many other people (both celebrities and the general public) were enlisted to paint.

==Episodes==

===Series One – ''The Impressionists''===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 2s.jpg|thumb|200px| Rolf's self portrait in Van Gogh's style]] --&gt;
In the first series, from 2001, Harris looked at the [[Impressionists]], a group he has a great affinity for:
# '''[[Claude Monet]]'''
# '''[[Edgar Degas]]'''
# '''[[Vincent van Gogh]]'''
# '''[[Paul Gauguin]]'''

===Series Two – ''The Post-Impressionists''===
In the second series, he looked at several artists who worked around and after the time of the Impressionists, but were not Impressionists.
# '''[[Henri Rousseau]]''' – the French painter of 2D Jungle scenes
# '''[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]''' – the French painter of the ''[[At the Moulin Rouge|Moulin Rouge]]''
# '''[[Gustav Klimt]]''' – the artist who worked in gold leaf
# '''[[Auguste Rodin]]''' – the famous sculptor

===Series Three – ''20th-century Masters''===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Art rolfonart 1s.jpg|thumb|200px|Rolf's picture in Toulouse-Lautrec's style]] --&gt;
# '''[[L. S. Lowry]]''' – the British painter famous for his stick men style
# '''[[Salvador Dalí]]''' – the most famous [[Surrealism|Surrealist]]
# '''[[Pablo Picasso]]''' – the famous [[Cubism|Cubist]]
# '''[[Paul Cézanne]]''' – the French [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]]
# '''[[Marc Chagall]]''' – the painter of love scenes
# '''[[Andy Warhol]]''' – the famous [[Pop Art|Pop artist]]

===Series Four – ''Old Masters''===
# '''The Big Event ~ [[John Constable]]'''
# '''[[Rembrandt van Rijn]]'''
# '''[[Sandro Botticelli]]'''
# '''[[J. M. W. Turner]]'''
# '''[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]'''

===''The Christmas Special''===
In this special, Harris looked at [[Christmas card]] making. The card he produced was mass-produced and sold for charity that year.

===''The Africa Special''===
Harris went on a tour of [[Africa]], looking at different styles on African art, including rock art, [[Makonde people|Makonde]] wood carving and [[Benin Bronzes]]. It was released to coincide with the [[Live 8]] festival in 2005 and the series of programmes on the BBC about Africa.

===Series Five – ''Old Masters''===
# '''The Big Event ~ [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'''
# '''[[Thomas Gainsborough]]'''
# '''[[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]]'''
# '''[[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'''
# '''The Big Event ~ [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]]'''

===''The Queen, by Rolf''===
This special, broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 1 January 2006, showed the creation of [[Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II – An 80th Birthday Portrait|Harris's 80th birthday portrait painting]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/default.asp?action=article&amp;ID=388 Rolf Harris unveils official portrait of The Queen at the Palace of Holyroodhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; It was highly publicised because the Queen had never been seen on such a programme before. In it, Harris goes to [[Buckingham Palace]] where he meets the Queen and paints her in an impressionist style. It is debatable whether it was a part of the ''Rolf on Art'' series, because it does not contain the title sequence or ''Rolf on Art'' in the title. However, it was advertised as a ''Rolf on Art'' special.

===''Rolf on Lowry''===
A one-off special, aired on 4 March 2007, where Harris followed in the footsteps of the painter [[L. S. Lowry]]. This is different from the season three episode on Lowry.

===''Rolf on Beatrix Potter''===
A one-off special, aired on 30 December 2007. Harris looked at the work of illustrator [[Beatrix Potter]].

===''Rolf on Welsh Art''===
This series was commissioned by and only shown on BBC One Wales. It aired from the 16 February to the 9th of March 2011. It took the same format as the original series, with each episode focusing on a different Welsh artist. The episode on Shani Rhys James was the first profile of a living artist, meaning as part of the programme Harris was able to meet the artist herself.
# '''[[Sir Kyffin Williams]]'''
# '''[[Josef Herman]]'''
# '''[[Shani Rhys James]]'''
# '''[[Graham Sutherland]]'''

The second series began airing on 12 October 2012 but has since ended following Harris's 2013 arrest on charges of indecent assault making indecent images of a child.
# '''[[Gren Jones (cartoonist)|Gren Jones]]'''
# '''[[Augustus John]]'''
# '''[[Evan Walters]]'''
# '''[[Brenda Chamberlain (artist)|Brenda Chamberlain]]'''

==Book==
A ''Rolf on Art'' book was released for the first series. It contained sections on how he worked, as well as a section on each of the artists he looked at in the series. An updated version was released for the second series.

[[Image:Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion.jpg|thumb|right|350px|''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion'']]

'''''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion''''' is an 1812 oil painting by [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]]. It has been called "The most famous of the British romantic works...;"&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs and Paul Stirton, ''The Knopf Traveler's Guides to Art: Great Britain and Ireland'', New York, Alfred A. Knopf, 1984; p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; it was the first of Martin's characteristically dramatic, grand, grandiose large pictures, and anchored the development of the style for which Martin would become famous. 

The painting shows a human figure climbing in a mountain landscape. The man struggles to surmount a rocky outcrop beside a pool and waterfall; more jagged cliffs and peaks loom in the background, vastly receding.

Martin later stated that he finished the work in a month. And he wrote, "You may easily guess my anxiety when I overheard the men who were to place it in the frame disputing as to which was the top of the picture! Hope almost forsook me, for much depended on this work."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in his Obituary, in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', April 1854, p. 434.&lt;/ref&gt; (At the time, Martin had left his £2-per-week job as a glass painter in a china factory, and was attempting to establish himself as an independent artist.)

The artist's anxiety was unnecessary; displayed in the [[Royal Academy]] exhibition at [[Somerset House]], the picture was a popular success. It was purchased for fifty [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] by William Manning, a member of the board of governors of the [[Bank of England]]. Reportedly, Manning's "dying son had been moved by its depiction of the slight solitary figure clinging perilously to a ledge."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher John Murray, ''The Encyclopedia of Romantic Art, 1760&amp;ndash;1850'', New York, Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004; p. 976.&lt;/ref&gt;

"What makes the work so remarkable is its persuasive combination of science and fantasy: while the scale seems beyond terrestrial experience, the attention given to geological and meteorological phenomena is that of the knowledgeable observer."&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Boime]], ''Art in the Age of Bonapartism, 1800&amp;ndash;1815'', Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1990; p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;Critics who accept  the conventions of [[Romanticism]] in art have appreciated Martin's ''Sadak''; those who do not have regarded the picture as lurid or puzzling.

Martin's Romantic style can be seen as influenced by prevailing Promethean zeitgeist. This is the story of Prometheus, the Greek God who betrayed Zeus and stole the secret gift of fire. Eventually this became a popular metaphor to depict in romantic works of art, because romantics were known for employing  the role of nature vs. man in their works.They believed that humans were obsolete to natural world around them. Due to this interpretation, Sadak is drawn to a much smaller scale than the landscape that surrounds him, revealing that he stands no chance against the power of nature. Also, romanticism arose during the industrial revolution, a time when engineers and scientists were exploring nature's secret gifts, analogous to the act of Prometheus stealing the secret gift of fire. Romantics portray the unknown of nature with its unpredictability, intractability and its barbaric capabilities as an opposite of the enlightenment thought. This can be seen in the background of ''Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion'' with an erupting volcano taking place in an other worldly dimension. The idea behind the piece was not to render a precise location and accurate in its depiction, but to express the emotion that was being experienced by the subject. 

Another key factor of Martins style can also be seen as "end of the world" or "apocalyptic". Although, he depicts a grim scene Martin shows a mere chance of hope in the distance. A glimmering stream of light beams in the corner, giving the viewer a sense of aspiration.
 
Sadak is a fictional character in a story in [[James Ridley]]'s ''[[The Tales of the Genii]]'' (two volumes, [[1764 in literature|1764]]); it is a ''faux''-Oriental tale allegedly from a Persian manuscript, but actually the work of Ridley himself.&lt;ref&gt;Murray,  p. 977.&lt;/ref&gt; In Ridley's story, the hero Sadak is sent by his Sultan, Amurath, to find the memory-destroying "waters of oblivion." The Sultan maliciously intends to use the waters on Sadak's wife Kalasrade in a seduction attempt. Sadak endures a range of trials &amp;mdash; a tempest at sea, a plague, evil genii, a subterranean whirlpool &amp;mdash; before he attains his goal. In the end, the Sultan himself falls victim to the water's effect. Amurath dies; Sadak becomes Sultan. Martin's picture portrays Sadak at the climax of his struggle, just before he reaches the waters of oblivion.

(Ridley's tale was popular in its era, and was adapted into a play by [[Thomas John Dibdin]], titled ''Sadak and Kalasrade'', which was staged in [[1797 in literature|1797]].&lt;ref&gt;William Davenport Adams, ''A Dictionary of the Drama'', Vol. 1, Philadelphia, J. P. Lippincott, 1904; p. 399.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Bishop (composer)|Henry Bishop]] mounted an operatic version in 1814.)

The picture was reproduced as a steel-plate etching in 1828. The print bore a poem on the same subject, "Sadak the Wanderer," which was attributed by some to [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. Modern editors of Shelley are skeptical.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Reiman and Neil Fraistat, eds., ''The Complete Poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley'', Vol. 1, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000;  pp. 460-68.&lt;/ref&gt;

With this and his subsequent paintings, Martin gained a reputation for replicating the effects of stained glass on canvas.&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Yampolsky, "Transparency Painting: From Myth to Theater," in: ''Tekstura: Russian Essays on Visual Culture,'' Alla Efimova and Lev Manovich, eds., Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1993; p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He employed a strong "chemical red" hue to express volcanic landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Yampolsky, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years the painting was known only in a reduced version in the Southampton Art Gallery. The full-size original was discovered in Sweden and acquired by the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;"Recent Acquisitions at The Saint Louis Art Museum: Supplement," ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 130 No. 1018 (January 1988), pp. 63-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Martin followed ''Sadak'' with ''Adam's First Sight of Eve'' (1813) and ''Clytie'' (1814), both shown at the Royal Academy.

By many, Martin's best work was ''Sadak in the Search of the Waters of Oblivion''

The '''''San Zaccaria Altarpiece''''' (also called '''''Madonna Enthroned with Child and Saints''''') is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Giovanni Bellini]],  executed in 1505 and located in the church of [[San Zaccaria]], [[Venice]].

==History==
The work was mentioned in 1648 by writer and painter [[Carlo Ridolfi]] as a large panel commissioned in memory of Venetian politician and diplomat Pietro Cappello; he described it as "one of the most beautiful and delicate by the artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Carlo Ridolfi|first=C. |last=Ridolfi|title=Le Meraviglie dell’arte, over le Vite degli illustri Pittori Veneti e dello Stato|volume=I|location=venice|year=1648|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Bellini's first work in which the influence of [[Giorgione]] is undeniable, starting the  last phase in the artist's career, a tonalist one&lt;ref name="Mariolina"&gt;{{cite book|first=Mariolina |last=Olivari|chapter=Giovanni Bellini|title=Pittori del Rinascimento|publisher=Scala|location=Florence|year=2007|isbn=888117099X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The work is set in a large niche, depicting a [[sacred conversation]] within an established scheme: the Madonna and Child enthroned, a musician angel on a step and four saints placed symmetrically at the sides. They are St. Peter the Apostle, St. Catherine of Alexandria, St. Lucy and St. Jerome.&lt;ref name="Mariolina"/&gt;

While the general ensemble is not different from previous works, such as the [[San Giobbe Altarpiece]] (which shares the apse with mosaics, for example), Bellini introduced some novelties, such as the side openings with landscape, inspired by [[Alvise Vivarini]]  Battutii Altarpiece, once in Belluno (now lost). The colors and light show the new adherence of Bellini to Giorgione's color and mood style.

The egg above Mary's head is a symbol of the creation, perhaps a citation of [[Piero della Francesca]]'s [[Brera Altarpiece]]. The [[lucerne]] below recalls [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s [[San Zeno Altarpiece]].

Sensory gardens can be designed in such a way as to be accessible and enjoyable for both [[disabled]] and non-disabled users. A sensory garden, for example, may contain features accessible to the disabled individual such as: scented and edible plants, sculptures and sculpted handrails, water features designed to make sound and play over the hands, textured touch-pads, magnifying-glass screens, braille and audio [[induction loop]] descriptions.  Depending on the user group, other provisions may integrate sound and music more centrally to combine the play needs of younger users with their sensory needs.

Many sensory gardens devote themselves to providing experience for multiple senses; those specialising in scent are sometimes called [[scented gardens]], those specialising in music/sound are sound gardens where the equipment doubles up to provides an enhanced opportunity for strategic developmental, learning and educational outcomes.

Sensory Gardens usually have an enhanced infrastructure to permit [[wheelchair access]] and meet other accessibility concerns; the design and layout provides a stimulating journey through the senses, heightening awareness, and bringing positive learning experiences.

[[File:WSTM Mark Frank 0039.jpg|thumb|The Flea Theater]]
'''The Flea Theater''', founded in 1996, is a [[theatre]] in the [[TriBeCa]] section of [[New York City]].  It presents primarily new American theatre, and provides a venue for film stars to act on a very small (74-seat) stage, as well as a smaller black box theater for experimental and new works. The theater was founded by distinguished downtown theater artists: director [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]], playwright [[Mac Wellman]], and designer [[Kyle Chepulis]].  The Flea earned early acclaim for original productions of post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9-11]] play "[[The Guys]]" and political works by [[A. R. Gurney]]. “Since its inception in 1996, The Flea has presented over 100 plays and numerous dance and live music performances. Under Artistic Director Jim Simpson and Producing Director Carol Ostrow,  The Flea is one of New York’s leading off-off-Broadway companies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/theater/flea-theater-gets-a-place-to-call-home.html Flea Theater Gets A Place To Call Home, New York Times 12/8/2013] The New York Times, Retrieved April 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1996, the award-winning{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Flea Theater was originally formed out of the purely artistic impulse to create “a joyful hell in a small space”.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} "Soon thereafter a more formal mission was born: to present distinctive work that raises the standards of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] for artists &amp; audiences alike…Non-institutional and resolutely noncommercial, The Flea embodies the spirit of adventure and experimentation that has defined Off-Off-Broadway since its inception. Despite its tiny capacity, more than 17,000 adventurous New Yorkers make their way to The Flea each year. Because of the huge variety, the Flea draws students, uptown residents, downtown enthusiasts—in short, as diverse a group in age, interests, and ethnicity as lives in the city itself. And while its primary service area is Lower Manhattan, in recent years their burgeoning reputation has brought audiences and patrons from throughout the tri-state area.”{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In March of 2015, The Flea announced that Niegel Smith would be taking over for Jim Simpson as its new artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/flea-theater-names-niegel-smith-as-next-artistic-director/|title=Flea Theater Names Niegel Smith as Next Artistic Director|first=Michael|last=Paulson|date=29 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production highlights include "Oh the Humanity and Other Exclamations", by Pulitzer finalist [[Will Eno]], starring Marisa Tomei and Brian Hutchison. This transcendent collection of five short plays extended through winter 2008. Another recent Flea hit was "Mrs. Farnsworth", a timely political comedy written specially for The Flea by renowned playwright A.R. Gurney. Performed by the incomparable duo of Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow, Mrs. Farnsworth won rave reviews and returned to The Flea for a special encore in the fall. For two years in a row, The New York Times named a Flea production as one of the best Off-Broadway shows of the season—"Mrs. Farnsworth" in 2004 and "O Jerusalem" in 2003. Recent productions include "The Great Recession", six plays commissioned by The Flea exploring the impact of the current economic crisis on the younger generation by Thomas Bradshaw, Sheila Callaghan, Erin Courtney, Will Eno, Itamar Moses and Adam Rapp, Jonathan Reynold’s "Girls in Trouble" and Bathsheba Doran’s "Parents’ Evening".

==New Works==
The Flea produces several original major productions each year, along with new work by the most iconoclastic, imaginative, and talented artists. Each year The Flea presents and produces dozens of new works in an environment that is professional, welcoming, and intimate.  Flea artists have been honored with two OBIE Awards, an Otto Award and, in May 2004, The Flea was given a Drama Desk Award for Distinguished Achievement commending its dedication to adventurous theater. With the continued participation of its founders and an ever-growing community of diverse and creative talents, The Flea strives to represent the wide range of what is possible Off-Off-Broadway.

== Awards and Recognition ==
In 2010, The Flea was awarded the [[American Theatre Wing]]'s National Theatre Company Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/American-Theatre-Wing-Announces-2010-National-Theatre-Company-Grants-20010101|title=American Theatre Wing Announces 2010 National Theatre Company Grants|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The BATS==
The Bats are the resident acting company of The Flea Theater. Each year over a thousand actors audition for a place in this unique company. The Bats perform in extended runs of challenging classic and new plays. Not a school, but a repertory company, the Bats also work to support all the visiting performing artists at The Flea Theater.

Past Bat productions include: "Benten Kozo", an Obie award winning production that played for over 6 months, "The Great Recession" by Thomas Bradshaw, "These Seven Sicknesses" by Sean Graney,
and "Future Anxiety" by Laurel Haines.

“The performances by the Bats, the Flea’s young resident company, are all well thought out and fresh. The Bats are most definitely a talented group of young artists.” – NYtheatre.com

==Resident Director Program==
Modeled after The Flea Theater’s successful resident company of actors, The Bats (now in its 16th season), this intensive residency program allow a small team of young directors to work, train and direct in support of The Flea’s season under the supervision of Artistic Director Jim Simpson and The Flea Theater staff. Applicants must be ready to roll up their sleeves and get involved with all aspects of theater production- dilettantes need not apply.

==#serials@theflea==
Created by Dominic Spillane and Stephen Stout #serials@theflea is a raucous late night play competition featuring The Bats and some of NYC’s hottest young playwrights and directors. This event, which runs Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays at 11pm, includes 1 FREE beer with the purchase of a ticket. All tickets are only $12. In #serials@theflea, five teams of Bats perform original ten-minute episodic plays. The audience votes for its three favorite plays, which return the next week with a new installment.

'''The Flying Grass Carpet''' is a huge rug entirely made of [[artificial grass]]. It travels around the world, as a temporary landscape. It's intended as space to play on and enjoy, but can also be used for picnics, open-air festivals and sports .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flying carpet, or pop-up pasture?|url=http://springwise.com/lifestyle_leisure/flying_carpet_or_pop-up_pastur/?format=print|work=Lifestyle &amp; Leisure|publisher=www.springwise.com|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The designers of The Flying Grass Carpet live in [[Rotterdam]], a city known for its designers and [[architects]]. The designers of the Flying Grass Carpet are fond of cities and city-life but are concerned about the loss of quality of the public space in a lot of cities. To make a positive gesture they created The Flying Grass Carpet.

The Flying Grass Carpet travels to different places around the world, and stays in the different locations for a short period of time.  It's intended to function as an actual park, allowing people to enjoy all the activities they can normally only enjoy in the park, in the middle of the city. The Flying Grass Carpet is also intended to connect different cities and their citizens with each other, and create what its designers call a "worldwide shared public domain".  [[Image:Tfgctech.jpg|thumb|alt=A''[[Technical Details]]''.]]

==Technical details==
The carpet contains several types and colors of grass. It weighs 6375 kilograms (6.5&amp;nbsp;kg per square meter). The size of the carpet is adjustable, and can be up to 25 by 36 meters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flyinggrasscarpet.org/tech.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Award==
The Flying Grass Carpet won a '[[Dutch Design Award]]' in 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dutch design awards|url=http://www.dutchdesignawards.nl/nl/hall_of_fame/2009/&amp;id=589|accessdate=27 October 2010|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Kitchen Maid''''' is a 1738 painting by [[Jean Simeon Chardin]]. The painting features a young kitchen maid in a Hollandish kitchen, taking a break from her work. The work was popular, and Chardin had made four different copies; with three of them present in various collections in the modern day.

==Background==
Chardin was born in [[Paris]], the son of a cabinetmaker, and rarely left the city. Chardin entered into a marriage contract with Marguerite Saintard in 1723, whom he did not marry until 1731.{{sfn | Rosenberg | 2000 | p=179}}  According to one nineteenth-century writer, at a time when it was hard for unknown painters to come to the attention of the [[Royal Academy]], he first found notice by displaying a painting at the "small Corpus Christi"  on the [[Place Dauphine]]. [[Jean-Baptiste van Loo|Van Loo]], passing by in 1720, bought it and later assisted the young painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?dq=intitle:Pont-neuf+inauthor&amp;q=Chardin&amp;pg=PA300&amp;id=w3jG6Xy1rHUC#v=snippet&amp;q=Chardin&amp;f=false|title=Histoire du Pont-Neuf|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon presentation of ''[[The Ray (painting)|The Ray]]'' in 1728, he was admitted to the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture. The following year he ceded his position in the Académie de Saint-Luc. He made a modest living by "produc[ing] paintings in the various genres at whatever price his customers chose to pay him",{{sfn | Rosenberg | 2000 | p=56}} and by such work as the restoration of the [[fresco]]es at the Galerie François I at [[Fontainebleau]] in 1731.{{sfn | Rosenberg | 2000 | p=20}}
In November 1731 his son Jean-Pierre was baptized, and a daughter, Marguerite-Agnès, was baptized in 1733. In 1735 his wife Marguerite died, and within two years Marguerite-Agnès had died as well.{{sfn | Rosenberg | 2000 | p=179}}

==Subject and composition==
Chardin's pigments are granular, his palette earthy, and his handling is thick. {{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}}The light of the painting has been described as subdued, with nothing being sudden or jarring. There is a superficial reference to Hollandish kitchens, and this is done only with respect to the props and predominantly brown coloring.{{sfn | Tsaneva | 2014 | p=49}} The primary object of the painting is a young kitchen [[maid]] on a low chair, looking to the right of the viewer during what appears to be a pause from her task.{{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}} The expression on the maid's face is one that is neither of sadness nor one of joy; picturing a [[woman]] that is focused on her work. The pictoral space is bounded, with a quality of contentment and timelessness. {{sfn | Tsaneva | 2014 | p=49}} One the floor are assorted [[vegetables]], some cooking pots, and a [[butcher's block]]. The block features a meat-cleaver with a spat of blood, bringing in the suggestion of violence to the purposed domestic reflection.{{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}}

It is unknown whether or not Chardin had intended for there to be a message in the painting, or if at all in any of his paintings. Despite portraying a [[servant]] helping in domestic tasks——described to be of a low social scale——the woman was still dressed well. In addition, the kitchen is kept in neat order; a sharp contrast to the portrayals of domestic servants in other paintings of the time. Nevertheless, the maid is still not a model of [[industry]] either, as the viewer in intended to speculate on what the maid is speculating in her moment of pause.It has been mentioned by critics that there is a sensous quality in Chardin's execution, in design, and in the choice of his colors. The techniques of [[ambiguity]] and sense has been noted to be a common trait for many of Chardin's works. {{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}}

==Exhibition==
Chardin first exhibited the painting along with five other works at the Salon of 1739 as '''''La Ratisseuse de Navets (Woman scraping Turnips)'''''. When the painting was first submitted, it drew little attention from critics due to the success of his other painting: ''The Governess''. {{sfn | Tsaneva | 2014 | p=49}}{{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}} Chardin painted at least three versions of the painting. The existing works are  the [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] copy, signed and dated to 1738; another in [[Munich]], signed and dated to 1746; a copy given by Count Rudolf von Rothenburg for [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]] of Prussia, lost since 1918; and the fourth copy in the [[Netherlands]], believed to be a studio copy. The existence of four copies of the painting attests to the success of the painting with some copies, such as the Washington copy, being at some point acquired by royals such as the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]]. {{sfn | Bailey | Conisbee | Gaehtgens | Canada | 2003 | p=192}}

'''''The Mystery of Oberwald''''' ({{lang-it|'''Il mistero di Oberwald'''}}) is a 1980 Italian drama film written, directed, and edited by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]] and starring [[Monica Vitti]], [[Paolo Bonacelli]], and Franco Branciaroli. Based on the 1946 play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' by [[Jean Cocteau]], the film is about a man who breaks into the castle at Oberwald to kill the queen but faints before doing so. The man's physical resemblance to the murdered king leads to a strange turn of events.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received the Italian National Syndicate of Film Journalists Silver Ribbon in 1982.&lt;ref name="imdbawards"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Internet Movie Database'' |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081165/awards |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
During the nineteenth century, a young radical poet named Sebastian (Franco Branciaroli) breaks into an old dilapidated castle in Oberwald on a dark stormy night intending to kill the queen and free his country. The queen ([[Monica Vitti]]) has been in mourning for ten years for her husband the king who was assassinated on their wedding day. Sebastian, who faints before he can kill the queen, is the spitting image of the assassinated king. Sebastian and the queen talk, and the queen discovers that Sebastian once wrote a subversive poem that she liked, even though it was attacking her. The queen dares Sebastian to kill her, otherwise she vows to kill him.

==Cast==
* [[Monica Vitti]] as The Queen
* [[Paolo Bonacelli]] as Count of Foehn
* Franco Branciaroli as Sebastian
* Elisabetta Pozzi as Edith de Berg

==Reception==
Upon its theatrical release, ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' received generally negative reviews. In his review in ''The New York Times'', Vincent Canby called it "a movie that probably wouldn't last five minutes in front of an audience in control of its wits and with no more than a passing interest in Art for its own sake."&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Canby |first=Vincent |title=Antonioni's 'The Mystery of Oberwald' |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=September 30, 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/30/movies/antonioni-s-mystery-of-oberwald.html |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canby concluded, "The only thing that makes ''The Mystery of Oberwald'' bearable is watching the Italian director's attempts to use video color techniques that are supposed to make more dramatic a fairly conventional narrative."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

On the review aggregator web site ''Rotten Tomatoes'', the film holds a 57% positive rating from critics based on 7 reviews, and a 35% positive audience rating based on 339 user ratings.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mystery of Oberwald |publisher=''Rotten Tomatoes'' |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mystery_of_oberwald/ |accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Secret Art of Dr. Seuss''''' ({{ISBN|0-679-43448-8}}) is a collection of [[visual art]] created by Theodor Seuss Geisel, better known as [[Dr. Seuss]]. It was published in 1995, after Geisel's death, by [[Random House]] of [[New York City|New York]].

==Contents of the book==

===Visual art===
The bulk of this collection consists of [[painting]] and [[drawing]]. It does, however, include photographs of many [[sculpture]]s created by Geisel. Both forms of art display the characteristic [[artistic|style]] and form that can be seen in all of his [[children's books]].

====Sculpture====
All of Dr. Seuss's sculptures display the same themes, which are [[taxidermy]] and [[trophy hunting]]. Each sculpture takes the form of an imaginary and fantastic creature displayed on a wood mount in the style of a hunting [[trophy]]. Most of his pieces in this category make use of authentic animal parts.

===Introduction/foreword===
In addition to visual art, ''Secret Art'' provides more personal insight into the life of Theodor Geisel. The book opens with a very short introductory letter by Geisel's widow, [[Audrey Geisel]], titled "A Personal Note About Theodor Seuss Geisel", as well as an introduction by [[Maurice Sendak]], both of which relate anecdotal tales of Geisel's work ethic and artistic vision.

==Media==
Dr. Seuss used a wide variety of [[recording medium|media]] in his art. In keeping with the [[postmodernism|post-modernist]] tradition, Seuss is very experimental with his media; he even uses a hinged window frame and screen as a frame for one of his oil paintings.

===Paintings and drawings===
Theodor Seuss Geisel's favored medium is [[watercolor]], usually either on [[bristol board|bristol]] or [[illustration]] board. He also makes ample use of [[ink]] or [[pen]], [[oil paint|oil]], and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]]. This selection of media helps to expand his distinctive style.

===Sculpture===
The most distinct aspect of Geisel's sculpture is his choice of medium. As mentioned above, all of his sculptures take the form of hunting-lodge trophies in the forms of surreal or fantasy animals. As if to enhance this effect, Dr. Seuss uses real parts of dead animals and animal [[by-product]]s. Each sculpture is hung on a plain wood mount.

==Classification and analysis==
Many have tried to classify Dr. Seuss's artwork, but there is no true consensus among [[art criticism|critics]] on which [[art movement|school of art]] or movement he belongs to.

Although he was no longer working at the time the terms were coined, he can probably be best defined as a combination of early forms of [[maximalism]] and [[cute formalism]]. This is evident not only in the visual [[aesthetic]] of his work, but also in his work ethic. In the maximalist tradition, his work is very bright, sensual, visually rich, and extremely detailed. He was also very conscientious, and his pieces are all very [[formalism (art)|formalistic]] and work-extensive. All of his pieces also display a childish and playful nature, with a touch of femininity and a sense of ironic politeness, which leads to the assertion that he was a preemptive cute formalist. This observation is particularly interesting because of the evident [[Oriental]] influence on Geisel's art, and both of these movements are centered in Eastern [[Asia]]n culture (Chinese and [[Japan]]ese, respectively).

Some have labeled Seuss's art as [[expressionism|expressionist]], but critics of this argument claim that his working style and ethics were not in-line with those of expressionism. Expressionism is usually defined as the exaggeration or over-emphasis of shapes, forms, and colors to heighten emotional reaction. While Dr. Seuss's art is clearly very exaggerated and emotional, many critics do not believe it was created with the deliberate attempt at emotional "shock value" they see as being characteristic of expressionism.

Neither of these arguments has much critical support, but then, neither do many other arguments concerning the classification of Theodor Seuss Geisel; in fact, he died before some of these terms were even coined. His works were quickly acquired by American [[pop art]] galleries, and some (but very few) critics consider it [[kitsch]]. Perhaps the safest classification is just as [[transgressive art]], or even just the broader umbrella term of [[postmodernism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

'''''The Third of May 1808''''' (also known as '''{{lang|es|El tres de mayo de 1808 en Madrid}}''' or '''{{lang|es|Los fusilamientos de la montaña del Príncipe Pío}}''',&lt;ref&gt;Prado, p.&amp;nbsp;141. "The third of May 1808 in Madrid; the shootings on the Prince Pio Hill".  See [[Príncipe Pío]] for the location.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''{{lang|es|Los fusilamientos del tres de mayo}}'''&lt;ref name="prado"&gt;The Museo del Prado entitles the work ''[http://www.museodelprado.es/coleccion/galeria-on-line/galeria-on-line/obra/el-3-de-mayo-de-1808-en-madrid-los-fusilamientos-en-la-montana-del-principe-pio/ El 3 de mayo de 1808 en Madrid: los fusilamientos en la montaña del Príncipe Pío]''&lt;/ref&gt;) is a painting completed in 1814 by the Spanish painter [[Francisco Goya]], now in the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. In the work, Goya sought to commemorate Spanish resistance to [[Napoleon]]'s armies during the occupation of 1808 in the [[Peninsular War]]. Along with its companion piece of the same size, ''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' (or ''The Charge of the [[Mamluk#Under Napoleon|Mamelukes]]''), it was commissioned by the provisional government of Spain at Goya's suggestion.

The painting's content, presentation, and emotional force secure its status as a groundbreaking, archetypal image of the horrors of war. Although it draws on many sources from both high and popular art, ''The Third of May 1808'' marks a clear break from convention. Diverging from the traditions of Christian art and traditional depictions of war, it has no distinct precedent, and is acknowledged as one of the first paintings of the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, pp.&amp;nbsp;116&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the art historian [[Kenneth Clark]], ''The Third of May 1808'' is "the first great picture which can be called revolutionary in every sense of the word, in style, in subject, and in intention".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;130.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Third of May 1808'' has inspired a number of other major paintings, including a series by [[Édouard Manet]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Massacre in Korea]]'' and ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.

==Background==
{{main|Peninsular War}}
[[Napoleon I of France]] declared himself [[First Consul]] of the [[French Republic]] on  November 10, 1799, and crowned himself Emperor in 1804. Because Spain controlled access to the Mediterranean, the country was politically and strategically important to French interests. The reigning Spanish sovereign, [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles&amp;nbsp;IV]], was internationally regarded as ineffectual. Even in his own court he was seen as a "half-wit king who renounces cares of state for the satisfaction of hunting",&lt;ref name="C1456"&gt;Connell, pp.&amp;nbsp;145&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; and a cuckold unable to control his energetic wife, [[Maria Luisa of Parma]]. Napoleon took advantage of the weak king by suggesting the two nations conquer and divide Portugal, with France and Spain each taking a third of the spoils, and the final third going to the Spanish Prime Minister [[Manuel de Godoy]], along with the title ''Prince of the [[Algarve]]''. Godoy was seduced, and accepted the French offer.  He failed, however, to grasp Napoleon's true intentions, and was unaware that his new ally and co-sovereign, the former king's son [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;VII of Spain]], was using the invasion merely as a ploy to seize the Spanish parliament and throne. Ferdinand intended not only that Godoy be killed during the impending power struggle, but also that the lives of his own parents be sacrificed.&lt;ref name="C1456" /&gt;

Under the guise of reinforcing the Spanish armies, 23,000 French troops entered Spain unopposed in November 1807.&lt;ref&gt;Baines, Edward. ''History of the Wars of the French Revolution''. Philadelphia: McCarty and Davis, 1835. p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Napoleon's intentions became clear the following February, the occupying forces found little resistance apart from isolated actions in disconnected areas, including [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]].&lt;ref&gt;Connell, pp.&amp;nbsp;145&amp;ndash;148.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's principal commander, Marshal [[Joachim Murat]], believed that Spain would benefit from rulers more progressive and competent than the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], and Napoleon's brother [[Joseph Bonaparte]] was to be made king.&lt;ref name="l109"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;109.&lt;/ref&gt; After Napoleon convinced Ferdinand to return Spanish rule to Charles IV, the latter was left with no choice but to abdicate, on March 19, 1808, in favor of Joseph Bonaparte.  
[[File:Manuel Godoy Spain.jpg|thumb|Goya's ''Manuel Godoy, Duke of Alcudia, Prince of the Peace'', 1801. [[Manuel de Godoy|Godoy]] was Prime Minister of Spain during the [[Peninsular War|1808 Napoleonic invasion]] of Spain.]]
Although the Spanish people had accepted foreign monarchs in the past, they deeply resented the new French ruler. On May 2, 1808, provoked by news of the planned removal to France of the last members of the Spanish royal family, the people of Madrid rebelled in the [[Dos de Mayo Uprising]]. A proclamation issued that day to his troops by Marshal Murat read: "The population of Madrid, led astray, has given itself to revolt and murder. French blood has flowed. It demands vengeance. All those arrested in the uprising, arms in hand, will be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Cowans, Jon. "Modern Spain: A Documentary History". University of Pennsylvania Press, May 2003. {{ISBN|0-8122-1846-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goya commemorated the uprising in his ''The Second of May'', which depicts a cavalry charge against the rebels in the [[Puerta del Sol]] square in the center of Madrid, the site of several hours of fierce combat.&lt;ref name="l112"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; Much the better known of the pair, ''The Third of May'' illustrates the French reprisals: before dawn the next day hundreds of Spaniards were rounded up and shot, at a number of locations around Madrid. Civilian Spanish opposition persisted as a feature of the ensuing five-year [[Peninsular War]], the first to be called ''[[guerrilla war]]''.&lt;ref name="l109"/&gt; Irregular Spanish forces considerably aided the Spanish, Portuguese, and British armies jointly led by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Sir Arthur Wellesley]], who first landed in Portugal in August 1808. By the time of the painting's conception, the public imagination had made the rioters symbols of heroism and patriotism.&lt;ref name="murray"&gt;Murray, Christopher John.

Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was personally placed in a difficult position by the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the [[French Revolution]], and hoped for a similar development in Spain. Several of his friends, like the poets [[Juan Meléndez Valdés]] and [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], were overt {{lang|es|[[Afrancesado]]s}}, the term for the supporters—collaborators in the view of many—of Joseph Bonaparte.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; Goya's 1798 portrait of the French ambassador-turned-commandant Ferdinand Guillemardet betrays a personal admiration.&lt;ref name="l111"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guillemardet came to Spain as French ambassador, and was the first foreigner Goya painted. Later Guillemardet brought a copy of the artist's {{lang|es|[[Caprichos]]}} back to France, where they were admired by [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], and influenced the [[Romantic movement]]. Heras, p.&amp;nbsp;73.&lt;/ref&gt; Although he maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary, Goya had by nature an instinctive dislike of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;129.&lt;/ref&gt; He witnessed the subjugation of his countrymen by the French troops.&lt;ref&gt;That Goya had first-hand knowledge of events depicted in ''The Disasters of War'' is underscored by the title of one of his prints, ''I saw it''.&lt;/ref&gt; During these years he painted little, although the experiences of the occupation provided inspiration for drawings that would form the basis for his prints ''The Disasters of War'' ({{lang|es|Los desastres de la guerra}}).&lt;ref name="l111"/&gt;

In February 1814, after the final expulsion of the French, Goya approached the provisional government with a request to "perpetuate by means of his brush the most notable and heroic actions of our glorious insurrection against the Tyrant of Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;126.&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal accepted, Goya began work on ''The Third of May''. It is not known whether he had personally witnessed either the rebellion or the reprisals,&lt;ref name="l112"/&gt; despite many later attempts to place him at the events of either day.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, pp.&amp;nbsp;153&amp;ndash;157. At the time, Goya may have been living in a house at the corner of the Puerta del Sol; however this is disputed and perhaps originated from a suspect account from the novelist [[Antonio de Trueba]] who supposedly heard it from Isidoro, Goya's gardener. Isidoro, it is claimed, said he accompanied the artist on the night of the third as he sketched the corpses of the slain.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The painting==

===Description===
''The Third of May 1808'' is set in the early hours of the morning following the uprising&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Rose-Marie and Hagen, Rainer. "What Great Paintings Say". Taschen, February 28, 2003. p.&amp;nbsp;363. {{ISBN|3-8228-2100-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and centers on two masses of men: one a rigidly poised [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]], the other a disorganized group of captives held at gun point. Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, "by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers' attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target."&lt;ref name="rubens"&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt; A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;This is consistent with Murat's desire to choose as victims members of the lower classes and the clergy who organized them. Boime, p.&amp;nbsp;297.&lt;/ref&gt; To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;It has been suggested that the disarray in which Goya depicted the victims was a decision of prudence: popular resistance to French forces could be memorialized, so long as there was no show of solidarity which would be threatening to the government of Fernando&amp;nbsp;VII. Boime, pp.&amp;nbsp;299&amp;ndash;300.&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the right side stands the firing squad, engulfed in shadow and painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their [[bayonets]] and their [[shako]] headgear form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a {{lang|fr|[[repoussoir]]}} at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance,&lt;ref name="Licht"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; probably including the barracks used by the French.&lt;ref&gt;Now the site of the transplanted [[Nubia]]n temple, the [[Temple of Debod]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the background between the hillside and the shakos is a crowd with torches: perhaps onlookers, perhaps more soldiers or victims.

The ''Second'' and ''Third of May 1808'' are thought to have been intended as parts of a larger series.&lt;ref name="t139"&gt;Tomlinson, p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt; Written commentary and circumstantial evidence suggest that Goya painted four large canvases memorializing the rebellion of May 1808. In his memoirs of the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|Royal Academy]] in 1867, José Caveda wrote of four paintings by Goya of the second of May, and Cristóbal Ferriz—an artist and a collector of Goya—mentioned two other paintings on the theme: a revolt at the royal palace and a defense of artillery barracks.&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt; Contemporary prints stand as precedents for such a series. The disappearance of two paintings may indicate official displeasure with the depiction of popular insurrection.&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt;

===''The Disasters of War''===
[[File:Prado - Los Desastres de la Guerra - No. 26 - No se puede mirar.jpg|left|thumb|[[Goya]]'s {{lang|es|No se puede mirar}} (''One cannot look at this'') in ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' ({{lang|es|Los desastres de la guerra}}), c.&amp;nbsp;1810&amp;ndash;1812. This is a very similar composition—though Goya was freer in expression in the prints than the paintings, in which he conformed more to traditional conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Stoichita, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
Goya's series of [[aquatint]] [[etching]]s ''[[The Disasters of War]]'' ({{lang|es|Los desastres de la guerra}}) was not completed until 1820, although most of the prints were made in the period 1810&amp;ndash;1814.  The album of proofs given by Goya to a friend, however, now in the [[British Museum]], provides many indications of the order in which both the preliminary drawings and the prints themselves were composed.&lt;ref&gt;There were probably preliminary drawings for all of the prints. The album shows a preliminary numbering system, different from the one Goya finally settled on, which probably relates to the order of composition. For example {{lang|es|Yo lo vi}} is no.&amp;nbsp;15 in the first sequence, and no.&amp;nbsp;44 in the final sequence. After the earlier no.&amp;nbsp;19 Goya ran out of good drawing paper from the Netherlands, and began to use whatever he could find. See Bareau, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; The groups identified as the earliest clearly seem to predate the commission for the two paintings, and include two prints with obviously related compositions (illustrated), as well as ''I saw this'', which is presumably a scene witnessed during Goya's trip to Saragossa.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau, pp.&amp;nbsp;49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|es|No se puede mirar}}  (''One cannot look at this'') is clearly related compositionally and thematically;&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, pp.&amp;nbsp;193&amp;ndash;195.&lt;/ref&gt; the female central figure has her arms outstretched, but pointing down, while another figure has his hands clasped in prayer, and several others shield or hide their faces. This time the soldiers are not visible even from behind; only the bayonets of their guns are seen.

{{lang|es|Y no hay remedio}} (''And it cannot be helped'') is another of the early prints, from a slightly later group apparently produced at the height of the war when materials were unobtainable, so that Goya had to destroy the plate of an earlier landscape print to make this and another piece in the ''Disasters'' series.  It shows a shako-wearing firing squad in the background, this time seen receding in a frontal rather than a rear view.&lt;ref name="Bareau, pp. 48–50"/&gt;

===Iconography and invention===
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', 1830. A later example of revolutionary art, which retains the idealized and heroic style of [[history painting]] that Goya had dramatically broken with.&lt;ref name="l124"/&gt;]]
At first the painting met with mixed reactions from art critics and historians. Artists had previously tended to depict war in the high style of [[history painting]], and Goya's unheroic description was unusual for the time. According to some early critical opinion the painting was flawed technically: the perspective is flat, or the victims and executioners are standing too close together to be realistic. Although these observations may be strictly correct, the writer [[Richard Schickel]] argues that Goya was not striving for academic propriety but rather to strengthen the overall impact of the piece.&lt;ref name="Conn1589"&gt;Connell, pp.&amp;nbsp;158&amp;ndash;159.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Third of May'' references a number of earlier works of art, but its power comes from its bluntness rather than its adherence to traditional compositional formulas.&lt;ref name="Licht"/&gt; Pictorial artifice gives way to the epic portrayal of unvarnished brutality. Even the contemporary [[Romanticism|Romantic painters]]—who were also intrigued with subjects of injustice, war, and death—composed their paintings with greater attention to the conventions of beauty, as is evident in [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' (1818&amp;ndash;1819) and [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s 1830 painting ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''.&lt;ref name="l124"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goya 3may hand.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the victim's right hand which shows a [[stigmata|stigma]]—a wound such as Christ suffered when nailed to the cross&lt;ref name="l121"/&gt;]]
The painting is structurally and thematically tied to traditions of [[martyrdom]] in Christian art, as exemplified in the dramatic use of [[chiaroscuro]], and the appeal to life juxtaposed with the inevitability of imminent execution.&lt;ref name="l121"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Goya's painting departs from this tradition. Works that depicted violence, such as those by [[Jusepe de Ribera]], feature an artful technique and harmonious composition which anticipate the "crown of martyrdom" for the victim.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Third of May'' the man with raised arms at the focal point of the composition has often been compared to a [[crucifixion|crucified]] Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Spivey, p.&amp;nbsp;195.&lt;/ref&gt; and a similar pose is sometimes seen in depictions of Christ's nocturnal ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' of Gethsemane.&lt;ref&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;121; including an [[commons:Image:Goya Christ.jpg|1819 painting by Goya]].&lt;/ref&gt; Goya's figure displays [[stigmata]]-like marks on his right hand,&lt;ref name="l121"/&gt; while the lantern at the center of the canvas references a traditional [[emblem|attribute]] of the Roman soldiers who arrested Christ in the garden.&lt;ref&gt;In depictions since the 12th century, according to Schiller p.&amp;nbsp;56.  Specifically the man who [[Saint Peter]] attacks with a sword often had the lantern, which he drops to the ground when attacked. The scenes of the ''[[Agony in the Garden]]'' of Gethsemane and the ''Arrest of Christ'' were central in the development of the depiction of nocturnal scenes in art.&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is he posed as if in crucifixion, he wears yellow and white: the heraldic colors of the [[Pope|papacy]].&lt;ref name="l122"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Saint barthelemy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]'s 1722 ''St. Bartholomew'' is a traditional scene of martyrdom, with the saint beseeching God. Goya drew inspiration from the iconography of such violent scenes.]]
The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by [[Baroque]] artists, and perfected by [[Caravaggio]].&lt;ref name="l119"&gt;Licht, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God. Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations; but in ''The Third of May'' the lantern manifests no such miracle. Rather, it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work, and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence. The traditional role of light in art as a [[Conduit (spiritualism)|conduit]] for the spiritual has been subverted.&lt;ref name="l119"/&gt;

The victim, as presented by Goya, is as anonymous as his killers. His entreaty is addressed not to God in the manner of traditional painting, but to an unheeding and impersonal firing squad.&lt;ref name="l121"/&gt; He is not granted the heroism of individuality, but is merely part of a continuum of victims. Beneath him lies a bloody and disfigured corpse; behind and around him are others who will soon share the same fate. Here, for the first time, according to biographer Fred Licht, nobility in individual martyrdom is replaced by futility and irrelevance, the victimization of mass murder, and anonymity as a hallmark of the modern condition.&lt;ref name="l122"/&gt;

The way the painting shows the progress of time is also without precedent in Western art.&lt;ref name="l122"/&gt; The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. ''The Third of May'' offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome is seen in the corpse of a man, splayed on the ground in the lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible.&lt;ref name="l124"/&gt; The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.&lt;ref name="l122"/&gt;

Finally, there is no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's brutality through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme.&lt;ref name="Licht125127"&gt;Licht, pp.&amp;nbsp;125&amp;ndash;127.&lt;/ref&gt; The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish.&lt;ref&gt;Gudiol (1971), p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; Few would admire the work for painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.&lt;ref name="Licht125127" /&gt;

==Provenance==
[[File:La familia de Carlos IV, Francisco de Goya.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Charles IV of Spain and His Family]]'', 1800&amp;ndash;1801. Although Goya had painted many portraits of the [[House of Bourbon]], they did not consider ''The Third of May 1808'' as "suitable subject matter" for the royal collection.]]
Despite the work's commemorative value, no details about its first exhibition are known, and it is not mentioned in any surviving contemporaneous accounts.  This lack of commentary may be due to Fernando&amp;nbsp;VII's preference for neoclassical art,&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson, pp.&amp;nbsp;137&amp;ndash;139.&lt;/ref&gt; and to the fact that popular revolts of any kind were not regarded as suitable subject matter by the restored [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. A monument to the fallen in the uprising, also commissioned in 1814 by the provisional government, "was stopped by Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;VII, in whose eyes the senators and heroes of the war of independence found small favour, on account of their reforming tendencies".&lt;ref&gt;Ford, p.&amp;nbsp;678.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some accounts the painting lay in storage for thirty to forty years before being shown to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Hughes, Robert]]. "[http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1055165,00.html The Unflinching Eye]". ''The Guardian'', October 4, 2003. Retrieved on April 18, 2008. But see also Gautier. Ford, p.&amp;nbsp;686, mentions only a couple of Goyas in the Prado, and is generally dismissive: "he delighted in dirty subjects from which others revolt. Those who admire him should visit his son Don Javier (No.&amp;nbsp;9, {{lang|es|C.&amp;nbsp;de las Aguas}}), who has many of his father's sketches and paintings."&lt;/ref&gt; Its mention in an 1834 Prado inventory shows that the painting remained in the possession of the government or monarchy;&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt; much of the royal collection had been transferred to the museum upon its opening in 1819. [[Théophile Gautier]] mentioned seeing "a massacre" by Goya during a visit to the museum in 1845, and a visitor in 1858 noted it as well, though both accounts refer to the work as depicting the events of the second of May,&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt; perhaps because {{lang|es|[[Dos de Mayo]]}} continues to be the Spanish name for the whole episode.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase in full is {{lang|es|El levantamiento del dos de mayo}}, but this celebrated sequence of events in the nation's history is normally referred to simply as {{lang|es|El dos de mayo}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte considered the painting important enough to warrant its own special exhibition,&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt; but it was not until 1872 that ''The Third of May'' was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title ''Scene of the Third of May 1808''.&lt;ref name="t139"/&gt; Both the ''Third'' and ''Second of May'' suffered damage in a road accident while being transported by truck to [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] for safety during the [[Spanish Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;Prado, p.&amp;nbsp;140.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently the only time they have left Madrid.  Significant paint losses to the left side of the ''Second of May'' have been deliberately left unrepaired.  [[Art conservation and restoration|Restoration work]] to both paintings was done in 2008 in time for an exhibition marking the bicentennial of the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;

In 2009, the Prado selected ''The Third of May 1808'' as one of the museum's fourteen most important paintings, to be displayed in [[Google Earth]] at a resolution of 14,000 megapixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/jan/14/museums-internet-google-earth-prado|title=Online gallery zooms in on Prado's masterpieces (even the smutty bits)|author=Giles Tremlett|date=January 14, 2009|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|[[Jacques-Louis David]]'s paintings, ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' is considered a likely source for elements of Goya's ''The Third of May 1808''.&lt;ref name="B2" /&gt;]]
The most likely sources for ''The Third of May'' were popular imagery, prints, and broadsides. Depictions of firing squads were common in Spanish political imagery during the Napoleonic War,&lt;ref name="TL1436"&gt;Tomlinson, pp.&amp;nbsp;143&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; and Goya's appropriations suggest that he envisaged paintings of heroic scale that would appeal to the general public.&lt;ref name="TL1436" /&gt; Miguel Gamborino's 1813 devotional print ''The Assassination of Five Monks from Valencia'' is thought to have served as a source for Goya's composition.&lt;ref&gt;Connell, p.&amp;nbsp;158.&lt;/ref&gt; Points of similarity include a victim in a posture of crucifixion, whose white garment sets him apart from his companions; a [[tonsure]]d monk with clenched hands who kneels to his left; and an executed corpse lying in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p.&amp;nbsp;314.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geometry of the composition may be an ironic comment on the French painter [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s 1784 work ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]''. The outstretched arms of David's three Roman [[Horatii]] in [[Roman salute|salute]] are transmuted into the rifles of the firing squad; the upraised arms of the Horatii's father become the victim's gesture as he faces his executioners. While David painted his figures' expressions with a neoclassical luster, Goya's reply is fashioned from brutal realism.&lt;ref name="B2"&gt;Boime, p.&amp;nbsp;211.&lt;/ref&gt; Goya may also have been responding to a painting by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]]; the French occupation of Madrid is the subject of Gros's ''[[commons:Image:GrosCaptureOfMadrid.jpg|Capitulation of Madrid, The Fourth of December 1808]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, Hugh.

==Legacy==
[[File:Edouard Manet 022.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'' (1868–1869), is one of five versions of his representation of the execution of the Austrian-born Emperor of Mexico, which took place on June 19, 1867. Manet borrowed heavily, thematically and technically, from Goya's ''The Third of May 1808.''&lt;ref name="danto" /&gt;]]

The first paraphrasing of ''The Third of May'' was [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Lee.; "A New Source for Manet's 'Execution of Maximilian'". The Burlington Magazine, Volume 119, Ed. 893, August 1977. pp.&amp;nbsp;560&amp;ndash;564.&lt;/ref&gt; painted in several versions between 1867 and 1869. In recording a current event to which neither he nor the emerging art of photography was witness,&lt;ref name="danto" /&gt; Manet seems inspired by Goya's precedent. He may have seen the work at the Prado in 1865 before beginning his own paintings, which were too sensitive to be exhibited in France in Manet's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/2006/Manet/detail_the_third_of_may.htm Manet and the Execution of Maximilian]".

''Édouard Manet: Rebel in a frock coat''. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997. p.&amp;nbsp;216. {{ISBN|0-226-07544-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic [[Arthur Danto]] compares Goya's work and Manet's:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Third of May'' also depicts an execution, an early event in the so-called Peninsular War between France and Spain. Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Spain in 1808, capturing its royal family and replacing them with his brother, Joseph. The French were as unpopular in Spain as they later were in Mexico, and they encountered a fierce insurrection, which ultimately triumphed. The ''Third of May'' execution was an indiscriminate killing of civilians by French soldiers in reprisal for a guerrilla attack the previous day. Goya's painting of the massacre, which shows terrified civilians facing a firing squad, was intended to arouse anger and hatred on the part of Spanish viewers. Goya's is a highly romantic picture of a deeply emotional episode.&lt;ref name="danto"&gt;Danto, Arthur C. "Surface Appeal". ''The Nation'', January 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''The Third of May'' is cited as an influence on [[Pablo Picasso]]'s 1937 ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'', which shows the aftermath of the Nazi German [[bombing of Guernica]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/picasso/education/ed_JTE_ITG.html An Introduction to Guernica]".

Retrieved on April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the room was Picasso's ''[[Massacre in Korea]]'', painted in 1951 during the [[Korean War]]—an even more direct reference to the composition of ''The Third of May''.&lt;ref name="keen" /&gt; The perpetrators in this painting were intended to be the [[United States Army]] or their United Nations allies.

''Picasso''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1955. p.&amp;nbsp;302.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Aldous Huxley]] wrote in 1957 that Goya lacked Rubens' ability to fill the canvas with an ordered composition; but he considered ''The Third of May'' a success because Goya "is speaking in his native language, and he is therefore able to express what he wants to say with maximum force and clarity".&lt;ref name="Conn1589" /&gt;

Kenneth Clark remarked on the painting's radical departure from [[history painting]], and its singular intensity:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With Goya we do not think of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May is a kind of superior journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Theatrical constraints''' are various rules, either of taste or of law, that govern the production, staging, and content of [[Play (theatre)|stage play]]s in the [[theater]].   Whether imposed externally, by virtue of [[monopoly]] franchises or [[censorship]] laws, or whether imposed voluntarily by actors, [[theatre director|director]]s, or [[theatrical producer|producer]]s, these restraints have taxed the creative minds of the theatre to  tackle the challenges of working with and around them.

The [[Classical unities]], requiring "unity" of "time, place, and subject", is the most well-known of all theatrical constraints.  It was first employed by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] and later became more fully embraced in France. Another example is the Japanese prohibition of female acting in 1625, then the prohibition of young male actors in 1657, that create "[[Kabuki|Onnagata]]" which is the ground of Japanese theatrical tradition.  In the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] theatre of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], a similar ban forbade all actresses from appearing on stage, at all; the parts of women were generally played by boys.  The plot of ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' turns on this fact.

In [[film|cinema]], the [[Dogme 95]] films form a body of work produced under voluntary constraints that severely limit both the choice of subjects and the choice of techniques used to bring them to the screen.

Another culturally significant constraint occurred in France.  In the late seventeenth century (1697 to be exact), Italian companies were prohibited from appearing in France, so native actors – strolling players going from fairground to fairground, market place to market place – took over the Italian plays and made the roles their own with great success.

But this aroused the jealousy of the [[Comédie-Française]] which decided to outlaw all spoken dialogue except in its own theatre. To overcome this, the travelling players divided their plays into soliloquies and performed nothing but monologues – which brought them even greater success than previously.   One actor would say his lines, run off into the wings, while another appeared in order to reply. He would then go off in his turn, allowing the first one to come back and reply, and so on and so forth.

After this, the Comédie-Française declared that they alone had the right to use speech on stage. Consequently, the public theatre found its way round this by using song instead of speech – and this is how French [[Operetta]] came into being. But then the Academy of Music proclaimed that they alone should be given the right to sing!

So in the markets and fairgrounds the itinerant actors created a new theatrical form by holding up cue-cards (like sub-titles or [[karaoke]]) containing the words of the plays or songs, which the audience then acted or sang for them. This became even more successful, with crowds coming from all around to see how the actors had overcome such rigid censorship.

Some of the restrictions, or traditions born of them, may have still been in place in the nineteenth century, at least if [[Marcel Carné]]'s ''[[Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' is a reliable guide.  This also explains why France has given the world so many [[mime artist|mime]]s.

[[File:Vitae patrum von Heribert Rosweyde 1615.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the 1615 first edition of ''Vitae Patrum'' by [[Heribert Rosweyde]]]]The '''''Vitae Patrum''''' (literally '''''Lives of the Fathers''''', also called ''Lives of the Desert Fathers'') is an encyclopedia of [[hagiography|hagiographical]] writings on the [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] of early Christianity.  The bulk of the original texts date from the third and fourth centuries.&lt;ref name="Leader2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anne Leader|title=The Badia of Florence: Art and Observance in a Renaissance Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BjS8j-6mf1UC&amp;pg=PA140|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=30 December 2011|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-35567-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vitae-patrum.org.uk/|title=Vitae Patrum|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lives that were originally written in Greek were translated into Latin between the fourth and the seventh century. An Italian vernacular translation was made by Dominican friar [[Domenico Cavalca]] from [[Pisa]] at the beginning of the fourteenth century.
A printed edition, edited by the Jesuit [[Heribert Rosweyde]], was printed by Balthazar Moret in 1615. The book is a significant part of the much broader work, ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]''.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hippolyte Delehaye|title=The work of the Bollandists through three centuries, 1615-1915|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjoKxXmj6EC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1922|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=17–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Vitae Patrum'' is based on extensive research by Rosweyde into all the available literature he could find on the early desert monastics. [[Hippolyte Delehaye]] described the work as "the epic of the origins of monasticism in Egypt and Syria, an epic unsurpassed in interest and grandeur." In the thirteenth century, a version of ''Vitae Patrum'' had been translated into Latin. It was such a popular book that numerous versions and editions were published, with extensive changes and variations in the stories. Rosweyde based his book on  twenty-three different versions of those earlier books, studying, dating, and classifying all the different versions and changes.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Rosweyde's ''Vitae Patrum'' consists of ten books. Book I has the lives of sixteen saints under the title ''Vitae virorum'' and eleven saints under the title ''Vitae mulierum'', beginning with [[St. Paul the Hermit]] and [[St. Anthony of the Desert]], and including women saints such as [[The Life of Saint Mary the Harlot|Saint Mary the Harlot]]. Books II, ''Historia monachorum'', and III, ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders), are attributed to [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]], who was later found to be only their translator. Book IV is a compilation of writings by [[Sulpicius Severus]] and [[John Cassian]]. Book V is another collection of ''Verba seniorum'' from Latin and Greek by [[Pelagius]].&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

Book VI and Book VII are further collections of ''Verba seniorum'' (Sayings of the Elders) by unknown Greek authors translated by John the subdeacon, possibly [[Pope John III]], and by [[Paschasius]]. Book VIII is a text that was previously known as ''The Paradise of Heraclides'', but which Rosweyde attributed to its real author, [[Palladius of Galatia|Palladius]], and titled the ''[[Lausiac History]]''. Book IX is ''De Vitis Patrum'' by [[Theodoret]]. Book X is ''The Spiritual Meadow of Moschus''. Rosweyde wrote an introduction to each book.&lt;ref name="Delehaye1922" /&gt;

'''William Hodges''' [[Royal Academician|RA]] (28 October 1744 – 6 March 1797) was an [[England|English]] [[painting|painter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Hodges, William (1744-1797)|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of [[James Cook]]'s [[Second voyage of James Cook|second voyage]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], and is best known for the sketches and paintings of locations he visited on that voyage, including [[Table Bay]], [[Tahiti]], [[Easter Island]], [[New Zealand]], [[Dusky Sound]] and the [[Antarctic]].

==Biography==
Hodges was born on 28 October 1744 in [[London]].  He studied under [[William Shipley]], and afterwards in the studio of [[Richard Wilson (painter)|Richard Wilson]], where he met [[Thomas Jones (artist)|Thomas Jones]].

During his early career, he made a living by painting [[theatrical scenery]].

Between 1772 and 1775 Hodges accompanied [[James Cook]] to the Pacific as the expedition's artist.  Many of his sketches and wash paintings were adapted as [[engraving]]s in the original published edition of Cook's journals from the voyage.

Most of the large-scale [[landscape]] [[oil paintings]] from his Pacific travels for which Hodges is best known were finished after his return to [[London]]; he received a salary from the [[Admiralty]] for the purposes of completing them.  These paintings depicted a stronger [[light]] and [[shadow]] than had been usual in European landscape tradition.  Contemporary art critics complained that his use of light and colour contrasts gave his paintings a rough and unfinished appearance.
[[Image:HodgesA View of Cape Stephens in Cook's Straits New Zealand with Waterspout 1776..jpg|thumb|left|''A View of Cape Stephens in [[Cook Strait|Cook's Straits]] New Zealand with Waterspout'', 1776]]
Hodges also produced many valuable portrait sketches of Pacific islanders and scenes from the voyage involving members of the expedition.

In 1778, under the patronage of [[Warren Hastings]], Hodges travelled to [[India]], one of the first British  professional landscape painters to visit that country.  He remained there for six years, staying in [[Lucknow]] with [[Claude Martin]] in 1783.&lt;ref&gt;Rosie Llewellyn-Jones [https://www.google.com/books?id=_IdAmZ5s7UcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;ots=NEgnct4Wix&amp;dq=%22john+wombwell%22+biography&amp;sig=shbHZ9gDeqBdMQ9uesFbuJsN-Hg A Man of the Enlightenment in Eighteenth-century India: The Letters of Claude Martin, 1766-1800] page 96 accessed July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
His painting of "Futtypoor Sicri" is in [[Sir John Soane's Museum]].

Later Hodges travelled across Europe, including a visit to [[St. Petersburg]] in [[Russia]] in 1790.

In 1793 Hodges published an illustrated book about his travels in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Travels in India, during the years 1780, 1781, 1782, and 1783|author=Hodges, W.|location=London|year=1794|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7UIAAAAQAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1794 Hodges opened an exhibition of twenty-five of his own works at Orme's Gallery, 14 Old Bond Street, London that included two large paintings called ''The Effects of Peace'' and ''The Effects of War''.  In late January, 1795, with Britain engaged in the [[War of the First Coalition]] against [[French First Republic|Revolutionary France]] and feelings running high, the exhibition was visited by [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]], the second son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].  The Duke took offence at the political nature of Hodges' paintings and ordered the exhibition closed; this royal censure effectively ended Hodges' career as a painter. Many of his works were then sold by auction but produced only an inconsiderable sum.

Hodges retired to [[Devon]] and became involved with a bank, which failed during the banking crisis of March, 1797.  On 6 March of that year, he died from what was officially recorded as "gout in the stomach", but which was also rumoured to be [[suicide]] from an overdose of [[laudanum]].

[[Hodges Knoll]] in [[Antarctica]] is named after William Hodges.

==Personal Life==
On 11 May, 1776, Hodges married Martha Bowden Nesbit, the daughter of William and Jane Nesbit, at St George’s, Hanover Square, London.  The couple settled in Pimlico.  They undertook a tour of Wales and the Midlands, during which they visited Derby, where Joseph Wright painted a portrait of Martha Hodges.  Sadly, Martha died within a year, possibly during childbirth.  Having finished his work for the Admiralty, and with the death of his wife, Hodges was free to travel. 

Hodges left India in November 1783, in Worcester.  This ship was nearly wrecked at St. Helena, but reached Britain in June 1784.  Hodges is reputed to have returned a rich man, and settled in Queen Street, Mayfair, where he built himself a studio.  He brought home with him a son, James.  Hodges’ mother looked after her new grandson in a house in Tunbridge Wells, which Hodges purchased.

William Hodges began preparing a collection, Select Views in India in the Years 1780–1783, that included a series of forty-eight aquatints adapted from sketches drawn in India.  On 16 October, 1784, again at St George’s, Hanover Square, Hodges married his second wife, Lydia Wright.  Lydia was the niece of John Whitehurst from Derby.  Unfortunately, she too died after only a few months of marriage, possibly from alcoholism.

n December 1785, Hodges married for a third time.  It was to Ann Mary Carr, a talented pianist, and the oldest of the five children of Benjamin and Elizabeth Carr.  Her parents were already deceased when she married Hodges.  At about the same time, Hodges was listed as the guardian of Ann Mary’s brother, John, later a famous travel writer.  They would have two daughters and three sons together.  Hodges was elected a member of the Royal Academy in 1789, and continued to exhibit there until 1794.  After experiencing financial diffi-culties, he made an unsuccessful trip to seek patronage in Russia in 1792.  On his return, in February, 1793, Hodges published his account of his time in India, entitled Travels in India in the Years 1780, 1781, 1782 and 1783, illustrated with plates derived from his drawings.

In December 1794, Hodges held a private exhibition of 25 of his pictures in old Bond Street, London.  Remarkably, it received no subscription, and made no sales, forcing Hodges to close it by 26 January, 1795.

Totally disillusioned, Hodges retired from his profession, sold his London property, and moved himself and his family, in July, 1795, to Brixham and Dartmouth in South Devon. There, he attempted to restore his fortunes by becoming a partner in a small bank at Dartmouth.  His partner was Thomas Gretton, a lawyer.  Also present in South Devon was Gretton’s brother, the Reverend George Gretton.  The Grettons were the nephews of John and Elizabeth Whitehurst of Derby, further evidence of the family connections with the town.The bank opened in Dartmouth on the 24th August, 1795, and the following is an extract from the Exeter Flying Post dated the 1st October, 1795:

"The public are hereby informed that on this day Bank was opened at Dartmouth in the county of Devon under the firm of J. Seale, Hodges, Gretton and Ful where business will be transacted with the greatest punctuality. Dartmouth, 24th August, 1795."

Banknotes, dated 24 August, 1795, exist, issued by Hodges and Thomas Gretton &amp; Co., payable on demand in Dartmouth or at their London agents, Walwyn, Petrie, Ward and McGregor.  The bank would soon be known as the Dartmouth Bank and incorporated the Arms of Dartmouth on a shield on its notes. In October, 1795, new partners were added, probably to inject new capital into the bank.  They were John Seale, a local landowner, and William Tult.  

John Seale was a very influential person in Dartmouth at the time, holding extensive property and land both in and around Dartmouth. Thomas Gretton was a practising attorney in the town. Not unlike many other banks of the period, there appear to have been problems from quite soon after the bank's inception. The ongoing war with France had severe effects on Dartmouth, and this, together with a stoppage of payments at the Bank of England, caused a run on the bank in March 1797. The Exeter Flying Post of the 13th September, 1798, has an official notice relating to Thomas Gretton's personal bankruptcy. John Seale, however, appears to have come out of this affair with his reputation unscathed as both he and his descendants remained very influential in the area throughout the 19th century.

Hodges died at 10.00 a.m. on Monday, 6th March, 1797. The cause of death, as rumour would have it locally, was through an overdose of laudanum, which Hodges used as medication to treat his stomach gout. Whether the overdose was accidental or deliberate we shall probably never know for certain. However, we do know that he was under severe stress at the time caused by his own parlous financial situation and the impending collapse of the bank, both of which appeared intertwined.  The Burial Register of St. Mary's Church, Brixham records William Hodges, burial 13th March, 1797.  No headstone has been found.

In spite of his financial problems, he nevertheless appeared to be liked and well respected, both locally and farther afield. As a young man, both Cook and Wales enjoyed his company during the three years that he spent on the Resolution on Cook's second epic voyage, and Cook greatly admired the young painter's sea and landscapes of the voyage. The "Gentleman's Magazine" reported of his death in 1797 as follows:

"Of the gout in his stomach, William Hodges Esq. R. A. of Brixham, Devon; a man of varied and considerable knowledge in his art. If he did not rise to the summit of landscape painting, there were in general strength, correctness, and taste in his productions. His paintings and drawings of Asiatic scenery are deservedly admired. With a modesty that always characterizes worth and genius, he retired from the prosecution of his art, conceiving that his place would be filled by men of greater merit. He had, therefore, with the profit of his labours in the East, taken a share in a provincial bank, which, with his attention, his integrity, and the many friends his virtues and talents had procured him, would probably have proved a prosperous undertaking. His personal manners were easy, affable and communicative; and all he said was marked by good sense, truth and simplicity. He has left to regret his loss a numerous train of friends and a widow, who is one of the most amicable and accomplished women in the kingdom, though the delicacy of her mind has chiefly confined the reputation of her merit and abilities within the sphere of domestic intercourse and enjoyment."

Hodges left his wife and children in great want. However, many of his friends soon rallied around to try and ease their burden, and for this, and other information relating to events soon after his death, we have the "Farrington Diaries", written daily as events unfolded. Joseph Farrington R.A. (1747 -1821) studied as a pupil under Richard Wilson R.A. at the same time as Hodges and later both became fellow Royal Academicians. They appear to have remained life long friends.

An entry relating to the disposal of some of Hodges' personal possessions was written some years later on the 3rd October, 1809, when Farrington was journeying through the West Country and visited Brixham:

"_____ told us that after his death there was a sale at his house and that many articles, particularly valuable books, were sold for almost nothing. But that she understood that the most valuable part of his drafts (drawings) as she called them were reserved by Mr. Carr (Sir John), and that though some were sold they were those of the least value."

Sir John Carr, 1772 - 1832, was a native of Totnes (approximately eight miles from Brixham ) who for health reasons frequently travelled abroad and wrote books on his travels. 

As Hodges was employed by the Admiralty on Cook's second voyage and all paintings and drawings of the voyage belonged to them. However, he also repeated some of them.

'''Yomango''' (In Spanish [[slang]], "yo mango" means "I steal") is a [[shoplifting]] movement that originated in [[Barcelona]] ([[Spain]]) in 2002. It is billed as an [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumer]] lifestyle.

It gained publicity when clothes were stolen from a store, put on and worn back to the store in a "fashion show". Some people claim that it is intended to be a parody of the [[Mango (clothing)|Mango]] clothing line popular in Europe. Actually Yomango consider themselves as an informal community aimed at diffusing practices of social disobedience. The kind of shoplifting promoted by Yomango may even be a tactics of [[individual reclamation|direct re-appropriation]] and redistribution of wealth. Yomango is connected with the European movement against labor and social instability.
