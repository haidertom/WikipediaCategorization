'''Aermacchi''' was an Italian [[aircraft manufacturer]]. Formerly known as '''Aeronautica Macchi''', the company was founded in 1912 by [[Giulio Macchi (engineer)|Giulio Macchi]] at [[Varese]] in north-western [[Lombardy]] as '''Nieuport-Macchi''', to build Nieuport monoplanes under licence for the Italian military. With a factory located on the shores of [[Lake Varese]], the firm originally manufactured a series of [[Nieuport]] designs, as well as [[seaplane]]s.

After  [[World War II]], the company began producing [[motorcycle]]s as a way to fill the post-war need for cheap, efficient transportation.

The company later specialised in civil and military pilot training aircraft. In July 2003, Aermacchi was integrated into the [[Finmeccanica]] Group (now Leonardo)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leonardocompany.com/en/-/statuto-sociale-articles-association|title=Leonardo: filing of Articles of Association - DETAIL - Leonardo - Aerospace, Defence and Security|website=www.leonardocompany.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as '''Alenia Aermacchi''', which increased its shareholding to 99%.

==Military trainers==

Since the beginning, the design and production of military trainers have been the core business of Alenia Aermacchi.

The products include: 
* [[SF-260]], piston-engined or turboprop-powered screener/primary trainer
* [[MB-326]], turbofan engined trainer and light attack aircraft
* [[Alenia Aermacchi M-311|M-311]], basic turbofan trainer
* [[MB-339]]CD, advanced and lead-in fighter trainer
* [[M-346]], advanced and lead-in fighter trainer of the new generation

==Military collaboration==
Alenia Aermacchi has cooperated in international military programs:

* [[AMX International AMX|AMX]] Program :
Alenia Aermacchi takes part in the AMX program with Alenia Aeronautica and [[Embraer]] of Brazil with a total share of 24%. Alenia Aermacchi develops and manufactures the fuselage forward and rear sections and installs some avionic equipment in the aircraft. A Mid-Life Updating program is required by the Italian Air Force to upgrade the aircraft capabilities.

* [[Panavia Tornado]] program :
Alenia Aermacchi designs and produces wing pylons and wing tips, roots, [[trailing edge]]s and flaps, which represents a 5% share in the overall program.

* [[Eurofighter]] program :
Alenia Aermacchi has a share of more than 4% in the Eurofighter program, for the design and development of wing pylons, twin missile and twin store carriers, ECM pods, carbon fiber structures and titanium engine cowlings.

* [[C-27J]] program :
After participating in the [[G-222]] transport aircraft program, the company is involved in the new Military Transport Aircraft C-27J Spartan, for the production of outer wings.

==Civil programs==

Since the mid-1990s, Alenia Aermacchi has participated in programs for the supply of engine nacelles for civil aircraft. It produces cold parts for engine nacelles: inlets, fan cowls and EBU, the systems-to-engine interface. 
In 1999, the company established a joint venture (MHD) with [[Hurel-Dubois]] (presently [[Hurel-Hispano]], of [[SNECMA]] group), a French company specializing in the development and manufacture of thrust reversers, to obtain the full responsibility for the development of nacelles installed on maximum 100-seat aircraft.

Aermacchi began producing motorcycles after World War II.  

In 1960, US business [[Harley-Davidson#Small Harleys: Hummers and Aermacchis|Harley-Davidson]] motorcycles purchased 50% of Aermacchi's motorcycle division.  The remaining motorcycle holdings were sold in 1974 to [[Harley-Davidson#Tarnished reputation|AMF-Harley-Davidson]], with motorcycles continuing to be made at Varese. The business was sold to [[Cagiva]] in 1978.

An '''apparatchik''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɑ:|p|ə|ˈ|r|ɑ:|t|tʃ|ɪ|k}}; {{lang-ru|[[wikt:аппаратчик|аппара́тчик]]}} {{IPA-ru|ɐpɐˈratɕɪk|}}), in [[Russian language|Russian]] colloquial terms also borrowed widely into other languages, was a full-time, professional [[functionary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] or the [[government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] ''apparat'' ([[Wiktionary:аппарат#Russian|аппарат]], apparatus), someone who held any position of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] or [[politics|political]] responsibility, with the exception of the higher ranks of management called [[nomenklatura]]. [[James H. Billington|James Billington]] describes an apparatchik as "a man not of grand plans, but of a hundred carefully executed details."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Billington, ''Fire in the minds of men'', Transaction Publishers, 1999, 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=a4PRx21WVqMC&amp;pg=PA455&amp;dq=apparatchik&amp;ei=Unp5Sve5G6PCM4j-vYUN&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=apparatchik&amp;f=false p. 455], {{ISBN|0-7658-0471-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7658-0471-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often considered derogatory, with negative [[connotation]]s in terms of the quality, competence, and attitude of a person thus described.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Pearson, ''The rise and fall of the Soviet Empire'', Palgrave Macmillan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9EehH16HO48C&amp;pg=PR20&amp;dq=derogatory++Apparatchik&amp;ei=LgSoSsWKOZzKzATSy9CpCg#v=onepage&amp;q=derogatory%20%20Apparatchik&amp;f=false p. xx], 1998, {{ISBN|0-312-17407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the apparat ('''apparatchiks''' or '''apparatchiki''') were frequently transferred between different areas of responsibility, usually with little or no actual training for their new areas of responsibility. Thus, the term apparatchik, or "agent of the apparatus" was usually the best possible description of the person's profession and occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Huntford, ''The new totalitarians'', Chapter 7 "The Rule of the Apparatchiks," Stein and Day, 1972, p. 135, {{ISBN|0-8128-1408-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8128-1408-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Not all apparatchiks held lifelong positions. Many only entered such positions in middle age.&lt;ref&gt;David Stuart Lane, Cameron Ross, ''The transition from communism to capitalism: ruling elites from Gorbachev to Yeltsin'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=08wU08p7QHAC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=apparatchik&amp;ei=Unp5Sve5G6PCM4j-vYUN&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=apparatchik&amp;f=false p. 25-26], {{ISBN|0-312-21612-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-312-21612-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today ''apparatchik'' is also used in contexts other than that of the [[Soviet Union]] or communist countries. According to [[Collins English Dictionary]] the word can mean "an official or bureaucrat in any organization".&lt;ref&gt;apparatchik. Collins English Dictionary - Complete &amp; Unabridged 11th Edition. Retrieved 2 August 2012 from CollinsDictionary.com website:
http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/apparatchik&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas Harper's ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'', the term was also used in the meaning "Communist agent or spy", originating in the writings of [[Arthur Koestler]], c. 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Apparatchik Apparatchik] Dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and Modelling Career==
Beverley Heath-Hoyland (née Beverley Heath) was born in Montego Bay on 18 November 1954. Her early years were spent in Jamaica with her grandmother, with Ms Heath joining her parents in the UK aged 9.&lt;ref name="jamaicaobserver"/&gt;

She broke into modelling accidentally when as a teenager a photo spread of her dressed in her school uniform and, in another picture, as a sultry young model was published in The Gleaner, a broadsheet newspaper in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="jamaicaobserver"/&gt;

By 1975 Beverley Heath was established as a model in London, having moved there in 1965. She had already won a series of titles: Miss Black Britain in 1971; Miss Caribbean Queen in 1974; Miss Variety Club of Great Britain and Miss West Indian in 1975 alongside regular work at fashion fairs and for boutiques across Europe, in TV commercials for the telecoms provider [[BT Group]], [[British Rail]], the car manufacturer [[Talbot]], [[Imperial Leather]], [[Avon Products]] and pop music promotion videos.&lt;ref name="jamaicaobserver"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhoyland.com/about/john-hoyland-by-john-mcewen/|title=John Hoyland &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; John Hoyland by John McEwen|publisher=johnhoyland.com|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage to John Hoyland==
Beverley Heath and John Hoyland entered into a relationship in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="artrepublic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrepublic.com/articles/280-acclaimed-british-abstract-painter-john-hoyland-dies.html|title=artrepublic article &amp;#124;Acclaimed British abstract painter John Hoyland dies|publisher=artrepublic.com|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thestar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.co.uk/what-s-on/out-about/city-born-abstract-artist-dies-aged-76-1-3660233|title=City-born abstract artist dies aged 76 - The Star|publisher=thestar.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their mutual friend [[Ian Ritchie (architect)]] described Beverley Heath as having a ‘particular sensitivity and understanding of John’s need to be alone a lot of the time’ combined ‘with humour, style and beauty’ which provided ‘a rock in his life’. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnhoyland.com/about/john-hoyland-by-john-mcewen/|title=John Hoyland &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; John Hoyland by John McEwen|publisher=johnhoyland.com|accessdate=2015-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, [[John Hoyland]] entered London Bridge Hospital for emergency heart surgery.&lt;ref name="Lambirth2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Lambirth|title=John Hoyland: Scatter the Devils|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNNLAQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Unicorn Press|isbn=978-1-906509-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beverley Heath and [[John Hoyland]] married on 28 June 2008.&lt;ref name="johnhoyland"/&gt; [[John Hoyland]] referred to Beverley Heath-Hoyland as his muse.&lt;ref name="jamaicaobserver"/&gt;

==Current Career==
Beverley Heath-Hoyland has been running the [[John Hoyland]] Estate since the artist's death in July 2011.&lt;ref name="spectator2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/arts-feature/9323572/why-isnt-john-hoyland-one-of-the-best-known-figures-of-the-english-20th-century/|title=Is John Hoyland the new Turner? &amp;raquo; The Spectator|publisher=spectator.co.uk|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 Beverley Heath-Hoyland announced the inaugural John Hoyland Scholarship at the [[Chelsea College of Arts]] in memory of the late [[John Hoyland]] with the stated aim of encouraging students from less privileged backgrounds to apply for the College’s MA course in Fine Art by fully funding their course fees.&lt;ref name="artlyst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artlyst.com/articles/damien-hirst-gives-thumbs-up-to-new-art-scholarship-honouring-john-hoyland|title=Damien Hirst Gives Thumbs Up To New Art Scholarship Honouring John Hoyland|publisher=artlyst.com|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnhoyland.com/news/hoyland-trust-launches-chelsea-scholarship-to-fund-next-generation-of-artists/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlos Enrique Meyer''' (born 1953) is an Argentine businessman and public official who was appointed as the nation's Minister of Tourism upon the post's establishment on July 1, 2010.

==Life and times==
Meyer was born in [[Ramos Mejía]], a western suburb of [[Buenos Aires]],&lt;ref name=clarin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/08/22/s-04401.htm|title=El turismo tiene que ser una política de Estado|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was raised in [[Puerto San Julián]], in remote [[Santa Cruz Province (Argentina)|Santa Cruz Province]].&lt;ref name=gente&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gente.com.ar/nota.php?ID=6518|title=Debemos ser más hospitalarios y mejorar los servicios para que los turistas sigan llegando|publisher=''Gente''}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed four years of a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] course in [[hospitality management studies]] in [[Buenos Aires]], though he did not ultimately graduate.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; Meyer became a [[tour guide]] in 1979, and was later the proprietor of a Santa Cruz [[tour operator]].&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt; He married the former María Lavirgen Enríquez, and they had three children.&lt;ref name=gente/&gt;

Meyer entered public service upon his appointment as Provincial Minister of Tourism by the newly elected Governor [[Néstor Kirchner]], in 1991. He worked closely with private investors from early in his tenure, notably with the founder of [[The North Face]] outfitters, [[Douglas Tompkins]], who in 1992 purchased a {{convert|20000|ha|acre|abbr=off}} ranch along the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]] to establish the first of numerous [[nature preserve]]s owned by Tompkins in Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=La Patagonia vendida: los nuevos dueños de la tierra|author=Sánchez, Gonzalo|publisher=Marea Editorial|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused promotional efforts on [[El Calafate]] and the neighboring [[Los Glaciares National Park]], and approved the construction of the [[Comandante Armando Tola International Airport]] at El Calafate, opened in 2000.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

Kirchner became [[President of Argentina]] in 2003. A subsequent dispute with the [[Vice President of Argentina|Vice President]], [[Daniel Scioli]], led to the dismissal of the Secretary of Tourism, Germán Pérez, and of a number of other officials recommended by Scioli.&lt;ref name=nacion&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/520962|title=Kirchner y Scioli, lejos de reconciliarse|publisher=''La Nación''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the need to "retake control of an office which needed a change in personnel,"&lt;ref name=nacion/&gt; Kirchner named Meyer to the post on August 21.&lt;ref name=clarin/&gt;

Meyer took office amid a strong recovery in [[tourism in Argentina]].&lt;ref name=gente/&gt; He and Presidential Spokesman Enrique Albistur sought to further promote the sector by announcing the ''Marca País'' ("Country Brand") initiative, a concept akin to "[[nation branding]]" which served the dual purpose of obtaining political support from well-known figures in [[Argentine sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revista-noticias.com.ar/comun/nota.php?art=831&amp;ed=1609|title=Cómo factura el Deportivo K|publisher=''Noticias''|access-date=2011-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726060445/http://www.revista-noticias.com.ar/comun/nota.php?art=831&amp;ed=1609#|archive-date=2011-07-26|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirchner's wife and successor, President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], had the Tourism Secretariat elevated to a cabinet-level post, and on July 1, 2010, Meyer was sworn in as the first Minister of Tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prensa.argentina.travel/newsletter26/newsletter26.html|title=Meyer juró como Ministro de Turismo|publisher=Instituto Nacional de Promoción Turística}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, a '''commodity''' is an economic good or service that has full or substantial [[fungibility]]: that is, the market treats instances of the good as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commodities are [[raw material]]s, basic resources, [[agriculture|agricultural]], or [[mining]] products, such as [[iron ore]], [[sugar]], or [[grain|grains]] like [[rice]] and [[wheat]]. Commodities can also be mass-produced unspecialized products such as [[chemical substance|chemicals]] and [[computer memory]].

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole: well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets. The wide availability of commodities typically leads to smaller [[profit margin|profit margins]] and diminishes the importance of factors (such as [[brand|brand name]]) other than price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commodity definition |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commodity |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''commodity'' came into use in English in the 15th century, from the French ''[[:wikt:commodité#French|commodité]]'', "amenity, convenience". Going further back, the French word derives from the Latin ''[[:wikt:commoditas#Latin|commoditas]]'', meaning "suitability, convenience, advantage". The Latin word ''[[:wikt:commodus#Latin|commodus]]'' (from which English gets other words including ''commodious'' and ''accommodate'') meant variously "appropriate", "proper measure, time, or condition", and "advantage, benefit".

== Characteristics ==
In economics, the term ''commodity'' is used specifically for economic goods or services that have full or partial but substantial [[fungibility]]; that is, the market treats their instances as equivalent or nearly so with no regard to who produced them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beginnersinvest.about.com/cs/commodities/f/whatcommodities.htm|title=Learn What Commodities Are in These Examples!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karl Marx described this property as follows: "From the taste of [[wheat]], it is not possible to tell who produced it, a [[Serfdom in Russia|Russian serf]], a French peasant or an English [[capitalist]]."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Petroleum]] and [[copper]] are examples of commodity goods:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Sullivan |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist) |author2=Steven M. Sheffrin |title=Economics: Principles in action |publisher=Pearson / Prentice Hall |year=2004 |isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; their supply and demand are a part of one universal market.

Non-commodity items such as [[stereo]] systems have many aspects of product differentiation, such as the [[brand]], the user interface and the perceived quality. The demand for one type of stereo may be much larger than demand for another.

The price of a commodity good is typically determined as a function of its market as a whole. Well-established physical commodities have actively traded [[spot market|spot]] and [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] markets.

== Hard and soft commodities ==
[[Soft commodity|Soft commodities]] are goods that are grown, such as [[wheat]], or [[rice]].

Hard commodities are [[mining|mined]]. Examples include [[gold]], [[helium]], and [[petroleum|oil]].

Energy commodities include electricity, gas, [[coal]] and oil. Electricity has the particular characteristic that it is usually uneconomical to store, and must therefore be consumed as soon as it is processed.

== Commoditization ==
[[Commoditization]] occurs as a goods or services market loses differentiation across its supply base, often by the diffusion of the [[intellectual capital]] necessary to acquire or produce it efficiently. As such, goods that formerly carried premium [[Profit margin|margins]] for [[Market (economics)|market]] [[wikt:participation|participants]] have become commodities, such as [[Generic drug|generic pharmaceuticals]] and [[dynamic random-access memory|DRAM chips]]. An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' cites [[multivitamin]] supplements as an example of commoditization; a 50&amp;nbsp;mg tablet of [[calcium]] is of equal value to a consumer no matter what company produces and markets it, and as such, multivitamins are now sold in bulk and are available at any supermarket with little brand differentiation.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite news |author=Natasha Singer |author2=Peter Lattman |title=Workout Supplement Challenged |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/business/a-soldiers-parents-take-aim-at-gnc-and-a-supplement-maker.html?hpw&amp;pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |date=15 March 2013 |accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this trend, [[nanomaterials]] are emerging from carrying premium profit margins for market participants to a status of commodification.&lt;ref&gt;C. McGovern, ″Commoditization of nanomaterials″. ''Nanotechnology Perceptions'' '''6''' (2010) 155–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a spectrum of commoditization, rather than a binary distinction of "commodity versus differentiable product". Few products have complete undifferentiability and hence fungibility; even electricity can be differentiated in the market based on its method of generation (e.g., fossil fuel, wind, solar), in markets where [[electricity market#Retail electricity market|energy choice]] lets a buyer opt (and pay more) for renewable methods if desired. Many products' degree of commoditization depends on the buyer's mentality and means. For example, milk, eggs, and notebook paper are not differentiated by many customers; for them, the product is fungible and lowest price is the main decisive factor in the purchasing choice. Other customers take into consideration other factors besides price, such as environmental sustainability and animal welfare. To these customers, distinctions such as "[[Organic food|organic]] versus not" or "[[Free-range eggs|cage free]] versus not" count toward differentiating brands of milk or eggs, and percentage of recycled content or [[Forest Stewardship Council]] [[Certified wood|certification]] count toward differentiating brands of notebook paper.

==Commodity trade==
{{Main article|Futures exchange|Commodity market}}
In the original and simplified sense, '''''commodities''''' were things of value, of uniform quality, that were produced in large quantities by many different producers; the items from each different producer were considered equivalent. On a commodity exchange, it is the underlying standard stated in the contract that defines the commodity, not any quality inherent in a specific producer's product.

[[Commodities exchange]]s include:&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;

== Inventory data ==
The [[inventory]] of commodities, with low inventories typically leading to more volatile future prices and increasing the risk of a "[[stockout]]" (inventory exhaustion). According to economist theorists, companies receive a [[convenience yield]] by holding inventories of certain commodities. Data on inventories of commodities are not available from one common source, although data is available from various sources. Inventory data on 31 commodities was used in a 2006 study on the relationship between inventories and commodity futures risk premiums.&lt;ref&gt;Gorton GB et al. (2008).

==Commodification of labor==
{{See also|Labour is not a commodity}}

In classical political economy and especially in [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of political economy, a commodity is an object or a good or service ("product" or "activity"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Outlines of the Critique of Political Economy" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 28'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;) produced by [[labour power|human labour]].&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' (International Publishers: New York, 1967) p. 38 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'' (International Publishers: New York, 1996) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Objects are external to man.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', p. 87 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some objects attain "[[use value]]" to persons in this world, when they are found to be "necessary, useful or pleasant in life,"&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Politica'' (Oxford, 1966) p. 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; "Use value" makes an object "an object of human wants,"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'' (International Publishers: New York, 1987) p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; or is "a means of subsistence in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, "Capital in General: The Commodity" contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 29'', p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

As society developed, people found that they could trade goods and services for other goods and services. At this stage, these goods and services became "commodities." Commodities are defined as objects which are offered for sale or are "exchanged in a market."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'' p. 36 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In the marketplace, where commodities are sold, "use value" is not helpful in facilitating the sale of commodities. Accordingly, in addition to having use value, commodities must have an "exchange value"—a value that could be expressed in the market.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 131 and David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: 1971, London) p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Marx, many economists debated as to what elements made up exchange value. [[Adam Smith]] maintained that exchange value was made up of [[economic rent|rent]], [[economic profit|profit]], [[labor economics|labour]] and the costs of wear and tear on the instruments of husbandry.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Smith, ''Wealth of Nations'' (Pelican Books: London, 1970) p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ricardo]], a follower of Adam Smith, modified Smith's approach on this point by alleging that labour alone is the content of the exchange value of any good or service.&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books: London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; While maintaining that all exchange value in commodities was derived directly from the hands of the people that made the commodity, Ricardo noted that only part of the exchange value of the commodity was paid to the worker who made the commodity. The other part of the value of this particular commodity was labour that was not paid to the worker—unpaid labour. This unpaid labour was retained by the owner of the means of production. In capitalist society, the capitalist owns the means of production and therefore the unpaid labour is retained by the capitalist as rent or as profit. The means of production means the site where the commodity is made, the raw products that are used in the production and the instruments or machines that are used for the production of the commodity.

However, not all commodities are reproducible nor were all commodities originally intended to be sold in the market. These priced goods are also treated as commodities, e.g. human labour-power, works of art and natural resources ("earth itself is an instrument of labour"),&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 179 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; even though they may not be produced specifically for the market, or be non-reproducible goods.

Marx's analysis of the commodity is intended to help solve the problem of what establishes the economic value of goods, using the [[labour theory of value|labor theory of value]]. This problem was extensively debated by [[Adam Smith]], [[David Ricardo]]&lt;ref&gt;David Ricardo, ''Principles of Political Economy and Taxation'' (Pelican Books, London, 1971) pp. 56-58.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Rodbertus-Jagetzow]] among others.

All three of the above-mentioned economists rejected the theory that labour composed 100% of the exchange value of any commodity. In varying degrees, these economists turned to supply and demand to establish the price of commodities. Marx held that the "price" and the "value" of a commodity were not synonymous. Price of any commodity would vary according to the imbalance of supply to demand at any one period of time. The "value" of the same commodity would be consistent and would reflect the amount of labour value used to produce that commodity.

Prior to Marx, economists noted that the problem with using the "quantity of labour" to establish the value of commodities was that the time spent by an unskilled worker would be longer than the time spent on the same commodity by a skilled worker. Thus, under this analysis, the commodity produced by an unskilled worker would be more valuable than the same commodity produced by the skilled worker. Marx pointed out, however, that in society at large, an average amount of time that was necessary to produce the commodity would arise. This average time necessary to produce the commodity Marx called the "socially necessary labour time"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, ''Capital: Volume I'', p. 39 and "Capital" as contained in the ''Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 35'', p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Socially necessary labour time was the proper basis on which to base the "exchange value" of a given commodity.

Value and price are not equivalent terms in economics, and theorising the specific relationship of value to market price has been a challenge for both liberal and Marxist economists. However, Marx held that the value and price of any commodity would coincide only when demand and supply were equivalent to each other.

While the strategy researchers have tended to focus on testing theories of firm performance, many [[organizational theorist]]s are focused on more descriptive theories{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}, the one uniting theme has been the use of [[computational model]]s to either verify or extend theories. It is perhaps no accident that those researchers using computational simulation have been inspired by ideas from [[Mathematical model|biological model]]ing, [[ecology]], [[theoretical physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], [[chaos theory]], [[complexity theory and organization studies]] since these methods have also been fruitfully used in those areas.

==Basic distinctions/definitions==
Researchers studying organizations and firms using computer simulations utilize a variety of basic distinctions and definitions that are common in computational science
* Agent-based vs Equation-based: [[agent-based model]]s unfold according to the interactions of relatively simple actions, while equation-based models unfold numerically based on a variety of dynamic or steady-state equations (Note: some argue this is something of a false distinction since some agent based models use equations to direct the behavior of their agents)
* Model: simplified versions of the real world that contain only essential elements of theoretical interest&lt;ref&gt;Lave and March 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complexity of the model: the number of conceptual parts in the model and the connections between those parts&lt;ref&gt;Simon 1969&lt;/ref&gt;
* Deterministic vs. Stochastic: deterministic models unfold exactly as specified by some pre-specified logic, while stochastic models depend on a variety of draws from probability distributions
* Optimizing vs. Descriptive: models with actors that either seek optimums (like the peaks in fitness landscapes) or do not

==Methodological approaches==

There are a variety of different methodological approaches in the area of computational simulation. These include but are not limited to the following. (Note: this list is not Mutually Exclusive nor Collectively Exhaustive, but tries to be fair to the dominant trends. For three different taxonomies see Carley 2001; Davis et al. 2007; Dooley 2002)

*Agent-based models: computational models investigating the interaction of multiple agents (many of the following approaches can be 'agent-based' as well)
*Cellular automata: models exploring multiple actors in physical space whose behavior is based on rules
*Dynamic network models: any model representing actors and non-actor entities (tasks, resources, locations, beliefs, etc.) as connected through relational links as in [[dynamic network analysis]]
*Genetic Algorithms: models of agents whose genetic information can evolve over time
*Equation-based (or non-linear modeling): models using (typically [[non-linear]]) equations that determine the future state of its systems
*Social Network models: any model representing actors as connected through stereotypical 'ties' as in [[social network analysis]]
*Stochastic Simulation: models that involve random variables or source of stochasticity
*[[System dynamics]]: equation-based approach using casual-loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks &amp; flows]] of resources
*NK modeling: actors modeled as N nodes linked through K connections that are (typically) trying to reach the peak of a fitness landscape

==Early research==

Early research in strategy and organizations using computational simulation concerned itself with either the macro-behavior of systems or specific organizational mechanisms. Highlights of early research included:

*Cohen, March, &amp; Olsen's (1972) ''Garbage Can Model of Organizational Choice'' modeled organizations as a set of solutions seeking problems in a rather anarchic 'garbage can'-esque organization.
*March's (1991) study of ''Exploration and Exploitation in Organizational Learning'' utilized John Holland's (1975) basic explore/exploit distinction to show the value of slow learners in organizations.
*Nelson &amp; Winter's (1982) ''Evolutionary theory of economic change'' used a simulation to show that an evolutionary model could produce the same sort of GDP / productivity numbers as neo-classical rational choice theorizing.

==Later research==

Later research using computational simulation flowered in the 1990s and beyond. Highlights include:

*Carroll &amp; Harrison's (1998) model of organizational demography and culture
*Davis, Eisenhardt &amp; Bingham's (2009) model of organization structure in unpredictable environments
*Gavetti, &amp; Levinthal's (2000) model of cognitive and experiential search
*Levinthal's (1997) NK model of adaptation on rugged fitness landscapes
*Rivkin's (2000) study of strategic imitation
*Rudolph &amp; Repenning's (2002) model of disastrous tipping points
*Sastry's (1997) model of punctuated organizational change
*Zott's (2003) model of strategic evolution and dynamic capabilities

The '''Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary''' ([[Latin]]: ''Congregatio Clericorum Marianorum ab Immaculata Conceptionis Beatissimae Virginis Mariae''; abbreviation: M.I.C.) is a [[Catholic]] male [[Clergy|clerical]] [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] founded, 1670, in Poland.  It is also known as '''Marians of the Immaculate Conception'''.

The Congregation of about 500 [[priest]]s and [[Brother (Catholic)|brothers]] has convents in 19 countries on 6 continents.  Marians pledge support to the Pope and follow the official teachings of the Catholic Church and aim to spread devotion to [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the [[Immaculate Conception]], pray for the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]s in [[purgatory]] and undertake a variety of apostolic work.

Marians were the first Catholic men’s [[religious institute]] dedicated to the honor of Mary’s Immaculate Conception. The community traces its roots to Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński|Stanislaus of Jesus and Mary Papczyński]] who was beatified in [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]], [[Licheń Stary]], [[Poland]], in 2007. As an [[Institute of consecrated life]] their motto is ''Pro Christo et Ecclesia''. Marians are also the official promoters of the authentic Divine Mercy message since 1941.

==History==
[[File:Fr pap shadow.jpg|thumb|210px|Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński|Stanislaus of Jesus and Mary Papczyński]], Founder of the Marians, on the oldest existing portrait from the end of the 17th century, Marian monastery in Skórzec, Poland.]]
The Congregation began on December 11, 1670, with Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński]] publicly announcing in his ''Oblatio'' the desire to establish a community of men dedicated to spreading the honor of the Immacuate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  In 1673, in Puszcza Korabiewska (today known as [[Puszcza Marianska]]/Marian Forest) near Skierniewice, Poland, the first religious house of the Marians was approved by the local bishop.  The first members of the community based their life on the ''Rule of Life'', written by St. Stanislaus.  He tempered his plans at first to establish a community active in the Church's service.  At the beginning, the Marian Fathers lived an eremitical rule of life as they pursued final recognition and approval by the Church.  Within a short time, the new and still small institute received approval from their local Ordinary, Bishop Stephen Wierzbowski of Poznan.&lt;ref name=marians&gt;[http://www.marian.org/marians/history.php "The History of the Marians", Marians of the Immaculate Conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent XII]] granted his approval for the young institute in 1699 with solemn vows under the French Rule of the Ten Virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary, initially placing them within the [[Franciscans]].&lt;ref name=marians/&gt;

With the death of the Founder in 1701, however, the Marian Fathers found themselves in a critical period of transition.  Internal factions divided the membership into one group favoring a strictly contemplative life, and a second group seeking to add missionary and pastoral outreach to the institute's contemplative spirit.&lt;ref name=marians/&gt;  The period known as the "Rostkowski Dispersion" followed, fired by internal conflict, as well as the negative attitude expressed by some bishops and lay dignitaries.  In 1716, Bishop Adam Rostkowski decided to close the Marian novitiate, instructing Marians to leave the monastery and move out to assume pastoral work in parishes.

In 1722, Bishop John Tarlo of Poznan called the scattered Marians back to their monasteries, and convened a general chapter.  The man elected to serve as Superior General was Fr. [[Andrew of St. Matthew Deszpot]], a Czech originally received into the institute by the founder St. Stanislaus.  At the same chapter, a General Procurator was chosen, Fr. [[Joachim of St. Ann Kozłowski]].  He was given the mission of going to Rome to have the institute's constitutions confirmed, and to remove the institute from the jurisdiction of local bishops.  In 1723, Pope [[Innocent XIII]] approved the Marian statutes and released the institute from the interference of local bishops.

[[File:Wyszynski 10212008.jpg|frame|Venerable Servant of God Fr. Casimir Wyszyński, Superior General of the Marians who established the institute in Portugal.]]
[[File:Nowicki.jpg|frame|Fr. Raymond Nowicki]]
The rest of 18th century was marked by steady growth as the Marians expanded from Poland to Portugal and Italy thanks to the efforts of two outstanding Superior Generals of the institute:  Venerable Serv. of God [[Casimir Wyszyński]] (1700–1755) and [[Raymond Nowicki]] (1735–1801).

Rapid changes in the European political situation by the end of the 18th and through 19th century led to the near destruction of the institute.

With the complete failure of the [[Kosciuszko Uprising]] in 1795, Poland lost its independence.  Now the Marian Fathers found themselves divided by virtually sealed borders.  The partitioning of the Polish Republic was decreed by the occupying armies of Russia, Prussia, and Austria.

Again, in 1798, after [[Napoleon]] seized Rome, he mandated that all foreigners be expelled from its borders.  The exodus included the Marian Fathers removed from their monastery and Rome's St. Vitus Church.

In 1834, the Portuguese government became hostile toward all religious, and finally closed all Marian monasteries in that nation.

In Eastern Europe following the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815, most of the Marian monasteries found themselves in the newly created [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was part of Imperial Russia, whose Czarist regime was openly hostile to the Catholic Church.

The defeat of two Polish national uprisings against [[Czarist Russia]], one in November 1830, and another in January 1863, meant repression for [[religious institute]]s in Poland.  The Czarist regime prohibited the acceptance of new candidates to the religious life, effectively stamping out the normal process of growth in vocations to the religious life for the Marian Fathers and other institutes.

One of the most famous Marians in the 19th century was Fr. [[Christopher Szwernicki]]. In 1852, he was exiled to [[Irkutsk]], where he built the church and an [[orphanage]] for the deportees’ children. In 1888 he was titled "Apostle of Siberia" by Pope [[Leo XIII]].

[[File:senku.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Fr. Vincent Sękowski]]
By 1865, the Russian occupying forces allowed only one Marian monastery to remain open in [[Marijampole]], Lithuania.  All Marians were sent to Marijampole.  Such rulings were nothing less than a death sentence for the religious institute.  By the year 1904, that last Marian house closed, since so few Marians remained.  By 1908, only one Marian remained, [[Vincent Sękowski]] (Senkus).  He was the last Superior General.  All other Marians had died, or asked to leave to join the ranks of the diocesan clergy.  For all appearances, the Czarist persecutions had succeeded.  The Marian Fathers seemed to have come to the end of the line.

At this critical moment in the history of the Marian institute, an ardent and energetic Lithuanian priest came to visit Fr. Vincent Sękowski, with the aim of secretly renewing it. He was Fr. [[Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius|George Matulaitis-Matulewicz]], and at that time he was a professor at the Academy of Theology in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Fr. Matulaitis had a profound understanding of the contributions and significance of religious life to society, although Catholic monasteries were being suppressed at that time.  He believed it was important to do whatever needed to be done to revive Catholic religious life in the lands dominated by Imperial Russia.

[[File:Fr. Michael Gaitley, MIC.jpg|thumb|left|Father Michael E. Gaitley, MIC is a popular preacher and author in the [[United States]].]]
As a youth, he had been brought up in a village where the Marian Fathers staffed the local parish.  The experience had left him with a lifelong respect and admiration for the Marian Fathers.  And so Fr. George, along with his friend Fr. [[Francis-Peter Bucys]], who had also grown up with Marian religious influence, entered the Marian institute with the intention of saving it from disappearing into history, along with all its promise for God's work.  They had to become Marians in secret in order to thwart Imperial Russian authorities, who continued to persecute the Church.

Fr. George made his vows and was accepted into the Marian institute by Fr. Vincent Sękowski, and in the same year, 1909, Fr. Francis Peter Bucys became the first novice of the institute on its way to renewed life.

Fr. George wrote the renewed institute's constitutions, inspired by the spirit of St. Stanislaus Papczyński and the desire to adapt his ideals to modern times.  The new Constitutions and revived form of Marian life were approved by St. Pope [[Pius X]] in 1910.  Fr. Vincent Sękowski, who was the last of the “White Marians”, lived on for five months after papal approval for Marian renewal.

To assure that the institute could continue to flourish without interference from the Imperial government, the secret Marian novitiate and house of studies were transferred from St. Petersburg in Russia to Fribourg in Switzerland.  From this time on, the Marian Fathers began to experience consistent growth.  In 1927, the year when the Renovator, then [[Archbishop]] George Matulaitis-Matulewicz, died, the Congregation had grown to around 300 members (among them [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[George Kalusza]], [[Servant of God]] [[Eugene Kulesza]], and Servant of God [[Janis Mendriks]]).

Fr. Francis P. Bucys succeeded Blessed George as the Superior General of the renovated Congregation.  Thanks to the Renovator's reforms, the Marian Fathers became a modern religious congregation.  Yet Blessed George Matulaitis did not change the main ideals of the religious community, such as spreading devotion to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary and supplication for the souls suffering in Purgatory.  However, he did expand the field of the Marian apostolate and introduced significant changes into the Marian Fathers' way of life, adapting it to the new conditions and needs of modern times.

==20th century==
Although it is now an international organization, the Marians still have strong roots in Poland, (e.g. the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen]]) and place a great deal of emphasis on spreading the messages of [[Divine Mercy]] of Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]].

Between 1950 and 1986 the Marian Fathers operated two boarding schools in England, at Lower [[Bullingham]] near [[Hereford]] and the second, ''Divine Mercy College'', at [[Fawley Court]], [[Buckinghamhire]], (north of [[Henley-on-Thames]]). Though intended for boys of Polish origin, in particular the children of the 100,000+ Poles who found exile in Britain after the Second World War, a proportion of the boys accepted were non-Poles.

In 1996 Fr. Seraphim Michalenko, MIC, and Fr. George Kosicki, CSB formed the ''John Paul II Institute of Divine Mercy'' to provide instruction in Divine Mercy theology and spirituality to both parish leaders and clergy.  At its inception, [[Pope John Paul II]] entrusted the Institute with the task of providing "formation and research in The Divine Mercy message".  Their role in spreading the Divine Mercy message was acknowledged by Pope John Paul II in a special [http://www.padrimariani.org/assets/images/blessings/2001oct5.jpg Papal Blessing] in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion.

==21st century==
[[File:S6000734.JPG|thumb|left|The Licheń Basilica]]
With a Polish Pope in the chair of [[St Peter the Apostle|St Peter]] and the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], the circumstances were ripe for a resurgence of the medieval Marian cult in Poland. The Fathers laid plans to erect an ambitious new shrine to Mary, to rival that of [[Czestochowa]], in the village [[Licheń Stary]], scene of a 19th-century Napoleonic soldier's devotion.

'''Crony capitalism''' is an [[economy]] in which [[business]]es thrive not as a result of risk, but rather as a return on money amassed through a nexus between a business class and the [[political class]]. This is done using state power to crush genuine competition in handing out permits, government grants, special [[tax break]]s, or other forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.org.au/publications/policy-magazine/article/2877-feature-crony-capitalism-and-the-east-asian-currency-and-financial-crises|author=Helen Hughes|volume=15 |issue=3 |date=Spring 1999|title=Crony Capitalism and the East Asian Currency and Financial 'Crises'|magazine=Policy|quote=Japan’s dismal performance in the 1990s and the East Asian collapses of 1997 indicate that [[dirigisme]] can only boost economies in the short run and at high cost.

Money is then made not merely by making a profit  in the market, but through profiteering by "rent seeking" using this monopoly or oligopoly. Entrepreneurship and innovative practices, which seek to reward risk are stifled, since the value-added is little by crony businesses as hardly anything of significant value is created by them, with transactions taking the form of "trading". Crony capitalism spills over into the government, the politics and the media,&lt;ref name="The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism, 1981"&gt;''The Discovery that Business Corrupts Politics: A Reappraisal of the Origins of Progressivism'', by McCormick, Richard. 1981. The American Historical Review, Vol. 86, No. 2 (Apr. 1981), pp. 247–74.&lt;/ref&gt; when this nexus distorts the economy and affects society to an extent it corrupts [[public good|public-serving]] economic, political and social ideals.

The term "crony capitalism" made a significant impact in the public as an explanation of the [[Asian financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Crony Capitalism: Corruption and Development in South Korea and the Philippines |first=David C. |last=Kang |year=2002 |url=http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/2001025806.pdf |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0-521-00408-4
|quote=Focused only on explaining successful outcomes, the conventional model provided no analytic way to explain the 1997 crisis. Countries previously regarded as miracles now were nothing more than havens for crony capitalists (p. 3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to describe governmental decisions favoring "cronies" of governmental officials. In this context, the term is often used comparatively with [[corporate welfare]], a technical term often used to assess government bailouts and favoritistic monetary policy, as opposed to the economic theory, described by "crony capitalism". The extent of difference between these terms is whether a government action can be said to benefit the individuals rather than the industry.

==In practice==
Crony capitalism exists along a continuum.  In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of [[collusion]] among market players which is officially tolerated or encouraged by the government. While perhaps lightly competing against each other, they will present a unified front (sometimes called a trade association or [[industry trade group]]) to the government in requesting subsidies or aid or regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/uber-vs-washington-dc-this-is-insane/259614/|title=Uber vs. Washington, D.C.: This Is Insane|date=July 10, 2012|accessdate=July 11, 2012|quote=a fight over a new competitor to the District's (often horrible) taxi service offers something I haven't seen in a while. Not routine retail-level corruption, nor skillful top-level favor trading, but instead what appears to be a blatant attempt to legislate favors for one set of interests by hamstringing another.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newcomers to a market then need to surmount significant "barriers to entry"  for instance, in seeking loans, acquire shelf space, or receive official sanction. Some such systems are very formalized, such as sports leagues and the Medallion System of the [[taxicabs of New York City]], but often the process is more subtle, such as expanding training and certification exams to make it more expensive for new entrants to enter a market and thereby limit competition. In technological fields, there may evolve a system whereby new entrants may be accused of infringing on [[patent]]s that the established competitors never assert against each other. In spite of this, some competitors may succeed when the legal [[Barriers to entry|barriers]] are light. {{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The term crony capitalism is generally used when these practices come to dominate the economy as a whole or to dominate the most valuable industries in an economy.&lt;ref name="NYT-20140327" /&gt; Intentionally ambiguous laws and regulations are common in such systems. Taken strictly, such laws would greatly impede practically all business; in practice, they are only erratically enforced. The specter of having such laws suddenly brought down upon a business provides incentive to stay in the good graces of political officials. Troublesome rivals who have overstepped their bounds can have the laws suddenly enforced against them, leading to fines or even jail time. Even in high-income democracies with well-established legal systems and freedom of the press in place, a larger state is associated with more political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''crony capitalism'' was initially applied to states involved in the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] such as [[Thailand]] and [[Indonesia]]. In these cases, the term was used to point out how family members of the ruling leaders become extremely wealthy with no non-political justification.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Southeast Asian nations still score very poorly in rankings measuring this. [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vines|first=Stephen|title=Why Hong Kong’s latest No 1 ranking was greeted with silence|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/money/wealth/article/1462317/why-hong-kongs-latest-no-1-ranking-was-greeted-silence|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1213&amp;context=facultyworkingpapers&lt;/ref&gt; are perhaps most noted for this, and the term has also been applied to the system of [[Business oligarch|oligarchs]] in [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2668298?story_id=E1_NGGRNJR |title=Having it both ways |work=The Economist |date=May 20, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=The countries where politically connected businessmen are most likely to prosper|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21599041-countries-where-politically-connected-businessmen-are-most-likely-prosper-planet|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=The Economist|date=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not list every country in the world, just the ones that are both corrupt AND capitalist enough.

=== Crony capitalism index ===
''[[The Economist]]'' benchmarks countries based on a "[[crony-capitalism index]]" calculated via how much economic activity occurs in industries prone to cronyism.  Its 2014 Crony Capitalism Index ranking listed [[Hong Kong]], [[Russia]] and [[Malaysia]] in the top 3 spots.&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

== In finance ==
Crony capitalism in finance was found in the [[Second Bank of the United States]].  It was a private company, but its largest stockholder was the federal government which owned 20%.   It was an early bank regulator and grew to be one being the most powerful organizations in the country due largely to being the depository of the government's revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]] in 1999 completely removed [[Glass-Steagall]]’s separation between commercial banks and investment banks.  After this repeal, commercial banks, investment banks, and insurance companies combined their [[lobbying]] efforts. Critics claim this was instrumental in the passage of the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity.|last=Zingales|first=Luigi|publisher=Basic Books|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sections of an economy==
{{POV section|date=November 2012}}
More direct government involvement in a specific sector can also lead to specific areas of crony capitalism, even if the economy as a whole may be competitive. This is most common in natural resource sectors through the granting of mining or drilling concessions, but it is also possible through a process known as [[regulatory capture]] where the government agencies in charge of regulating an industry come to be controlled by that industry. Governments will often, in good faith, establish [[regulatory agency|government agencies to regulate an industry]]. However, the members of an industry have a very strong interest in the actions of that regulatory body, while the rest of the citizenry are only lightly affected. As a result, it is not uncommon for current industry players to gain control of the "watchdog" and to use it against competitors. This typically takes the form of making it very expensive for a new entrant to enter the market. An [[Gibbons v. Ogden#Background|1824 landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling]] overturned a New York State-granted monopoly ("a veritable model of state munificence" facilitated by one of the [[Founding Fathers]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert R. Livingston]]) for the then-revolutionary technology of [[North River Steamboat|steamboats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=T.J. |last=Styles |title=The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]|ISBN=978-0-375-41542-5|quote=Property requirements for suffrage under New York's constitution of 1777 hardened the culture of rank into law. Two distinct levels of wealth were required to vote, one for state assembly, and a second and higher level for the state senators and governor... [this [[suffrage]] scheme fostered] [[mercantilism]], which in the state empowered private parties to carry out activities thought to serve the public interest. The standard reward for such an undertaking was a [[monopoly]]—just what Chancellor Livingston sought when he offered to meet a most pressing public need, the need for steamboats...Livingston maneuvered...the monopoly through the legislature ("a veritable model of state munificence," as legal scholar Maurice G. Baxter writes—that gave him the right to seize steamboats the entered New York waters from other states. But Livingston had overreached. With so many inventors and investors interested in the steamboat, the monopoly on served to limit its adoption.  The new technology was simply too important for the monopoly to remain unchallenged. [pp. 39–42]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leveraging the Supreme Court's establishment of Congressional supremacy over commerce, the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] was established in 1887 with the intent of regulating railroad "[[robber baron (industrialist)|robber barons]]".  President [[Grover Cleveland]] appointed [[Thomas M. Cooley]], a railroad ally, as its first chairman and a permit system was used to deny access to new entrants and legalize [[price fixing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Lee |title=Entangling the Web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/opinion/03lee.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The defense industry in the United States is often described as an example of crony capitalism in an industry. Connections with [[United States Department of Defense|the Pentagon]] and lobbyists in Washington are described by critics as more important than actual competition, due to the political and secretive nature of defense contracts. In the [[Transatlantic relations#Boeing and Airbus subsidies|Airbus-Boeing WTO dispute]], Airbus (which receives outright [[subsidy|subsidies]] from European governments) has stated Boeing receives similar subsidies, which are hidden as inefficient defense contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pulling Boeing Out of a Tailspin |url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/03_50/b3862121_mz029.htm |work=[[BusinessWeek]] |quote=A national treasure, once No. 1 in commercial aviation, Boeing has become a risk-averse company stumbling to compete in the marketplace and dependent on political connections and chicanery to get government contracts.

The Department of Defense has been criticized for awarding Iraq reconstruction contracts to Haliburton and Bechtel without competition (Broder 2005)|publisher=[[Occidental College]] |date=March 2006|accessdate=July 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald P. O'Driscoll, former vice president at the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]], stated that [[Fannie Mae]] and [[Freddie Mac]] became examples of crony capitalism. Government backing let Fannie and Freddie dominate [[mortgage underwriting]]. "The politicians created the mortgage giants, which then returned some of the profits to the pols—sometimes directly, as campaign funds; sometimes as "contributions" to favored constituents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |work=New York Post |title=Fannie/Freddie Bailout Baloney |first=Gerald P. |last=O'Driscoll Jr |date=September 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913195535/http://www.nypost.com/seven/09092008/postopinion/opedcolumnists/fannie_freddie_bailout_baloney_128135.htm |archivedate=September 13, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In developing economies==
In its worst form, crony capitalism can devolve into simple [[Political corruption|corruption]], where any pretense of a free market is dispensed with. Bribes to government officials are considered ''de rigueur'' and [[tax evasion]] is common; this is seen in many parts of Africa, for instance.  This is sometimes called [[plutocracy]] (rule by wealth) or [[kleptocracy]] (rule by theft).

Corrupt governments may favor one set of business owners who have close ties to the government over others. This may also be done with, religious, or ethnic favoritism; for instance, [[Alawites]] in [[Syria]] have a disproportionate share of power in the government and business there. ([[Bashar al-Assad|President Assad]] is an Alawite.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/world/asia/01makhlouf.html Syrian Businessman Becomes Magnet for Anger and Dissent] "Like Mr. Ezz in Egypt, he has become a symbol of how economic reforms turned crony socialism into crony capitalism, making the poor poorer and the connected rich fantastically wealthier."&lt;/ref&gt;) This can be explained by considering personal relationships as a [[social network]]. As government and business leaders try to accomplish various things, they naturally turn to other powerful people for support in their endeavors. These people form hubs in the network. In a developing country those hubs may be very few, thus concentrating economic and political power in a small interlocking group.

Normally, this will be untenable to maintain in business; new entrants will affect the market. However, if business and government are entwined, then the government can maintain the small-hub network.

[[Raymond Vernon]], specialist in economics and international affairs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url         = http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|title       = Raymond Vernon Dies at 85|date        = September 23, 1999|work        = The Harvard University Gazette|publisher   = President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate  = February 9, 2013|deadurl     = yes|archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120503203741/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/09.23/vernon.html|archivedate = May 3, 2012|df          = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
wrote that the [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain]], because they were the first to successfully limit the power of veto groups (typically cronies of those with power in government) to block innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  "Unlike most other national environments, the British environment of the early 19th century contained relatively few threats to those who improved and applied existing inventions, whether from business competitors, labor, or the government itself.  In other European countries, by contrast, the merchant guilds ... were a pervasive source of veto for many centuries.  This power was typically bestowed upon them by government".  For example, a Russian inventor produced a steam engine in 1766 and disappeared without a trace.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}  "[A] steam powered horseless carriage produced in France in 1769 was officially suppressed."  [[James Watt]] began experimenting with steam in 1763, got a patent in 1769, and began commercial production in 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon (1989, p. 8);  see also [[Watt steam engine]] and [[James Watt#Patents|James Watt]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political viewpoints==
{{misleading|date=May 2016}}
While the problem is generally accepted across the political spectrum, ideology shades the view of the problem's causes and therefore its solutions. Political views mostly fall into two camps which might be called the socialist and capitalist critique. The socialist position is that broadly democratic government must regulate economic, or wealthy, interests in order to restrict monopoly. The capitalist position is that "[[natural monopolies]]" are rare, therefore governmental regulations generally abet established wealthy interests by restricting competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103083819/http://gothamist.com/2014/11/29/uber_driving_down_price_of_taxi_med.php |archivedate=2015-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Socialist critique===
Critics of crony capitalism including [[socialism|socialists]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalists]] often assert that crony capitalism is the inevitable result of ''any'' strictly capitalist system. [[Jane Jacobs]] described it as a natural consequence of collusion between those managing [[power (sociology)|power]] and [[trade]], while [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that the word "crony" is superfluous when describing capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/20081114.htm "Black Faces in Limousines:" A Conversation with Noam Chomsky] from Chomsky.info accessed on June 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since businesses make money and money leads to political power, business will inevitably use their power to influence governments. Much of the impetus behind [[campaign finance reform in the United States]] and in other countries is an attempt to prevent economic power being used to take political power.

[[Ravi Batra]] argues that "all official economic measures adopted since 1981...have devastated the middle class" and that the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement should push for their repeal and thus end the influence of the super wealthy in the political process, which he considers a manifestation of crony capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truth-out.org/occupy-wall-street-movement-and-coming-demise-crony-capitalism/1318341474 |title=The Occupy Wall Street Movement and the Coming Demise of Crony Capitalism |first=Ravi |last=Batra |publisher=[[Truthout]] |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist economists, such as [[Robin Hahnel]], have criticized the term as an ideologically motivated attempt to cast what is in their view the fundamental problems of capitalism as avoidable irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Review |url=http://www.bradley.edu/campusorg/bpn/znet/april08.txt |author=[[Robin Hahnel]] |quote=IMF officials Michel Camdessus and Stanley Fischer were quick to explain that the afflicted economies had only themselves to blame. Crony capitalism, lack of transparency, accounting procedures not up to international standards, and weak-kneed politicians too quick to spend and too afraid to tax were the problems according to IMF and US Treasury Department officials. The fact that the afflicted economies had been held up as paragons of virtue and IMF/World Bank success stories only a year before, the fact that neoliberalism’s only success story had been the Newly Industrialized Countries (NIC's) who were now in the tank, and the fact that the IMF and Treasury department story just didn’t fit the facts since the afflicted economies were no more rife with crony capitalism, lack of transparency, and weak-willed politicians than dozens of other economies untouched by the Asian financial crisis, simply did not matter.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Socialist economists dismiss the term as an [[apologetic]] for failures of [[neoliberal]] policy and, more fundamentally, their perception of the weaknesses of market allocation.

===Capitalist critique===
Supporters of capitalism generally oppose crony capitalism as well, and consider it an aberration brought on by governmental favors incompatible with [[free market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Crony Capitalism Comes Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/27/opinion/kristof-crony-capitalism-comes-homes.html|accessdate=Nov 27, 2011|quote=some financiers have chosen to live in a government-backed featherbed.

Even if the initial regulation was well-intentioned (to curb actual abuses), and even if the initial lobbying by corporations was well-intentioned (to reduce illogical regulations), the mixture of business and government stifle competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let's Take the "Crony" Out of "Crony Capitalism"|url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/john-stossel/let-s-take-the-crony-out-of-crony-capitalism.html|accessdate=Nov 26, 2011|quote=Which are more likely to be hampered by vigorous regulatory standards: entrenched corporations with their overstaffed legal and accounting departments or small startups trying to get off the ground?

[[Burton W. Folsom, Jr.]] distinguishes those that engage in crony capitalism—designated by him "political entrepreneurs"—from those who compete in the marketplace without special aid from government, whom he calls "market entrepreneurs". The market entrepreneurs, such as Hill, Vanderbilt, and Rockefeller, succeeded by producing a quality product at a competitive price. The political entrepreneurs, for example, [[Edward Knight Collins|Edward Collins]] in steamships and the leaders of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] in railroads, were men who used the power of government to succeed. They tried to gain subsidies or in some way use government to stop competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myth of the Robber Barons|url=http://www.burtfolsom.com/?page_id=29|accessdate=Nov 28, 2011|quote=The author, Burton Folsom, divides the entrepreneurs into two groups:  market entrepreneurs and political entrepreneurs.|last1=Folsom|first1=Burton|authorlink=Burton W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18953">A ''die'' in polymer processing is a metal restrictor or channel capable of providing a constant cross sectional profile to a stream of liquid [[polymer]].  This allows for continuous processing of shapes such as sheets, films, pipes, rods, and other more complex profiles.  This is a continuous process, allowing for constant production (assuming constant supply of polymer melt), as opposed to a sequential (non-constant) process such as [[injection molding]].

==Process==

[[File:Compounding-en.png|thumb|Extrusion line for plastic laces]]

'''Die forming''' typically occurs immediately after polymer melt has exited an [[plastics extrusion | extruder]].  The most basic process involves guiding the stream of molten polymer under pressure through a die, which three distinct regions:  manifold, approach, and lip.  The 'manifold' serves to channel the polymer melt from its initial extrusion point to a near-net-shape of the final product.  The 'approach' region further guides the melt into the final shape, and begins to correct for any non-uniform [[fluid dynamics | flow]].  Finally, the 'lip' forms the melt into the final desired cross section and compensates for any remaining flow asymmetry.  After exiting the lip of the die, the polymer melt will undergo [[die swell]] before curing.  Die swell is an expansion of the melt as the pressure is released, and is dependent on polymer chemistry and die design.  After curing, the solid, continuous part is drawn onto a take-up roller or cut into transportable lengths, depending on the type of part.  This process may vary significantly depending on the type of die and extrusion process.&lt;ref&gt;Tadmor and Gogos (2006). ''Principles of Polymer Processing''. John Wiley and Sons. {{ISBN|978-0-471-38770-1}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Sheet/film extrusion==

There are two major types of dies used in flat sheet extrusion: T-shaped and coat-hanger.  A T-shaped die consists of two arms extending at right angles from the initial extrusion channel; these arms have a small slit along their length to allow the polymer melt to flow through.  The melt is then further thinned by a short, flat approach before being pushed through the lips of the die.  This setup can cause non-uniform flow across the width of the extruded sheet, with the melt at the center flowing faster than the melt at the edges of the die, resulting in buckling and other defects after exiting the die.&lt;ref&gt; US Patent No. 5395231 A&lt;/ref&gt;

A more modern design is the coat-hanger die.  This die differs from the T-shaped die in that the arms are not at right angles to the input direction; instead, the arms are at a shallower angle and are often curved.  The arms also have a variable diameter, tapering down to a smaller radius further from the input channel.  The approach portion of coat-hanger dies are longer than their T-shaped counterparts, further reducing any flow nonuniformity.  Finally, the melt is extruded through lips as in the T-shaped die. 

For products such as plastic sheets or films, cooling is achieved by pulling through a set of cooling rolls (also known as calender or chill rolls), usually 3 or 4 in number. In sheet extrusion, these rolls not only deliver the necessary cooling but also help determine sheet thickness and surface texture (in case of structured rolls; i.e. smooth, levant, haircell, etc.).  A common processing defect known as nerve may occur when contact time between the rollers and extrudate is too brief, resulting in insufficient cooling time.

Coextrusion  is common in sheet and film extrusion, allowing for speedy production of multi-layered parts.  This is accomplished by joining multiple polymer melts in either the manifold or approach stage.  Layers of different thicknesses may be formed by introducing melts at different flow rates or different manifold sizes.  

==Blown film extrusion==

[[File:Film extrusion.jpg|thumb|Blow extrusion of plastic film]]

The manufacture of [[plastic film]] for products such as shopping bags and continuous sheeting is achieved using a blown film line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HOW TO SOLVE BLOWN FILM PROBLEMS|url=http://www.lyondellbasell.com/techlit/techlit/Handbooks%20and%20Manuals/BlownFilmProblems.pdf|publisher=Lyondell Chemical Company|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Polymer melt from an extruder is fed through an upright die with an annular opening. There are several types of dies that can be used, depending on final requirements of film quality and characteristics of the polymer melt: spider, crosshead, and spiral dies.

A spider die consists of an internal mandrel connected to the outer die wall by several "legs", and is a moderately complex design.  The resulting film will feature weld lines wherever legs were present.  These weld lines are weaker than the surrounding polymer, and may also have different optical characteristics, such as haze.  This weakness is caused by incomplete healing of the polymer molecular matrix.  Furthermore, a pressure gradient produced by the spider legs will cause nonuniform die swell, resulting in nonuniform film thickness.

A crosshead die splits the melt flow in two at the manifold inlet, recombining them at the opposite side of a cylindrical center mandrel.  This relatively simple design results in non-symmetrical flow, as molecules take longer to reach the opposite side than the close side of the mandrel.  As such, the resulting film will not be of uniform thickness.  To reduce this nonuniformity, inlet diameters can be varied, and various inserts can be added to minimize stagnant regions.

A spiral die is the most complex of the three major blown film die types.  The polymer melt is evenly distributed into several feed tubes, which wind around a central mandrel.  Each of these feed tubes is connected to the space between the mandrel and outer die walls; the feed tubes gradually diminish in diameter as they spiral around the mandrel.  At the same time, the space between the mandrel and outer die walls is increased.  This allows the polymer melt to layer and blend, resulting in a uniform melt profile free of weld lines.  This die design produces the most uniform films, but is also the most expensive.
 
Air pressure is introduced through the extrusion die so that after the polymer melt leaves the lip of the die, it expands in circumference. The tubing is also drawn along its length faster than it is being extruded. This leads to thinning of the film as it is expanded in both the draw (or machine) direction, and in the transverse (or hoop) direction. The ratio of the blown diameter to the extruded diameter is known as the blow-up ratio, and affects the resulting physical properties of the film, such as stiffness and strength. Film thickness and blow-up ratio can be varied by altering the take-up rate of the rollers, the internal pressure in the blown tube, and the melt extrusion rate. 

As the film is drawn upwards, it is cooled by a ring of air blowers so that the melt first becomes an amorphous viscoelastic solid, and then a semicrystalline solid, at what is known as the [[Frost line (polymers)|frost line]].  After solidification, the blown film tube continues to be cooled as it is pulled up by several sets of rollers, deflating the film to form lay-flat tubing. The flat film is then wound on a spool before further processing or shipping. The height of the film line is often 10 times the diameter of the blown tube or more; film lines in excess of 30 meters are possible.

Once the film tube is completely cooled, it is taken up by several nip rollers.  The width of the resulting doubled-over flat film is equal to half of the blown tube's circumference.  The film is then either spooled as a flattened tube, or immediately split into two separate pieces.  At this point, the film is ready for further processing, such as printing or cutting into final shape.

==Overjacketing extrusion==

[[Image:RG-59.jpg|thumb|[[Coaxial cable]], one example of a jacketed wire.]]

Overjacketing extrusion is a coating process, in which individual bare wires or bundles of pre-coated wires are coated with a layer of insulating polymer.  A wide variety of materials may be used, depending on the specific application.  For many applications, such as [[wire | insulated cables]], the polymer should be a good insulator, flexible, and wear resistant.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, F J (1998). ''Plastics Engineering''. Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-0-7506-3764-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this process, a wire (or bundle of wires) is preheated to above the glass transition or melting temperature of the polymer coating that is to be applied.  This is to ensure adhesion of the new coating.  Next, this preheated bare wire is pulled very rapidly through a die which places a thin coating of polymer around the wire.  Due to the geometry of the dies used, relatively high extrusion rates are possible while still avoiding melt fracture.  The newly coated wire is then drawn through an air or gas flame to smooth the surface of the coating, and finally a water bath to fully cool the coated wire.  Coated wires are now spooled to prepare for further processing, if desired.

There are two major types of dies used in overjacketing extrusion, both based on an overall crosshead design.  Regardless of die type used, the polymer melt is often extruded at a rate less than the speed of the bare wire that is drawn through the die, typically on the order of 1-4 times the speed of the melt.  This causes the polymer jacket to extend, thin, and tighten around the central wire, increasing adhesion of the new layer.

The first dye type is an annular, or tubing/jacketing, die that extrudes a tube of polymer that is initially ''not'' touching the bare wire.  A vacuum is then applied to the still-molten polymer tube, causing it to be drawn onto and bond to the surface of the bare wire.  This type of die is typically used to coat very thin wires with polymer jacketing that is highly viscous.

The second die type, known as a pressure type die, relies on contact between the jacketing polymer and bare wire inside the die. In this die type, a ring of polymer melt under pressure is forced around the bare wire. Due to the applied pressure of the melt, the opening around the inlet for the bare wire must be very small, on the order of 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm. The size of the exit opening controls the thickness of the resulting coating.  This type of die results in more intimate contact between the outer coating and the bare wire than the jacketing die.

== Fiber drawing (polymers) ==
Fiber drawing is a hybrid process, in which gravity or another force is used to geometrically and mechanically alter the extruded fibers. This process not only reduces the cross section of the polymer fiber, but also increases the strength of the fibers by aligning the individual polymer molecules.

Before drawing, polymer melt is pushed through a die with a large number of small holes, known as a spinneret. Typically, the fibers are air cooled without any need for curing.  If curing is needed, two methods are available: dry and wet spinning.  In wet spinning, the polymer is dissolved and extruded through a spinneret into a chemical bath.  In dry spinning, a solvent is allowed to evaporate as the fibers are cooled.

Typically, fiber drawing occurs immediately after spinning.  Application of an external force, either from gravity or take up rollers, causes the fibers to contract laterally and lengthen.  This orients the individual polymer molecules along the length of the fiber, increasing strength.  The radius of the fibers have been shown to decrease hyperbolically as they lengthen.  Once the fibers solidify, they may begin to crystallize, with each grain initially randomly oriented.  Further drawing will cause the crystal grains to elongate and reorient in the direction of the tensile axis, further strengthening the fibers.

=== Spinning stability ===

In practice, not all polymers are suitable for fiber spinning or drawing.  This is particularly an issue in extensional-thinning polymers, where capillary failure or [[Necking (engineering) | necking]] can cause separation of the melt before solidification.

Draw resonance is the most common issue that can occur during drawing of the polymer melt, regardless of polymer suitability.  Resonance occurs when the rate of mass flow is not constant between the spinneret and fiber take up roller, despite being constant at each of those individual components.  When the mass flow rate is not constant, the diameter of the fiber will vary to accommodate the variation.  Once started, this resonance may not correct itself, requiring a complete shutdown of the extrusion line.

It has been shown that draw resonance occurs once a critical drawdown ratio is exceeded; this ratio is dependent on the flow behavior (i.e. Newtonian, shear thinning) and viscoelastic behavior of the fluid.  Draw resonance has not been found to be a function of the flow rate, however.  A polymer melt approaching a Newtonian fluid such as PET can have a drawdown ratio of around 20, whereas highly shear thinning and viscoelastic polymer melts such as polyethylene, polystyrene, and polypropylene may have critical drawdown ratios as low as 3.

==Tube forming==

Tube forming dies allow for continuous extrusion of thick walled (relative to blown film extrusion) tubes and [[Pipe (fluid conveyance) | pipes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Small Scale Recycling of Plastics|author=John Vogler|publisher=Intermediate Technology Publication|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dies themselves are almost identical to those used in blown film extrusion; the only major difference is the gap between the inner mandrel and outer die wall.  Once the polymer melt is extruded from the die, it is pulled away by take-up rollers.  Cooling is accomplished through the use of water baths, or a large number of cooling fans.  After cooling, the tube is either wound onto large spools (if flexible), or cut into pre-set lengths and stacked (if stiff).  

Tubing with multiple lumens (holes) must be made for specialty applications. For these applications, the tooling is made by placing more than one mandrel in the center of the die, to produce the number of lumens necessary. In most cases, these mandrels are supplied with air pressure from different sources. In this way, the individual lumen sizes can be adjusted by adjusting the pressure to the individual mandrels.

==Profile extrusion==

Profile extrusion, the extrusion of complex shapes such as rain gutters, structural supports, and other components, brings with it some of the most complex die designs of any extrusion process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Giles | first = Harold F. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = John R. | last3 = Mount | first3 = Eldridge M. | title = Extrusion: the definitive processing guide and handbook | publisher = William Andrew | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUl2snQQ_OUC&amp;pg=PT173 | isbn = 978-0-8155-1473-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This difficulty is due to two primary concerns: producing the initial, still molten profile, and then controlling for asymmetrical shrinkage and die swell due to varying wall thicknesses.

Unlike in blown film, pipe, and sheet extrusion, the dies used in profile extrusion are rarely round or completely flat.  Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, this is not the case for more complex shapes.  Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, square profile.  The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls.  When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer die wall.  However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual.  As a result, the extruded square profile will experience more die swell at the edges than the corners, causing the once square profile to become more circular.  This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.  

As the desired profile becomes more complex, the die in turn becomes more complex.  Care must be taken to minimize weld lines, as well as ensuring complete filling of the die to prevent bubbles and other defects in the finished extruded profile.  After the initial extrusion is complete, the molten polymer profile is cooled slightly before being run through a sizing die.  This die ensures that the extruded profile meets specifications, and can correct the shape to fit those specifications.  After sizing is complete, the profile is cooled before any further processing.

==Coextrusion==

[[File:5 Layer Extrusion Technology.jpg|thumb|5 :5 Layer Co-Extrusion of Cosmetic "Squeeze" Tube]]

In practice, many films, sheets, and other extruded parts are multilayered; this allows for optimization of a wide range of properties, such as oxygen permeability, strength, and stiffness. The primary difficulty of coextrusion is bridging the gap in properties between each layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Rosato | first = Marlene G. | title = Concise encyclopedia of plastics | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0g9QjxsbqmUC&amp;pg=PA245 | isbn = 978-0-7923-8496-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adding a thin "compatibility" layer is a common solution to alleviating viscosity or stiffness incompatibilities.&lt;ref&gt;Brydson, J A (1999). ''Plastics Materials''. Elsevier. {{ISBN|978-0-7506-4132-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two major die types for coextrusion: single manifold and multi manifold.  Both types rely on a separate extruder for each polymer chemistry.  In multi manifold dies, each layer is extruded separately and only combined just before the die lips.  This die type is expensive due to the complex tooling required, but can alleviate vast differences in rheological behavior between the various layers.  Single manifold dies form the multiple layers into a single layer, allowing contact between the polymer layers for a longer period of time.  This ensures optimal bonding, but comes at the consequence of needing higher compatibility polymers.

There are two types of processing defects that can occur during coextrusion.  The first defect is interface instability, causing unintended interface shapes.  This can cause "encapsulation" of the higher viscosity melt by the lower viscosity melt, leading to poor final performance of the extruded part.  The severity of this type of defect is proportional to the difference in viscosities between the two polymer melts.  The other type of defect forms from oscillations in the melt flow, causing small wavelike patterns on the surface of the melt and reducing optical transparency.

'''Emilio Bacardi Moreau''' (1844–1922) was a Cuban industrialist, politician, and writer who managed the [[Bacardi|Bacardi Rum Company]] and served as mayor of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]].

==Biography==
Emilio was the son of [[Facundo Bacardi]] and his wife Amalia Moreau.  His father was a businessman who in 1862 founded the Bacardi distilling company that would grow into today's international corporation.  However, before finding stability in the rum business, Facundo and his young family experienced some of tragedies of the day.  For instance, in 1852 a major earthquake struck Santiago and the family briefly returned to [[Spain]] to escape the ensuing epidemics of [[cholera]] (epidemics which claimed some of Emilio's siblings).  Upon his return, Facundo found that the general store he had been running was looted and its customers had fled.  Within a few years he was bankrupt.

In some ways, Emilio was protected from the turbulence by distance: the family's return to Cuba was completed without him, who stayed behind with a family friend in Spain.  He received instruction in literary and political topics and grew to appreciate the arts and the liberal politics of the day (including abolition of slavery, criticism of organized religion, nationalism, and democracy).  By the time he returned to Cuba at the age of 17, his interests lay more in political and poetic activism than business.  However, as the first-born son of his father, he was given a growing and important role in the fledgling company.

Throughout the 1870s, 80's, and 90's, Emilio's dual identity as business magnate and subversive political activist grew.  The rum business continued to grow under his leadership, which was made official in 1877 when Don Facundo retired and named him president of the company.  At the same time, Emilio became more and more involved in Cuba's nationalistic resistance to the [[Spanish Empire]].  He was repeatedly arrested and imprisoned on suspicion of helping the rebels.  These suspicions were well founded, as Emilio used his respectable business activities and connections as a cover for developing a financial network which channelled resources to the rebel guerilla army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Gjelten, Tom]]|title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba|publisher=Viking|year=2008|isbn=978-0-670-01978-6|pages=45–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emilio's personal life continued to develop as well: in 1876 he married Maria Lay Berlucheau, a French Cuban from Santiago.  He would go on to have a number of children with her, including Emilio (Emilito), Daniel, Jose, Facundo, Maria, and Carmen.  In the spring of 1885, however, she died at the age of 33, devastating Emilio and sending him into a depression from which it took months to recover.  His eventual recovery coincided with the companionship of Elvira Cape, whom he married in 1887 and lived with for the rest of his life.  Their four children (Marina, Lucia, Adelaida, and Amalia) further enlarged the Bacardi family.

[[File:Panteon de Emilio Bacardi y Moreau.jpg|thumb|Burial vault of Emilio Bacardi y Moreau and his wife Elvira Cape de Bacardi, located in the [[Santa Ifigenia Cemetery]], in the provinces Santiago de Cuba, Cuba.]]

The political fortunes of both Cuba and Emilio were radically altered by the [[Spanish–American War]], in which the conquering American army took over administration of the island.  The American military governor of Santiago, General [[Leonard Wood]], appointed Bacardi as mayor of Santiago.  In this position, Emilio worked extensively with the American military administration, and the relationship between him and General Wood warmed to the level of friendship, tempered by their complicated political relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gjelten, Tom|title=Bacardi and the Long Fight for Cuba|publisher=Viking|year=2008|isbn=978-0-670-01978-6|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As mayor, he was generally recognized as a competent and effective manager, succeeding on extending services and practicing good government under the military administration and later the new Cuban republic.  His reputation for honesty and public service distinguished him from many of the would-be leaders who arose in the post-independence political scramble, and he eventually ran for and won a seat in the national senate in 1906.

'''Equipment Lease Agreements''' typically contain language prohibiting the lessee from assigning the [[lease]] to a third party.  For example, "You have no right to sell, transfer, assign, sublease, or encumber the equipment or this agreement" protects the Lessor’s [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] and credit [[underwriting]] guidelines in the event the lessee ever wants to transfer the lease to another party.  However, it is possible to assign the lease, but the new party (assignee) will be subject to the lessor’s credit evaluation process and approval. Even if the assignee is approved, the existing lessee’s (assignor’s) personal guarantee(s), if any, might not be released unless the assignee’s credit stature is extremely strong.

Felice is known to have won a [[Jousting|joust]] held to celebrate Florence's submission of [[Pisa]] in 1406.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6796">'''Fira de Barcelona''' is [[Barcelona]]’s [[trade fair]] institution and one of the most important in [[Europe]].

Fira de Barcelona works to develop new opportunities for overseas business, especially in Asia and Latin America, geared to increasing the participation of Fira exhibitors in events in other countries, replicating some shows that are held in Barcelona and selling services, technology, management and advice to other organisers and exhibition centres.

In 1932, Fira Internacional de Barcelona was officially constituted, declared for public use and, in 2000, the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] was incorporated in the government organs, together with the [[Barcelona City Council]] and the [[Barcelona Chamber of Commerce]]. In 2010, it revised its strategic plan named “new value proposal” in order to anticipate the future demands of the market, based on reinforcing the ranking of its shows, promoting innovation and knowledge and boosting international business.

==Two large venues: Montjuïc and Gran Via==
Fira de Barcelona has over 400,000 m2 of exhibition floor space and is one of the largest in Europe, divided into two large venues: the emblematic Montjuïc and the modern [[Gran Via (Barcelona)|Gran Via]], designed by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3069">'''Fleet management software''' (FMS) is [[computer software]] that enables people to accomplish a series of specific tasks in the management of any or all aspects relating to a fleet of [[vehicles]] operated by a company, government, or other organisation.  These specific tasks encompass all operations from vehicle acquisition through maintenance to disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bennett|first=Sean|title=Heavy Duty Truck Systems|edition=5|date=February 2, 2010|publisher=Delmar Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1435483828|pages=116–117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fleet management software functions==

The main function of [[fleet management]] software is to gather, store, process, monitor, report on and export information.  Information can be imported from external sources such as [[gas pump]] processors, territorial authorities for managing vehicle registration (for example [[DVLA]] and [[VOSA]]), financial institutions, insurance databases, vehicle specification databases, mapping systems and from internal sources such as [[Human Resources]] and [[Finance]].

===Vehicle management===

Fleet management software should be able to manage processes, tasks and events related to all kinds of vehicles - car, [[truck]]s, earth-moving machinery, buses, forklift trucks, trailers and specialist equipment, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drivingtests.co.nz/resources/fleet-management-software-functions/|title=Fleet Management Software Functions|work=DT Driver Training Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vehicle inventory - the number and type of vehicles
* Vehicle maintenance - specific [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and scheduled maintenance, and ad hoc requirements
* Licensing, registration, [[MOT test|MOT]] and [[tax]] 
* [[Vehicle insurance]] including due dates and restrictions
* [[Cost management]] and analysis
* Vehicle disposal

===Driver management===
* [[Driver license]] management, including special provisions
* Logging of penalty points and infringements against a licence
* Booking system for pool vehicles

===Incident management===
* Accidents and fines, plus apportioning costs to drivers

===Tracking===
* [[Telematics]]
* [[Route planning]]
* Logbooks and work time
* Alerts

==Software procurement and development==

Fleet management software can be developed in-house by the company or organisation using it, or be purchased from a third party.  It varies greatly in its complexity and cost.

Fleet management software is directly related to [[fleet management]].  It originated on mainframe computers in the 1970s and shifted to the [[personal computer]]s in the 1980s when it became practical. In later years however Fleet Management Software has been more efficiently provided as [[SaaS]]. Fleet management software has become increasingly necessary and complex as increasing amounts of [[vehicle]] related [[legislation]] has been brought in.

'''Frederick Anderson''' (1855&amp;ndash;1940) was a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[association football|football]] player and businessman in Shanghai and London. He served two terms as the Chairman of the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]].

==Life and career==
Anderson was born on 17 November 1855 in Scotland, to James Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in the Far East 1906; British Peerage&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[The Glasgow Academy]].

Anderson played as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Clydesdale F.C.|Clydesdale]], [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queen's Park]] and represented the [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] national team once, in an 1874 [[friendly match]] against [[England national football team|England]]. He scored Scotland's first goal in a 2–1 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/international_fixture_details.cfm?page=1921&amp;matchid=58025 Scottish Football Association]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.londonhearts.com/scotland/games/18740307.html Sat 07 Mar 1874 Scotland 2 England 1], London Hearts.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played in the first ever [[Scottish Cup Final]], which his Clydesdale team lost 2–0 to his former club, Queen's Park  in 1874.

Anderson moved to Shanghai in the early 1880s to join Messrs Holliday, Wise &amp; Co.. At the beginning of 1890 he joined Messrs Ilbert &amp; Co and by 1909 had become the principal partner of the firm.&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, May 15, 1909, p402&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson served on the [[Shanghai Municipal Council]] for eight years from 1892 to 1897.  The Municipal Council was the body that ran the Settlement. He was elected Chairman in August 1899 following the resignation of [[James Fearon (businessman)|James Fearon]] and served until 1900.  He served as Chairman again from 1904 to 1906. He was also the local chairman in Shanghai of the [[China Association]].

In 1898-99 and 1908-9, Shanghai Rugby Club chose Frederick Anderson as President in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, 3 November 1905 and North China Herald, May 15, 1909, p402&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously played two games of rugby for the second Shanghai Football Club, once in January 1882 and then four years later in January 1886.

He left Shanghai in 1909 and returned to London.&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, May 15, 1909, p378 and 402&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1919, was serving as the chairman of the [[China Association]] in London&lt;ref&gt;Canton Times, Feb 4, 1919, p6&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1922, he was re-elected President of the association.&lt;ref&gt;North China Herald, 16 Sept 1922, p801&lt;/ref&gt; 

He died on 5 January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 106th edition vol 1 p181 by Charles Mosley (1999)  There is what is reported to be a gravestone of Anderson at the Soong Ching-ling Memorial Park in Shanghai. [https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/114290732 Find a Grave Memorial].  This is most likely not Anderson's grave.  He does not appear to have died in Shanghai.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Anderson married Sophia Louisa Le Hunte Ward, daughter of [http://www.pdavis.nl/ShowBiog.php?id=1428 Admiral T. Le Hunte Ward C.B.] on 4 June 1896. They had two children Frederick Le Hunte Anderson, and Helen Sophia Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Who's Who in the Far East 1906; British Peerage&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Albert Dimmitt''' (21 June 1888 – 29 January 1957) was an Australian politician who was a [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1938 to 1953. He later served as [[Agent-General for Western Australia]] from 1953 until his death.

Dimmitt was born in [[Melbourne]], and arrived in Western Australia in 1911, where he began working as a salesman. He eventually became a company director, serving on the boards of a wide variety of companies, including a [[match]] company, an insurance company, a coal-mining firm, and an airline ([[West Australian Airways]]). His own company, Armstrong Dimmitt Ltd., sold motor vehicle parts and accessories. Dimmitt was elected to parliament in 1938, representing [[Metropolitan-Suburban Province]]. He was appointed chairman of committees in the Legislative Council in 1946, replacing [[James Cornell]]. In 1953, the Liberal government of [[Ross McLarty]] appointed Dimmitt to the position of agent-general (the government's representative in London), which meant he had to resign from parliament. He served until his death in January 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.wa.gov.au/parliament/library/MPHistoricalData.nsf/(Lookup)/D184A64E8E0F8C5F482577E50028A5B8?OpenDocument James Albert Dimmitt] – Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.

'''Jan Cock Blomhoff''' ([[Amsterdam]], 5 August 1779 – [[Amersfoort]], 15 August 1853) was director ("[[opperhoofd]]") of [[Dejima]], the Dutch trading colony in the harbour of [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]], 1817–1824,&lt;ref&gt;Historiographical Institute. (1988). ''Historical documents relating to Japan in foreign countries,'' Vol. I, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; succeeding [[Hendrik Doeff]].

During his first stay on the island (1809–1813) he had an affair with a Japanese woman and the couple had a child, who died in 1813.
 
When he arrived in Dejima for the second time in August 1817 he was accompanied by his wife [[Titia Bergsma]], whom he had married in 1815; his son Johannes; [[Petronella Muns]], a Dutch wetnurse; and an Indonesian maid.  The ladies and the little boy were not allowed to stay. In the short time they stayed there, till December 1817, they were often drawn by artists, who had never seen other than Japanese women, and 500 different prints widely circulated throughout the country.

Blomhoff is commemorated in the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] of an Asiatic pit viper, ''[[Gloydius blomhoffii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

'''John Jantsch''' (born April 2, 1960) is an author, speaker, and [[marketing consultant]] who specializes in assisting small businesses.&lt;ref name=forbesinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2012/10/11/is-the-work-you-do-worthwhile/ |title=Is the Work You Do Worthwhile? |author=Schawbel, Dan |work=Forbes |date=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of ''Duct Tape Marketing'', ''The Referral Engine'', and ''[[The Commitment Engine: Making Work Worth It|The Commitment Engine]]''.&lt;ref name=nytimesmention&gt;{{cite news |url=http://boss.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/this-week-in-small-business-now-what/ |title=This Week in Small Business |author=Marks, Gene |newspaper=New York Times |date=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Jantsch grew up in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and attended the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name=linkedinprofile&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linkedin.com/in/ducttapemarketing |title=LinkedIn Profile |publisher=LinkedIn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Jantsch created the Duct Tape Marketing System, which trains and licenses small business consultants.&lt;ref name=ducttapeabout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/about |title=Duct Tape Marketing About |publisher=DuctTapeMarketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later he added the Duct Tape Marketing Consultant Network.&lt;ref name=ducttapeconsulting&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ducttapemarketingconsultant.com/ |title=Duct Tape Marketing Consultant |publisher=DuctTapeMarketingConsultant.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duct Tape Marketing offers marketing workshops and consulting to small businesses looking to expand.&lt;ref name=bloombergducttape&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-04-26/duct-tape-tips-on-marketing-your-business |title=Duct Tape Tips on Marketing Your Business |newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek |date=April 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jantsch suggests treating small business marketing systematically and not creating individual "marketing events."&lt;ref name=bloombergducttape/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnmoney&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/21/smallbusiness/customers_sell_for_you.fsb/ |title=Get customers to sell for you |author=Martin, Justin |newspaper=CNN Money |date=May 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way to do this, Jantsch says, is to maintain a strong and consistent internet presence through blogs, social media, and forums tailored to small business interests.&lt;ref name=wsjducttape&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118705175447196673 |title=Getting Effective Publicity for Less |author=Spors, Kelly |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==

===''Duct Tape Marketing''===
In 2007, Jantsch published ''Duct Tape Marketing: The World's Most Practical Small Business Marketing Guide'', which outlines his systematic approach to marketing.&lt;ref name=guyk&gt;{{cite web |url=https://guykawasaki.com/the_essence_of_/ |title=The Essence of Duct Tape Marketing |author=Kawasaki, Guy |publisher=GuyKawasaki.com |date=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into three parts.&lt;ref name=ducttapebook&gt;{{cite book|last=Jantsch|first=John|title=Duct Tape Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=1591843111|pages=304|url=https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1595554653/jantschcomm-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part I is titled "The Duct Tape Foundation—The Way to Sticky Marketing" and deals with laying the groundwork for a successful marketing system.&lt;ref name=ducttapebook/&gt; Part II is titled "The Duct Tape Lead Generation Machine—Turning Stickiness Into a System That Works for You" and it focuses on implementing the strategies of Part I.&lt;ref name=ducttapebook/&gt; Part III is titled "Getting on a Roll!" and it serves as a conclusion meant to ground the preceding two parts.&lt;ref name=ducttapebook/&gt;

[[Michael Gerber (non-fiction writer)|Michael Gerber]] said ''Duct Tape Marketing'' is "just like its namesake – Duct Tape – it's good, incredibly smart, amazingly practical, and immensely sticky stuff."&lt;ref name=ducttapesmallbizreview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallbiztrends.com/2009/01/duct-tape-marketing-book-review.html |title=Duct Tape Marketing: The World’s Most Practical Small Business Marketing Guide – A Book Review |author=Lindeskog, Martin |publisher=SmallBizTrends.com |date=January 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Duct Tape Marketing Revised &amp; Updated'' was published in 2011.&lt;ref name=ducttapeupdated&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2011/09/27/duct-tape-marketing-updated-revised-and-alive/ |title=Duct Tape Marketing Updated, Revised and Alive

===''The Referral Engine''===
In 2010, Jantsch published ''The Referral Engine: Teaching Your Business to Market Itself''. The book outlines an approach to marketing that moves away from complicated marketing campaigns and instead focuses on personal interactions with customers through outlets such as social media and friend-to-friend word of mouth.&lt;ref name=referralenginesmallbiztrends&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/05/referral-engine-teaching-your-business-market-itself.html |title=The Referral Engine: Teaching Your Business to Market Itself |author=Taylor, Ivana |publisher=SmallBizTrends.com |date=May 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea, Jantsch writes, is that a business should always focus on and understand the importance of referrals.&lt;ref name=referralengineentrepreneur&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/blog/218929 |title=
Book Review: Referral Engine by John Jantsch |author=Danielson, Diane |newspaper=Entrepreneur |date=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65815">This is a '''list of companies founded by [[Stanford University]] alumni''', including attendees who enrolled in degree-programs at Stanford but did not eventually graduate. This list is not exhaustive, as it only includes notable [[Company|companies]] &lt;!-- i.e. having articles on Wikipedia, but we don't reference Wikipedia within Wikipedia--&gt; of which the founding and development history is well recorded by reliable sources. In particular, [[Subsidiary|subsidiaries]] are listed with their owners in parentheses.

According to [[PitchBook Data|PitchBook]], from 2006 to 2017, Stanford produced 1,127 company founders as alumni or current students, more than any other university in the world; and these founders created 957 companies, second only to [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/website/files/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2017-2018_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: The top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2017-2018)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.pitchbook.com/pdf/PitchBook_Universities_Report_2016-2017_Edition.pdf|title=Universities Report: Top 50 universities producing VC-backed entrepreneurs (2016-2017)|last=|first=|date=|website=PitchBook|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a Stanford alumni survey conducted in 2011, some 39,900 companies founded by Stanford alumni were active, and companies founded by Stanford alumni altogether generated more than $2.7 [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] in annual revenue and had created 5.4 million jobs, roughly equivalent to the 10th-largest economy in the world (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stanford.app.box.com/s/55estv4w8qi5vgd8n7i8q6jlo7cmdy6f|title=Box|website=stanford.app.box.com|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.stanford.edu/news/2012/october/innovation-economic-impact-102412.html|title=Study shows Stanford alumni create nearly $3 trillion in economic impact each year|work=Stanford University|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2012/10/24/stanford-alumnis-companies-combined-equal-10th-largest-economy-on-the-planet/|title=Stanford alumni’s companies combined equal 10th largest economy on the planet|date=2012-10-24|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2017-12-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this list, founders of a company which [[merged]] with other companies to form a new company are counted as founders of the new company. However, founders of a company which later dissolved into several successor companies are ''not'' counted as founders of those successor companies; this same rule applies to [[Spin-off (corporate)|spin-off companies]]. Finally, a defunct company is a company that had stopped functioning completely (e.g., [[Bankruptcy|bankrupt]]) without dissolving, merging or being [[Acquisitions|acquired]].

'''''Microsoft Corp v Commission''''' (2007) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:62004TJ0201 T-201/04] is a case brought by the [[European Commission]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) against [[Microsoft]] for abuse of its dominant position in the market (according to [[competition law]]). It started as a complaint from [[Sun Microsystems]] over Microsoft's licensing practices in 1993, and eventually resulted in the EU ordering Microsoft to divulge certain information about its server products and release a version of [[Microsoft Windows]] without [[Windows Media Player]]. The European Commission especially focused on the interoperability issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leconcurrentialiste.com/2014/02/10/the-microsoft-case-by-the-numbers-comparison-between-u-s-and-e-u/|title=The Microsoft case by the numbers: comparison between U.S. and E.U.|author=|date=10 February 2014|website=leconcurrentialiste.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facts==
In 1993, [[Novell]] claimed that Microsoft was blocking its competitors out of the market through anti-competitive practices. The complaint centered on the license practices at the time which required royalties from each computer sold by a supplier of Microsoft's operating system, whether or not the unit actually contained the Windows operating system. Microsoft reached a settlement in 1994, ending some of its license practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1023_3-204317.html | title=Microsoft investigated in Europe | first=Lamia | last=Abu-Haidar | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | date=1997-10-16 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Sun Microsystems]] raised a complaint about the lack of disclosure of some of the interfaces to Windows NT. The case widened when the EU examined how [[streaming media]] technologies were integrated with Windows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1001_3-941090.html | title=EU looks to wrap up Microsoft probe | publisher=CNET News.com| first=Declan | last=McCullagh | authorlink=Declan McCullagh | date=2002-07-01 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment ==
Citing ongoing abuse by Microsoft, the EU reached a preliminary decision in the case in 2003 and ordered the company to offer both a version of Windows without Windows Media Player and the information necessary for competing networking software to interact fully with Windows desktops and servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5060463.html | title=EU closes in on Microsoft penalty | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2003-08-06 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2004, the EU ordered Microsoft to pay [[Euro|€]]497 million ([[United States Dollar|$]]794 million or [[Pound sterling|£]]381 million), the largest fine ever handed out by the EU at the time, in addition to the previous penalties, which included 120 days to divulge the server information and 90 days to produce a version of Windows without Windows Media Player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32007D0053:EN:NOT Commission Decision of 24.03.2004 relating to a proceeding under Article 82 of the EC Treaty (Case COMP/C-3/37.792 Microsoft)| date=2007-06-02].

The next month Microsoft released a paper containing scathing commentary on the ruling including: "The commission is seeking to make new law that will have an adverse impact on intellectual property rights and the ability of dominant firms to innovate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5197390.html | title=Microsoft commentary slams EU ruling | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Ina | last=Fried | authorlink=Ina Fried | date=2004-04-21 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft paid the fine in full in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1014_3-5255715.html | title=Microsoft pays EU in full | publisher=CNET News.com | first=Matt | last=Hines | date=2004-07-02 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[Neelie Kroes]] was appointed the European Commissioner for Competition; one of her first tasks was to oversee the fining brought onto Microsoft. Kroes has stated she believes [[open standards]] and [[Open-source software|open source]] are preferable to anything [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2544|title=Linux and Open Source - ZDNet|author=|date=|website=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The Commission must do its part.....It must not rely on one vendor, it must not accept closed standards, and it must refuse to become [[Vendor lock-in|locked into a particular technology]] – jeopardizing maintenance of full control over the information in its possession}}

==Significance==
Microsoft has a compliant version of its flagship operating system without Windows Media Player available under the negotiated name "[[Windows XP]] N".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.com/2100-1016_3-5960750.html | title=Still 'no demand' for media-player-free Windows | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Ingrid | last=Marson | date=2005-11-18 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the server information requirement, Microsoft released the [[source code]], but not the specifications, to [[Windows Server 2003]] Service Pack 1 (SP1) to members of its Work Group Server Protocol Program (WSPP) on the day of the original deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://open.itworld.com/4914/060125ms_ups_ante/page_1.html |title=Microsoft ups the ante with the E.C. |publisher=ITworld.com |first=Neil |last=Macehiter |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630061120/http://open.itworld.com/4914/060125ms_ups_ante/page_1.html |archivedate=30 June 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also appealed the case, and the EU had a week-long hearing over it. [[Neelie Kroes]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.cnet.com/No-alternative-to-Microsoft-fine/2008-1014_3-6093104.html | title='No alternative' to Microsoft fine | publisher=[[CNET News.com]] | first=Dawn | last=Kawamoto | date=2006-07-12 | accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Microsoft has claimed that its obligations in the decision are not clear, or that the obligations have changed. I cannot accept this characterization--Microsoft's obligations are clearly outlined in the 2004 decision and have remained constant since then.
Indeed, the monitoring trustee appointed in October 2005, from a shortlist put forward by Microsoft, believes that the decision clearly outlines what Microsoft is required to do. I must say that I find it difficult to imagine that a company like Microsoft does not understand the principles of how to document protocols in order to achieve interoperability.}}

Microsoft stated in June 2006 that it had begun to provide the EU with the requested information, but according to the [[BBC]] the EU stated that it was too late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5120536.stm | title=Brussels poised to fine Microsoft | publisher=BBC | date=2006-06-27 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 July 2006, the EU fined Microsoft for an additional €280.5 million (US$448.58 million), €1.5 million (US$2.39 million) per day from 16 December 2005 to 20 June 2006. The EU threatened to increase the fine to €3 million ($4.81 million) per day on 31 July 2006 if Microsoft did not comply by then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.zeropaid.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-38334.html |title=EU fines Microsoft $357.3 million for defiance |publisher=Reuters |first=David |last=Lawsky |author2=Zawadzki, Sabina |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2006-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309135557/http://www.zeropaid.com/bbs/archive/index.php/t-38334.html |archivedate=9 March 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 September 2007, Microsoft lost their appeal against the European Commission's case.  The €497 million fine was upheld, as were the requirements regarding server interoperability information and bundling of Media Player.  In addition, Microsoft has to pay 80% of the legal costs of the Commission, while the Commission has to pay 20% of the legal costs by Microsoft. However, the appeal court rejected the Commission ruling that an independent monitoring trustee should have unlimited access to internal company organization in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6998272.stm Microsoft loses anti-trust appeal].

Microsoft announced that it will demand 0.4% of the revenue (rather than 5.95%) in patent-licensing royalties, only from commercial vendors of interoperable software and promised not to seek patent royalties from individual open source developers. The interoperability information alone is available for a one-time fee of €10,000 (US$15,992).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63623,eu-forces-microsoft-to-cage-open-source-patent-dogs.aspx EU forces Microsoft to cage open source patent dogs]. itNews, 24 October 2007.  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024201321/http://www.itnews.com.au/News/63623%2Ceu-forces-microsoft-to-cage-open-source-patent-dogs.aspx |date=24 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 February 2008, the EU fined Microsoft an additional €899 million (US$1.44 billion) for failure to comply with the March 2004 antitrust decision. This represented the largest penalty ever imposed in 50 years of EU competition policy until 2009, when the European Commission fined Intel €1.06 billion ($1.45 billion) for anti-competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/137467-european-commission-gives-intel-record-fine-for-antitrust-violation|title=European Commission Gives Intel Record Fine for Antitrust Violation|first=|last=TechCrunch|date=13 May 2009|website=seekingalpha.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latest decision follows a prior €280.5 million fine for non-compliance, covering the period from 21 June 2006 until 21 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/|title=Breaking News, World News &amp; Multimedia|author=|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 May 2008, Microsoft lodged an appeal in the European [[General Court (European Union)|Court of First Instance]] seeking to overturn the €899 million fine, officially stating that it intended to use the action as a "constructive effort to seek clarity from the court".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9084578&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top Update: Microsoft to appeal $1.3B EU fine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525142524/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9084578&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top |date=25 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 2008 Annual Report Microsoft stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Asay |first=Matt |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-10005379-16.html |title=Microsoft's annual report: Open-source mental block &amp;#124; The Open Road |publisher=CNET News |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design of high-volume Microsoft products and the terms on which we make certain technologies used in these products, such as file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available to other companies. In 2004, the Commission ordered us to create new versions of Windows that do not include certain multimedia technologies and to provide our competitors with specifications for how to implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols in their own products. The Commission’s impact on product design may limit our ability to innovate in Windows or other products in the future, diminish the developer appeal of the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability of licenses related to protocols and file formats may enable competitors to develop software products that better mimic the functionality of our own products which could result in decreased sales of our products.}}

On 27 June 2012, the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] upheld the fine, but reduced it from €899 million to €860 million.  The difference was due to a "miscalculation" by the European Commission.  The commission's decision to fine Microsoft was not challenged by the court, saying the company had blocked fair access to its markets.&lt;ref name=upheld&gt;{{cite news|title=In European Court, a Small Victory for Microsoft|author=James Kanter|date=27 June 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/global/in-european-court-a-small-victory-for-microsoft.html?_r=1|accessdate=28 June 2012|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; E.U. competition commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, has said that such fines may not be effective in preventing anti-competitive behavior and that the commission now preferred to seek settlements that restrict businesses' plans instead.  As such, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the Microsoft decision "a decision that could mark the end of an era in antitrust law in which regulators used big fines to bring technology giants to heel."&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;

A spokesperson for Microsoft said the company was "disappointed with the court’s ruling" and felt the company had "resolved [the commissions'] competition law concerns" in 2009, making the fine unnecessary.&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;  He declined to say whether Microsoft would file an appeal or not. Almunia called the ruling a vindication of the crackdown on Microsoft and warned "The judgment confirms that the imposition of such penalty payments remains an important tool at the commission’s disposal."&lt;ref name=upheld /&gt;  He also claimed that the commission's actions against Microsoft had allowed "a range of innovative products that would otherwise not have seen the light of day" to reach the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft loses EU antitrust fine appeal|author=Charles Arthur|work=The Guardian|date=27 June 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jun/27/microsoft-loses-eu-antitrust-fine-appeal?newsfeed=true|accessdate=28 June 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fines will not be distributed to the companies that lost income due to Microsoft practices.  The money paid in fines to the European Court goes back into the EU budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/consumers/institutions_en.html|title=Competition policy and EU institutions - European Commission|author=|date=|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the European Commission announced it would investigate the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows operating systems from Microsoft, saying "Microsoft's tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and ultimately reduces consumer choice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7834792.stm|title=Microsoft is accused by EU again|author=|date=25 May 2018|publisher=|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/09/15&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - Antitrust: Commission confirms sending a Statement of Objections to Microsoft on the tying of Internet Explorer to Windows|author=|date=|website=europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Microsoft announced that it would not bundle Internet Explorer with Windows 7 E, the version of Windows 7 to be sold in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://microsoftontheissues.com/cs/blogs/mscorp/archive/2009/06/11/working-to-fulfill-our-legal-obligations-in-europe-for-windows-7.aspx |title=Working to Fulfill our Legal Obligations in Europe for Windows 7 |date=2009-06-11 |publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]] |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618132052/http://microsoftontheissues.com/cs/blogs/mscorp/archive/2009/06/11/working-to-fulfill-our-legal-obligations-in-europe-for-windows-7.aspx |archivedate=18 June 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Win7PreOrder"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/uk/windows/buy/offers/pre-order.aspx|title=Windows 7 Pre-Order Offer|publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]]|accessdate=2009-07-15|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AIAq387M?url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/shop/windows-7|archive-date=30 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCNoIEWin7"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8096701.stm|title=No IE onboard Windows 7 in Europe|date=2009-06-12|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArsTechnicaNoIEWIn7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/06/windows-7-to-be-shipped-in-europe-sans-internet-explorer.ars|title=Windows 7 to be shipped in Europe without Internet Explorer|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianNoIEWin7"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2009/jun/12/windows-7-internet-explorer|title=European version of Windows 7 will not include browser|last=John|first=Bobbie|date=2009-06-12|publisher=[[guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=2009-07-15 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RegisterNoIEWin7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/07/14/windows_7_leak_ie8/|title=Windows 7 still baking in oven, insists Microsoft|last=Fiveash|first=Kelly|date=2009-07-14|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2009-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''national trade union center''' is a federation or confederation of [[trade union]]s in a single [[country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HAGMFu2sAh8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=National+trade+union+centre+country&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ4ayItdLWAhUMYVAKHSAEAWMQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=National%20trade%20union%20centre%20country&amp;f=false|title=Political Transformation, Structural Adjustment and Industrial Relations in Africa : English-speaking Countries: Proceedings Of, and Documents Submitted To, a Symposium (Arusha, United Republic of Tanzania, 1-4 February 1993).|last=Office|first=International Labour|date=1994|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=|isbn=9789221085195|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every country in the world has a national trade union center, and many have more than one. When there is more than one national center, it is often because of [[ideology|ideological]] differences—in some cases long-standing historic differences. In some regions, such as the [[Nordic countries]], different centers exist on a sectoral basis, for example for [[blue collar]] workers and [[professional]]s.

Among the larger national centers in the world are the [[American Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations]] and the [[Change to Win Federation]] in the USA; the [[Canadian Labour Congress]]; the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) in Britain; the [[Irish Congress of Trade Unions]]; the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU); the [[Congress of South African Trade Unions]]; the Dutch [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]]; the [[LO, The Danish Confederation of Trade Unions|Danish]], [[Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions|Norwegian]], and [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|Swedish LO]]; the German [[German Confederation of Trade Unions|DGB]]; the French [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] and [[CFDT]]; the Italian [[Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions|CISL]], [[Italian General Confederation of Labour|CGIL]] and [[Italian Labour Union|UIL]]; the Spanish [[Comisiones Obreras|CCOO]], [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], [[Confederacion General del Trabajo de España|CGT]] and [[Unión Sindical Obrera|USO]]; the Czech [[Bohemian-Moravian Confederation of Trade Unions|ČMKOS]]; the Japan Trade Union Confederation [[RENGO]]; the Argentinian [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] and [[Argentine Workers' Center|CTA]]; the Brazilian [[Central Única dos Trabalhadores|CUT]], and so on.

Many national trade union centers are now members of the [[International Trade Union Confederation]], although some belong to the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

Sgt '''Per Bergsland''' (17 January 1918 – 9 June 1992) was a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[POW]] in the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[POW camp]] [[Stalag Luft III]] and one of only three men to escape to freedom in the "[[Stalag Luft III#The "Great Escape"|Great Escape]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports career==
During in the 1930s Bergsland competed in [[orienteering]], representing the club [[IL Heming]]. In 1939 he placed second at the individual Norwegian championship in orienteering held at [[Modum]].&lt;ref name=o90&gt;{{cite book |title=Orienteringsidretten i Norge gjennom 90 år |editor1=Berglia, Knut |editor2=Brohaug, Tom-Erik |editor3=Staver, Kristoffer |editor4=Thuesen, Kaare |editor5=Strandhagen, Torgeir |pages=71–76 |year=1987 |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Norges Orienteringsforbund]] |location=Oslo }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in Bærum, but resided at [[Ullern]]åsen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dagens navn|work=Aftenposten|date=16 January 1988|page=20|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Per Bergsland served as an instructor at flight school in [[Canada]] before he transferred to the [[RAF Ferry Command]], where he was assigned to fly with a combat unit. As a member of [[No. 332 Squadron RAF]] (332 Sqn) stationed at [[North Weald]] airfield, Bergsland's [[Supermarine Spitfire Mk.Vb]], (serial no AB269, coded AH:D) was shot down by a German [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] during the [[Dieppe Raid]] on 19 August 1942. After arriving at the POW camp, he gave his name as "Peter Rockland" (''Per'' = [[Petrus (given name)|Petrus]], meaning rock in [[Greek language|Greek]], and ''Berg'' meaning mountain or rock in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]), in order to protect his family in Norway from German reprisals.

[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|300px|''Stalag Luft III'' mockup.]]

In what later became known as the "Great Escape", he was escapee #43 among the 76 prisoners of war who managed to escape from the camp via tunnel with another Norwegian pilot, escapee #44 [[Jens Müller (pilot)|Jens Müller]],

{{Quote
|text="Bergsland was wearing a civilian suit he had made for himself from a Royal Marine uniform, with an RAF overcoat slightly altered with brown leather sewn over the buttons. A black RAF tie, no hat. He carried a small suitcase which had been sent from Norway. In it were Norwegian toothpaste and soap, sandwiches, and 163 reichsmarks given to him by the Escape Committee.

We caught the 2:04 train to [[Frankfurt an der Oder]]. Our papers stated that we were Norwegian electricians from the Arbeitslager [labor camp] in Frankfurt working in the vicinity of Sagan. For the journey from Frankfurt to [[Stettin]] we had other papers ordering us to change our place of work from Frankfurt to Stettin, and to report to the Birgermeister of Stettin."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/greatescape/three.html ''The Great Escape - The Three That Got Away''(Nova)]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Bergsland and Müller made it to the nearby town, where they caught a train to [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in Germany (now: [[Szczecin]], Poland). At the port, the pair were snuck onto a Swedish ship by friendly sailors and made it to the safety of [[Gothenburg]]. There, they met the British consulate, who arranged travel by train to [[Stockholm]], where they were flown to [[Scotland]] from [[Bromma]] airport. From there they were sent by train to [[London]] and shortly afterwards to '[[Little Norway]]' in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profero.no/littlenorway/Personell_Little_Norway_1940-1945.pdf ''List of personnel associated with Little Norway'' (Edvard Omholt-Jensen "The Spirit of Little Norway" Atheneum. 1986)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, only three POWs from Stalag Luft III made it to [[Neutral country|neutral countries]] and freedom. 

The third escapee was the [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Bram van der Stok]], who crossed most of occupied Europe and escaped to Spain with the help of the [[French resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/military-obituaries/air-force-obituaries/5648616/Bram-van-der-Stok.html|work=Daily Telegraph|title=Obituary - Bram van der Stok|date=1 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining 73 escapees were captured. [[Adolf Hitler]] wanted to [[Execution (legal)|execute]] them all, but [[Hermann Göring]] persuaded him not to: in the end, fifty were shot as an example. The remaining 23 were held in the custody of the [[Gestapo]] before being sent off to other camps. 17 were returned to [[Stalag Luft III]], four were sent to [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]], and two to [[Oflag IV-C|Colditz Castle]].

==Postwar career==
In 1946, Per Bergsland began as a pilot in [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]]. He later became Chief Pilot and Operational Manager. Per Bergsland became CEO of [[Fred Olsen Air Transport]] in 1968 and CEO of [[Widerøe]] from 1970 to 1981.

&lt;!--Yield Management is focused exclusively on managing inventory (e.g., opening/closing rooms), whereas revenue management is focused entirely on revenue, whether revenue is generated using yield management, pricing, promotions, etc.--&gt;
'''Revenue management''' is the application of disciplined [[analytics]] that predict [[consumer behaviour]] at the micro-market levels and optimize product availability and price to maximize [[revenue]] growth. The primary aim of revenue management is selling the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price and with the right pack. The essence of this discipline is in understanding customers' perception of product value and accurately aligning product prices, placement and availability with each customer segment.&lt;ref name="CrossR"&gt;Cross, R. (1997) Revenue Management: Hard-Core Tactics for Market Domination. New York, NY: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Businesses face important decisions regarding what to sell, when to sell, to whom to sell, and for how much. Revenue management uses data-driven tactics and [[strategy]] to answer these questions in order to increase revenue.&lt;ref name="vanRyzinRM"&gt;Talluri, K., and van Ryzin, G. (1999) Revenue Management: Research Overview and Prospects. Transportation Science 33:233-256.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline of revenue management combines data mining and operations research with strategy, understanding of customer behavior, and partnering with the sales force. Today, the revenue management practitioner must be analytical and detail oriented, yet capable of thinking strategically and managing the relationship with sales.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Nicole. 2007. Revenue management redefined. Hotels, February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the emergence of revenue management, [[BOAC]] (now [[British Airways]]) experimented with differentiated fare products by offering capacity controlled "Earlybird" discounts to stimulate [[demand]] for seats that would otherwise fly empty.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"&gt;McGill, J. and van Ryzin, G. (1999) Revenue management: research overview and prospects. Transportation Science 33: 233–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking it a step further, [[Robert Crandall]], former [[Chairman]] and [[CEO]] of [[American Airlines]], pioneered a practice he called [[yield management]], which focused primarily on maximizing revenue through analytics-based [[inventory control]]. Under Crandall's leadership, American continued to invest in yield management's forecasting, inventory control and overbooking capabilities. By the early 1980s, the combination of a mild recession and new competition spawned by [[airline deregulation act]] (1978) posed an additional threat. Low-cost, low-fare airlines like [[People Express]] were growing rapidly because of their ability to charge even less than American's Super Saver fares. After investing millions in the next generation capability which they would call DINAMO (Dynamic Inventory Optimization and Maintenance Optimizer), American announced Ultimate Super Saver Fares in 1985 that were priced lower than the PeoplExpress. These fares were non-refundable in addition to being advance-purchase restricted and capacity controlled. This yield management system targeted those [[discounts]] to only those situations where they had a surplus of empty seats. The system and analysts engaged in continual re-evaluation of the placement of the discounts to maximize their use. Over the next year, American's revenue increased 14.5% and its profits were up 47.8%.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

Other industries took note of American's success and implemented similar systems. Robert Crandall discussed his success with yield management with [[J. W. "Bill" Marriott, Jr.]], CEO of [[Marriott International]]. Marriott International had many of the same issues that airlines did: perishable inventory, customers booking in advance, lower cost competition and wide swings with regard to balancing supply and demand. Since "yield" was an airline term and did not necessarily pertain to hotels, Marriott International and others began calling the practice Revenue Management.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; The company created a Revenue Management organization and invested in automated Revenue Management systems that would provide daily forecasts of demand and make inventory recommendations for each of its 160,000 rooms at its Marriott, [[Courtyard Marriott]] and [[Residence Inn]] brands.&lt;ref name="MarriottCross"&gt;Marriott, Jr., J. and Cross, R. (2000) Room at the revenue inn. In Book of Management Wisdom: Classic Writings by Legendary Managers, ed., Peter Krass, 199-208, New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; They also created "fenced rate" logic similar to airlines, which would allow them to offer targeted discounts to price sensitive market segments based on demand.&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, R., Cross, R. and Noland, R. (1992) Discounting in the hotel industry: a new approach. Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly 33(1): 15–23.&lt;/ref&gt; To address the additional complexity created by variable lengths-of-stay, Marriott's Demand Forecast System (DFS) was built to forecast guest booking patterns and optimize room availability by price and length of stay. By the mid-1990s, Marriott's successful execution of revenue management was adding between $150 million and $200 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref name="MarriottCross"/&gt;

A natural extension of hotel revenue management was to rental car firms, which experienced similar issues of discount availability and duration control. In 1994, revenue management saved [[National Car Rental]] from [[bankruptcy]]. Their revival from near collapse to making profits served as an indicator of revenue management's potential.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, M. and Johnson, E. (1997) Revenue management saves national car rental. Interfaces 27(1): 107–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to this point, revenue management had focused on driving revenue from Business to Consumer ([[B2C]]) relationships. In the early 1990s UPS developed revenue management further by revitalizing their Business to Business ([[Business-to-business|B2B]]) pricing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R., Higbie, J. and Cross, Z. (2010) Milestones in the Application of Analytical Pricing and Revenue Management. Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the need for volume growth in a competitive market, UPS began building a pricing organization that focused on discounting. Prices began to erode rapidly, however, as they began offering greater discounts to win business. The executive team at UPS prioritized specific targeting of their discounts but could not strictly follow the example set by airlines and hotels. Rather than optimizing the revenue for a discrete event such as the purchase of an [[airline seat]] or a hotel room, UPS was negotiating annual rates for large-volume customers using a multitude of services over the course of a year. To alleviate the discounting issue, they formulated the problem as a customized bid-response model, which used historical data to predict the probability of winning at different price points. They called the system Target Pricing. With this system, they were able to [[forecasting|forecast]] the outcomes of any contractual bid at various net prices and identify where they could command a price premium over competitors and where deeper discounts were required to land deals. In the first year of this revenue management system, UPS reported increased profits of over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, V. and Ferguson, M. (2007) Optimal customized pricing in competitive settings. Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management 6: 212-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of maximizing revenue on negotiated deals found its way back to the [[hospitality]] industry. Marriott's original application of revenue management was limited to individual bookings, not groups or other negotiated deals. In 2007, Marriott introduced a "Group Price Optimizer" that used a competitive bid-response model to predict the probability of winning at any price point, thus providing accurate price guidance to the sales force. The initial system generated an incremental $46 million in profit. This led to an Honorable Mention for the [[Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hormby, S., Morrison, J., Prashant, D, Meyers, M. and Tensa, T. (2010) Marriott International increases revenue by implementing a group pricing optimizer. Interfaces 40(1): 47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the early 1990s revenue management also began to influence television ad sales. Companies like [[Canadian Broadcast Corporation]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],&lt;ref&gt;Mandese, J. (1998). Taking hint from travel world, ABC goes up against ritual: Aeronomics system expected to help troubled net set prices to fill seats. Advertising Age, 11 May.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NBC]]&lt;ref&gt;Bollapragada, S., Cheng, H., Phillips, M. and Garbiras. M. (2002) NBC's optimization systems increase revenues and productivity. Interfaces 32(1): 47-60.&lt;/ref&gt; developed systems that automated the placement of ads in proposals based on total forecasted demand and forecasted ratings by program. Today, many television networks around the globe have revenue management systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P. (2005) Revenue Management. Plenary presentation at Vision 2020, Ahmedabad, India. 8 January. Retrieved September 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue management to this point had been utilized in the pricing of perishable products. In the 1990s, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] began adopting revenue management to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of its vehicles by segmenting customers into micro-markets and creating a differentiated and targeted price structure.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. (2005) Follow the money: high margin growth focused on the customer. Presentation to Revenue Management &amp; Price Optimization Conference; 21 April, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing for vehicles and options packages had been set based upon annual volume estimates and profitability projections. The company found that certain products were overpriced and some were underpriced.&lt;ref&gt;Coy, P. (2000) The power of smart pricing, BusinessWeek, 10 April pp.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the range of customer preferences across a product line and geographical market, Ford leadership created a Revenue management organization to measure the price-responsiveness of different customer segments for each [[incentive]] type and to develop an approach that would target the optimal incentive by product and region. By the end of the decade, Ford estimated that roughly $3 billion in additional profits came from revenue management initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Leibs, S., (2000), [http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/2990968 Ford heeds the profits], CFO Magazine, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The public success of Pricing and Revenue Management at Ford solidified the ability of the discipline to address the revenue generation issues of virtually any company. Many auto manufacturers have adopted the practice for both vehicle sales and the sale of parts. [[Retailers]] have leveraged the concepts pioneered at Ford to create more dynamic, targeted pricing in the form of discounts and promotions to more accurately match supply with demand. [[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]s planning and [[optimization]] assisted retailers with the timing and prediction of the incremental lift of a promotion for targeted products and customer sets. Companies have rapidly adopted [[price markdown]] optimization to maximize revenue from end-of-season or end-of-life items. Furthermore, strategies driving promotion roll-offs and discount expirations have allowed companies to increase revenue from newly acquired customers.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, R. (2005) Pricing and Revenue Optimization, Stanford, CA: Stanford Business Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, virtually all major [[airlines]], [[hotel]] firms, cruise lines and rental car firms had implemented revenue management systems to predict customer demand and optimize available price. These revenue management systems had limited "optimize" to imply managing the availability of pre-defined prices in pre-established price categories. The objective function was to select the best blends of predicted demand given existing prices. The sophisticated technology and optimization [[algorithms]] had been focused on selling the right amount of inventory at a given price, not on the price itself. Realizing that controlling inventory was no longer sufficient, [[InterContinental Hotels Group]] (IHG) launched an initiative to better understand the [[price sensitivity]] of customer demand. IHG determined that calculating [[price elasticity]] at very granular levels to a high degree of accuracy still was not enough. Rate transparency had elevated the importance of incorporating market positioning against substitutable alternatives. IHG recognized that when a competitor changes its rate, the consumer's perception of IHG's rate also changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R., Higbie, J. and Cross, D. (2009) Revenue management's renaissance: a rebirth of the art and science of profitable revenue generation. Cornell Hospitality Quarterly 50: 56-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with third party competitive data, the IHG team was able to analyze historical price, volume and share data to accurately measure price elasticity in every local market for multiple lengths of stay. These elements were incorporated into a system that also measured differences in customer elasticity based upon how far in advance the booking is being made relative to the arrival date. The incremental revenue from the system was significant as this new Price Optimization capability increased Revenue per Available Room ([[RevPAR]]) by 2.7%.&lt;ref&gt;InterContinental Hotels Group (2009) Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement, accessed 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; IHG and [[Revenue Analytics]], a pricing and revenue management consulting firm, were selected as finalists for the [[Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] for their joint effort in implementing Price Optimization at IHG.&lt;ref&gt;Eister, C., Higbie, J., Koushik, D. (2012) Retail Price Optimization at InterContinental Hotels Group. Informs, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Holiday Retirement and Prorize LLC were awarded with the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences (&lt;ref&gt;https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Holiday-Retirement-Prorize &lt;/ref&gt;) for their use of operations research (O.R.) to improve the pricing model for more than 300 senior living communities. Holiday Retirement partnered with Prorize LLC, an Atlanta-based revenue management firm that leveraged O.R. to develop its Senior Living Rent Optimizer. The revenue management system developed by Prorize enabled a consistent and proactive pricing process across Holiday, while simultaneously providing optimal pricing recommendations for each unit in every one of their communities.  As a result of their joint efforts, they were able to consistently raise revenues by over 10%. &lt;ref&gt;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2017.0927 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/home/news/how-holiday-increased-revenue-from-new-leases-by-10/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue Management Society ("RMS")===
The Revenue Management Society is the industry body representing companies and practitioners working in this area. The Society traces its roots back to 2002 when Steve Marchant gathered a group of clients and colleagues to discuss revenue management issues of common interest. Initially the club was financed by Consultecom but in 2007 became a Society fully funded by the membership. Membership initially comprised companies in the travel and leisure sector. There are now over 60 corporate members from across Europe and from many industries. The Society's Mission Statement is "To define and promote best practice in the use of revenue and yield management techniques, through discussion and communication between the key users of these techniques within the Travel, Transportation and Leisure industries." To this end the Society organises member conferences, newsletters and supports University research projects

==Levers==
Whereas yield management involves specific actions to generate yield through perishable inventory management, revenue management encompasses a wide range of opportunities to increase revenue. A company can utilize these different categories like a series of levers in the sense that all are usually available, but only one or two may drive revenue in a given situation. The primary levers are:

===Pricing===
This category of revenue management involves redefining pricing strategy and developing disciplined pricing tactics. The key objective of a pricing strategy is anticipating the value created for customers and then setting specific prices to capture that value. A company may decide to price against their competitors or even their own products, but the most value comes from pricing strategies that closely follow market conditions and demand, especially at a segment level. Once a pricing strategy dictates what a company wants to do, pricing tactics determine how a company actually captures the value. Tactics involve creating pricing tools that change dynamically, in order to react to changes and continually capture value and gain revenue. Price Optimization, for example, involves constantly optimizing multiple variables such as price sensitivity, price ratios, and inventory to maximize revenues. A successful pricing strategy, supported by analytically-based pricing tactics, can drastically improve a firm's profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, J. and Nagel, T. The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory===
When focused on controlling inventory, revenue management is mainly concerned with how best to price or allocate capacity. First, a company can discount products in order to increase volume. By lowering prices on products, a company can overcome weak demand and gain market share, which ultimately increases revenue. On the other hand, in situations where demand is strong for a product but the threat of cancellations looms (e.g. hotel rooms or airline seats), firms often overbook in order to maximize revenue from full capacity. [[Overbooking]]'s focus is increasing the total volume of sales in the presence of cancellations rather than optimizing customer mix.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"/&gt;

===Marketing===
Price promotion allow companies to sell higher volumes by temporarily decreasing the price of their products. Revenue management techniques measure customer responsiveness to promotions in order to strike a balance between volume growth and profitability. An effective promotion helps maximize revenue when there is uncertainty about the distribution of customer willingness to pay. When a company's products are sold in the form of long-term commitments, such as [[internet]] or [[Local telephone service|telephone service]], promotions help attract customers who will then commit to [[contracts]] and produce revenue over a long time horizon. When this occurs, companies must also strategize their promotion roll-off policies; they must decide when to begin increasing the contract fees and by what magnitude to raise the fees in order to avoid losing customers. Revenue management optimization proves useful in balancing promotion roll-off variables in order to maximize revenue while minimizing [[Product churning|churn]].&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

===Channels===
Revenue management through channels involves strategically driving revenue through different [[distribution channel]]s. Different channels may represent customers with different price sensitivities. For example, customers who shop online are usually more price sensitive than customers who shop in a physical store. Different channels often have different costs and [[Gross margin|margins]] associated with those channels. When faced with multiple channels to retailers and distributors, revenue management techniques can calculate appropriate levels of discounts for companies to offer distributors through opaque channels to push more products without losing integrity with respect to public perception of quality.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

Since the advent of the Internet the distribution network and control has become a major concern for service providers. When the producer collaborates with a powerful provider, sacrifices may be necessary, particularly concerning the selling price/commission rate, in exchange for the capacity to reach a certain clientele and sales volumes &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revenue Management for Hospitality and Tourism|last=Legoherel|first=Patick|publisher=Goodfelow Publishers Ltd|year=|isbn=978-1-908999-48-1|location=Oxford, UK|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

===Data collection===
The revenue management process begins with [[data collection]]. Relevant data is paramount to a revenue management system's capability to provide accurate, actionable information. A system must collect and store historical data for inventory, prices, demand, and other causal factors. Any data that reflects the details of products offered, their prices, competition, and customer behavior must be collected, stored, and analyzed. In some markets, specialized data collection methods have rapidly emerged to service their relevant sector, and sometimes have even become a norm. In the [[European Union]] for example, the [[European Commission]] makes sure businesses and governments stick to EU rules on fair competition, while still leaving space for innovation, unified standards, and the development of small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/pol/comp/index_en.htm European Union Competition] Retrieved on 14 December 2012, Europa.eu, Competition&lt;/ref&gt; To support this, third party sources are utilized to collect data and make only averages available for commercial purposes, such as is the case with the hotel sector – in Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkg-group.com/Portals/2/FILES/201210_15451/MKG-HIT-Report-EU-102012.pdf Europe HIT Report] Retrieved on October 2012, [[MKG Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Middle East &amp; North Africa region,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkg-group.com/Portals/2/FILES/201210_15451/MKG-HIT-Report-ME-102012.pdf MEA HIT Report] Retrieved on October 2012, [[MKG Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; where key operating indicators are monitored, such as Occupancy Rate (OR), Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). Data is supplied directly by hotel chains and groups (as well as independent properties) and benchmark averages are produced by direct market (competitive set) or wider macro market. This data is also utilized for financial reporting, forecasting trends and development purposes. Information about customer behavior is a valuable asset that can reveal consumer behavioral patterns, the impact of competitors' actions, and other important market information. This information is crucial to starting the revenue management process.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

===Segmentation===
After collecting the relevant data, [[market segmentation]] is the key to market-based pricing and revenue maximization. Airlines, for example, employed this tactic in differentiating between price-sensitive leisure customers and price-insensitive business customers. Leisure customers tend to book earlier and are flexible about when they fly and are willing to sit in coach seats to save more money for their destination, whereas business customers tend to book closer to departure and are typically less price sensitive.  Success hinges on the ability to segment customers into similar groups based on a calculation of price responsiveness of customers to certain products based upon the circumstances of time and place. Revenue management strives to determine the value of a product to a very narrow micro-market at a specific moment in time and then chart customer behavior at the margin to determine the maximum obtainable revenue from those micro-markets.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; Micro-markets can be derived qualitatively by conducting a dimensional analysis. Business customers and leisure customers are two segments, but business customers could be further segmented by the time they fly (those who book late and fly in the morning etc.). Useful tools such as [[Cluster Analysis]] allow Revenue Managers to create a set of data-driven partitioning techniques that gather interpretable groups of objects together for consideration. Market segmentation based upon customer behavior is essential to the next step, which is forecasting demand associated with the clustered segments. 

===Forecasting===
Revenue management requires forecasting various elements such as demand, inventory availability, [[market share]], and total [[Market (economics)|market]]. Its performance depends critically on the quality of these forecasts. Forecasting is a critical task of revenue management and takes much time to develop, maintain, and implement. Quantity-based forecasts, which use [[time-series]] models, booking curves, cancellation curves, etc., project future quantities of demand, such as reservations or products bought. Price-based forecasts seek to forecast demand as a function of marketing variables, such as price or promotion. These involve building specialized forecasts such as market response models or [[cross price elasticity]] of demand estimates to predict customer behavior at certain price points.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"/&gt; By combining these forecasts with calculated price sensitivities and price ratios, a revenue management system can then quantify these benefits and develop price optimization strategies to maximize revenue.

===Optimization===
While forecasting suggests what customers are likely to do, optimization suggests how a firm should respond. Often considered the pinnacle of the revenue management process, optimization is about evaluating multiple options on how to sell your product and to whom to sell your product.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; Optimization involves solving two important problems in order to achieve the highest possible revenue. The first is determining which objective function to optimize. A business must decide between optimizing prices, total sales, [[contribution margin]]s, or even [[customer lifetime value]]s. Secondly, the business must decide which optimization technique to utilize. For example, many firms utilize [[linear programming]], a complex technique for determining the best outcome from a set of linear relationships, to set prices in order to maximize revenue. [[Regression analysis]], another statistical tool, involves finding the ideal relationship between several variables through complex models and analysis. [[Discrete Choice Models|Discrete choice models]] can serve to predict customer behavior in order to target them with the right products for the right price.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Tools such as these allow a firm to optimize its product offerings, inventory levels, and pricing points in order to achieve the highest revenue possible.

===Dynamic re-evaluation===
Revenue management requires that a firm must continually re-evaluate their prices, products, and processes in order to maximize revenue. In a dynamic market, an effective revenue management system constantly re-evaluates the variables involved in order to move dynamically with the market. As micro-markets evolve, so must the strategy and tactics of revenue management adjust.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

==In an organization==
Revenue management's fit within the organizational structure depends on the type of industry and the company itself. Some companies place revenue management teams within Marketing because marketing initiatives typically focus on attracting and selling to customers. Other firms dedicate a section of Finance to handle revenue management responsibilities because of the tremendous bottom line implications. Some companies have elevated the position of [[chief revenue officer]], or CRO, to the senior management level. This position typically oversees functions like sales, pricing, new product development, and advertising and promotions. A CRO in this sense would be responsible for all activities that generate revenue and directing the company to become more "revenue-focused".&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

[[Supply chain management]] and revenue management have many natural synergies. Supply chain management (SCM) is a vital process in many companies today and several are integrating this process with a revenue management system. On one hand, supply chain management often focuses on filling current and anticipated orders at the lowest cost, while assuming that demand is primarily exogenous. Conversely, revenue management generally assumes costs and sometimes capacity are fixed and instead looks to set prices and customer allocations that maximize revenue given these constraints. A company that has achieved excellence in supply chain management and revenue management individually may have many opportunities to increase profitability by linking their respective operational focus and customer-facing focus together.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

[[Business Intelligence]] platforms have also become increasingly integrated with the Revenue Management process. These platforms, driven by [[data mining]] processes, offer a centralized data and technology environment that delivers business intelligence by combining historical reporting and advanced analytics to explain and evaluate past events, deliver recommended actions and eventually optimize decision-making. Not synonymous with [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), Business intelligence generates proactive forecasts, whereas CRM strategies track and document a company's current and past interactions with customers. Data mining this CRM information, however, can help drive a business intelligence platform and provide actionable information to aid decision-making.

==Developing industries==
The ability for revenue management to optimize price based on forecasted demand, price elasticity and competitive rates has incredible benefits, and many companies are rushing to develop their own revenue management capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, J. (2009) Mobilizing global resources to transform the revenue management discipline. Presentation to 5th Annual Revenue Management &amp; Price Optimization Conference; 6 October, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt; Many industries are beginning to embrace revenue management and

(2008) Price Profiling. SmartMoney 17(5): 80-85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mass media|Media]]/[[Telecommunications service provider|Telecom]] – a promotion-driven industry often focused on attracting customers with discounted plans and then retaining them at higher price points. Businesses in this industry often face regulatory constraints, demand volatility, and sales through multiple channels to both business and consumer segments. Revenue management can help these companies understand micro-markets and forecast demand in order to optimize advertising sales and long-term contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Kimms, A. and Müller-Bungart, M.

* [[Distributors]] – face a complex environment that often includes thousands of individual SKUs with several different product lifecycles. Each distributor must account for factors such as channel conflict, cross-product cannibalization, and competitive actions. Revenue Management has proved useful to distributors in promotion analysis and negotiated contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Bippert, D.

* [[Medical services|Medical Products and Services]] – deal with large fluctuations in demand depending on time of day and day of week. Hospital surgeries are often overflowing on weekday mornings but sit empty and underutilized on the weekend. Hospitals may experiment with optimizing their inventory of services and products based on different demand points. Additionally, revenue management techniques allow hospitals to mitigate claim underpayments and denials, thus preventing significant revenue leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, W.H.

Dr '''Ron Brunton''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Anthropology|anthropologist]]. He is the Director of Encompass Research Pty Ltd and was a Director of the Board of the [[Public broadcasting|public broadcaster]], the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] for a five-year term from 1 May 2003.

==Biography==
Prior to his appointment to the ABC Board, Brunton was a fortnightly columnist for ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'' from 1997–2003; a Senior Fellow at the [[Institute of Public Affairs]], a [[right wing]] [[think tank]] from 1995–2001, and a contributor to the [[Conservatism|conservative]] literary and political journal ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]''.

In his articles, Brunton was highly critical of the ''[[Bringing Them Home]]'' report on the stolen generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hal Wootten|Wootten, Hal]] (1998) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ILB/1998/44.html 'Ron Brunton and Bringing Them Home', the Report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission into the removal of Aboriginal children from ... ]''[[Indigenous Law Bulletin]]'' 44; 4(12): 12-12]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written scathing criticisms of both the [[Australian High Court|High Court]]'s 1992 ''[[Mabo v Queensland (No 2)|Mabo v Queensland]]'' decision and the [[Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody]]. In addition, he enunciated the view that the "secret women's business" of the [[Ngarrindjeri]] women during the [[Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy]] was a fabrication, and came to the defence of the murdered [[Netherlands|Dutch]] politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] who called on [[Muslim]] immigrants to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into Dutch society and culture. Prior to his appointment to the Board he was a harsh critic of the ABC itself, accusing it of being part of the "left establishment" and of being a "sucker" for "brainless comment".

Brunton's appointment to the ABC Board by the [[Australian Government]] of [[John Howard]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anthropologist gets nod for ABC board|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work=ABC News|date=2 May 2003|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2003/05/02/845928.htm|accessdate=11 May 2008|location=Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt; created controversy with left-wing ABC supporters given his conservative views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=The usual suspects - Dr Ron Brunton appointed to the ABC Board|publisher=Friends of the ABC|date=2 May 2003|url=http://friendsoftheabc.org/suspects.htm|accessdate=3 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614204640/http://friendsoftheabc.org/suspects.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Encompass Research Pty Ltd is an organisation engaged in anthropological and [[socio-economic]] [[research]], concentrating on [[native title]], [[Australian Aboriginal culture|indigenous heritage]], [[immigration]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] issues.

Brunton has published a range of research papers and books on anthropological issues and has lectured in anthropology at universities in Australia and at the [[University of Papua New Guinea]]. He has also stood as an [[expert witness]] in a number of [[native title]] court cases across Australia, having been engaged by parties involved in native title [[litigation]].

===Education===
He completed his Ph.D. at [[La Trobe University]] with a thesis on [[kava]] use in [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name=kava&gt;{{Citation | author1=Brunton, Ron (Ronald) | title=The abandoned narcotic : kava and cultural instability in Melanesia | publication-date=1989 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | isbn=978-0-521-37375-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had in 1973 completed a M.A. with a thesis titled ''Social stratification, trade and ceremonial exchange in Melanesia'' at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Brunton, Ron (Ronald) | title=Social stratification, trade and ceremonial exchange in Melanesia | publication-date=1973 | publisher=[s.n.] | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/22023886 | accessdate=5 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Admiralty law}}
The "'''Rotterdam Rules'''" (formally, the '''United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea''') is a treaty proposing new international rules to revise the legal framework for [[affreightment|maritime affreightment]] and [[Ship transport|carriage of goods by sea]]. The Rules primarily address the legal relationship between carriers and cargo-owners. As of October 2015, the Rules are not yet in force as they have been ratified by only three states.

The aim of the convention is to extend and modernize existing international rules and achieve uniformity of [[International trade law]] in the field of [[admiralty law|maritime]] carriage, updating or replacing many provisions in the [[Hague Rules]], [[Hague-Visby Rules]] and [[Hamburg Rules]].&lt;ref name=un/&gt;&lt;ref name=rotterdam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rotterdamrules2009.com/cms/index.php?page=general-information|title=Rotterdam Rules Signature Ceremony|author=Susan Husselman|work=Rotterdam Rules 2009 Secretariat|publisher=Rotterdam Rules 2009|accessdate=16 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention establishes a comprehensive, uniform legal regime governing the rights and obligations of [[Shipment|shippers]], [[Common carrier|carriers]] and [[consignee]]s under a contract for [[door-to-door]] shipments that involve international sea transport.&lt;ref name=un&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/2008rotterdam_rules.html|title=2008 – United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea – the 'Rotterdam Rules'|work=U.N. Commission on International Trade Law|publisher=UNCITRAL.org|accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Hague Rules of 1924 were updated in 1968 to become the Hague-Visby Rules, but the changes were modest. The modified convention still covered only "tackle to tackle" carriage contracts,  with no provision for multimodal transport. The industry-changing phenomenon of [[containerization]] was barely acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;Hague-Visby Rules: Article IV Rule 5c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jus.uio.no/lm/sea.carriage.hague.visby.rules.1968/doc.html#31 ''Hague-Visby Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 Hamburg Rules were introduced to provide a framework that was both more modern, and less biased in favour of ship operators. Although the Hamburg Rules were readily adopted by developing countries, the new convention was shunned by richer countries who stuck with Hague and  Hague-Visby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonparton.com ''The Jackson Parton Miscellany'']&lt;/ref&gt; It had been expected that a Hague/Hamburg compromise might arise, but instead the vast (96 articles) Rotterdam Rules appeared.

The final draft of the Rotterdam Rules, which was assembled by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]], was adopted by the United Nations on 11 December 2008, and a signing ceremony was held in [[Rotterdam]] on 23 September 2009.&lt;ref name=rotterdam/&gt;&lt;ref name=rules&gt;{{Citation|title=United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea|url=http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/transport/rotterdam_rules/09-85608_Ebook.pdf|year=2008|publisher=U.N. Commission for International Trade Law|accessdate=16 November 2009|edition=9|version=9|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124164131/http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/transport/rotterdam_rules/09-85608_Ebook.pdf|archivedate=24 January 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the United States, France, Greece, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands; in all, signatures were obtained from countries said to make up 25 percent of world trade by volume.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; Signatures were allowed after the ceremony at the [[Headquarters of the United Nations|U.N. Headquarters]] in New York City, United States.&lt;ref name=rules/&gt;

The [[World Shipping Council]] is a prominent supporter of the Rotterdam Rules. In 2010, the American Bar Association House of Delegates approved a resolution supporting U.S. ratification of the Rotterdam Rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joc.com/maritime/bar-association-endorses-rotterdam-rules ''Maritime Bar Association Endorses Rotterdam Rules'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/international_law/2010/09/rotterdam-rules.html ''Law Professors Address International Law'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main provisions==
The following are critical provisions and law changes found in the Rotterdam Rules:
* The Rules apply only if the carriage includes a sea leg; other multimodal carriage contracts which have no sea leg are outside of the scope of the Rules.
* It extends the period that carriers are responsible for goods, to cover the time between the point where the goods are received to the point where the goods are delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic&gt;{{cite news|title=UN shipping convention ready for Australia|author=Adeline Teoh|newspaper=Dynamic Export|date=16 November 2009|url=http://www.dynamicexport.com.au/news/un-shipping-convention-ready-for-australia00799/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It allows for more [[e-commerce]] and approves more forms of electronic documentation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It increases the limit liability of carriers to 875 units of account per shipping unit or three units of account per kilogram of gross weight.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It eliminates the "nautical fault defence" which had protected carriers and crew from liability for [[negligent]] ship management and navigation.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It extends the time that legal claims can be filed to two years following the day the goods were delivered or should have been delivered.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It allows parties to so-called "Volume Contracts" to [[opt-out]] of some liability rules set in the convention.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt;
* It obliges carriers to keep ships seaworthy and properly crewed throughout the voyage.&lt;ref name=dynamic/&gt; The standard of care is not "strict", but "due diligence" (as with the Hague Rules).

==Entry into force and ratifications==
The Rotterdam Rules will enter into effect a year after 20 countries have ratified that treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/transport_goods/rotterdam_status.html ''U.N. Transport Treaty'']&lt;/ref&gt; As of 9 August 2011, there were 24 signatories to the treaty.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; The most recent country to sign the treaty was Sweden, which signed on 20 July 2011.&lt;ref name="uncitral.org"/&gt; Spain was the first country to ratify the convention in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2011/unisl149.html ''U.N. Press Release 2011'']&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of signatures and ratifications is shown below:

Upon entry into force of the convention for a country, it should denounce the conventions governing the [[Hague-Visby Rules]] as well as the [[Hamburg Rules]] as the convention does not come into effect without such denouncements.

'''Otto Lucien Anton "Tony" Spaeth', Jr.''' (February 6, 1934 in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]]) is a [[corporate identity]] planner, consultant, critic and teacher.

==Early years==
During his childhood, Spaeth's parents took in [[Anthony Bailey (author)|Anthony Bailey]] (then himself a child) as a war refugee; Bailey has since told the story of their shared childhood years in the books ''America, Lost &amp; Found''&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Anthony C., “America, Lost &amp; Found”  [Random House, 1981; Chicago, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''England, First &amp; Last''.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Anthony C., “England, First &amp; Last”  [Viking, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Spaeths moved to Manhattan, ‘Tony S’ was schooled at Millbrook and Portsmouth Priory, then majored in architecture at [[Princeton University]]. After Navy service (as a corpsman, 2nd Marine Division) Spaeth learned market research and account management at Foote Cone &amp; Belding (now [[Draftfcb]]), then joined the [[Harvard Business School]] class of 1963.

In 1964, Spaeth was recruited by Lippincott &amp; Margulies (now [[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]]), where “Corporate Identity” was first being thought through as a meaningful professional specialization. From that point on, “identity” became his primary window on marketing and management issues.

==Middle Years==
Two decades of diverse marketing work followed, including classic product management (at American Home Foods, on [[Jiffy Pop]] and [[Gulden's]] brands)… the creation of Controlled Brand Marketing Inc., in partnership with industrial designer Robert P. Gersin, to be product managers/designers for supermarket private labels… consultancy on [[N.W. Ayer &amp; Son]]’s marketing services team (including a key role in creation of the [[Absolut Vodka]] brand)… VP Marketing of the [[Levolor]] blinds company… and then marketing direction of several [[Citicorp]] business units.

==Identity Consulting==
Spaeth returned to undiluted identity focus in 1985, when he joined the consulting firm Anspach Grossman Portugal (whose partners he had known from Lippincott &amp; Margulies in the 60s) as director of marketing and a consulting principal. His first act was to change the firm’s descriptive tag from “Marketing Communications and Design” to “Identity Consultants,” thus naming the category in which the firm held a leadership position. Clients he served included [[American Express]] and [[Pfizer]]. He also restructured and directed the firm’s naming capability. In 1990, when AGP’s partners had sold the firm to [[WPP Group]], Spaeth established an independent consultancy.

==Tony Spaeth / Identity==
From a base in Rye, New York, since 1990 Spaeth has provided identity planning and creative counsel to scores of clients in diverse categories. He is credited with such corporate brands as [[Dow Jones]], [[Eastman Chemical]], [[Celera Genomics]], [[Flowserve]], [[Commonfund]], [[FIRST]] Robotics and [[Outward Bound USA]].

On the Web site ''[http://www.identityworks.com Identityworks.com]'' (no longer online), since 1998 Spaeth has reviewed noteworthy new identities of strategic or creative interest, with appropriate credit to chief executives and designers alike. The site also provides a variety of analytic and planning tools for branding and design students worldwide, and contains ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20091222051538/http://www.identityworks.com/forum/ Identity Forum]'', where a global panel of leading thinkers and practitioners address identity issues.

Since 1992, Spaeth’s annual rebrandings overview article has appeared in [http://www.tcbreview.com The Conference Board Review] magazine, thus providing a record covering nearly two decades (and counting) of significant identity change.

Spaeth also created and, in collaboration with consultant Tom Vanderbauwhede in Antwerp, maintains the [http://www.corporatebrandmatrix.com Corporate Brand Matrix], building a data base of rebranding case histories for students of identity change. The Matrix documents the leadership intentions in noteworthy corporate rebrandings, matched to the rebranding tools used to achieve them.

In addition to serving the identity community, Spaeth is active in alumni public service initiatives, as advisor to Princeton Project 55 and as a founding director of Partners of ’63 of the Harvard Business School, which seeks systemic improvements in America’s public education systems.
