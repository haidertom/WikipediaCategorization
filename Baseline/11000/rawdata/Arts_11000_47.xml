'''Fashion in the period 1700–1750''' in [[Europe]]an and European-influenced countries is characterized by a widening silhouette for both men and women following the tall, narrow look of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|1680s and 90s]]. This era is defined as late Baroque/Rococo style. The new fashion trends introduced during this era had a greater impact on society, affecting not only royalty and aristocrats, but also middle and even lower classes. Clothing during this time can be characterized by soft pastels, light, airy, and asymmetrical designs, and playful styles. Wigs remained essential for men and women of substance, and were often white; natural hair was powdered to achieve the fashionable look.

Distinction was made in this period between ''full dress'' worn at court and for formal occasions, and ''undress'' or everyday, daytime clothes. As the decades progressed, fewer and fewer occasions called for full dress, which had all but disappeared by the end of the century.

Fashion designers became more recognizable during this period, as men and women were eager to be dressed in the latest trends and styles. Fashion magazines emerged during this era, originally aimed at intelligent readers, but quickly capturing the attention of lower classes with their colorful illustrations and up-to-date fashion news.

==Women's fashion==

===Gowns and dresses===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Antoine Watteau]] --&gt; 
[[Image:Phillips Tea Party.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A rigid, upright posture with a sharp "break" at the bust is characteristic of the stiffly boned stays of the 1730s. These English ladies wear formal mantuas for tea.]]
[[Image:Elisabeth Christine of Braunschweig Wolfenbuettel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Empress Elisabeth Christine in riding costume.]]
In the early decades of the new century, formal dress consisted of the stiff-bodiced [[Mantua (clothing)|mantua]]. A closed (or "round") [[petticoat]], sometimes worn with an apron, replaced the open draped mantua skirt of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]].  This formal style then gave way to more relaxed fashions.  

The ''robe à la française'' or [[sack-back gown]] had a tight bodice with a low-cut square neckline, usually with large ribbon bows down the front, wide panniers, and was lavishly trimmed with all manner of lace, ribbon, and flowers. With flowing pleats from the shoulders was originally an undress fashion. At its most informal, this gown was unfitted both front and back and called a ''sacque''. With a more relaxed style came a shift away from heavy fabrics, such as satin and velvet, to Indian cotton, silks and damasks. Also, these gowns were often made in lighter pastel shades that gave off a warm, graceful and childlike appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Kemper, Rachel H., "Costume," pg. 105 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, for formal wear, the front was fitted to the body by means of a tightly-laced underbodice, while the back fell in loose box pleats called "Watteau pleats" from their appearance in the paintings of [[Antoine Watteau]].

The less formal ''robe à l'anglaise'', [[Close-bodied gown]] or "nightgown" also had a pleated back, but the pleats were sewn down to fit the bodice to the body to the waist. It featured a snug bodice with a full skirt worn without panniers, usually cut a bit longer in the back to form a small train, and often some type of lace kerchief was worn around the neckline.

Either gown could be closed in front (a "round gown") or open to reveal a matching or contrasting [[petticoat]].
Open-fronted bodices could be filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], and toward the end of the period a lace or linen kerchief called a ''fichu'' could be worn to fill in the low neckline.

Sleeves were bell- or trumpet-shaped, and caught up at the elbow to show the frilled or lace-trimmed sleeves of the [[shift (clothing)|shift]] ([[chemise]]) beneath. Sleeves became narrower as the period progressed, with a frill at the elbow, and elaborate separate ruffles called [[engageante]]s were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]] to the shift sleeves, in a fashion that would persist into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|1770s]].

Necklines on dresses became more open as time went on allowing for greater display of ornamentation of the neck area. A thick band of lace was often sewed onto the neckline of a gown with ribbons, flowers, and/or jewels adorning the lace. Jewelry such as strings of [[pearl]]s, ribbons, or lace frills were tied high on the neck. Finally, one other large element of 18th century women's dress wear became the addition of the frilled neckband, a separate piece from the rest of the dress. This ornament was popularized sometime around 1730 .&lt;ref&gt;B. Payne, "Women's Costume of the Fifteenth Century", History of Costume: From the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marie Antoinette introduced the chemise à la reine, a loose white gown with a colorful silk sash around the waist. This was considered shocking for women at first, as no corset was worn and the natural figure was apparent. However, women seized upon this style, using it as a symbol of their increased liberation.

===Underwear===
The ''stays'' or [[corset]] of the early 18th century were long-waisting and cut with a narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps; the most fashionable stays pulled the shoulders back until the shoulder blades almost touched.  The resulting  silhouette, with shoulders thrown back, very erect posture and a high, full bosom, is characteristic of this period and no other.

Skirts were worn over small, domed [[hoop skirt|hoops]], called panniers, in the 1730s and early 1740s. Depending on the occasion, these panniers varied in size. Smaller hoops were worn in everyday settings and larger hoops for more formal occasions, which later widened to as much as three feet to either side at the French court of [[Marie Antoinette]].

The shift ([[chemise]]) or smock had full sleeves early in the period and tight, elbow-length sleeves in the 1740s as the sleeves of the gown narrowed.

Some women wore drawers (underpants) in England. For instance, as early as 1676 inventory of Hillard Veren had "3 pair of women drawers". Although, they are not common in English or New England inventories during the 17th and 18th century. Clothing Through American History: The British Colonial Era, by Kathleen A. Staples, Madelyn C. Shaw page 245

Woolen waistcoats were worn over the corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting.

[[Handbag|Free-hanging pockets]] were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the gown or petticoat.

Loose gowns, sometimes with a wrapped or surplice front closure, were worn over the shift ([[chemise]]), petticoat and stays (corset) for at-home wear, and it was fashionable to have one's portrait painted wearing these fashions.

===Outerwear===
[[Riding habit]]s consisted of a fitted, thigh- or knee-length coat similar to those worn by men, usually with a matching petticoat. Ladies wore masculine-inspired shirts and tricorne hats for riding and hunting.

When outdoors, ladies also wore elbow-length capes, often lined with fur for warmth.

===Fabrics and colors===

In the early years of this period, pastel silk hoods and light colors became fashionable at the French court for mature women, under the influence of [[Madame de Maintenon]]. Younger women also wore light or bright colors, but the preference was for solid-colored or floral silks with ornamentation.

Gradually, trim in the form of applied lace and fabric ''robings'' (strips of ruched, gathered or pleated fabric) replaced the plain style.  Ribbon bows, lacing, and rosettes became popular, as did boldly patterned fabrics. Silk gowns and [[stomacher]]s were often intricately embroidered in floral and botanical motifs, demonstrating great attention to detail and care for an accurate portrayal of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashelford|first=Jane|title=The Art of Dress Clothes and Society 1500-1914|year=1996|publisher=National Trust Enterprises Limited|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-8109-6317-5|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A mid-century vogue for striped fabrics had the stripes running different directions on the trim and the body of the gown.

[[Chintz]], Indian cotton fabric with block-printed imaging on a white base, was wildly fashionable.  Bans against their importation to protect the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[silk]], [[linen]] and [[wool]]en industries did nothing to reduce their desirability.  Brocaded silks and woolens had similar colorful floral patterns on light-colored grounds.  Blends of wool and silk or wool and linen ([[linsey-woolsey]]) were popular. Until the 1730s, European textiles were of inferior quality that could not match the complex fashionable designs of [[Calico (textile)|Indian calicoes]]. Europe was able to produce high quality petit teints (colors that faded with light and washing), but they were unable to produce grand teints (permanent colors resistant to light and wear).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=Beverly|author2=Giorgie Reillo|title=East &amp; West: Textiles and Fashion in Early Modern Europe|journal=Journal of Social History|year=2008|volume=41|series=4|pages=887–916|doi=10.1353/jsh.0.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear and accessories===
[[Image:18th century shoes mules.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Shoes of 1742 (left) and 1731 (right).]]
The '''[[shoe]]''' of the [[1650–1700 in fashion|previous period]] with its curved heel, squarish toe, and tie over the instep gave way in the second decade of the 18th century to a shoe with a high, curved heel. Backless [[mule (footwear)|mules]] were worn indoors and out (but not on the street). Toes were now pointed.  This style of shoe would remain popular well into the [[1750–1795 in fashion|next]] period. Shoes at the time had many variations of decoration, some even included metal wrapped threads.&lt;ref name="The Metropolitan Museum of Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Slippers|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/156126?rpp=20&amp;pg=1&amp;ao=on&amp;ft=shoes+1700&amp;img=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women, particularly in France, began wearing a '''boutonnière''', or a small bouquet of fresh flowers in a "bosom bottle." About four inches in length, these glass or tin bottles were small enough to discreetly tuck into the bosom or hair, but also just large enough to contain water to keep the flowers from wilting.&lt;ref name=Wilcox&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilcox|first=R. Turner|title=The Mode in Costume|year=1958|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York, NY|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Makeup===
An 18th-century toilette began with a heavy white foundation made from white lead, egg white, and a variety of other substances. This was overlaid with white powder (typically potato or rice powder), rouge, and deep red or cherry lip color.

Tiny pieces of fabric, known as patches, in the shapes of dots, hearts, stars, etc. were applied to the face with adhesive. The fashion is thought to have originated as a way of disguising pox scars and other blemishes, but gradually developed coded meanings. A patch near the mouth signified flirtatiousness; one on the right cheek denoted marriage; one on the left cheek announced engagement; one at the corner of the eye signified a mistress.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.vintageconnection.net/ModesInMakeup.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suits===
The male suit, also known as the habit à la française, made of three parts: the [[justaucorps]], a jacket, and [[breeches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bigelow|first=Marybelle S.|title=Fashion in History: Western Dress, Prehistoric to Present|year=1979|publisher=Burgess Publishing Company|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waistcoat was the most decorative piece, usually lavishly embroidered or displaying patterned fabrics. In the early 18th century the Breeches usually stopped at the knee, with white stockings worn underneath and heeled shoes, which usually had large square buckles.  Coats were worn closer to the body and were not as skirt-like as during the Baroque era.  They were also worn more open to showcase the elaborate waistcoats..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrde|first=Penelope|title=The Male Image Men's Fashion in Britain 1300-1970|year=1979|publisher=The Anchor Press Britain|location=Great Britain|isbn=0-7134-0860X|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fabrics for men were primarily silks, velvets, and brocades, with woolens used for the middle class and for sporting costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Douglas A.|title=Costume History and Style|year=1983|publisher=Prentice-Hall, Inc|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-181214-9|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Footwear===

In the early 18th century, men's shoes continued to have a squared toe, but the heels were not as high. From 1720-1730, the heels became even smaller, and the shoes became more comfortable, no longer containing a block toe. The shoes from the first half of the century often contained an oblong buckle usually embedded with stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Geoffrey|title=Fashion Accessories Since 1500|year=1987|publisher=Drama Book Publishers|location=New York|pages=62, 67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accessories===

Upper class men often wore a cane as part of their outfits, suspending it by a loop from one of their [[waistcoat]] buttons to allow their hands to properly hold snuff-boxes or handkerchiefs. The cane was thus less functional and rather for the sake of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cookson|first=Nesfield|title=The Costume Book|year=1935|publisher=Robert M. McBride &amp; Company, New York|location=New York, NY|pages=164–165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Wigs in a variety of styles were worn for different occasions and by different age groups.

The large high parted wig of the 1690s remained popular from 1700 until around 1720.  During this time various colors were worn, but white was becoming more popular and the curls were getting tighter. The cadogan style of men’s hair developed and became popular during this period, with horizontal rolls of hair over the ears. Later, wigs or the natural hair were worn long, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' or tied back at the nape of the neck with a black ribbon. From about 1720, a bag wig gathered the back hair in a black silk bag. Black ribbons attached to the bag were brought to the front and tied in a bow in a style called a "solitaire".

Wide-brimmed [[hat]]s with brims turned up on three sides into [[tricorne]]s were worn throughout the era. They were an essential element to the "domino", a stylish costume for masquerade balls, which became an increasingly popular mode of entertainment. The "domino" style consisted of a mask, a long cape, and a [[tricorne]] [[hat]], all usually constructed of dark colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ribiero|first=Aileen|title=The Dress Worn at Masquerades in England 1730 to 1790|year=1984|publisher=Garland|location=New York, NY|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children's fashion==
{{contradict|date=August 2014}}
Toddler boys and girls wore low-necked gowns.  ''[[Leading strings]]''—narrow straps of fabric attached to the gown at the shoulder—functioned as a sort of leash to keep the child from straying too far or falling as they learned to walk.

Children older than toddlers continued to wear clothing which was in many respects simply a smaller version of adult clothing.  Although it is often said that children wore miniature versions of adult clothing, this is something of a myth.  Girls wore back-fastening gowns, trimmed much more simply than women's. The skirt of a girl's gown was not split down the front, as women's typically were.&lt;ref name="Art"&gt;Ashelford, Jane, ''The Art of Dress''&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls did not wear jackets or bedgowns.  Boys wore shirts, breeches, waistcoats and coats a man would, but often wore their necks open, and the coat was fitted and trimmed differently from a man's, and boys often went bareheaded.  During some decades of the 18th Century, boys' shirts and coats had different collars and cuffs than a man's.  Even if the size is not apparent, it is usually possible to tell a child's garment from an adult's.

1.A simple trimmed lace and cloth dress English/French cut. (1710)

2. Silk dress supported by panniers. Note that there is no central parting to the dress. The low cut neckline is also less ornamented than a contemporary women's would be. (1718)

3.A group scene of a girl and two boys. Boys were breeched at around 5-10. The girl wears a low neckline that was customary for young girls and boys. (1724)

4.An example of an older girl not far from adulthood. The neckline is still lower than a womans but is more ornamented than that of a child. (1727)

5. The girl sitting holding a fan is displaying her leading strings that her mother would have used to make sure she didn't fall when learning to walk. (1730)

6.A boy of around 10 who has been breeched and wears a Frock coat of a child's pattern. The cuffs and frills would have been less obvious on a grown man. (1738)

7. A middle class girl c1740. The simpler fabric and colours used in her dress show her not to be of noble birth but not in poverty either.Again the low neckline is typical of girls of that age.(1740)

8.A group portrait of children in fine clothes of the period. The boy has been newly breeched while the girls have the characteristic low neckline of children. (1745)

==Satirising fashion==
[[Joseph Addison]] in 1711 devoted an issue of ''[[The Spectator]]''&lt;ref&gt;The Spectator no. 119. 17 July 1711&lt;/ref&gt; to satirising fashion, by noting how the country fashions lagged behind those in [[London]].  "As I proceeded in my journey I observed the petticoat grew scantier and scantier, and about threescore miles from ''London'' was so very unfashionable, that a woman might walk in it without any manner of inconvenience" and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4209">Abraham - Belgian Newspaper Catalogue is an online [[database]] of historical Belgian [[newspaper]]s from 1830 to 1950 that are preserved in [[Library|libraries]] and other [[History|heritage]] institutions all around [[Flanders]] and [[Brussels]].

== Contents ==
Abraham catalogues the location and ownership of [[Belgium|Belgian]] national, regional, and local newspapers kept in more than one hundred libraries and heritage institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | title = Deelnemende instellingen (a list of participating institutions - in Dutch)
 | last =

 | publisher = Flanders Heritage Library (2016-01-28)
 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, the number of [[Inventory|inventoried]] newspaper titles from the period 1830-1950 already exceeds 7200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The database shows the most important specifications of each newspaper, such as title, date, and place of [[publication]]. [[Index term|Keywords]] indicate the type of newspaper (with a focus on e.g. trade, sports, or advertising) or the social community at which the newspaper was aimed (e.g. catholic, liberal, or socialist community). Seeing that newspapers were often attached to a certain city or region, the database allows searching on geographical terms.

Users are able to see detailed information on the exact editions and locations of each newspaper, including the format (paper, [[microform]], or [[digital media|digital]] format) in which it is preserved in each of the institutions. Links are added for newspapers that are consultable online. It is not possible to search on content of any newspaper article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The database was named after [[Abraham Verhoeven]] ([[Antwerp]], 1575-1652), who is considered to be the first publisher of newspapers in the [[Southern Netherlands]]. His ''[[Nieuwe Tijdinghen]]'' (New Tidings) was a substantial contribution to the early beginnings of a daily form of newspaper.

== The Abraham database: development and continuation ==
Abraham was developed as a project in 2007 by the [[Hendrik Conscience Heritage Library]] in co-operation with a large number of heritage institutions. The catalogue was created to increase general access to historical newspapers, a goldmine of [[Cultural history|cultural-historical]] information. Frequent consultation of these newspapers, however, poses considerable risks, seeing that especially those from 1830 to 1950 are often printed on fragile and low-quality paper. The only way to preserve their contents for posterity will be by copying them to microform or digital format. In this way, Abraham plays an important role in the [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of these vulnerable documents.

At the end of 2008, the project was taken over by the then newly founded Flanders Heritage Library. Together with various partners from the heritage field, Flanders Heritage Library is further actively updating and enriching the database with new records. In the meantime, Abraham is being used as a helpful tool for [[Digitizing|digitising]] projects.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1300">In [[painting]], a '''retarder''' is a substance, usually added to [[water]], used to slow the drying time of [[acrylic paints]], giving more time for [[Mixing (process engineering)|blending]] or [[layering]] [[Specular highlight|highlights]].

==Use in fine art==
Retarders are used to counter the fast drying properties of acrylic paints making possible the usage of wet on wet or other techniques which would otherwise require oil paints. Even if they will never give acrylic the working time oil paints permits, depending how much it is adding to paint, they can give anywhere from half an hour to a full day's working time.

==Content==
They generally contain glycol (such as [[propylene glycol]]) or glycerin-based additives.

== Home-Made ==
For home-made acrylic retarder, water [[glycerol]] down about 5:1 (water: glycerol) and apply to paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |title=Home Made Acrylic Retarders |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515215304/http://www.paintingclinic.com/clinic/guestarticles/retarder.htm |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-toxic car anti-freeze, which contains propylene glycol can also be used.

The '''''Adoration of the Shepherds''''' is a painting of 1633–34 by the French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594–1665), now in the [[National Gallery, London]] (Room 19). It is in [[oil painting|oils]] on canvas, and measures {{convert|97.2 x 74| cm}} (with uneven edges). Unusually for Poussin, it is signed "N. Pusin.fe" ["[[fecit]]"] on the stone at lower right.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1637, soon after it was painted, it was owned by Cardinal [[Gian Carlo de' Medici]] (1611{{ndash}}1663),&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; the second son of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany]] and was placed in his villa outside [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to a group of paintings with a predominately "coppery" colour scheme, from which its dating mainly derives. Classicising elements have been added to the usual figures.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 337–339&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was evidently well-regarded, and 20 painted copies are recorded from approximately the next century, as well as seven [[old master print|print]] versions made between the 1660s and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334–336&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of drawings, some showing what appear to be early thoughts about the composition, though some may not be by Poussin or were created before the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334–339&lt;/ref&gt;  As is often the case with Poussin, elements of the painting reflect the works of other artists, including [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 337–338&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description ==
To the usual cast of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]] are added the earlier scene of the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] in the distance at the centre, five ''[[putti]]'' above, about to shower the scene with flowers, and a woman at left holding a large [[wicker]] tray with fruit.  The scene takes place in a large but derelict classical building, to which a crude wooden lean-to stable has been added. The golden stone of the building is echoed by the tanned bodies of the shepherds, the cloudy sky, and other elements, giving an unusually unified "coppery" colour scheme to the painting, with the blue of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s mantle and that of the woman carrying the fruit the other prominent colour.  The ox, to the right of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], almost disappears into the wall behind him.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike those in the still central scene, the figures in the small background Annunciation to the Shepherds are highly agitated, with extreme and strenuous poses. The gesturing angel is loosely painted in white against the cloud, just above the foremost vine leaves in the basket.  Like other figures by Poussin from this period, the foreground figures seem to have a frozen sculptural quality.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The figure with a green dress is female.  The foremost kneeling shepherd is close to, and perhaps derived from, a shepherd in a painting of the Nativity by [[Raphael]] ([[Vatican Loggie]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338–339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
Other paintings by Poussin, generally dated to the years between 1633 and 1634, have similar colour schemes.  The ''Adoration of the Magi'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]] (illustrated) is dated 1633; it has a very similar setting but a more varied colour scheme, so the London ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' is assumed to be later than that.  The ''Saving of the Infant Pyrrhus'' in the [[Louvre]], with a similar unified "coppery" scheme, has now been shown to have been finished by 1634 at the latest, so the London painting is now assigned to 1633–34 with reference to these, and also a drawing with a preparatory sketch on the [[verso]], now in the [[Royal Collection]].  This was made for Marshall [[Charles III de Créquy]] when he was French ambassador to Rome, resident there between June 1633 and July 1634.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338–339&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "coppery-toned" National Gallery Possin (in 2015 hanging next to this one) is ''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'', also dated 1633–34, largely on the basis of this similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 320&lt;/ref&gt;  This is usually thought to have been painted as a pair with ''[[The Crossing of the Red Sea (Poussin)|The Crossing of the Red Sea]]'', now [[National Gallery of Victoria]], [[Melbourne]]; the two remained together until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 314, 319–320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The painting was done when Poussin was approaching the age of 40. He had been in Rome since 1624, and enjoyed some success in the 1620s, in particular when his main patrons were not abroad on embassies. These were Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597–1679)|Francesco Barberini]] (1597–1679), nephew of the current Pope, [[Urban VIII]] (reigned 1623–1644), and his secretary, the [[antiquarian]] [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]] (1588–1657), who was to remain an important friend and patron of Poussin.  However, when in 1628 Barberini secured him the commission for an [[altarpiece]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], the ''Martyrdom of St Erasmus'' ([[Pinacoteca Vaticana]]), its reception seems to have been lukewarm, which perhaps triggered a change in Poussin's career, along with a period of illness in 1629 or 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 159–160; Mahon, 16–40 and throughout; Wine, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time he seems to have abandoned the pursuit of the many rich commissions Rome offered for large paintings for churches and palaces, and henceforth painted only canvases of a relatively small size for "a small circle of ''[[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]]''",&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 160&lt;/ref&gt; led by dal Pozzo. That this painting quickly passed to a Medici prince-cardinal makes it rather untypical for this period, though during the 1630s awareness of Poussin's talent was growing in the French court, until he was eventually ordered by the king to return to Paris in 1640 (he escaped back to Rome two years later, and never left again).&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 163–165&lt;/ref&gt;

His style and subject-matter also changed at the end of the 1620s, switching away from the influence of [[Italian Baroque art|Italian baroque]]  painters to a classicism influenced by [[classical sculpture]] and the [[High Renaissance]]. His paintings from about 1629 to 1633 are nearly all drawn from [[classical mythology]], or the epics of [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]. The Dresden ''Adoration'', dated 1633, perhaps marks the end of this phase, and for the rest of the 1630s his subjects become once again more varied.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 160–163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:L'Adoration des bergers, 1633, Londres, National Gallery (cropped5).jpg|thumb|Detail of the ''[[putti]]'']]
Nativity scenes are very often given such classical settings.  As well as showing off the artist's skill and learning they acted as a reminder of the medieval legend, reported in the popular compilation of the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', that on the night of Christ's birth the [[Basilica of Maxentius]] in Rome, supposed to house a statue of [[Romulus]], had partly tumbled to the ground, leaving the impressive ruins that survive today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Lloyd|Lloyd, Christopher]], ''The Queen's Pictures, Royal Collectors through the centuries'', p.226, National Gallery Publications, 1991, {{ISBN|0-947645-89-6}}. In fact the Basilica was not built until the 4th century. Some later painters used the remains as a basis for their depictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning for the ruined temple went back to 15th-century [[Early Netherlandish painting]], when the usual simple shed of the Nativity stable, little changed from [[Late Antiquity]], had developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49–50. Purtle, Carol J, "Van Eyck's Washington 'Annunciation': narrative time and metaphoric tradition", p.4 and notes 9–14, ''Art Bulletin'', March, 1999. Page references are to online version. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_1_81/ai_54517312 online text]. Also see [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italian works the architecture of such temples became classical, reflecting the growing interest in the ancient world, and the ruins that remained in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:91-82&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman with the fruit can be paralleled in some other paintings, and if the work was actually commissioned by Cardinal de' Medici, a reference to a statue of ''Plenty'' by [[Donatello]], now lost but then prominently displayed in the Mercato Vecchio of his home-city of Florence, may have been intended.  It was also a Florentine custom to bring gifts of fruit to women after childbirth, no doubt to be placed on their ''[[desco da parto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;  Various meanings might be attached to both the apples and grapes the woman appears to carry, and the types of flowers held by the ''putti'', though other than the [[jasmine]] held by the top left ''putto'', the identification of these is not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The main surviving preparatory drawing is in the [[British Museum]].  This is in a horizontal format, just showing the lower part, and may suggest that Poussin originally intended a smaller painting with a horizontal format, although the drawing is cut along its top edge. This includes an upturned [[pediment]] stone at bottom left, a low arch in the centre at what is now about halfway up the final composition, and a lamb lying below Jesus.  [[Christ Church Picture Gallery]] in [[Oxford]] has a drawing with the ''putti'', again with differences in the architectural background.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was still in the collection of Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici in a posthumous inventory in 1663, after which it may have moved to France, where a ''Nativity'' attributed to Poussin is recorded in a number of collections for the next century. These include that of [[Louis Phélypeaux (1643-1727)|Louis II Phélypeaux]] (1643–1727), better known as the chancellor de Pontchartrain, an important French politician.&lt;ref&gt;His jobs included: [[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)]], [[Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi]], [[Controller-General of Finances]], [[Chancellor of France]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] noted seeing such a painting in his collection in 1665,&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; and one is recorded in his wife's collection in 1672. Another mention, from 1700, is in the collection of [[André Le Nôtre]] (1613–1700), the landscape architect and principal gardener of King [[Louis XIV of France]],&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; and there are two further owners of what was probably the same painting, ending in a posthumous sale in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point it may have passed to England; in 1795 what was certainly the same painting was in the posthumous sale of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]' collection at [[Christie's]],&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; where it fetched 205 guineas.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by the painter and dealer [[Henry Walton (English painter)|Henry Walton]] who sold it a year later to Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor, 2nd Baronet (1756–1827).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained in the collections of the [[Proctor-Beauchamp baronets]] and their family between 1796 and 1956, when it fetched £29,000 at [[Sotheby's]], bought by an overseas collector.  An export licence was deferred, allowing the National Gallery to buy the work for £33,100 in 1957, with funds from the Temple-West Fund, the [[The Art Fund|NACF]], and a special Treasury grant.  It is catalogued as NG 6277.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The condition is "generally good ... but with some wear".  There are some minor [[pentimenti]] and retouches. As of 2001, the painting was last "cleaned and restored" in 1958, then "surface cleaned and revarnished" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 336&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Apart from National Gallery exhibitions since 1957, it has travelled to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1880 and 1995, [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] 1992–93 and Paris in 1994–95 ([[Grand Palais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''album era''' was a period in English-language popular music from the mid 1960s to the mid 2000s in which the [[album]] was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption.  It was primarily driven by three successive music recording formats, the 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm [[LP record]], the [[Compact Cassette|audiocassette]] and the music [[Compact disc]].

==Origins==
Technological developments in the early twentieth century led to the development of the vinyl [[LP album|long-playing (LP) album]] as an important medium for recorded music. In 1948, [[Columbia Records]] began to bring out 33{{frac|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;rpm twelve-inch extended-play LPs that could play for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. [[Musical film]] soundtracks, jazz works, and thematic albums by singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]] quickly utilized the new longer format. However, in the 1950s and into the 1960s, 45&amp;nbsp;rpm [[seven-inch single]] sales were considered the primary market for the recorded music industry, while albums were a secondary market.  The careers of notable rock and roll performers such as [[Elvis Presley]] were driven primarily by single sales.

==1960s–1990s==
The dominance of the single as the primary medium of creative expression in music changed with the release of several albums in the 1960s, such as ''[[A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector]]'' (1963), [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965),&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41" /&gt; [[the Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' (1966), [[the Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'' (1966), and the Beatles' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' (1967).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Julien|first=Oliver|title=Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles: It Was Forty Years Ago Today|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2013|isbn=9781409493822}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' (1966) and ''Sgt. Pepper'' and the Beach Boys' ''Pet Sounds'', writer [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] noted: "In the wake of these albums, many rock musicians took up the 'complete album approach.'"&lt;ref name="MartinProg p 41"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bill|title=Listening to the Future: The Time of Progressive Rock, 1968-1978|date=1998|publisher=Open Court|location=Chicago, Ill. [u.a.]|isbn=0-8126-9368-X|pages=41|edition=1. print.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' assistant editor Andy Greene felt that ''Sgt. Pepper's'' "was the beginning of the album era.  It was the big bang of albums."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Kokenes. [http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/29/lennon.lyrics.auction/ "'A Day in the Life' Lyrics to be Auctioned."] [[CNN.com]]. 30 April 2010. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Howard, writing in his book ''Sonic Alchemy'', "pop's stakes had been raised into the stratosphere" by the Beatles' ''Rubber Soul'', resulting in a shift in focus from singles to creating albums without the usual [[filler (media)|filler]] tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Howard |first=David N. |year=2004 |title=Sonic Alchemy: Visionary Music Producers and Their Maverick Recordings |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Sk0FNXkjcC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=rubber+soul+album+without+filler#v=onepage&amp;q=rubber%20soul%20album%20without%20filler&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-634-05560-7 |p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1966, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine cited the initial US sales of ''Rubber Soul'' (1.2 million copies over nine days) as evidence of teenage record-buyers increasingly moving towards the LP format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7SgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;q="Rubber+Soul"+%22nine+days%22 |author=Staff writer|title=Teen Market Is Album Market|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=18 March 2016|p=36|date=15 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, no singles were released from the album, which writer [[David Leaf]] says created the "perception that their new work should be viewed as a whole.&amp;nbsp;... it introduced the possibility to the recording industry that the 45&amp;nbsp;RPM disc&amp;nbsp;... preeminent for a decade&amp;nbsp;... might soon give way to a new king&amp;nbsp;... the album as a work of art."&lt;ref name="LeafPerspective"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |first=David |last=Leaf |authorlink=David Leaf |chapter=''Pet Sounds'' – Perspective |title=The Pet Sounds Sessions |others=[[The Beach Boys]] |year=1997 |publisher=[[Capitol Records]] |type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Pet_Sounds_-_Perspective.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During ''Pet Sounds''' composition and production, Beach Boys bandleader [[Brian Wilson]] found the American version of ''Rubber Soul'' to be "a collection of songs that…somehow went together like no album ever made before", which inspired Wilson to briefly shift his focus from singles to albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Stevens | first =Robert  | url =http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/oct2007/wils-o24.shtml  | title = An Evening with Brian Wilson: The Palace Theatre in Manchester, England—September&amp;nbsp;23, 2007 | publisher =wsws.org | date=October 24, 2007 | accessdate = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mid 1960s to the late 1970s was the era of the LP and the "golden era" of the album. According to BBC Four's ''The Golden Age'', "These were the years when the music industry exploded to become bigger than Hollywood."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01qhn70 Synopsis of "When Albums Ruled the World."] from [[BBC Four]]'s ''The Golden Age Of The Album'' series. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  This period, especially the 1970s, is also called the Album Rock Era. Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] has called [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s 1967 "[[Purple Haze]]" the "debut single of the Album Rock Era"&lt;ref&gt;Dave Marsh.

Da Capo Press, 1999. p. 178. {{ISBN|9780306809019}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called [[Lou Gramm]]'s 1987 "[[Midnight Blue (Lou Gramm song)|Midnight Blue]]" the "last great single of the album-rock era".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Thomas Erlewine.

Hal Leonard Corporation, 2007. p. 72. {{ISBN|9780879309176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[LP record]], the [[8-track tape]] was another format popular in the United States in this period. After the fall of LP record sales at the end of the 1970s and rise of first the cassette and then the CD as the dominant format for recorded music saw the end of the LP-driven "golden age" of the album, the album consolidated its domination of the recorded music market.  Seven-inch vinyl single sales were dropping and were almost totally displaced by [[cassette single]]s by the end of the 1980s.  Yet these were never as popular as seven-inch singles and they and the subsequent CD singles never amounted to a significant threat to the dominance of the album.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The primary threat to the album's primacy in the 1980s and early 1990s came from [[MTV]].  It was quickly recognized that, "after the album-rock era of the 1970s, MTV helped return the hit single to prominence as a pop marketing tool".&lt;ref name=Pareles&gt;Jon Pareles.

"Death of the album" is a phrase used to describe the perceived decline of album sales in the 21st century, sometimes attributed to internet sharing and downloading,&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation|last=Baneriee|first=Scott|title=New Ideas, New Outlets|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=6 November 2004|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRMEAAAAMBAJ|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kiss|first=Jemima|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2008/aug/29/thedeathofthealbum|work=[[Guardian.co.uk]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=29 August 2008|title=The death of the album|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the changing expectations of music listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Paxson|first=Peyton|date=2010|title=Mass Communications and Media Studies: An Introduction|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=9781441108951|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RusUVdLjxrsC|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to releasing an album, some bands have begun releasing a series of singles&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hopkins|first=Daniel|title=Advice to Every New Band: Stop Putting Out Albums|work=[[Dallas Observer]]|date=12 September 2012|publisher=Kevin Thornburg|url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2012/09/ask_a_failed_musician.php|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Extended play|EP]]s as a way to combat the "average person's short attention span."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Hearsay|title=Death of the Album?|work=[[Fort Worth Weekly]]|date=3 October 2012|url=http://www.fwweekly.com/2012/10/03/death-album/|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 1990s, single song delivery of music to the consumer was almost dead, at least in the United States.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;  In 1998, ''Billboard'' magazine [[Billboard Hot 100#Album cuts|ended the requirement of a physical single]] for charting on its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart after several of the year's major hits were not released as singles. But, despite the dominance of the CD, technological changes quickly turned the tables. In 1999, the internet [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] service [[Napster]] allowed internet users to easily download single songs in [[MP3]] format.  By early 2001, Napster use peaked with 26.4 million users worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Jupiter Media Metrix (July 20, 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080413104420/http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?id=249 Global Napster Usage Plummets, But New File-Sharing Alternatives Gaining Ground]. Press Release.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Napster was shut down in 2001 for copyright violations, other [[music download]] services took its place.  In 2001, [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] service was introduced and the [[iPod]], a consumer-friendly MP3 player, was released later that year.  This and other legal alternatives as well as illicit file sharing continued to depress sales of recorded music on physical formats.  By 2006, downloaded digital single sales outnumbered CD sales for the first time and buyers of digital music purchased singles over albums by a margin of 19:1.&lt;ref name=Leeds&gt;Jeff Leeds. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/26/business/media/26music.html "The Album, a Commodity in Disfavor."] ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 March 2007. Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even music industry executives were forced to admit that the album was on its way out.  "For some genres and some artists, having an album-centric plan will be a thing of the past," [[Capitol-EMI]]'s COO Jeff Kempler said.  Other warnings were more dire.  Media researcher Aram Sinnreich bluntly predicted that "the album is going to die.  Consumers are listening to play lists" on their MP3 players.&lt;ref name=Leeds/&gt;

With consumers abandoning albums, performers "started concentrating on dishing out singles as opposed to churning out albums".&lt;ref name=Morey&gt;Tejas Morey.

Retrieved 5 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of the trend argued that single songs "never truly showed an artist’s true prowess and every singer or songwriter proved to be a one-hit wonder".&lt;ref name=Morey/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3853">The '''American Writers Association''' ('''AWA''') was an organization formed in 1946 in opposition to an attempt to introduce a form of [[trade unionism]] for authors. Its members included writers such as [[Bruce Barton]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]], [[James T. Farrell]], [[John T. Flynn]], [[Rupert Hughes]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Clarence Budington Kelland]], [[Clare Boothe Luce]], [[Eugene Lyons]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Dorothy Thompson]] and [[Louis Waldman]].&lt;ref name="moser168"&gt;{{harvnb|Moser|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burns101"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoopes398"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization formed as a response to the "Cain Plan", a proposal put forth by the novelist and screenwriter [[James M. Cain]]. In July 1946, Cain proposed that an "American Authors' Authority" be created to act as a central repository for copyrights, and additionally negotiating collectively for authors to give them greater bargaining power. The AWA opposed this plan. Many AWA members considered the Cain Plan to be an attempt by [[Communism|Communists]] to gain control over copyrights. Flynn compared the Authority's board of governors to the [[politburo]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; Cain responded by referring to members of the AWA as "reactionary, almost incomprehensibly censorious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cain Denounces Authors League |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, a group of 50 writers signed a joint letter to [[Elmer Rice]], president of the Authors League of America, to announce the group's formation.&lt;ref name="hoopes398"/&gt; The AWA soon found backing from radio and film producers, as well as newspaper editors and publishers.&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; The group held meetings and began a newsletter.&lt;ref name="burns101"/&gt; Erskine was initially elected as the group's leader,&lt;ref name="hoopes400"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was soon succeeded by Hughes.&lt;ref name="fine208"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1992|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn, Lyons and Waldman were selected for a "strategy committee".&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt;

The Cain Plan was quickly defeated, but the AWA continued to exist for several years after. In 1949, the group supported the [[Contempt of Congress]] citations against the [[Hollywood Ten]] by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Against Hollywood Ten |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 16, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the AWA denounced the [[Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace]] as a "fraud", saying its Russian delegates were "prisoners" of that country's Communist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-Red Session Is Hailed by Tobin |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Angelique Rockas''' (born in Boksburg, South Africa) is an actress, producer and activist, most notable for introducing London to its first multi-racial and multi-national theatre productions in the 1980s. Rockas founded [[Internationalist Theatre]] in the UK with patron [[Athol Fugard]]. The theater featured multi-racial casts in classical plays, breaking racial barriers that were once accepted norms for theatrical performances.

==Early life==
Rockas was born and raised in Boksburg, South Africa to Greek parents who had emigrated from Greece with hopes of finding a better life. She had three siblings, followed Orthodox Christian traditions, and was taught to honor her Greek cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"&gt;{{cite web | title=Angelique Rockas: Strong, Bold and Unafraid | website=Greek Reporter Europe | date=2012-05-21 | url=https://eu.greekreporter.com/2012/05/21/angelique-rockas-strong-bold-and-unafraid/ | access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received her early education at [[St Dominic's Catholic School for Girls, Boksburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesouthafrican.com/angelique-rockas-bold-theatre-pioneer/|title=Angelique Rockas: bold theatre pioneer|date=10 August 2011|editor= Heather Walker|work=The South African}}&lt;/ref&gt;and later earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] honours degree in English literature with a major in philosophy at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. After earning her degree, Rockas went on to complete an acting course at the Drama School of the [[University of Cape Town]] under the direction of Robert Mohr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esat.sun.ac.za/index.php/Robert_Mohr|title=Robert Mohr|author=University of Stellenbosch|via=esat.sun.ac.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/DieEffekVanGammaStraleProgramme |title=Programme of Die Effek van Gamma Strale directed by Robert Mohr, Reza De Wet in cast|author=Little Theatre, Univ of Cape Town|year=1976|work=Die Effek van Gamma Strale|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A young activist, Rockas appeared on the June 1970 front page of the ''[[The Star (South Africa)|Star]]'' with a group of debutantes raising funds for Saheti School, a Greek school located in [[Germiston, South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AngeliqueAsASahetiDebutantOnTheStarFrontPage1970|title=Debutantes for SAHETI|date=5 June 1970|work=The Star|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also participated in a 25 March [[Greek War of Independence]] Poetry Celebration with [[George Bizos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03js1g3|title=BBC World Service Interview Archive:George Bizos|date=29 July 2003|via=BBC World Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bizos nicknamed her “l’enfant terrible” for her resistance to the status quo,&lt;ref name="The South African 2011"&gt;{{cite web | title=Angelique Rockas: bold theatre pioneer | website=The South African | date=2011-08-10 | url=https://www.thesouthafrican.com/angelique-rockas-bold-theatre-pioneer/ | access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became her role model leading up to her founding of the Internationalist Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellenism.net/interview_angelique-rockas.html|title=Angelique Rockas|author=Evangelos Kordakis|work=''hellenism.net''}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her activities as an anti-apartheid and feminist activist in “the then underdeveloped and extremely conservative” South Africa eventually motivated her move to the UK.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"/&gt;  While residing in North London, she worked for Theatro Technis, a Greek Cypriot theatre company that focused on sociopolitical issues affecting [[Greek Cypriots]]. She was also a participant in promoting Greek tragedies and comedies to London audiences.&lt;ref name="Greek Reporter Europe 2012"/&gt;

==Acting career==
In London, Rockas began acting under the direction of [[George Eugeniou]] at Theatro Technis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angelique Rockas a Theatreo Technis Prometheus|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/abstract?site=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;jrnl=08248621&amp;AN=52410713&amp;h=D4pQVSHa%2blft3Fkw0PfL0P6VsqS5LzgL3rJ0zFn6HFeAqgqGTLhjLJEzqMvoOl2cN5%2fokwT3iEkKRUTPN9UnqA%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNoResults&amp;resultNs=Ehost&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d08248621%26AN%3d52410713|author=Petsalas,Anastassios|series=Etudes Helleniques Vol 16 Issue 2-page 107|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she participated in Greek classical productions.

[[File:Angeline Rockas as Miriam (In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel).jpg|thumb|upright|Rockas as Miriam, ''In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel'']]
In April 1981, Rockas founded [[Internationalist Theatre]] to create a multi-racial and multi-national theatre company for actors living in London of any racial or national background, of any accent, performing drama classics as well as contemporary works not especially written for multi-racial and multi-national casts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BBCLatinAmericanReview2 |title=BBC Latin American The Camp Multi Racial And Multi National |year=1981|work=Griselda Gambaro The Camp |author=Ann Morey |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/BBCLatinAmericanReview1 |title=BBC Latin American The Camp Multi Racial And Multi National|author=Ann Morey|date=26 October 1981|work=BBC Latin American Service page 2|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first announced on 9 April 1981 in the Theatre News, page (2), by the editor of ''[[The Stage]]'', describing the company's formation "to assert a multi-racial drama policy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/search/results?basicsearch=second%20show%20by%20genet%20the%20stage%20april%201981&amp;retrievecountrycounts=false|title= British Newspaper Archive Screenshot The Stage Second show by Genet multi-racial No 3 |series=The Stage|date=9 April 1981|work=britishnewspaperarchive.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their performance of the revival of ''[[The Balcony]]'' by [[Jean Genet]].

Internationalist Theatre staged productions by dramatists including Pirandello, Genet, and Tennessee Williams who belong to "the continental, non-realistic, symbolically orientated drama of this century (20th) and..proved most uncongenial to the tunnel visioned repertoire builders" of British theatre of that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://archive.org/details/Liola_review_guardian_de_jong_28_july_1982_Internationalist_theatre |title=LIOLA |author=Nicolas de Jongh |date= 28 July 1982|work=The Guardian |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ars Mathematica''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[the] Mathematical Art") is a [[Paris]], [[France]]-based, international and [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1992 by Christian Lavigne and Alexandre Vitkine to promote the interconnection between [[art]], [[science]], and [[technology]], with a particular focus on digital [[sculpture]].

Since 1993, the association has organized a biennial exhibition of digital sculpture. "Intersculpt '95," the second show, was jointly sponsored by U.S.-based [[Computer and Sculpture Forum]]. During the expo, a [[wikt:transatlantic|transatlantic]] [[videoconference]] between [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and Paris resulted in the creation of a shared sculpture, "the Temple Hands," based on a concept by David Morris, and the first transatlantic telesculpture, sent by Stewart DICKSON via the Internet and materialized in Paris.

Since 1996, many digital sculptures showed during the Intersculpt events are displayed on [[Active Worlds]], in the DAAP zone founded, curated and managed by the Pr. Derrick WOODHAM (professor Emeritus at the [[University of Cincinnati]] ).

'''Asian Dub Foundation''' ('''ADF''') is an English [[electronic music|electronica]] band that combines the musical styles [[rapcore]], [[dub music|dub]], [[dancehall]] and [[ragga]]. The group also includes traditional rock instruments such as electric bass and guitar, which acknowledges a [[Punk rock|punk]] rock influence. Their music is known for its dub-inspired basslines, guitar parts inspired by the traditional Indian instrument the [[sitar]], and fast rapping.

==History==
Asian Dub Foundation (ADF) was formed in summer 1993 from an education workshop run by Aniruddha Das (bass, programming) and assisted by John Pandit (mixing)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Sharma|first=Samjay|author2= Hutnyk, John|author3= Sharma, Ashwani|title = Dis-orienting Rhythms: Politics of the New Asian Dance Music|publisher = Zed Books Ltd|date = 1996-11-01|location = [[London]]|pages = 32–57 (Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?)| isbn = 978-1-85649-469-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was attended by rapper [[Deeder Zaman]]. This early line-up released the sound-system based ''Conscious'' EP in late 1993 on [[Nation Records]]. Guitarist/programmer [[Steve Chandra Savale]] was invited to join in early 1994 and ADF became more of a band format.&lt;ref name=nme&gt;{{cite web|title = NME Reviews: Community Music|publisher=[[NME]]|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/asian-dub-foundation/1983|accessdate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanjay Tailor joined the band as live midi/programmer and DJ soon after. This completed the full live line-up of the band and their debut album ''[[Facts and Fictions]]'' was released in late 1995, following the single "Rebel Warrior".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/artist/asian-dub-foundation-mn0000936480/biography&lt;/ref&gt; 

Initially not widely known in a UK music scene focused on [[Britpop]], the band toured in mainland Europe and gained a substantial following, particularly in France where their French-only release ''[[R.A.F.I.]]'' sold 100,000 copies. In early 1997 the band was signed by [[London Records]]. Their British profile was upped considerably by the support of [[Primal Scream (band)|Primal Scream]] with whom the band began to tour regularly. Their second album ''[[Rafi's Revenge]]'' (1998) combined punk energy with a jungle/reggae core and was nominated for a [[Mercury Prize]]. The single "Naxalite" was an ode to the militant [[Naxalite]] movement in India. Tours to the United States (with the [[Beastie Boys]]) and Japan followed.

Their following album, ''[[Community Music]]'', developed their sound further and received a 10/10 review in ''[[NME]]''.{{r|nme}} In 2000, ADF played a slot on [[Glastonbury Festival]]'s Pyramid stage. At the end of 2000, [[Deeder Zaman]] announced his plans to go solo, his last gig being at Alexandra Palace alongside Primal Scream and [[Ian Brown]].

Their first project of 2001 was an attempt to create a live re-score of [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]'s film ''[[La Haine]]'' at the [[Barbican Centre]]'s "Only Connect" festival in London. The gig was sold out and received critical praise, particularly from Max Bell and [[Steven Wells]]. They did the piece again by invitation of [[David Bowie]] at his South Bank [[Meltdown Festival]] in 2002; in attendance was Kassovitz. The band went to Brazil to collaborate with community activist Afro-Reggae with new band members MC Aktarv8tr, Spex MC, Rocky Singh (drums), and Prithpal Rajput ([[dhol]]).

In 2002, Pandit G was awarded the [[MBE]] for "services to the music industry" in relation to his work with ''Community Music''. He declined the award, however, stating:&lt;ref name="NME2"&gt;

{{cquote|I personally don't think it's appropriate. I've never supported the honours system. If you want to acknowledge projects like [''Community Music''], the work that these organisations do, then fund them. There's no point in giving an individual an accolade to bring people into the establishment; [it] won't actually help the organisations!

"If you want to acknowledge the work of these organisations, prioritise funding so they can grow and expand and do the work that they do (in) creating new music, giving people the opportunities to make music, develop new musicians and create pathways where they can go out and establish themselves in the music industry.}}

In 2003, they released ''[[Enemy of the Enemy]]'', which became their best-selling album and contained the track "Fortress Europe", an attack on European immigration policy, along with "1000 Mirrors", a collaboration with [[Sinéad O'Connor]] about a woman serving life for killing an abusive husband. In 2003, they played their biggest gig in front of 100,000 people in France at a celebration of [[José Bové]], a radical campaigning farmer. For 2005's ''[[Tank (album)|Tank]]'', they were joined by [[On-U Sound]] collaborator Ghetto Priest on vocals, with the help of [[Adrian Sherwood]].

The band continued performing their ''La Haine'' soundtrack around the world for the next five years. They developed this approach in 2004 with another improvised soundtrack to the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'', first performing the piece at the Brighton Dome.

In 2005, they won "Best Underground" at the [[UK Asian Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wass-up.com/ukama2005.php |title=Artists unite to celebrate British Asian Music |accessdate=24 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110150402/http://wass-up.com/ukama2005.php |archivedate=10 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bassist Dr Das announced his intention to retire in May 2006 to resume teaching and produce his own music. He was replaced by Martin Savale, who also plays bass with British-Asian electro/grunge/hip-hop band [[Swami (band)|Swami]].

In September 2006, the dub/punk opera "Gaddafi: A Living Myth", with music by ADF, opened at the [[Coliseum Theatre|London Coliseum]]. In Spring 2007, Asian Dub Foundation announced the release of a [[greatest hits|best of]] compilation ''[[Time Freeze: The Best of Asian Dub Foundation]]'' which included a bonus disc of rare remixes and live tracks, including a live recording of a [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] song featuring [[Chuck D]]. The album also featured a new track recorded with former vocalist Deeder Zaman. In May 2007 ADF performed a radio session and interview on the [[Bobby Friction|Bobby]] and [[DJ Nihal|Nihal]] show on [[BBC Radio 1]] where they performed three new tracks: "Climb On", "Superpower" and "S.O.C.A.". In June 2007, they were the only Western act to perform at the Festival of [[Gnawa music]] in [[Essaouira]], [[Morocco]] playing to a crowd of 60,000 people and collaborating with traditional Gnawa musicians.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In August 2007, Asian Dub Foundation started playing with two new vocalists, Al Rumjen (previously and subsequently with [[King Prawn (band)|King Prawn]]) and Aktarv8r, who returned after MC Spex was asked to leave the band due to personal issues.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In November/December 2007, Asian Dub Foundation recorded a new album, ''[[Punkara]]''. It was released in March 2008 and followed by a tour of Europe and Japan.

In 2009, ADF contributed to the Indigenous Resistance project after having met up with the Atenco movement in [[Mexico]]. Asian Dub Foundation started work on their new album, provisionally entitled ''A New London Eye'', which would feature Ministry of Dhol, Nathan "Flutebox" Lee, Chi 2 and Skrein. The album eventually came out as ''The History of Now'' and the band toured extensively to promote it. The cover contained many fantasy iPhone "Apps" intended to parody the contemporary age.

In May 2012, the band was asked by immersive pop-up subversives [[Secret Cinema]] to revive their live soundtrack to ''La Haine'' at [[Broadwater Farm]] and also performed the piece in Paris the night of the French elections. Later that year ADF were rejoined by Dr. Das, Ghetto Priest and Rocky Singh. They recorded a new album, ''[[The Signal and the Noise (Asian Dub Foundation album)|The Signal and the Noise]]'', and headlined a series of festivals including "Bearded Theory" and "Asigiri Jam" in Japan.

In 2014, the band debuted their latest live soundtrack, to ''[[THX 1138]]'', [[George Lucas]]'s first feature-length film. George Lucas and his collaborator [[Walter Murch]] gave their blessing to the project and it was performed at the Brooklyn Festival in [[Prospect Park, Brooklyn|Prospect Park]] which led to an Arts Council Sponsored Tour of the UK in 2015. ADF signed a label deal with Believe records in 2015 and released ''More Signal More Noise'' on their own ADF Communications imprint, an enhanced version of the 2013 Japanese release. They were joined in early 2015 by ex-[[The Prodigy]] drummer Brian Fairbairn and have since toured Italy with a revived version of their ''La Haine'' soundtrack, performed an Arts Council sponsored tour of THX 1138, recorded a [[BBC Radio 6]] session for [[Tom Robinson]] and played headline slots at WOMAD and [[Boomtown Film and Music Festival|Boomtown]] festivals in 2016.

In June 2017, it was announced that the band is working on an upcoming album which is set to be released in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiandubfoundation.com/site/?p=738&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8132">'''Association MAV (Mujeres en las Artes Visuales)''' is a group of more than 500 visual arts professionals women in Spain that promotes the visibility and improvement of opportunities for women in the arts. The association was founded on May 9, 2009 at [[La Casa Encendida (Madrid)|La Casa Encendida]] in Madrid by a group of contemporary female artists led by professor and art critic [[Rocio de la Villa]].

==Objectives==
The '''Association MAV (Mujeres en las Artes Visuales)''' promotes initiatives to foster the participation of women in culture and to combat discrimination in accordance with the Organic Act 1/2004 on Integral Protection Measures against Gender Violence.

Through its Observatorio, MAV analyzes and provides objective, numeric data to inform the situation of visual arts professionals in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iac.org.es/mav-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales-foro-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales|title=MAV, Mujeres en las Artes Visuales. Foro mujeres en las artes visuales. : Instituto de Arte Contemporáneo|access-date=2016-04-22|website=Iac.org.es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acknowledging the low number of women in top positions in arts and culture,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://masdearte.com/miradas-de-mujeres-2016/|title=Miradas de Mujeres 2016, "un año de arte feminista"|website=Masdearte.com|access-date=2016-07-04|date=2016-04-26|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; the MAV seeks to balance the presence of Spanish women in all sectors of contemporary art (e.g., artists, gallerists, researchers, curators, professors, art managers, museum directors) and advocate with Spanish institutions for the implementation of gender equality policies in all types of arts.

The MAV Association has established collaborations with other organizations of women in culture and [[contemporary art]] to develop initiatives towards tackling the lack of participation of women in the art system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.inmujer.gob.es/publicacioneselectronicas/documentacion/Revistas/ANALITICAS/DEA0230.pdf|title="MAV te observa", "entraremos en acción": "Las mujeres en el sistema del arte español". "Sobre piedras y vientos de igualdad"|author=López Fernandez-Cao|date=2013|journal=Universidad Complutense de Madrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its Centre of Documentation, the MAV Association provides resources for the investigation and documentation of best labour practices, and for the creation of new projects in the field of art, gender and [[feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laboralcentrodearte.org/es/actividades/presentacion-en-asturias-de-la-asociacion-mujeres-en-las-artes-visuales-contamporaneas-mav/view|title=Presentación en Asturias de la Asociación Mujeres en las Artes Visuales Contemporáneas (MAV) — LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial|access-date=2016-04-22|language=es|website=Laboralcentrodearte.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre of Documentation also preserves the historical memory of women's participation in the arts. It has created a chronological chart about art, woman and [[feminism]] in Spain and internationally.

==Projects==
Mujeres en las Artes Visuales improves the visibility of women in the arts and inform of their professional activities and productions on its [http://www.mav.org.es website];

Since 2012, it produce an online magazine call "M-Arte Y cultura visual".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mataderomadrid.org/ficha/4489/v-edicion-premios-mav.html|title=V EDICIÓN PREMIOS MAV|access-date=2016-04-22|website=MataderoMadrid.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exit-express.com/fallados-premios-mav/|title=Fallados premios MAV {{!}} Exit Express|access-date=2016-04-22|website=Exit-express.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through this magazine discusses issues about arts and the visual culture from a gender perspective".[http://www.m-arteyculturavisual.com]

One of the most important projects that MAV has generated is the "Women's gaze festival" (Festival Miradas de Mujeres).

'''''Big Eyes''''' is a 2014 American [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]], written by [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] and starring [[Amy Adams]] and [[Christoph Waltz]]. The film is about the life of American artist [[Margaret Keane]]—famous for drawing portraits and paintings with big eyes. It follows the story of Margaret and her husband, [[Walter Keane]], who took credit for Margaret's phenomenally successful and popular paintings in the 1950s and 1960s. It follows the lawsuit (and trial) between Margaret and Walter, after Margaret reveals she is the real artist behind the big eyes paintings.

''Big Eyes'' had its world premiere in New York City on December 15, 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvey Weinstein Praises 'Big Eyes' Screenwriters-Producers at Film's Premiere|url=https://variety.com/2014/scene/news/harvey-weinstein-sony-hacking-praises-screenwriters-at-big-eyes-premiere-1201380858/|website=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released on December 25, 2014 in the [[United States|U.S.]] by [[The Weinstein Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Conference For The Weinstein Company's "BIG EYES" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/photos/press-conference-weinstein-companys-big-20141212-184849-769.html |website=Yahoo |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216033416/http://news.yahoo.com/photos/press-conference-weinstein-companys-big-20141212-184849-769.html |archivedate=December 16, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was met with positive reviews, praising the performances of both Adams and Waltz, with Adams winning the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]]. Waltz was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his performance and [[Lana Del Rey]] received a Golden Globe nomination for the film's theme song "[[Big Eyes (song)|Big Eyes]]".

==Plot==
In 1958, [[Margaret Keane|Margaret Ulbrich]] leaves her husband and takes her young daughter Jane to [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]], [[San Francisco]]. Supporting her daughter alone, Margaret gets a job painting illustrations at a furniture factory. While creating portraits at an outdoor art show, Margaret meets [[Walter Keane]], who is selling his Parisian street scene paintings. Soon, Walter proposes to her and they marry.

Walter goes to a popular jazz club and tries to convince the club's owner, [[Enrico Banducci]], to purchase the couple's paintings. He only agrees to rent out the walls to Walter. A drunk woman is touched by one of Margaret's paintings and buys it. Walter fights with Banducci and ends up on the front page of the local newspaper. When Walter goes to the club again it is packed with curious people. Dick Nolan, a celebrity gossip columnist (who serves as the film's narrator), wants to know more about Walter's art, but is only interested in Margaret's paintings. Afterward, Walter shows Margaret all the money they have made from the sales. He tells her they are a great team: she can stay at home painting and he will sell her works.

Walter opens up his own Keane gallery, promoting the art as his own work, and sells reproductions. Margaret, however, is upset about Walter taking credit for her art, and feels guilty about lying to Jane about who is the real artist. Margaret decides to paint in a different style with elongated features and small eyes, so that she can honestly tell people she is also a painter.

Margaret and Walter move into a mansion. While going through a crate Margaret finds a stack of paintings of Parisian street scenes, but they are all signed by S. CENIC. She realizes Walter paints over the name of the original artist and claims the paintings as his own. When Margaret confronts Walter, he says he always wanted to be an artist, but never had the talent.

Walter learns of the [[1964 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] and demands Margaret paint something to put on display; she refuses and Walter threatens to have her killed. Jane discovers her mother working on the World's Fair painting ''Tomorrow Forever''. Jane tells her mother she always knew that she was the real artist.

At a party, Walter is angered after reading [[John Canaday]]'s scathing review of the ''Tomorrow Forever'' exhibit and confronts Canaday. Back at home, Walter starts drunkenly throwing lit matches at Margaret and Jane. They run into the studio and lock the door, but Walter nearly sets the house on fire. Margaret runs away with Jane.

One year later, Margaret and Jane have settled in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]]. Walter will not agree to a divorce unless Margaret signs over the rights to every painting, and produces 100 more. Margaret agrees and continues sending paintings to California. Margaret is visited by two [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] who convince her that honesty is important. The next time Walter receives the paintings, they are signed "MDH Keane". On a Hawaiian radio show, Margaret reveals she is the real artist behind the paintings attributed to Walter, making national news. Nolan publishes Walter's claims that Margaret has "gone nuts". Margaret sues both Walter and the newspapers that printed his version of the story for [[Defamation|libel and slander]].

At the trial, reporters swarm the courthouse in Honolulu. The judge immediately rules that Margaret's statements in the press have contributed to the public idea that Walter has painted the paintings, and as such dismisses the libel lawsuit against the newspapers. Since the libel suit only concerned the newspaper and its lawyers, Walter is left to defend himself against slander, even cross-examining himself as a "witness". The judge directs both Margaret and Walter to create a painting in one hour to prove who is the real artist. Margaret paints steadily, but Walter is hesitant, claiming his arm hurts too much to hold a paintbrush. Margaret completes her painting and wins the lawsuit. Outside the courthouse, Margaret says she doesn't care about money and just wants credit for her paintings. A fan asks her to sign a copy of ''Tomorrow's Masters'' and she does, finally autographing her own work.

The end credits then state that Margaret later retired in life and opened an Art Gallery, while Walter continued with his claim that he was the true artist but never produced anything to back this, and eventually died bitter and penniless.

Writers [[Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski]] negotiated over the life rights with [[Margaret Keane]], and wrote ''Big Eyes'' as a [[spec script]].

In September 2010, it was announced that [[Tim Burton]] had also become involved as producer for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike Fleming|title=Tim Burton Reunites With 'Ed Wood' Scribes For 'Addams Family' And 'Big Eyes'|url=http://deadline.com/2010/08/tim-burton-reunites-with-ed-wood-scribes-for-addams-family-and-big-eyes-62229|publisher=Deadline.com|date=2010-08-19|accessdate=2014-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography was scheduled to start in April 2012, with [[Reese Witherspoon]] and [[Ryan Reynolds]] attached to star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sneider, Jeff|url= https://variety.com/2012/film/news/witherspoon-reynolds-land-big-eyes-1118048991| title= Witherspoon, Reynolds land 'Big Eyes'|work=Variety|date=January 22, 2012|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2013, Burton had taken over directing and ''Big Eyes'' was set up at [[The Weinstein Company]], with Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz starring. Filming began in July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Fleming, Michael|title=Tim Burton To Direct 'Big Eyes'; The Weinstein Company Putting Finishing Brush Strokes On Deal For Painting Saga|url=http://deadline.com/2013/04/tim-burton-to-direct-big-eyes-the-weinstein-company-putting-finishing-brush-strokes-on-deal-for-painting-saga-466304|publisher=Deadline.com|date=April 2, 2013|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">The '''Chechen wolf''', or '''[[gray wolf]]''' ({{lang-ce|Borz}}, pronounced {{IPA-cau|bo̞ɾz|}} or {{IPA-cau|bwoɾz}}), is the national animal of the [[Chechen people|Chechen nation]].&lt;ref name=JaimoukhaWolf&gt;Jaimoukha, Amjad. ''The Chechens: A Handbook'', Caucasus World: Peoples of the Caucasus, Routledge; (2005), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Characteristics of the wolf are also frequently compared to the Chechen people in a poetic or metaphoric sense, e.g. as being "free and equal like wolves",&lt;ref&gt;Jaimoukha. (2005:83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gammer, Moshe. ''The Lone Wolf and the Bear: Three Centuries of Chechen Defiance of Russian Rule''. London 2006. Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya: The Case for Independence''. page 13.&lt;/ref&gt; or representing "courage and tenacity", compared to the British "[[stiff upper lip]]"  by Jaimoukha (2005).&lt;ref&gt;"According to the Chechen ethos, the wolf is the only animal that would enter into an unequal match, making up for any disadvantage by its agility, wit, courage and tenacity. If it loses the battle, it lies down facing the foe in full acceptance of its fate—Chechen poise equivalent to the famed British ‘stiff upper lip’." Jaimoukha. (2005:153)&lt;/ref&gt; The saying of a person having been "raised by the She-Wolf" expresses admirable personality traits.&lt;ref name=JaimoukhaWolf/&gt; Wolf clans are often equated to Chechen [[teip]]s (clans).

==Mythological==
There is one myth that the mythological founder of the Chechen nation, Turpalo-Noxchuo (Chechen Hero, who Chechens are descended from "like sparks of steel"), was raised by a fabled, loving "Wolf Mother". Old Chechen lore holds that the sheep was actually originally created for the wolf to enjoy, but man "stole" the sheep from the wolf (this is rather interesting considering that many Chechens in the past have in fact been shepherds). According to the ethnographic historian Jaimoukha, in olden times Chechens used to observe a wolf cult that would prevent lupine raids on sheep, by observing Saturday as being a special day.&lt;ref name=JaimoukhaWolf/&gt;

==In insignia and symbols==
[[Image:На̇хчиє къо̇ма Хјуост.png|thumb|Chechen ([[Ichkeria]]n) seal bearing a wolf, the nation's symbolic embodiment]]

The wolf is frequently used for insignia and images, as a symbol of the Chechen nation. Common poses involve the wolf howling off the top of a mountain (Chechnya is very mountainous), laying down, or staring at the viewer. The different poses evoke different symbolism: 
*The wolf howling off the top of the mountain is usually an expression of national pride. In the period of 1991-1994, broadcasts in independent Chechnya bore this symbol,&lt;ref&gt;Henze, Paul B; in collaboration with Tishkov, Valery. ''Islam in the North Caucasus: the Example of Chechenia''. Originally completed September 1993, "somewhat updated", released May 1995. Available from website www.circassianworld.com in pdf form here: [http://www.circassianworld.com/pdf/Henze_Islam_NorthCaucasus.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; in that case symbolizing the struggle for national recognition. The symbol is also used by Chechens nowadays as a simple expression of being proud they are Chechen.
*The wolf lying down, facing the viewer is usually a reference to the mythological "Wolf Mother" of Turpalo-Noxchuo.
*Staring at the viewer usually evokes a feeling of intense emotion that the artist is implying they believe is felt by the Chechen nation.

Modernly, the coat of arms of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|secular separatists]]  in Chechnya bore the wolf. The [[Caucasus Emirate|Islamists]] later removed it and replaced it with Arabic script, and the Russian-sponsored ruling regime removed it entirely, but the secular government in exile still uses it. In addition, many other insignia of the Chechen nation (of all three governments) use the wolf as a heraldic symbol.

==In naming==
*The gun manufactured by the Chechen separatists in the two Chechen wars was called the [[Borz]], after the wolf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iwpr.net/?p=crs&amp;s=f&amp;o=161041&amp;apc_state=henicrs2004 |title=Chechnya’s Homemade Weapons Fuel War |publisher=Iwpr.net |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cold North Killers: Canadian Serial Murder''''' is a 2012 Canadian non-fiction book written by [[Lee Mellor]]&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://hpr1.com/index.php/feature/news/looking-for-another-indian-girl-to-kill/|title = Looking for Another Indian Girl to Kill|last = Hagen|first = C.S.|publisher = ''[[High Plains Reader]]''|date = 7 September 2017|website = hpr1.com|accessdate = 19 August 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.therecord.com/news-story/7988478-lawlor-may-have-killed-more-than-twice-profiler-says/|title = Lawlor may have killed more than twice, profiler says|last = Paul|first = Gordon|publisher = ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]''|date = 9 December 2017|website = therecord.com|accessdate = 19 August 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Dundurn Press]]. It documents the lives of sixty Canadian [[serial killer]]s, with the earliest being [[Edward H.

== Background ==

While bedridden with illness in 2009, Mellor occupied his time by writing a novel about an [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|RCMP]] [[Offender profiling|criminal profiler's]] hunt for a serial killer terrorizing Canada, but partway into the story, Mellor realized that he had very little knowledge of any actual Canadian serial killers beyond [[Clifford Olson]], [[Paul Bernardo]], [[Karla Homolka]], and [[Robert Pickton]]. While looking up other cases, Mellor, inspired by both the lack of a single comprehensive source regarding serial murder in Canada and the high-profile arrest of [[Russell Williams (criminal)|Russell Williams]] in 2010, decided to abandon his original idea for a book in favor of new one, an encyclopedia about serial homicide in Canada.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/02/13/qa-with-lee-mellor-author-of-cold-north-killers/|title = Q&amp;A with Lee Mellor, author of ''Cold North Killers''|publisher = [[Internet Archive]]|website = definingcanada.ca|accessdate = 14 August 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140314102744/http://www.definingcanada.ca/2012/02/13/qa-with-lee-mellor-author-of-cold-north-killers/|archivedate = 14 March 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pod"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.saultstar.com/2012/03/12/book-on-serial-killers-touches-on-local-murders|title = Book on serial killers touches on local murders|last = Della-Mattia|first = Elaine|publisher = ''[[Sault Star]]''|date = 12 March 2012|website = saultstar.com|accessdate = 14 August 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Mellor researched seventy-five cases for the book, but at the behest of the editors at [[Dundurn Press]] reduced the number of them included in it to sixty due to spatial constraints. Mellor later included two of the excised cases—the [[Montreal]] child murders of 1981-92 and the "[[Nahanni National Park Reserve|Headless Valley]]" murders 1908-46—in the third issue of his [[online magazine]] ''Serial Killer Quarterly''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite magazine|author = Lee Mellor|title = Introduction to Unsolved in North America|magazine = Serial Killer Quarterly|location = Canada|publisher = Grinning Man Press|date = Summer 2014|language = English|volume = 1|issue = 3|page = }} &lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

Each of the book's four sections cover different aspects of serial murder, and are divided into chapters that are each about a different Canadian serial killer. In-between each section are passages relating to [[Russell Williams (criminal)|Russell Williams]], who was active and arrested in the same area where Mellor was residing while he was in the process of writing ''Cold North Killers''.

The first section showcases four of Canada's earliest serial killers—[[Edward H. Rulloff]], Joseph LaPage, [[Theodore Durrant]], and [[Wineville Chicken Coop Murders|Gordon Stewart Northcott]]—and then delves into the [[nature versus nurture]] debate by scrutinizing the lives of [[Russell Maurice Johnson|Russell Johnson]], Doug Moore, [[Peter Woodcock]], and [[Clifford Olson]]. [[Modus operandi]] and [[signature crime]] are then discussed by looking into the crimes committed by [[Léopold Dion]], [[William Patrick Fyfe]], [[Earle Nelson]], Serge Archambault, Sam Pirrera, and William Dean Christenson, with [[victimology]] then being explored through examination of [[John Martin Crawford]], Donald Sherman Staley, and [[Allan Legere]], as well as the unsolved Toronto gay village murders of 1967-68 and the [[Highway of Tears murders]] of 1969-2011.

The next section begins with a focus on the three different categories of serial killer: organized, [[Disorganized offender|disorganized]], and mixed (someone who displays both organized and disorganized traits). Angelo Colalillo and David Threinen are used as examples of organized offenders, Braeden Nugent and Carl Hall as examples of disorganized offenders, and Donald Armstrong and Danny Wood as examples of mixed offenders. Next, sub-categories are explored, beginning with  "[[Serial killer#Visionary|visionary]]" killer [[Peter Woodcock#Imprisonment|Bruce Hamill]] followed by "[[Serial killer#Mission-oriented|missionary]]" killer Ronald Sears, and then the three varieties of "[[Serial killer#Hedonistic|hedonist]]" killer; Henry Williams and Christian Magee are presented as instances of "hedonist-[[Lust serial killers|lust]]" killers, James Greenidge and [[Michael Wayne McGray]] as "hedonist-[[Thrill killing|thrill]]" killers, and [[insurance fraud]]sters Charles Kembo and Sukhwinder Dhillon, "black widow" [[Melissa Ann Shepard]], and [[Baby farming|baby farmers]] [[Lila and William Young]] as "hedonist-[[Serial killer#Comfort (profit)|comfort]]" killers. After chapters on "[[Serial killer#Power/control|power/control]]" killers David Snow&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.orangeville.com/news-story/8090086--tbt-remembering-orangeville-murderer-david-snow-who-police-dubbed-the-house-hermit/|title = #TBT: Remembering Orangeville murderer David Snow, who police dubbed the House Hermit|last = Halliday|first = Chris|publisher = ''Orangeville Banner''|date = 24 January 2018|website = orangeville.com|accessdate = 19 August 2018}} &lt;/ref&gt; and [[Keith Hunter Jesperson]], the section concludes with passages on "[[Angel of mercy (criminology)|angels of death]]" [[Thomas Neill Cream]] and Robert MacGregor.

The third section centers around techniques that are used by the authorities to help them investigate serial killers. [[Offender profiling]] was employed in the Brian Arp, [[Paul Bernardo]], and the still-unsolved Edmonton serial killer cases, while advances in DNA analysis resulted in cold case murders being positively attributed to Ronald West, [[Gerald Thomas Archer]], and Alan Craig MacDonald. Crime-solving methods pioneered by Canada are then showcased; [[metal detector]]s were used to uncover Michael Vescio's discarded shell [[Cartridge (firearms)|casings]] in what was the first instance of the devices being used to assist with a criminal investigation, while bite-mark analysis was used to help convict [[Wayne Boden]] in what was one of the earliest usages of [[forensic dentistry]] in North America. In 1998, [[Kim Rossmo]] used [[geographic profiling]] to discern the presence of a serial killer operating in Vancouver's [[Downtown Eastside]]. Rossmo's data, which the [[Vancouver Police Department]] refused to look into, was later vindicated by the arrest of [[Robert Pickton]] in 2002.

The first half of the book's final section is dedicated to discussing violence against Canadian sex workers, and how many of their deaths seemingly go unreported and under-investigated, possibly due to both their profession and the fact that many of them are [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Aborogine]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/the-taken-who-qualifies-as-a-serial-killer-and-more-on-the-data-behind-the-project/article27443307/|title = The Taken: Who qualifies as a serial killer and more on the data behind the project|last1 = McClearn|first1 = Matthew|last2 = Blaze Baum|first2 = Kathryn|publisher = ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''|date = 23 November 2015|website = theglobeandmail.com|accessdate = 9 April 2017}} &lt;/ref&gt; The cases examined here are all unsolved ones, and include the [[Sasquatch Mountain Resort|Hemlock Valley]] murders of 1995, the Calgary prostitute murders of 1991-93, the Prostitutes-in-the-Lake killings of 1994-97, and the Niagara prostitute murders of 1995-2006. The second half of the section presents six cases ([[Karla Homolka]], Allan Sweeney, Melvin Stanton, Paul Cecil Gillis, Michael Hector, and [[Gilbert Paul Jordan]]) that Mellor regards as having been notably "botched" in some way, such as through investigative, judicial, or bureaucratic incompetence, apathy, or [[red tape]]. The concluding chapter consists of brief write-ups on Noel Winters, Allan George Foster, Paul Alan Hachey, Raymond Russell, Donald Falkner, Davey Mato Butorac, Camille Cleroux, [[Cody Legebokoff]], and Mark Garfield Moore, all offenders who did not receive longer entries in the book due to either a lack of easily accessible information about their crimes, or because the murders that they committed were only unearthed while the book was undergoing its final editing phase.

== Controversy ==

The [[Vancouver Public Library]] sent their copy of ''Cold North Killers'' to the hate-speech squad at the [[Vancouver Police Department]] for analyses in 2013 after receiving complaints about its content from a concerned citizen, who wrote, "There is no educational benefit in introducing a 10-year-old child who might pick this book up... to the ideas contained in it." The authorities concluded that there was nothing illegal about the book's content, and the Vancouver Public Library subsequently issued the formal statement, "This work is disturbing to read, but this does not affect the library's obligation to protect the right of a citizen to read this book."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.theprovince.com/news/What+THAT+book+doing+library+Seuss+among+authors+targeted+removal/9828476/story.html|title = What's THAT book doing in the library?

{{Refimprove|date=February 2017}}
'''Copywriting''' is the act of writing text for the purpose of advertising or other forms of [[marketing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/copywriter|title=copywriter {{!}} Definition of copywriter in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product, called [[Copy (written)|copy]], is written content that aims to increase [[brand awareness]] and ultimately persuade a person or group to take a particular action.

Copywriters help create [[Billboard (advertising)|billboards]], [[brochure]]s, [[Mail order|catalogs]], [[jingle]] [[lyrics]], [[magazine]] and [[newspaper]] advertisements, [[sales letter]]s and other [[direct mail]], scripts for [[television]] or [[radio]] commercials, [[tagline]]s, [[white papers]], [[social media]] posts, and other [[marketing communications]].

They are generally known as [[website content writer]]s or copywriters if their work appears mostly on the [[Internet]]. A content writer helps create [[Online advertising|online advertisements]], [[web page]]s, [[email]] newsletters, [[blog]] posts and [[social media]] posts.

Cross discipline copywriters who look at the wider context of their work are called '''digital copywriters'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alldaycreative.co.uk/blog/essential-skills-every-digital-copywriter-needs/|title=Essential skills every digital copywriter needs|author=|date=2 March 2011|website=alldaycreative.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is that these individuals consider the mechanics of the [[user journey]], the [[external links]] that are included in the copy for [[search engine optimization]] and are highly focused towards creating online [[sales]] and dealing with technical issues such as [[bounce rate]].

==Employment==
Many copywriters are employed in [[advertising agency|advertising agencies]], [[public relations]] firms, or [[copywriting agency|copywriting agencies]].

*'''Advertising agencies''' usually employ copywriters as part of a creative team in which they are partnered with [[Art director|art directors]] or [[Creative director|creative directors]]. The copywriter writes copy or script for an advertisement, based largely on information obtained from the client. The art director is responsible for visual aspects of the advertisement and, particularly in the case of print work, may oversee production. Either member of the team can come up with the overall idea (typically referred to as the concept) and the process of collaboration often improves the work.
*'''Copywriting agencies''' combine copywriting with a range of editorial and associated services that may include positioning and messaging consulting, social media, [[search engine optimization]], developmental editing, [[copy editing]], [[proofreading]], [[fact checking]], [[Page layout|layout]] and [[design]]. The clients are usually large corporations.

Copywriters also work in-house for retail chains, book publishers or other big firms which advertise frequently. They can also be employed to write [[advertorial]]s for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[Broadcasting|broadcasters]] and cable providers.

Some copywriters work as [[independent contractor]]s, doing [[freelance]] writing for a variety of clients. They may work at a client's office, a [[coworking]] office, a [[coffeehouse]], or from home.

Copywriters are similar to [[technical writer]]s and the careers may overlap. Broadly speaking, however, technical writing is dedicated to informing readers rather than persuading them. For example, a copywriter writes an advertisement to sell a car, while a technical writer writes the operator's manual explaining how to use it.

==Formats==
===Book publishing===
In [[Publishing|book publishing]], ''flap copy'' or ''jacket flap copy'' is the summary of a book which appears on the inside of a hardcover dust jacket; ''back cover copy'' is similar text, usually briefer, on the outside back cover; and ''catalog copy'' is a summary written for a publisher's catalog.

===Internet===
{{further|Content marketing|Web content development}}
The Internet has expanded the range of copywriting opportunities to include [[landing page]]s and other web content, online advertisements, emails, blogs, social media and other forms of electronic communications.

The Internet has brought new opportunities for copywriters to learn their craft, do research and view others' work. Clients, copywriters and art directors can more readily find each other, making freelancing a viable job option.

====Search engine optimization====

Web copy may include among its objectives the achievement of higher [[PageRank|rankings]] in [[search engine]]s. Known as "organic" search engine optimization (SEO), this involves the [[strategy|strategic]] placement and [[wikt:repetition|repetition]] of [[Index term|keyword]]s and keyword phrases on web pages, writing in a manner that human readers would consider normal.

The '''Cordoba Treasure''', or ''Tesoro de Córdoba'' in [[Spanish Language|Spanish]], is the name of a major [[Iron Age]] silver hoard found on the outskirts of the city of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]], Spain in 1915. The entire treasure was purchased by the [[British Museum]] in 1932, where it has been on public display ever since.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=6457&amp;plaA=6457-3-1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/c/cordoba_treasure.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The hoard of silver objects was found by chance in 1915 at Molino de Marrubial, a suburb of the city of Córdoba in the province of [[Andalucia]], Spain. The treasure had been buried in a pit for safe-keeping, but was never retrieved by its original owners. The Cordoba Treasure eventually came into the possession of the [[United States of America|American]] art collector Walter Hildburgh, who sold it to the British Museum in 1932. The treasure is one of the few Iron Age hoards from the [[Iberian Peninsular]] to be in the collection of a museum outside [[Spain]] or [[Portugal]].

==Description==
The hoard dates from the Iron Age and was probably buried around 100 BC. Even though this part of Spain had recently been conquered to become part of the [[Roman Empire]], the style of [[jewellery]] reflects [[Celts|Celtic]] aesthetic traditions. The silver treasure includes a large circular [[torc]] with terminals in the form of double cones, eight armlets with [[zoomorphic]] relief decoration, a [[brooch]] in the shape of two horses' heads, a conical bowl, over three hundred coins, two lumps of silver and other miscellaneous objects including rods and [[ingots]]. The [[coins]] enable archaeologists to date the treasure, as 82 of them were locally made and 222 were [[Mint (coin)|minted]] in a Roman city.

==Reason for burial==
It remains unclear why the [[hoard]] was never recovered by the person or people by whom it was buried. The large amount of [[silver]] in the treasure could have meant that its owner planned to melt it down at one stage, but for some reason was unable to. Others have suggested it could have been a [[votive offering]], following native practices.

[[File:De Balneis Puteolanis MS 1474 Biblioteca Angelica de Rome 3.jpg|thumb|Illumination from ''De balneis Puteolanis'' -late 13th century manuscript, MS 1474, [[Biblioteca Angelica]] in Rome]]

'''''De balneis Puteolanis''''' ("On the baths of Pozzuoli") is a medieval didactic poem in Latin, attributed to [[Peter of Eboli]], describing the thermal baths of [[Pozzuoli]] in the [[Campi Flegrei]] region of [[Campania]]. The poem has the alternative title '''''De balneis terrae laboris'''''.

The poem in thirty-five epigrams was written in the last decade of the twelfth century, probably in 1197. It is dedicated to the emperor ("Cesaris ad laudem"), probably [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]]. The author "reports every detail about more than thirty different thermal sites in the Campi Flegrei, including all therapeutic effects of their waters."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15293539 Mezzogiorno et al. (2004). "Pietro Anzolino da Eboli and the thermal therapy of renal pathologies". J Nephrol. 2004 Mar-Apr;17(2):329-33. PMID: 15293539.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution to [[Peter of Eboli]] ''(Petrus de Ebulo)'' is generally made "with some certainty", although some historians associate it with the work of Sicilian physician [[Alcadino di Siracusa]].&lt;ref&gt;Fulvio Delle Donne, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/pietro-da-eboli_(Federiciana)/ "Pietro da Eboli"], ''Enciclopedia Federiciana'', Vol. II, Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana Treccani&lt;/ref&gt;

''De balneis Puteolanis'' was popular in its time and survives in a number of manuscript versions. It was also translated into vernacular languages and was issued in 12 editions in print, from 1457 to 1607.

Many surviving manuscript versions are especially notable for their accompanying illustrations of medieval [[bathing]].

Many of the thermal baths described in the Pozzuoli region were destroyed in the 1538 volcanic eruption which transformed the landscape of the Campi Flegrei caldera and created [[Monte Nuovo]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3087">'''Design controls''' designates the application of a formal [[Design management|methodology]] to the conduct of [[new product development|product development]] activities.
It is often mandatory (by regulation) to implement such practice when designing and developing products within regulated industries (e.g. [[medical devices]]).

== Medical devices ==

Since 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has required that [[medical device]] manufacturers that want to market certain categories of medical devices in the USA follow Design Control requirements (21 CFR 820.30). At a high level, this regulation requires:
* [[Design and development planning]]
* [[Design input]], including intended use and [[Voice of the customer|user needs]] (also known as customer attributes)
* [[Design output]], including evaluation of conformance to design input requirements through:
** Design verification confirming that the design output meets the design input requirements ("did we design the device right?")
** Design validation ensuring that the devices conform to defined user needs and intended uses ("did we design the right device?")
* [[Design review]]
* [[Design transfer]] ensuring that the device design is correctly translated into production specifications
* [[Design change|Design changes]]
* [[Design history file]], a demonstration that the design was developed according to the approved design plan and 21 CFR 820.30.

The [[Medical Devices Directive]] (MDD 93/42/EEC) similarly lists several requirements regarding the design of a medical device.
'''[[ISO 13485]]''' is a voluntary standard that contains section 7.3 Design and Development recommending which procedures should be put in place by manufacturers in order to have a quality system that will comply with MDD 93/42/EEC.

The objective of Design Controls, in this context, is to require that manufacturers follow a methodologically-sound process to develop a medical device, with the intent of improving the probability that the device will reach an acceptable level of [[efficacy]] and safety.

The [[kylix]] depicting athletic combats is a ceramic drinking cup made approximately in the late [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] period, 490 B.C., in [[Attica]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; It is currently in the Museum of Fine Arts Boston as part of The Ancient World Collections.&lt;ref name =ref1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/drinking-cup-kylix-depicting-athletic-combats-153754|title=Drinking cup (kylix) depicting athletic combats|date=2017-09-14|work=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2017-10-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist, Onesimos, uses red-figure technique for the decoration. [[Red-figure pottery|Red-figure]] technique was invented in Athens around 530 B.C. and quickly became one of the leading modes of decoration Athenian potters used.&lt;ref name =Author&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/vase/hd_vase.htm|title=Athenian Vase Painting: Black- and Red-Figure Techniques {{!}} Essay {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|last=Art|first=Author: Department of Greek and Roman|website=The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red-figure technique was favored because it allowed for a greater representation of garments, emotions and anatomy making it useful for artists, such as Onesimos, to use in painting athletic events.&lt;ref name =Author/&gt;

== Onesimos ==
[[Onesimos (vase painter)|Onesimos]] was an artist who worked in Athens from 500-480 B.C.&lt;ref name=Getty1&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/56/onesimos-greek-attic-active-500-480-bc/|title=Onesimos (Greek (Attic), active 500 - 480 B.C.)

He almost exclusively painted cups and he favored realistic portrayals of the human body often painting athletic events and other activities that allowed for him to depict active poses.&lt;ref name="Onesimos - Oxford Reference"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Onesimos - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0702?rskey=IDDXGr&amp;result=703|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195300826.001.0001/acref-9780195300826-e-0702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pancration Foul Scene by the Foundry Painter
]]
The exterior sides of this kylix holds depictions for two athletic events: the [[Pankration|pancration]] and a wrestling match. The pancration was a popular athletic event in Ancient Greece and was introduced in 648 BCE to the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=Nenova&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/pankration/|title=Pankration|last=Nenova|first=Stella|date=February 9, 2016|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word pancration can be broken down into ''pan'' meaning all and ''kratos'' meaning strength or power and it was a form of ancient martial arts that combined both wrestling and boxing.&lt;ref name=Nenova/&gt; In Onesimos' depiction of the pancration there are two young boys wrestling, their youth evident from their lack of facial hair, and there are two trainers, one on either side of the them. One trainer is standing and the other is sitting next to a column that is holding what appears to be a prize cauldron.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; There is also another young boy standing next to the standing trainer. Scenes of the pancration were common among red-figure vessels depicting athletic events as is seen by the pancration scene by the Foundry Painter.

The other athletic event depicted is boxing. There are also two young boys with no facial hair engaged in the athletic act with the one on the left facing frontally towards the viewer. They being observed by a trainer on the left with a staff and staves in his hand and another young boy on the right. The boy standing on the right observing the young boxers appears to be in a stance of measuring the field and is also a mirror image of the boy observing in the pancration scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4171628|title=Masterpieces of Greek Vase Painting, about 1900 B.C.-340 B.C|last=Vermeule|first=Cornelius C.|date=1980|journal=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the background around the scene there are different objects that would typically be used in athletic events such as a two mattocks, a discus bag which appears to be on a wall, and jumping weights.&lt;ref name =ref1/&gt;

The tondo or the interior of this kylix holds an image on a youth holding a hare. His face is frontal facing the viewer and he is wearing a himation or a cloak around his shoulders and there is a walking stick in the background.&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

== Inscriptions ==
On the pancration scene there is one inscription that reads "Panaitios kalos" which is translated to "Panaitios is handsome".&lt;ref name =ref1/&gt; In many of his [[kalos inscription]]s, Onesimos uses the name Panaitios which misled many to believe that there was a Panaitios Painter whose work was earlier than Onesimos. It is now accepted, however, that the Panaitos Painter and Onesimos are the same.&lt;ref name="Onesimos - Oxford Reference"/&gt; In the boxing scene there are two inscriptions; one reading "Lukos kalos" or "Lykos is handsome" and the other on the discus bag reading "Kalos" or "handsome".&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt; The final inscription is found in the tondo and it reads "Ho pais kalos" or "The boy is handsome".&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

== Connection between kylixes and athletic training ==
Greek kylixes and other vessels during the Archaic period frequently depicted activities such as athletic training events that were favored by their users, the majority of which where part of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/10928/attributed-to-carpenter-painter-attic-red-figure-kylix-greek-attic-510-500-bc/|title=Attic Red-Figure Kylix (Getty Museum)|website=The J. Paul Getty in Los Angeles|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kylixes where often used at [[symposium]]s which were all male drinking parties. Symposiums were considered an integral part of Greek culture and was an activity reserved for only the most elite of society.&lt;ref name=symp&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Symposium/|title=Symposium|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was held in a private home where the men would get together to drink, eat, sing and discuss various topics such as philosophy and politics; the only women who were allowed to attend were high-class entertainers. It was an activity that served to reinforce the status and bond of the aristocracy.&lt;ref name=symp/&gt; Athletic events were also an important part of Greek culture as they believed in the importance of training their bodies just as much as they trained their minds.&lt;ref name=FAQ6&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Olympics/faq6.html|title=Ancient Olympic FAQ 6|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grecian youths of elite families would train under athletic trainers at a [[palaestra]] or a wrestling school.&lt;ref name=FAQ6/&gt; These training sessions where a key part of youth socialization in society.&lt;ref name="getty.edu"/&gt;

'''''Glory Road''''' is a 2006 American [[Sports film|sports]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by James Gartner, based on a true story surrounding the events leading to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship]] (the historic name for what is now known as the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]). [[Don Haskins]] portrayed by [[Josh Lucas]], head coach of [[University of Texas at El Paso|Texas Western College]], coached [[1965–66 Texas Western Miners basketball team|a team]] with an all-[[African Americans|black]] starting lineup, a first in [[NCAA]] history. ''Glory Road'' explores racism, discrimination, and student athletics. Supporting actors [[Jon Voight]] and [[Derek Luke (actor)|Derek Luke]] also star in principal roles.

The film was a co-production between the motion picture studios of [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Jerry Bruckheimer Films]], Texas Western Productions, and Glory Road Productions. It was commercially distributed by Buena Vista Pictures theatrically and by the Buena Vista Home Entertainment division for the video rental market. It premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on January 13, 2006, grossing $42,938,449 in box office business despite generally mixed reviews from critics. ''Glory Road'' was nominated for a number of awards including the [[Humanitas Prize]]; the film won the 2006 [[ESPY Award]] for ''Best Sports Movie''.

On January 10, 2006, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the [[Hollywood Records]] music label. The soundtrack was composed and orchestrated by musician [[Trevor Rabin]]. The DVD release, featuring theatrical trailers, extended interviews with players and colleagues of coach Haskins, and deleted scenes, among other highlights, was released in the U.S. on June 6, 2006.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Newly appointed men's basketball coach Don Haskins gets a new job at Texas Western College in [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]]. Lacking necessary financial resources, he makes an effort to recruit the best players regardless of race to form a team that can compete for a national championship. Some of the young men he brings in possess skill, but are raw in talent when it comes to organized teamwork focusing on defense and ball distribution. In the end, his Texas Western Miners team comprises seven black and five white athletes; a balance that raises eyebrows among university personnel. Haskins puts his players through a rigorous training program, threatening to cut anyone who doesn't work as hard as he demands, while trying to integrate his players into a single team with a common goal.

Following initial victories against mediocre local teams, Haskins quickly discovers that he has to give his black players more free room on the court. Yet, the more victories his team achieves with its flamboyant style, up until this point rarely seen in college basketball, the more racial hatred mounts on his squad. This culminates in threats to his own family, the beating of a player while on the road and ultimately the vandalism of his team's motel rooms by racists while they are at an away game. Increasingly frightened, the team loses its last game of the regular season after the black players stop playing with passion. Thus, the Texas Western Miners finish the 1965-66 regular season with a 23–1 record, entering the 1966 NCAA tournament ranked third in the nation.

Going on to the [[1966 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game|NCAA final]], played at [[College Park, Maryland]], they take on the top-ranked [[1965–66 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|University of Kentucky]] under legendary coach, [[Adolph Rupp]]. Rupp, with a well-organized and more experienced all-white [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]] squad, firmly believes that his opponent stands no chance. On the eve of the decisive game, Haskins decides to experiment with a bold strategy, informing his team that he intends to start an all-black lineup in the game, and also only using the two other black players in the rotation.

In the midst of seemingly insurmountable odds, Texas Western encounters mounting problems with [[forward (basketball)|forward]] and team captain Harry Flournoy leaving the game with an injury, and their center David Lattin in foul trouble. In a close game, the Miners narrowly lead at halftime, but finally manage to beat Kentucky 72–65 with some impressive [[steal (basketball)|steals]], rebounding and passing techniques in the second half. The film ends with the players exiting the plane that brought them back to El Paso to the greeting of a raucous crowd.

==Production==

===Development===

''Glory Road'' was inspired by a true story, as described by Texas Western's head coach [[Don Haskins]] in his autobiography of the same title, a national bestseller released in 2005 by [[Hyperion Books]]. The book details Haskins' early life as a player (including a one-on-one game against a black friend that opened his eyes) and women's basketball coach. Like the film, it then focuses on the 1966 Texas Western men's basketball team and the aftermath of the championship. It was reprinted five times in its first four months of release and was selected as an "Editor's Choice" by the New York Times Book Review. Additionally, ''Glory Road'' is the name of a street on the UTEP campus near the [[Sun Bowl]] which was renamed to commemorate the 1966 NCAA championship.

Later asked about his decision to start five black players, Haskins downplayed the significance of his decision. "I really didn't think about starting five black guys. I just wanted to put my five best guys on the court. I just wanted to win the game."&lt;ref&gt;Limón, Iliana. [http://www.abqtrib.com/albq/sports/article/0,2564,ALBQ_19879_4382982,00.html "Ex-Miners coach Don Haskins wasn't playing the hero during a racially charged 1966 championship, but Hollywood doesn't seem to mind."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403063757/http://www.abqtrib.com/albq/sports/article/0%2C2564%2CALBQ_19879_4382982%2C00.html |date=2007-04-03 }} ''Albuquerque Tribune''. 11 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Though credited with setting in motion the [[desegregation]] of college basketball teams in the [[American South|South]], he wrote in his book "I certainly did not expect to be some racial pioneer or change the world."&lt;ref&gt;Haskins, Don with Dan Wetzel. ''Glory Road''. New York:Hyperion, 2006. {{ISBN|1-4013-0791-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunking was banned in the NCAA from 1967 to 1976, not least due to the success of the Texas Western team and a UCLA player named Lew Alcindor (better known later as [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]]) then entering the league.

Next to the [[closing credits]], scenes from interviews with some of the real-life players from the team are shown, including one player from the opposing [[University of Kentucky]] team beaten by Texas Western in the NCAA finals, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] head coach [[Pat Riley]]. The real-life Don Haskins was cast as an extra in the film as a gas station attendant, and David Lattin was cast as an extra as a military bartender.

The players on the 1966 team were [[David Lattin]], [[Bobby Joe Hill]], [[Willie Cager]], [[Willie Worsley]], Jerry Armstrong, [[Orsten Artis]], [[Nevil Shed]], [[Harry Flournoy]], Togo Railey, Louis Baudoin, Dick Myers,and David Palacio.
The team was nominated in its entirety for the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]], and was inducted on September 7, 2007, ten years after coach Don Haskins had already been enshrined.

The movie skipped a crucial game that Texas Western had played. On March 18, 1966, the Miners defeated Utah 85-78 in the Final Four to advance to the national championship game the following night. In the movie the team played against Kansas in the regional final and the following game was the national championship, which is incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/postseason/1966-ncaa.html|title=1966 NCAA Tournament Summary - College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com|website=College Basketball at Sports-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
Several scenes in this movie were filmed at the [[University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP), which is the former Texas Western College, and [[El Paso High School]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. Other scenes were filmed at [[Southeastern Louisiana University]] in [[Hammond, Louisiana]], [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]] and Douglas High School, formerly F. T. Nicholls High School, in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], and [[Chalmette High School]] in [[Chalmette, Louisiana]]. The [[IHOP]] scene was filmed in the old Airline Motors Diner on [[Airline Highway]] just west of New Orleans. The school shown for the girls' basketball game in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] at the beginning of the film is actually the front of El Paso High School, as shown by the engraving on the top of the columns. The lunchroom basketball trash can scene was filmed at Booker T. Washington High School, the first high school built in New Orleans for African-Americans. Towards the beginning of the film for the shot of Texas Western College, the [[Wells Fargo Plaza (El Paso)|Wells Fargo Plaza]] and the Chase Bank Building in downtown El Paso can be seen in the top left corner. The Wells Fargo Plaza was not completed until 1971, and the Chase Bank Building was still the Texas Commerce Bank building until the early 1990s. In addition, [[Ralph Strangis]] (the former [[Dallas Stars]] play-by-play announcer) had a small speaking role as a courtside broadcaster. [[Ben Affleck]] was the original choice for the role of coach Don Haskins, but had to drop out of the filming due to prior commitments. [[NBA]] point guard [[Kirk Hinrich]] was offered a role in the film, but chose not to participate "because of time constraints".&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Smith (journalist)|Sam Smith]]. "Skiles lauds Chandler's play; Coach calls game 7-footer's best yet". ''Chicago Tribune''. November 21, 2005. Sports, pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

During the scene of the Texas Western-[[Seattle Redhawks men's basketball|Seattle University]] basketball game broadcast the announcers inadvertently used the call letters [[WTSM]], which is an  FM radio sports station from Tallahassee, Florida instead of the El Paso station [[KTSM-AM]].

===Controversy===
Kentucky Wildcat fans and other Rupp supporters said the film at least implicitly portrayed UK coach Adolph Rupp as a racist, with such lines as Bobby Joe Hill's that Rupp would not have recruited him. Like other teams in the Southeastern Conference, Kentucky was indeed all-white, but they were the first (and for about a decade, the only) SEC team to regularly play (inter-conference) opponents with black players (starting in the 1950s) and, in fact, took the place of Alabama (1956) and Mississippi State (1959, 1961) in the NCAA Tournament after their respective state legislatures and/or university leadership refused the invitations because of the possibility of playing against integrated squads.[http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html#evidencepro] Starting in 1964, Rupp had recruited Kentuckians [[Wes Unseld]] and [[Butch Beard]] along with eight other black players who received formal scholarship offers before [[Tom Payne (basketball)|Tom Payne]] in 1969 became UK's first black player.[http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/rupp.html#evidencepro] But while doing so he told them (just as [[Branch Rickey]] did to [[Jackie Robinson]] about the racial difficulties they could expect in playing in the SEC and Unseld and Beard went to [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]] instead. 

In the game between [[Texas A&amp;M–Commerce Lions men's basketball|East Texas State University]], now known as [[Texas A&amp;M University–Commerce]], and Texas Western, East Texas State fans are shown throwing popcorn and drinks, and yelling [[racial epithet]]s. In a later scene, racial slurs are shown painted onto the hotel rooms of the black Texas Western players. After verification that the events never took place, Texas A&amp;M–Commerce asked for an apology from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] and the makers of the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-baskbl/stories/021006aey.html ''Texas A&amp;M-Commerce Wants Apology For Glory Road Movie Portrayal'']. CSTV.com, Published 2006-02-10. Accessed 2007-05-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Disney did not directly apologize; rather, it explained that the movie was not a documentary and that it had been necessary to consolidate events given the time limitations of the film, and that Disney did not intentionally set out to misrepresent any group and was sorry for any misunderstanding.&lt;ref name=AMcommerce&gt;[http://www.tamu-commerce.edu/mrp/pdf/today/03-01-06.pdf Underdue Murph heads enrollment/marketing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717134828/http://www.tamu-commerce.edu/mrp/pdf/today/03-01-06.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }}. Texas A&amp;M University Commerce. Retrieved 2013-02-13.&lt;/ref&gt; The President of Texas A&amp;M–Commerce said that, given the way the school was shown in the film, it was hard to believe that Disney could plausibly argue that the portrayal of the school was unintentional.&lt;ref name="AMcommerce"/&gt; The scene even prompted the Texas state senate to consider a bill which would allow financial assistance from the state to be withheld for films that portray the state negatively.&lt;ref&gt;Fikac, Peggy.

'''Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda''' is [[National treasures of South Korea|National Treasure of Korea]] No. 86.  It was designated by the South Korean government on December 20, 1962.  

An inscription on the first story of the pagoda states that it was erected in the fourth year of [[Chungmok of Goryeo|King Chungmok]] in 1348.  The pagoda was first placed at the now-lost Gyeongcheonsa Temple which sat at the foot of Mt. Buso in Gwangdeok-myeon, Gaepung-gun, [[Gyeonggi-do]] Province.  During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation of Korea]], the pagoda was taken to Japan. In 1960, the pagoda was returned and placed on the grounds of [[Gyeongbokgung]] Palace.  Today, the pagoda stands in one of the main halls of the [[National Museum of Korea]].

The pagoda stands 13 m in height and is ten storeys tall.  However, because of the three-tiered foundation, it is a common mistake to believe that the pagoda has thirteen storeys.  Unlike most [[Goryeo]]-era pagodas, this pagoda is made from marble.  The preferred material of Korean sculptors was generally granite.  The later [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]]-era [[Wongaksa Pagoda]] is stylistically very similar and is believed to have been heavily influenced by the Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda.

Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda sits on a three-tiered foundation which projects in four directions like a cross.  The first three storeys of the pagoda share the same shape as the foundation.  Each panel of this tiered foundation is carved with Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, flowers, and arabesque patterns.  

The remaining storeys are square in shape and share intricate detailing which tries to create the illusion that the marble pagoda is made from wood. Each remaining storey has railings, a hip-and-gabled roof, eaves, and carvings made to suggest that each roof is tiled.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.tour2korea.com/enu/CU/CU_EN_8_3_2_1.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buddhism.org/board/read.cgi?board=glossary&amp;y_number=41&amp;nnew=1&lt;/ref&gt;

This pagoda is very valuable because it preserves the Goryeo-era wooden architectural style that has been mostly lost. According to the South Korean [[Cultural Heritage Administration]], this pagoda is one of the finest examples of Korean stone work and is of high artistic value.

The '''Hargeysa International Book Fair''' ('''HIBF''') ({{lang-so|Bandhigga Caalamiga ah ee Buugaagta Hargeysa}}) is an annual cultural event in the northwestern [[Somaliland]] region of [[Somalia]]. It is one of the largest public [[book fair]]s in the [[Horn of Africa]]. Every summer, HIBF brings writers, poets, artists and thinkers from Somaliland and from all over the world gather to share and discuss their art and literary productions with a wider audience. The main goal of the festival is to promote a culture of reading and writing in the region by producing and publishing high quality [[Somali literature]] and translating international classical literature (including fiction, poetry and drama) into Somali. Organized by the Redsea Online Culture Foundation, the event aims to enable young people to access a range of cultural heritages, with the intention of stimulating the revival of all forms of art and human expression, including painting, poetry reciting, story-telling, drama composition and writing.

==History==
===Origins===
The Hargeysa International Book Fair was inaugurated in 2008 by [[Jama Musse Jama]], who serves as Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Announcement: 2010 Hargeysa International Book Fair (HIBF) 23rd of July to the 27th of July 2010 in Hargeysa|url=http://www.baadiya.com/View.aspx?ID=403|publisher=Baadiya|accessdate=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It grew from 200 to 10,000 participants over the following six years.

===Significance===
HIBF targets not only a young audience, but wider sectors of society. It aims to help foster cultural understanding, tolerance, democracy, and an appreciation of the diversity of Somali culture and literature. In the past few years, the Redsea Online Culture Foundation's festivals have served to raise the profile of reading and writing in the Somaliland region, and also unite youth from different provinces in the area. The main goal of the book fair is to promote critically thinking cultural and creative writing, to facilitate the habit of reading, to display books, from both local and writers abroad, to encourage members in the public to browse, read, engage with authors, serve as an inspiration to young people, and the wider society.

===Parallel events and joint ventures===
''Somaliland Moving Library'': The Moving Library Tour is the Book Fair's flagship outreach event. An exciting initiative, it takes place a week before the opening of the festival in Hargeisa and is held across all regions of Somaliland. It aims to bring the ethos and principles of the Book Fair – of citizenship and creative freedoms – closer to aspiring writers and readers outside of the city.

'''''Merelaus the Emperor''''' is the name of one of the stories from the 13/14th c. collection ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]''. It tells of the patience and virtue of the wife of Merelaus the Emperor, who is betrayed successively by her husband's brother, a steward in an earl's household, a thief she rescued, and a ship captain. The tale was retold by [[Christine de Pisan]] and by [[Thomas Hoccleve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blamires|first1=Alcuin|last2=Pratt|first2=Karen|last3=Marx|first3=C.

'''Momart''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] company specialising in the storage, transportation, and installation of works of [[art]].

A major proportion of their business is maintaining (often delicate) artworks in a secure, climate-controlled environment. The company maintains specialist [[warehouse]] facilities adapted for this task. Momart's clients include the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]], [[Tate Modern]], [[Tate Britain]] and [[Buckingham Palace]]. The company received considerable media attention in 2004 when a fire spread to one of their warehouses from an adjacent unit, destroying the works in it, including works by [[Young British Artists]] such as [[Tracey Emin]] and [[Damien Hirst]], with the most well known work lost being Emin's 1995 piece ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963–1995]]''. On 5 March 2008 Momart was taken over by  [[Falkland Islands Holdings]] for a value of £10.3 Million &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.growthcompany.co.uk/news/311966/fine-art-move-by-falkland.thtml|title=Fine art move by Falkland|date=2008-03-07|work=Growth Company Investor|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which £4.6 Million was in cash, £2.5 Million was with shares and £3.2 was deferred consideration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fihplc.com/download/Momart_acquisition030308.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Momart began in 1971 as the “Jim Moyes’s Compendium of Working Possibilities”, with its founder, himself an artist, offering installation, display, handling, transport and framing services to up an coming artists and emergent galleries in London. Early users of the service included [[David Hockney]], [[Howard Hodgkin]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]]. The client base quickly grew by word of mouth in recognition of the service levels being offered and in September 1972 the company was registered as Momart Limited&amp;nbsp;– an amalgam of Jim Moyes and new partner Rees Martin. Rees subsequently left the business but the brand was becoming well established so the name remained.

The company set up its first office on Richmond Road, Hackney in East London and continued to grow organically – moving art, painting gallery walls, making frames and cases, hanging paintings, slinging sculpture and providing art storage. By 1985 Momart had gained a solid reputation amongst the commercial galleries and artists and started to introduce its credentials to the public sector such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]], the [[National Gallery]], [[Tate]], [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]] and other UK based art institutions.

In 1985, Momart commissioned the UK’s first fine art vehicle with temperature control and air ride suspension and carried out its first museum job on behalf of the Royal Academy - a [[Henry Moore]] exhibition. Momart was by then able to undertake all of the transport handling requirements completely in-house, including making site visits to the individual lenders where required, case making, transport of the empty cases to the lenders, pack on site and delivery of the case loan to the borrower.

=== Research and development ===
From 1988 Momart expanded the services to include the international movement of artworks on behalf of both commercial and museum clients overseas. This prompted close analysis and investigation of the various case making options and specifications and in 1991, in collaboration with Tate, the company assisted with the development and the standard specification for museum cases for touring exhibitions and for sending artworks worldwide. This was then presented at the Art in Transit Conference in Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/8127/mci_Art_in_Transit_Handbook_for_Packing_and_Transporting_Paintings.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal Warrant ===

Momart’s client base continued to expand. In the late 1980s the company started working for the Royal Collection and, in 1993, in recognition of the high quality of service provided by Momart, Her Majesty The Queen appointed Momart as a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal warrant]] holder.

=== New storage facilities ===

In 2003 Momart invested in new premises in [[Leyton]], with new plant and equipment and room for expansion. This included a new state-of-the-art workshop, storage facilities and transport office with Hackney remaining as the office base for the project coordination, administration and some satellite warehousing. This investment improved efficiency and capacity for increased storage business. In the same year Momart was granted Listed Agent status with the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) allowing certified Momart employees to carry out hand search procedures on client artworks to avoid the need for X-raying at the airport of departure.

=== Falkland Islands Holding ===

In 2008 Momart was acquired by Falkland Islands Holdings (FIH) the international services group that owns services businesses focused on transport and logistics. Following the acquisition, Momart's key management and staff has continued to work within the group to drive the company’s continued expansion, particularly in rapidly growing overseas markets. In that same year Momart’s administrative offices were moved from Hackney to Whitechapel from where the company operated all of the administration, coordination, shipping, finance, IT services.

=== Customs procedures ===

In 2009 HMRC granted Momart the then unique privilege amongst fine art transport companies to undertake all of its customs procedures in-house. Couple of years later, in 2011, Momart has been certified as an Authorised Economic Operator (AEO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/dds2/eos/aeo_home.jsp?Lang=en|title=Authorised Economic Operator|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling the company to simplify customs bureaucracy and speed up passage within the EU for their clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gov.uk/guidance/authorised-economic-operator-certification|title=Authorised Economic Operator|work=GOV.UK|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''New premises''' ===
In 2013 the company relocated its head office to South Quay, East London where it currently resides.

In 2016 Momart expanded its storage facilities in [[Leyton]], East London, with a new purpose-built unit providing additional 2,500 square metres of specialist art storage space.

== ARTIM ==
In 2001 Momart and five other respected international fine art transport agents founded the professional association ARTIM, whose members monitor each other's service levels both professionally and financially. ARTIM comprises the leading fine art agents worldwide who have the highest standards of service. Agents wishing to join ARTIM have to be voted in with a majority vote by the Founders’ Committee before becoming members. The association has gained much respect due to the calibre of the membership and although it cannot be used as an advertising tool in any way, offers great mutual support and benefits to its members and thereby to its clients and to the art world as a whole.

== The 2004 warehouse fire ==

In the early hours of 24 May 2004 a fire broke out at the Cromwell industrial estate in Leyton, east London. According to the fire investigation report, the flames that caught between 1.45 am and 3.15 am that morning were started deliberately, after burglars broke into a unit located at the extreme south-western corner of the estate and leased to an individual business repairing consumer electronics. 

The fire spread through the adjoining units at the estate, eventually reaching and destroying a warehouse then operated by Momart.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/27/thebritartfire.arts1|title=50 years of British art lies in ashes|last=Higgins|first=Charlotte|last2=Dodd|first2=Vikram|date=2004-05-27|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blaze destroyed more than 100 works by some of Britain's leading contemporary artists including Tracey Emin, Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Gary Hume, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Helen Chadwick and others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3748179.stm|title=Fire devastates Saatchi artworks|date=2004-05-26|access-date=2018-05-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those works were owned by [[Charles Saatchi]], the country's biggest collector of modern art.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Art industry insiders noted at the time that the insurance value of the works lost in the fire would be many times their initial purchase price, and that a comparable rise could be expected in the market values of the remaining (and future) works by artists whose works were lost. The total value of artworks lost was estimated at between £30 and £50 million.

A number of artists, in a joint action with several insurance firms, alleged negligence and pursued a legal case against Momart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-1592859/Art-blaze-sparks-lawsuits-against-Momart.html|title=Art blaze sparks lawsuits against Momart|work=This is Money|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was settled out of court in a mediated agreement for an undisclosed fee, reported to be in the order of  “tens of millions of pounds”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plone.unige.ch/art-adr/cases-affaires/warehouse-fire-2013-gillian-ayres-et-al-and-momart|title=Warehouse Fire – Gillian Ayres et al. and Momart — Centre du droit de l'art|website=plone.unige.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Momart Christmas card series ==
The tradition of the Christmas card goes back to 1984 when the first object – a festive card – was designed for the company by Bruce McLean. Since then Momart collaborated on this project with many of the top British and international artists. The complete series of Momart Christmas card is now part of the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Tate.

[[File:BirdCone.png|thumb|Bird cone cell, including oil droplet.]]
'''Oil droplets''' are found in the [[eye]]s of some animals, being located in the [[photoreceptor cell]]s. They are especially common in the eyes of [[diurnality|diurnal]] (active during the day) [[reptile]]s (e.g. [[lizard]]s, [[turtle]]s) and [[bird]]s (see [[bird vision]]), though are present in other taxa such as [[lungfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robinson, S.R. |year=1994 |title=Early vertebrate color vision |journal=Nature |volume=367 |issue= |pages=121 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/367121a0|pmid= |pmc= |url= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are found in [[cone cell]]s far more often than in [[rod cell|rods]], suggesting a role in [[colour vision]]. Occurrence in rod cells may imply that they have been modified from a cone cell ancestor.&lt;ref name = "Walls"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Vertebrate Eye and its Adaptive Radiation |last=Walls |first=G. |year=1942 |publisher=Cranbrook Institute of Science |location=MI, Bloomfield Hills |isbn= |pages=55–63 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occasionally occur in [[Double cone (biology)|double cones]]/double rods.&lt;ref name = "Walls"/&gt; Some oil droplets are [[colour]]ed, while others appear colourless. They are located in the cone inner segment, where they intercept and filter [[light]] before it can pass through to the cone outer segment where the [[visual pigment]] is.&lt;ref name = "Vorobyev"/&gt;

The [[adaptation|adaptive advantage]] of oil droplets is not firmly established. Coloured oil droplets have a cost in that they reduce the amount of light available to the [[visual system]].&lt;ref name = "Wilby"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilby D, Toomey MB, Olsson P, Frederiksen R, Cornwall MC, Oulton R, Kelber A, Corbo JC, Roberts NW |year=2015 |title=Optics of cone photoreceptors in the chicken (''Gallus gallus domesticus''). |journal=[[J.

This can be a benefit because it increases the number of colours that can be discriminated, and calculations by Vorobyev (2003) support the hypothesis that this is of net benefit.&lt;ref name = "Vorobyev"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vorobyev, M. |year=2003 |title=Coloured oil droplets enhance colour discrimination |journal=[[Proc.

'''Origomu'''  is a movement originated in [[New York City]] by [[Chile]]an artist [[Tatiana Pagés]] in 2009. It is the practice of recycling plastic waste into wearable art. Origomu or オリゴム comes from the Japanese ori, meaning “folding”, and gomu, meaning “rubber”.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"&gt;http://www.listindiario.com/las-sociales/2010/8/7/153823/Cambia-el-mundo-con-tus-propias-manos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOMAMAG"&gt;http://somamagazine.com/origomu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"&gt;http://www.gz-online.de/cgi-bin/adframe/design/article.html?ADFRAME_MCMS_ID=3286&amp;id=1305739720149392501128313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Heraldo"&gt;http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/401572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The technique has been taught in workshops at [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]], making necklaces using six-pack rings as chief material. Origomu is based in connecting art and fashion with environmental awareness. The technique has also been taught in workshops for low-income women.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;

Origomu necklaces has since been displayed at the Eco-Fashion exhibit at The Museum of FIT, the [[Cirque Du Soleil]] Ecological Tent in [[Montreal]], Canada, the country of [[Ecuador]] and the Punta Cana Foundation in [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"&gt;http://www.miami.com/el-arte-y-la-moda-del-origomu&lt;/ref&gt;

Origomu organized an international design contest. Creations from 25 countries were submitted and design and fashion experts chose the most innovative pieces. There was a first round of 8 finalists, out of these, three winners.&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2011, the movement had collected over 200,000 plastic six-pack rings, resulting in more than 500 Origomu designs. Over 305 designers have created Origomu pieces from countries such as Mexico, India, [[Portugal]], New Zealand, United States, [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], Belgium and Switzerland, among others.&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Protagonize is an [[online community]] and [[self-publishing]] platform, launched in December, 2007 by creator Nick Bouton &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/person/nick-bouton|title=Nick Bouton on Crunch Base|publisher=Crunch base |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a home for [[Choose Your Own Adventure]]-style branching stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kyllo|first=Blaine|title=Web community spins Protagonize's yarns|url=https://www.straight.com/life/web-community-spins-protagonizes-yarns|newspaper=straight.com|date=Jul 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riley|first=Duncan|title=Protagonize Is A Good Read, Help Write "FriendFeed Fan"|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/572/protagonize-is-a-good-read-help-write-friendfeed-fan/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=THE INQUISITR|date=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after launch, the site began to allow for linear narrative as well, and has since expanded to include poetry, screenplays, and other forms of literature.

Following its subsequent growth, there has been an increasing focus on the community aspect of the site, with features such as groups and writing circles being added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Plus |url=http://www.protagonize.com/help/about |title=About Protagonize on Protagonize, a creative writing community |publisher=Protagonize.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008 Protagonize was selected as a finalist in the 2008 Canadian New Media Awards for "Excellence in Social Media Websites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Excellence in Social Media Websites|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/winners-at-the-canadian-new-media-awards-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009 Protagonize was one of seven local BC startups chosen to demo at Launch Party Vancouver 7 as part of the Startup Most Likely to Succeed competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Admin|title=Launch Part Vancouver 7 Companies Announced|url=http://blog.bootuplabs.com/2009/05/12/launch-party-vancouver-7-companies-announced/|publisher=Bootup Labs Blog|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=Rob|title=Seven for LPV7 announced|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/seven-for-lpv7-announced|publisher=TECHVIBES|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one published book started out life as a story on Protagonize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heighway|first=Tricia|title=Paddytum|year=2010|publisher=Hirst Publishing|isbn=978-0956641731|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Paddytum-Tricia-Heighway/dp/0956641733}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boog|first=Jason|title=Tricia Heighway: Digital Writer Spotlight|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/appnewser/tricia-heighway-digital-writer-spotlight_b1101|publisher=APP NEWSER|accessdate=29 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2017, Protagonize closed down due to stagnant user growth and declining revenue from advertising and donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouton|first=Nick|title=The End of the Road|url=http://blog.protagonize.com/2017/05/04/the-end-of-the-road/|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''River of Fundament''''' is a 2014 [[operatic]] [[experimental film]] written and directed by American artist and filmmaker [[Matthew Barney]], and co-directed by longtime collaborator Jonathan Bepler. It was produced by Barney and the [[Schaulager|Laurenz Foundation]] and is loosely based on the 1983 novel ''[[Ancient Evenings]]'' by [[Norman Mailer]]. The film features Barney, [[Dave Bald Eagle]], [[Milford Graves]], [[Ellen Burstyn]],  [[Maggie Gyllenhaal]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Aimee Mullins]]. 

==Background== 
''River of Fundament'' was produced over 2007 to 2012, being the final product of a series of performances that accumulated into becoming the film's narrative. The film follows Norman Mailer (played by three different actors over the course of the film) as he travels through three different [[Reincarnation|reincarnations]], enduring the seven mythological states of his soul, loosely based on his own novel, "Ancient Evenings" (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riveroffundament.net/rof_synopsis.htm|title=Synopsis|last=Barney|first=Matthew|date=|website=River of Fundament|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the main narrative, it includes other elements from performance, sculpture, and opera. It has been described as an "eulogy for [Norman] Mailer."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/09/matthew-barney-river-of-fundament-moca|title=This 6-Hour Film Will Test Your Patience, Thirst, and Expectations for Art|last=Benns|first=Sway|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film was released on February 12, 2014 in a limited theatrical release and through exhibitions at museums in several countries.

==Plot and narrative==
Writer [[Norman Mailer]], becoming a protagonist of his own, reincarnates three times during and after his wake into three separate bodies, the last failing to survive through the womb and body of his wife, Hathfertiti (a character in ''Ancient Evenings''). Each reincarnation, he wakes up in a river of feces running beneath his [[Brooklyn Heights]] apartment. 

Simultaneously, Mailer's body is represented as three generations of American cars: a [[Imperial (automobile)|1967 Chrysler Crown Imperial]] (referencing Barney's [[The Cremaster Cycle|Cremaster 3]]), a [[Pontiac Firebird|1979 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am]] and finally a [[Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor|2001 Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptor]]. All three cars are transmogrified through modern industrial processing and recycling to symbolize the regeneration and reincarnation of Mailer.

Through this, the narrative also follows American [[car dealership]]s, [[Drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]], 'stomp teams', [[James Lee Byars]]' piece "The Death of James Lee Byars", [[Culture of Los Angeles|Los Angeles culture]], the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] and [[alchemy]].

'''Satyr plays''' were an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] form of [[tragicomedy]], similar in spirit to the bawdy satire of [[burlesque]]. They featured choruses of [[satyr]]s, were based on [[Greek mythology]], and were rife with mock drunkenness, brazen sexuality (including [[phallus|phallic]] props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment.

Satyr plays are an independent genre, but they share many attributes with comedy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Shaw (C. A.) “Satyric Play. The Evolution of Greek Comedy and Satyr Drama.” ''The Classical Review'', 65 (2014): 358-360. (Print). {{ISBN|978-0-19-995094-2}}. DOI: 10.1017/S0009840X15001250.&lt;/ref&gt; Satyric drama though is one of the three varieties of Athenian [[drama]], the other two being [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]]. Comedy and Satyr drama are both founded from [[Komos|kômos]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It can be traced back to [[Pratinas]] of [[Phlius]], c. 500 BC. After settling in Athens, he probably adapted the [[dithyramb]], customary in his native home, with its [[Greek chorus|chorus]] of satyrs, to complement the form of tragedy which had been recently invented in Athens. It met with approval and was further developed by his son [[Aristeas (playwright)|Aristeas]], by [[Choerilus (playwright)|Choerilus]], by [[Aeschylus]], and others.

In the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Dionysia]], each playwright customarily entered four plays into the competition: three [[tragedy|tragedies]] and one satyr play to be performed either at the end of the festival or between the second and third tragedies of a trilogy, as a spirited entertainment, a comic relief to break the oppression of hours of gloomy and fatalistic tragedy. They were short, half the duration of a tragedy.  The general theme of heaven, fate, and the gods affecting human affairs in the tragedies was carried through into the festivities of the chorus of satyrs and [[Silenus|Sileni]], companions of [[Dionysus]].

==Origins==

The origins of performance culture and the emergence of the satyr play can be traced to ancient rural celebrations in honour of the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Rush Rehm]] argues that these inaugurated the "agricultural cycle of planting and harvesting" closely associated with Dionysus, who represented the embodiment of "a fundamental paradox inherent to the world, life-giving but potentially destructive."&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 12–13)&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the satyr play within the Festival of Dionysus is often times not noted to be as important as the tragedies presented at the festival; however, it is crucial to the dramatic arts and history to not downplay their importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Griffith|first=Mark|date=October 2002|title=Slaves of Dionysos: Satyrs, Audience, and the Ends of Oresteia|jstor=10.1525/ca.2002.21.2.195|journal=Classical Antiquity|volume=21|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satyr plays were composed of fantastic plots and mythological burlesque moments &amp; scenes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dramatic festivities at the [[Dionysia|City Dionysia]] in [[classical Athens|Athens]], similarly dedicated to [[Dionysus]], required each playwright to submit three [[Tragedy|tragedies]] and a satyr play, which functioned as the last piece performed at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Rehm (1992, 39) and Lancelyn Green (1957, 11)&lt;/ref&gt; The accurate emergence of the satyr play is debatable; however, Brockett argues that most evidence “credits Pratinas with having invented this form sometime before 501 BC”,&lt;ref name="Brockett 1999, 17"&gt;Brockett (1999, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; which is supported by P. E. Easterling’s argument that by the 5th century the satyr play was considered an integral component of the tragike didaskalia.&lt;ref&gt;Easterling(1997, 40)&lt;/ref&gt;  Brockett also suggests the possibility that the satyr play was the first form of drama from which both [[tragedy]] and [[comedy]] gradually emerged.&lt;ref name="Brockett 1999, 17"/&gt;

[[Arthur Elam Haigh|A. E. Haigh]] however maintained that the satyr play is a survival from “the primitive period of Bacchic worship”.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 16)&lt;/ref&gt; Haigh lists several examples of recorded entries to the City Dionysia: thus, in 472 BC Aeschylus won the first prize with ''Phineaus'', ''Persae'', ''Glaucus'' and the satyr play ''Prometheus''. Among Euripides’ entries, Haigh underlines ''Theristae'' (431 BC), ''Sisyphus'' (415 BC) and ''Alcestis'' which Euripides was allowed to present as a replacement of the traditional satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 17)&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the evidence and information found regarding satyr plays and their history has been located through vase paintings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The mythological origins of the satyrs are closely linked to the advent of [[Dionysus]] into Hellenic culture. The satyrs and their female counterpart, the [[maenads]], were followers of Dionysus, a “late-comer to Olympus and probably of Asiatic origin”.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelyn Green (1957, 9)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Roger Lancelyn Green, the satyrs probably began as minor nature deities, while their designated leader Silenus originated as a water spirit, a maker of springs and fountains.&lt;ref name="Lancelyn Green 1957, 10"&gt;Lancelyn Green (1957, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Silenus was already an attendant to [[Dionysus]] when the satyrs joined the god’s following, and was subsequently proclaimed their father.&lt;ref&gt;Lancelyn Green. (1957, 10)&lt;/ref&gt; The satyrs characterised themselves by amorality, excessive drinking and the breaking down of traditional values and barriers.&lt;ref name="Lancelyn Green 1957, 10"/&gt; Eric Csapo and Margaret C. Miller further argue that satyrs have a strong connection with music and dance and consider them to be “archetypal musicians and dancers”,&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Miller (2007, 21)&lt;/ref&gt; thus linking them to Dionysiac processions and the origins of performance culture.&lt;ref&gt;Csapo and Miller (2007, 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Dionysia went through a phase of change around the middle of the fourth century. This change brought with it a switch in the ways plays were performed. Plays were no longer performed in a completion/competition type setting. Satyrs were now performed outside of the Festival of Dionysus and were no longer subjected to the judgement among other plays. Satyrs and comedies became more relevant within the theatre community in the 430s. The new found prevalence came after Morychides began to forbid fighting-related activities on the stage. Satyr plays did have some influence on other forms of performance as well; of the most noteworthy is Middle Comedy. This time period for comedy brought with it the humbling of gods and heroes; which was done through the domesticizing of these characters within the different performances. Middle Comedy took on many of the factors of satyr plays but adapted the performances to be what was desired by the public at that time. These plays have been said to be performed well into the Hellenistic and Roman eras.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some consider the satyr play to be an extinct form of drama due to the lack of overall evidence from the past for these plays in comparison to comedy or tragedy. This creates a challenge of reconstructing the truth and history behind everything;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; however, with the below information, we can try to ensure that this dramatic performance style lives on.

==Structure and content==

The material for a satyric drama, like that for a tragedy, was taken from an [[Epic poetry|epic]] or mythology, and the action, which took place under an open sky, in a lonely wood, the haunt of the satyrs, had generally an element of tragedy; but the characteristic solemnity and stateliness of tragedy was somewhat diminished, without in any way impairing the splendour of the tragic costume and the dignity of the heroes introduced. The satyr plays generally took on topics that were popularized within society in the approach of a satyric farce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Satyr plays incorporated aspects of comedy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some well known examples are ''Heracles'', ''Agen'', and ''Menedemus''. The amusing effect of the play did not depend so much on the action itself, as was the case in comedy, but rather on the relation of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]] to that action. That relation was in keeping with the wanton, saucy, and insolent, and at the same time cowardly, nature of the satyrs. The choruses in satyr plays usually involved the use of ''musically-inclined'' animals (such as monkeys). These animals were seen as a form of mockery for the ongoing issues in society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Victor Castellani, V “Ritual or Playful? On the Foundations of European Drama.” ''The European Legacy'', 14 (2009): 621-631. (Print). DOI: 10.1080/10848770903128786.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of persons in the chorus is not known, although there were probably either twelve or fifteen, as in tragedy. In accordance with the popular notions about the satyrs, their costume consisted of the skin of a goat, deer, or panther, thrown over the naked body, and besides this a hideous mask and bristling hair. The dance of the chorus in the satyric drama was called [[sicinnis]], and consisted of a fantastic kind of skipping and jumping.

The only satyr play to survive in its entirety is [[Euripides]]' ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', based on [[Odysseus]]' encounter with the cyclops, [[Polyphemus]], in Book 9 of the ''[[Odyssey]]''. [[Aeschylus]] was noted for his satyr plays,&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2.13.6&lt;/ref&gt; the largest fragment of which to have survived being his ''Dictyulci'' ('The Net Fishers') in which the baby [[Perseus]] is washed up on the shore with his mother [[Danae]] and is found by Silenus and the satyrs.  We also have large fragments of a satyr play of [[Sophocles]] called ''[[Ichneutae]]'' ('The Trackers'), in which the satyrs are employed by Apollo to track down his stolen cattle, and discover the baby Hermes. Smaller fragments of other satyr plays exist, and the genre continued to be written and performed as late as the 2nd century AD, though most have wholly vanished.&lt;ref&gt;West (1992, 281)&lt;/ref&gt; Even a fragment of music survives from a satyr play.&lt;ref&gt;Oxyrhynchus papyrus 2436; see Fragment 29 in West (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] did not imitate this kind of drama in their literature, although, like the Greeks, they used to have merry after-pieces following their serious plays.

==Costumes==
[[File:Actor as Papposilen Antikensammlung Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|''Actor as Papposilenus'', around 100 AD, after 4th-century BC original]]
A.E. Haigh writes extensively on costumes for the satyric drama. The chorus members all wore masks in accordance with Bacchic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 290)&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reliable testimony is supplied by the Pandora Vase dating from the middle of the 5th century BC. On that vase, the satyrs are portrayed as half men and half goats, wearing goat’s horns on their heads, thus referring to the goat deities of the Doric type.&lt;ref&gt;Haigh (1907, 293–294)&lt;/ref&gt;

A later representation can be seen on the Pronomos Vase, found in Naples. The goatish element has disappeared and the satyrs resemble the old Ionic Sileni who were horse deities. The performers are wearing horse tails and short pants with attached phallus, a symbol of Dionysiac worship.&lt;ref name="Haigh 1907, 294"&gt;Haigh (1907, 294)&lt;/ref&gt; Haigh claims that the Doric satyrs were the original performers in Attic tragedy and satiric drama, whereas the Ionic element was introduced at a later stage.&lt;ref name="Haigh 1907, 294"/&gt;

== Characters ==
Men were typically portrayed in a heroic-type myth within the plot line. Heracles is a great example of a character that is representative of satyr plays. [[Heracles]] is usually around gods; however, his presence is one portrayed as very domestic and humanized in its appearance. Characters similar to Heracles and with similar roles as his are usually represented in relation to a musical performance. One of the elements that satyr plays contained was the consideration of "wild women". These were ''women'' that would dance with the satyrs and be called maenads. The movement of these characters within the plays was part of what began to create the basis from development of comedy. Additionally, these dances had variations that generally were parallel to the different forms of the dithyramb.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These plays were also filled with different types of singers. These singers at the Panathenaea were classified as traditionalists when looked at from an early Satyr play perspective.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Simon Chimbetu''' (23 September 1955 – 14 August 2005) was a [[Zimbabwe]]an guitarist, vocalist and composer. He was the founding member of his band '''Orchestra Dendera Kings'''. He was known by many stage names, including "Chopper, "Mr Viscose" (before imprisonment), "Cellular", "Simomo" and "Mukoma Sam".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.herald.co.zw/chopper-commemorations-at-dandaro-inn/simon-chimbetu-3/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chimbetu was born in the Musengezi area of Mbire District in Mashonaland Province of [[Southern Rhodesia]], on 23 September 1955. His ancestral origins were of the Samanyika tribe in [[Manicaland Province]], the eastern region of Zimbabwe, bordering with [[Mozambique]]. His father was a bricklayer and Simon regularly accompanied his father on his business errands. He attended the local Musengezi High School before trekking to [[Harare]](then Salisbury) to look for employment.

==Rhodesian Bush War==
During the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], Chimbetu went to [[Tanzania]] to join the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU), which employed him as an entertainer for its guerrillas in exile. At some point prior to 1980, Chimbetu returned to Rhodesia.

==Return to Harare==
Chimbetu worked for a tobacco processing company for many years after the attainment of Zimbabwe's internationally recognised independence in 1980. His passion for music did not wane. Rather, he regularly played at Mushandirapamwe Hotel in Highfield, a high-density suburb in Harare. At this point he was backed by John Chibadura's '''Sungura Boys''' as he did not have his own instruments. His younger brother, Naison backed him and together they performed as '''Marxist Brothers''' because of the then prevailing political ideology which had also shaped Simon's war experiences. Together, the siblings penned songs like "Dr Nero"(Naison) and "Nherera"(Simon) which gave them visibility on the Zimbabwean music scene. After recording several albums together, the two split in 1988 with Simon forming his own band, The Orchestra Dendera Kings while Naison formed his Gee(Great) 7 Commandos. It was after splitting with Naison that Simon recorded the hit album ''Nguva Yakaoma''(Hard Times).

The album carried hits such as "Spare Wheel", the soulful "Samatenga", "Pasi Rapinduka", and others. "Samatenga" stayed at the number one spot for a long time; it was somewhat prophetic in that the suffering it describes was mirrored in Simon's own life soon after when he was arrested for theft/receiving stolen property. Although he pleaded his innocence, he was found guilty and incarcerated at Khami Prison in Bulawayo. 

==Rise to fame==
Chimbetu realised greater success when he went solo, recording classics like "Kuipa Chete", "Ngoma Yanditora Moyo", "Mwana Wedangwe", "Southern Africa" and many others. He called his brand of [[Music_of_Zimbabwe#Sungura|sungura]] 'dendera', a reference to a common tropical bird with a booming bass sound. Chimbetu's songs are distinguished by this deep, booming bass guitar.

What also distinguished Simon from many other sungura/museve artists at this time and throughout his career was that his music focused on contemporary social and political topics. The song "Kuipa Chete", for example, is about black Zimbabweans being abused and exploited economically by white commercial farmers. Towards the end of the 1980s, Chimbetu recorded many hits and grew to be force to reckon with on the scene. He is famous for penning and singing such songs as "Samatenga", "One Way", "Dzandipedza Mafuta" and many others. Simon also had a great facility with languages, being fluent in several and having in sung in Shona, Chewa, Ndebele and Swahili, among others. Chimbetu is also noted for his critical lyrics such as in the songs "Southern Africa", "Kuipa Chete" and "Simba Nederere", among many others.  

Out Of the two brothers, Chimbetu had the greater success. This was interrupted by his 2-year imprisonment from 1993 after being convicted of receiving stolen property. He was released in 1995 and immediately shot to the top with Pachipamwe (Welcome Back). The song "Saina", off ''Pachipamwe'', was favourite of many at weddings and social gatherings. His albums ''Survival'' and ''Lullaby'' are highly critical of the Mugabe regime. One of Chimbetu's distinct successes was being able to reclaim his top spot even after being jailed for such a long time. While in prison, another musician, [[Leonard Zhakata]] had wooed many fans with his similarly styled beat and well thought out lyrics. After this purple patch, Simon's career plummeted after he became more directly linked to the ruling ZANU-PF party.

==Controversy and Decline==
Chimbetu wasn't far from controversy during his career. At the peak of his popularity, he spent four years in jail and thereafter, rumours hit in 2002 that he hadn't paid his own farm workers for months. Additionally, his pro-government stance contributed to his somewhat rising unpopularity. As the economic situation in Zimbabwe worsened with the [[Land reform in Zimbabwe|controversial land reform programme]], musicians who were seen to side with the land reform and general ZANU-PF policies became unpopular. 

His political rhetoric, with songs like "Pane Asipo", especially on the highly political album, ''Hoko'', was obviously out of tune with the masses. Some fans deserted him but many still liked his music. In "Zuva Raenda", (the sun is setting) Chimbetu laments the delays in redistributing the land from white to black Zimbabweans.

Chimbetu died on 14 August 2005, following injuries sustained in a car accident. Curiously, at the time of his death, his career appeared to be on the mend with the release of ''10 Million Pounds Reward''. On this album, he sings about many issues, one of which is the unequal resource distribution in Zimbabwe on the Chewa song, "Governor Cornwell". Chimbetu was of Chewa origin, although born and raised in Zimbabwe; when declared a provincial hero, his actual burial was kept a secret in line with his religious burial traditions. A younger brother who was already part of the Orchestra Dendera Kings, Allan, fronted the band for a while before Suluman Chimbetu, Simon's second eldest son took over. His eldest son being Collin "Kodza" Chimbetu who ventured into farming. He has recorded a well-received albums  has toured overseas.He has managed to take over from Simon as well as he is a Simon lookalike which has popular musician Alick Macheso to mimick on stage that Sulu anenge Chopper literally translated as Sulu is like Chopper(Simon's common alias)

'''Sound art''' is an artistic discipline in which [[sound]] is utilised as a primary [[artistic medium|medium]]. Like many genres of [[contemporary art]], sound art may be [[interdisciplinary]] in nature, or be used in [[Cross-genre|hybrid]] forms. Sound art can be considered as being an element of many areas such as [[acoustics]], [[psychoacoustics]], [[electronics]], [[noise music]], audio [[Recording medium|media]], [[Field recording|found or environmental sound]], soundscapes, explorations of the human body, [[sculpture]], [[architecture]], [[film]] or [[video]] and other aspects of the current discourse of contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn. 2001, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Western art]], early examples include [[Luigi Russolo]]'s ''[[Intonarumori]]'' or noise intoners, and subsequent experiments by [[Dadaists]], [[Surrealists]], the [[Situationist International]], and in [[Fluxus]] [[happenings]]. Because of the diversity of sound art, there is often debate about whether sound art falls within the domains of [[visual art]] or [[experimental music]] categories, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Licht 2007, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other artistic lineages from which sound art emerges are [[conceptual art]], [[minimalism]], [[site-specific art]], [[sound poetry]], [[electro-acoustic music]], [[spoken word]], [[avant-garde]] poetry, and [[experimental theatre]].

==Origin of the term in the United States==
The earliest documented use of the term in the U.S. is from a catalogue for a show called "Sound/Art" at The Sculpture Center in New York City, created by William Hellerman in 1983.  The show was sponsored by "The SoundArt Foundation," which Hellerman founded in 1982.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} The artists featured in the show were: [[Vito Acconci]], Connie Beckley, Bill and Mary Buchen, [[Nicolas Collins]], [[Sari Dienes]] and [[Pauline Oliveros]], Richard Dunlap, [[Terry Fox (artist)|Terry Fox]], William Hellermann, Jim Hobart, [[Richard Lerman]], [[Les Levine]], [[Joe Lewis (artist)|Joe Lewis]], Tom Marioni, [[Jim Pomeroy (artist)|Jim Pomeroy]], Alan Scarritt, [[Carolee Schneeman]], Bonnie Sherk, [[Keith Sonnier]], Norman Tuck, [[Hannah Wilke]], Yom Gagatzi. The following is an excerpt from the catalogue essay by art historian Don Goddard: "It may be that sound art adheres to curator Hellermann's perception that "hearing is another form of seeing,' that sound has meaning only when its connection with an image is understood... The conjunction of sound and image insists on the engagement of the viewer, forcing participation in real space and concrete, responsive thought rather than illusionary space and thought."&lt;ref&gt;Hellerman and Goddard 1983, {{Page needed|date=May 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound art always takes place in an acoustic context, which may influence interpretation as much as if not more than any associated imagery. Installations of sound art rely on the acoustics of the spaces and reproduction technologies employed as can be exemplified by current practitioners such as Chris Watson.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Sound art in Europe==
===Belgium===
The [[Klankenbos]] (Sound forest) of [[Provinciaal Domein Dommelhof]] is the biggest sound art collection in [[public space]] in Europe. In the forest there are 15 [[sound installation]] pieces by artists such as [[Pierre Berthet]], [[Paul Panhuysen]], [[Geert Jan Hobbijn]] ([[Staalplaat]] Soundsystem), [[Hans van Koolwijk]], and others. Yearly in [[Kortrijk]] there is the sound art festival [[Wilde Westen]] (formerly known as Happy New Ears). In [[Brussels]] there are [[QO2]] and [[Overtoon]], two organisations that run [[artist-in-residence]] programs and organize events. [[Logos Foundation]] from [[Ghent]] is a sound art org run by [[Godfried-Willem Raes]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Paul Panhuysen]] and [[Remko Scha]] developed many early sound art pieces in the 70s and 80s and set up the [[Apollohuis]] in [[Eindhoven]]. [[STEIM]]. [[WORM (Rotterdam)|WORM]], [[Extrapool]] are active organisations that have sound art activities. [[Polderlicht]] was a sound art festival running from 2000–2015. [[iii]] (Instrument Inventors innitiative]] is a [[The Hague]] based organisation focused on the creation of sound art pieces. The organisation has an active [[artist-in-residence]] program and continuously invites sound artists to make new works at their location. The Netherlands have three academies where you can study in the direction of sound art [[Institute of Sonology]], [[Art Science]] at [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]] and at the [[Utrecht School of the Arts]] in Utrecht.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Norway===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5441">The '''Symphony No. 4''' is an [[orchestra]]l composition by the American composer [[John Harbison]].  The work was commissioned by the [[Seattle Symphony]] with contributions from the philanthropists Richard and Constance Albrecht.  It was given its world premiere in [[Seattle]] on June 17, 2004 by the Seattle Symphony under the direction of [[Gerard Schwarz]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Harbison |first=John |authorlink=John Harbison |year=2003 |title=Symphony No. 4 |publisher=[[G. Schirmer Inc.]] |url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/24250 |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Background===
The symphony was composed during a turbulent period in Harbison's life when his wife became very ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Freedman |first=Geraldine |title=ASO will perform John Harbison work, new composition by young protégé Timo Andres |work=[[The Daily Gazette]] |date=March 25, 2010 |url=http://www.dailygazette.com/news/2010/mar/25/0325_aso/ |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The composer wrote in the score program notes, "One morning at eight, in [[Bogliasco]], [[Italy]], where I was working, I receive a phone call - two o'clock the caller's time. I cannot describe the knowledge that struck during that call except to say that the breath of mortality, bearing at this moment on the person closest to me, came suddenly and radically near."  He continued:{{quote|Other action temporarily impossible, I went to work and by eleven A.M. had composed in every detail the fourth movement, which (perhaps superstitiously) I have not subsequently revised. This "Threnody" is not about loss but about the imminence and inevitability of loss at times we of course do not choose. Its early completion, far ahead now of the rest of the piece, affected the character of the whole symphony, especially the last movement, whose ritual formality embraces, the frantic dance and march which attempt to modify its character.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}

===Structure===
The symphony has a duration of roughly 27 minutes and is composed in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
#Fanfare
#Intermezzo
#Scherzo
#Threnody
#Finale

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (3rd doubling [[piccolo]]), three [[oboe]]s (3rd doubling [[Cor anglais|English horn]]), three [[clarinet]]s (3rd doubling [[bass clarinet]]), three [[bassoon]]s (3rd doubling [[contrabassoon]]), four [[French horn|horns]], two [[trumpet]]s, two [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], three percussionists, [[piano]], [[Pedal harp|harp]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been praised by music critics.  Lisa Hirsch of the ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' wrote, "It's an engrossing work, full of interesting detail and structural experimentation. Like the Mahler and Ravel, it deploys a very large orchestra, but the effects provided by that orchestra seem more studied and less organic than those in its companions, thought through rather than arising naturally from the melodic and harmonic elements of the work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirsch |first=Lisa |title=Boston's Ravishing Bay Area Bow |work=San Francisco Classical Voice |date=December 7, 2011 |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/bostons-ravishing-bay-area-bow |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith Powers of the ''Boston Classical Review'' compared the symphony with Harbison's 1999 opera ''[[The Great Gatsby (opera)|The Great Gatsby]]'', writing:{{quote|The music shifts ideas incessantly: the opening Fanfare carries the flavor of ''Gatsby'', presenting a pastiche of jazzy ideas, set in formal structures. The second movement offers a bewildering array of themes, connected by a mood of introspection. The scherzo, the most straightforward of the sections, lacks humor but suggests an antic energy. The centerpiece, a fourth movement labeled Threnody, begins with a string-based theme, deeply lyrical and pensive, with accents from the back of the orchestra. The Finale creates some ease for the listener, shifting to less tense, major harmonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Powers |first=Keith |title=Morlot takes up the BSO's Harbison mantle in convincing fashion |work=Boston Classical Review |date=November 25, 2011 |url=http://bostonclassicalreview.com/2011/11/morlot-takes-up-the-bsos-harbison-mantle-in-convincing-fashion/ |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Matthew Guerrieri of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' was slightly more critical of the work, however, saying "...the whole symphony feels like workings-through, of influences, forms, processes, difficulties."  He added, "The opening and closing movements had crisp force; the quieter movements, especially the piecemeal transparency of the 'Intermezzo,' were more skittish and hesitant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guerrieri |first=Matthew |title=Ludovic Morlot conducts the BSO in a concert of Harbison, Ravel, and Mahler |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=November 26, 2011 |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2011/11/26/ludovic-morlot-conducts-bso-concert-harbison-ravel-and-mahler/wvi26pgoAbhJBcz8UZuAoK/story.html |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5600">The '''Symphony for Solo Piano''' is a large-scale romantic work for piano composed by [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]] and published in 1857.

Although it is generally performed as a self-contained work, it comprises studies Nos. 4-7 from the ''Douze [[étude]]s dans tous les tons mineurs (Twelve Studies in all the minor keys)'', Op. 39, each title being prefaced by the word ''Symphonie'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Symphony''). The four movements are titled ''Allegro'', ''[[Funeral march|Marche Funèbre]]'', ''[[Minuet|Menuet]]'', and ''Finale''. Much like the [[Concerto for Solo Piano (Alkan)|Concerto for Solo Piano]], the Symphony is written so as to evoke the broad palette of timbres and harmonic textures available to an orchestra. It is an early example of a [[Piano symphony]]. In the opinion of François Luguenot, it "does not contain the excesses of [Alkan's] Concerto or the Grande Sonate (Op. 33). But, rather like [Alkan's] Sonatine Op. 61, it proves that Alkan was also capable of writing perfectly balanced and almost ‘Classical’ works."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;Luguenot (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a standard [[classical music|classical]] symphony, each movement is in a different key, rising in [[progressive tonality]] by a [[perfect fourth]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2000), v.2 p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alkan Symphony for Solo Piano Allegro first theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening theme of the Allegro.]][[File:Alkan symphony 2nd movement theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening of the Funeral March.]][[File:Alkan symphony movement 4 theme.png|thumb|upright=1|Opening of the Finale.]]The opening movement in C minor is written in [[sonata form]]. The thematic material of the Allegro is almost entirely derived from the opening theme, which appears in octaves in the left hand.

=== Marche Funèbre ===
The second movement is in [[ternary form]] with a [[legato]] melody over [[staccato]] chords in the first section and a lyrical [[chorale]] in the middle section.

François Luguenot wrote:&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The second movement is a [[funeral march]] in F minor, rather [[Gustav Mahler|Mahlerian]] in style. In the original edition the title page read ‘Symphonie: No 2. Marcia funebre sulla morte d’un Uomo da bene ['Funeral march on the death of a good man’], words which have sadly been lost in all subsequent editions. Of course one is reminded of the subtitle of the ‘Marcia funebre’ in Beethoven’s third symphony. But might we not regard this ‘uomo da bene’ as Alkan’s father, Alkan Morhange, who died in 1855, two years before these studies were published?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jack Gibbons]] wrote:&lt;ref name="Gibbons_facebook"&gt;[https://lt-lt.facebook.com/JackGibbonsPiano/posts/10151807117194384 Jack Gibbons Facebook entry, 3 July 2013], accessed 3 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; "The funeral march's sense of restraint is borne out by Alkan's marking over the gentle central section, "with contained sorrow" [...] The distant drum roll that interrupts the march near its close adds an Alkanesque sense of disquiet to this already sombre music."

=== Menuet ===
The Menuet is in ternary form, like the Marche Funèbre. François Luguenot writes that "the Minuet in B{{music|flat}} minor is in fact a [[scherzo]] that anticipates shades of [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]—full of energy and brightened by a lyrical trio."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Corleonis suggests that "[[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] are in closest proximity in the hectic Minuet, combining the spirit of the Ronde du Sabbat and Marche au Supplice from the former's ''[[Symphonie Fantastique]]'', with a palpable debt to the Minuet from the latter's [[String_Quartets,_Op._76_(Haydn)#Opus_76.2C_No._2_.28.22Fifths.22.29|"Les Quintes" Quartet, Op. 76/2]], which Alkan transcribed."&lt;ref&gt;Corleonis (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finale ===
The final movement is extremely technically demanding. Luguenot comments that "the final Presto in E{{music|flat}} minor, memorably described by [[Raymond Lewenthal]] as a ‘ride in hell’, brings the work to a breathless close."&lt;ref name="hyperion_Hamelin"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance history==

In the opinion of [[Jack Gibbons]]: "That music of this quality has remained neglected in the 150 or so years since its creation is a shocking scandal ... Alkan performed extracts of the work himself at his series of 'Petits Concerts' in Paris in the 1870s but the next notable performance wasn't until 1938 when [[Egon Petri]] performed the Symphony for [[BBC]] radio in London. Gramophone recordings of the work didn't appear for another 25 years, and though today the work is performed more often than at any time in the past, its appearance in a concert programme is still unusual."&lt;ref name="Gibbons_facebook"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tea Tasting (054A) (7545204176).jpg|thumb|right|The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] tested tea until 1996.]]
'''Tea tasting''' is the process in which a trained taster determines the quality of a particular [[tea]].&lt;ref name="All The Tea In China"&gt;{{citation|author=Yvonne Wrightman|title=All the Tea in China - Fascinating Traditions and Incredible Edibles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBoS3RTLnrYC&amp;pg=PA14|accessdate=March 4, 2013|date=January 1994|publisher=Centax Distribution|isbn=978-1-895292-35-0|pages=14–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to climatic conditions, topography, manufacturing process, and different clones of the ''[[Camellia sinensis]]'' plant (tea), the final product may have vastly differing flavours and appearance. These differences can be tasted by a trained taster in order to ascertain the quality prior to sale or possibly [[blending tea]].&lt;ref name="All The Tea In China"/&gt;

==Techniques==
The [[ISO 3103]] standard describes a standardised method for brewing teas in order to make meaningful sensory comparisons between them. It is not a particularly useful standard for many teas, however, requiring a six-minute brewing time and boiling water, neither of which are recommended for green teas (usually brewed at &lt; 90&amp;nbsp;°C and for under 3 minutes). Tea tasters would instead usually taste teas which have been brewed according to the recommendations of the producer.

A [[tea]] taster uses a large spoon and noisily slurps the liquid into his/her mouth - this ensures that both the tea and plenty of oxygen is passed over all the taste receptors on the tongue to give an even taste profile of the tea. The liquid is then usually spat back out into a [[spittoon]] before moving onto the next sample to taste. The flavour characteristics and indeed leaf colour, size and shape are graded using a specific language created by the tea industry to explain the overall quality. Generally speaking, once the quality has been tasted/graded, each tea company places a value on it based on market trends, availability and demand.

'''The Gersh Agency''' (also known as '''TGA''', or simply '''Gersh''') is a talent and literary agency established in 1949 by Phil Gersh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/thr-guide-7-major-hollywood-799743|title=The THR Guide to the 7 Major Hollywood Agencies|website=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Beverly Hills, California]] and [[New York City]]. The Gersh Agency is the sixth largest talent agency in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://actingplan.com/top-talent-agencies-los-angeles/ Top Talent Agencies in Los Angeles (2017)] 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gersh was founded in Beverly Hills in 1949 by [[Phil Gersh]]. He was considered one of the last links between Hollywood's Golden Age and today's corporate-owned movie business,&lt;ref name="mclellan"/&gt; and his clients included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[David Niven]], [[William Holden]], [[June Allyson]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Fredric March]], [[Gloria Grahame]], [[James Mason]], [[Karl Malden]], and [[Robert Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/phil-gersh-a-leading-agent-in-hollywood-is-dead-at-92.html|title=Phil Gersh, a Leading Agent In Hollywood, Is Dead at 92|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|date=May 12, 2004|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, [[Richard Arlook]] joined the agency, which subsequently grew from a handful of agents to over 60 agents.  Arlook left the agency in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charitybuzz.com/catalog_items/meet-with-producer-manager-richard-arlook-in-beverly-1423600&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name="mclellan"/&gt; 
Phil Gersh gradually handed over responsibility to his two sons but continued to play a role in the company's management until 10 weeks before his death in 2004.&lt;ref name="mclellan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/11/local/me-gersh11|title=Phil Gersh, 92; Agent With Old Hollywood Instincts, Art Patron|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|date=11 May 2004|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency is currently run by Phil Gersh's sons, Bob and David.

"'''The Three Spinners'''" is a German [[fairy tale]] [[Grimm's Fairy Tales|collected]] by the [[Brothers Grimm]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/rumpelstiltskin/stories/3spinners.html "The Three Spinners"]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is tale no 14 and [[Aarne–Thompson]] type 501.  It is widespread throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 716 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has obvious parallels to [[Rumpelstiltskin]] and [[Frau Holle]], and obvious differences, so that they are often compared.

[[Giambattista Basile]] includes an Italian literary fairy tale, '''The Seven Little Pork Rinds''', in his 1634 work, the [[Pentamerone]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 585, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[Italian Folktales]]'' includes a variant, ''And Seven!''.&lt;ref&gt;Italo Calvino, ''Italian Folktales'' p 14-18 {{ISBN|0-15-645489-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edition of ''Grimm's Fairy Tales'' contained a much shorter variant, '''Hateful Flax Spinning''', but it is "The Three Spinners" that became well-known.

==Synopsis==
Once there was a beautiful-but-lazy girl who would not spin. While her mother beats her for it, the Queen, passing by, overhears and asks the reason for the punishment. Ashamed to admit that her daughter is lazy, the woman replies that the girl spins so much that her mother cannot afford to buy enough [[flax]] to keep her occupied.  The Queen, impressed by such industry, offers to take the girl with her.

Once at the castle, the queen takes the girl to a room filled with flax. If she spins it all within three days, she'll be rewarded with marriage to the queen's oldest son.  Two days later, the queen returns and is amazed to find the flax untouched.  The girl pleads that homesickness has kept her from spinning, but she realizes that excuse will not serve her twice.

[[Rule of three (writing)|Three]] women appear in the room that night. One has a grotesquely swollen foot; the second, an overgrown thumb; the third, a pendulous lip.  They offer to spin all the flax for the girl if she will invite them to her wedding, introduce them as her aunts, and seat them at the high table.  She agrees, and they commence and complete the spinning.

In the morning, the queen is satisfied to see the flax all spun.  She arranges for the wedding to her son, the prince, and the girl asks to invite her "aunts".  When they appear, the king asks how they came to have such deformities, and the three explain that they come from their years of spinning.  The king forbids his beautiful daughter-in-law to spin again.

===Variant: Hateful Flax Spinning===
A king orders his queen and daughters to spin all the time.  One day, he gives them a great box of flax to spin, to his daughters' distress.  The queen invites three hideous old maids to come to the castle and spin.  The king sees them and asks the cause of their deformities.  Their answer: from spinning.  The king forbids his wife and daughters to spin again.

==The Seven Little Pork Rinds==
A girl eats seven pieces of bacon, leaving none for her mother. While the mother beats her for her [[gluttony]], a passing merchant asks the reason, and the woman replies that her daughter is ruining her health by working too hard. The merchant decides on the spot to marry this industrious girl.

The now-married merchant goes on a journey, leaving his wife the spinning. Making an effort to spin, she flicks a passersby with water; some passing fairies are so amused by this that they offer to do the spinning for her.  Despite their aid, the merchant's wife claims that the spinning has made her ill, and the merchant decides not to require her to spin any more, as her mother must have been right about her overworking.

===And Seven!===
In this version, as in the one just described, the part of the king is taken by a merchant; similarly, the mother berates her daughter for "seven" – meaning seven bowls of soup that the girl has eaten – but the mother pretends that they are spindles of [[hemp]] that the girl has spun.

The women helpers in this version – who also are deformed from their years of spinning – instruct the girl to invite them to her wedding by calling their names. If she does not do so, they warn her, she will be worse off than she would have been had they not spun for her. She forgets the names and puts off the wedding while she tries to recall them.  The merchant sees the three women cavorting in the forest and hears them call out their names, similar to the scene in [[Rumpelstiltskin]]; he describes this to his bride in hopes of amusing her and getting her to agree to a wedding date.  She is therefore able to invite her helpers and bring about the happy ending as in "The Three Spinners".

A Puerto Rican version exists, with three Holy Souls in [[Purgatory]] replacing the fairies, and a merchant in place of the king. The heroine in this version is an orphan abused by an aunt.

'''''Untitled''''' is an outdoor 1952 fountain and sculpture by [[Tom Hardy (artist)|Tom Hardy]], installed at the [[Park Blocks (Eugene, Oregon)|Park Blocks]] in Eugene, Oregon, United States.

==Description and history==
[[File:Eugene Saturday Market-4.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The fountain during [[Eugene Saturday Market]]]]

Tom Hardy's untitled fountain (1952) is installed at the northeast corner of Eugene's Park Blocks, near the intersection of 8th Avenue and Oak Street. The fountain's [[bronze sculpture]] depicts a school of fish, possibly salmon, jumping in and out of the water and measures approximately {{Convert|69|in|m}} x {{Convert|18|ft|m}}, {{Convert|8|in|m}} x {{Convert|5|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Untitled, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!328726~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surrounding the sculpture are five water jets. The fountain's base is made of concrete and embedded stones, and measures approximately {{Convert|24|in|m}} x {{Convert|40|ft|m}} x {{Convert|40|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

The work was surveyed and deemed "well maintained" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in August 1993. It was administered the Cultural Services Division of the City of Eugene's Library, Recreation and Cultural Services Department at that time.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

[[File:Altes Museum Berlin (11).JPG|thumb|Two objects from the trove]]
The '''Vettersfelde Treasure''' or '''Witaszkowo Treasure''' is a treasure trove, which was found by chance in what was then Vettersfelde in the [[Province of Brandenburg]] (modern [[Witaszkowo]], near [[Gubin, Poland|Gubin]], [[Poland]]) in 1882, and is now in the [[Antikensammlung Berlin]]. The objects in the trove are connected to the animal-themed art of the [[Scythians]]. The origin of the trove remains mysterious.

Among the most significant items in the trove are:
* an [[electrum]] plaque (41 x 15&amp;nbsp;cm, 608 g) in the shape of a fish,&lt;ref&gt;Petre Alexandrescu, « Zum goldenen Fisch von Witaszkowo, ehem. Vettersfelde », in ''L'aigle et le dauphin : études d'archéologie pontique'', Editura enciclopedică, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; which probably dates to the end of the 6th century BC. According to Furtwängler, it was originally an ornament (''sema'') on a shield. The body of the fish is covered by little animals in relief, including a [[Black panther|panther]] catching a [[boar]], and a [[lion]] catching a [[deer]], and the tail is made up of two rams' heads. It is believed to have been made by the artisans of an [[Ionians|Ionian]] colony on the northern coast of the [[Black Sea]], such as [[Olbia]] or [[Panticapaeum]], to cater to the tastes of a Scythian prince. 
* a golden plaque intended to cover the upper part of a sheath for an [[Acinaces]] (a type of dagger used by Scythians) and decorated with animals (fish, vultures, deer, boar). Length: 19&amp;nbsp;cm. 6th century BC.
* a golden object made up of four disks, each decorated with animals around a central boss, and a smaller central disk. It might have been part of a breast plate or a harness. Height: 17&amp;nbsp;cm. 6th century BC.
Other highlights include pendants of braided wire, a massive [[torc]]. Part of the find went to Berlin and was kept with a suit of [[Scythian]] armour, which dated from around 500 BC. Other, smaller objects from the trove were sold or melted down.

The discovery began a long scholarly debate. The presence of these objects so far into northern Europe was explained by a Scythian expedition into central Europe, with the trove forming the grave-offerings of a Scythian prince, who had made it to [[Brandenburg]]. One such expedition is attested at the end of the sixth century BC as a result of [[Darius I|Darius]]' Scythian expedition (513 BC). Newer research on the find location argues that it might have been deposited as a sacrifice after being taken as booty from a Scythian prince. The presence of Scythians in this area is otherwise only suggested by the discover of three-fluted arrowheads, but these were regularly used by other [[Eurasian nomads]].

[[File:Francesco Porzio, Monumento alla difesa di Casale, Piazza Castello, Casale Monferrato (Ian Spackman 199xC n25).jpg|thumb|200px|Bronze of a young female warrior in [[Lombards|Lombard]] costume. Francesco Porzio, ''Monumento alla difesa di Casale'', 1897]]

A '''virago''' is a woman who demonstrates exemplary and heroic qualities. The word comes from the Latin word ''virāgō'' (([[genitive case|genitive]] virāginis) meaning variously 'a man-like, vigorous, heroic maiden, a female warrior, heroine..'&lt;ref&gt;{{L&amp;S|virago|virāgō|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''vir'' meaning 'man' (cf. [[virile]] and [[virtue]]) to which the suffix ''-āgō '' is added, a suffix that creates a new noun of the [[Third declension|third declension]] with feminine [[grammatical gender]].

The word ''virago'' has almost always had an association with cultural [[gender role|gender transgression]]. A virago, of whatever excellence, was still identified by her gender. There are recorded instances of viragos (such as [[Joan of Arc]]) fighting battles, wearing men's clothing, or receiving the [[tonsure]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Tibbetts Schulenburg. ''Forgetful of their sex: female sanctity and society, ca. 500-1100''. University Of Chicago Press, 2001. Page 50. {{ISBN|978-0-226-74054-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''virago'' could also be used disparagingly, to imply that a virago was not excellent or heroic, but was instead violating cultural norms. Thus ''virago'' joined [[pejorative]]s such as ''[[termagant]]'',&lt;ref name=MWdict&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/virago| title=Virago| accessdate=2011-11-25| publisher=Merriam-Webster Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''mannish'', ''amazonian'' and ''[[Shrew (archetype)|shrew]]'' to demean women who acted aggressively or like men.

==History==
Historically, the concept of a virago reaches back into antiquity where [[Hellenistic philosophy]] asserted that elite and exceptionally heroic men had ''[[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'' ({{lang-el|ἀνδρεία|andreia}}). ''Virtus'' (once again linked to ''vir'', the brave man abiding by society's highest values and ethics as opposed to ''homo'', human being) defined the traits of excellence for a man in ancient Rome (and Greece), including valor and heroism, but also morality and physical strength. Women and non-elite or unheroic men (slaves, servants, craftsmen, merchants) were considered a lesser category, and believed to be less excellent in [[Mos maiorum|Roman morality]]. A woman, however, if exceptional enough could earn the title ''virago''. In doing so, she surpassed the expectations for what was believed possible for her [[gender]], and embodied masculine-like aggression&lt;ref&gt;Virginia Blanton. ''Signs of devotion: the cult of St. Æthelthryth in medieval England, 695-1615'' Pennsylvania State Univ Pr (Trd) (April 30, 2007). Page 168. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02984-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or excellence. Virago, then, was a title of respect and admiration. In [[Christianity]], a [[nun]] or holy woman who had become equal in divinity to male [[monks]] through practiced [[celibacy]], exemplary religious practice and devotion, and intact [[virginity]], was considered to have surpassed the limitations of her femaleness and was called ''virago''.&lt;ref&gt;Newman, Barbara. ''From Virile Woman to Woman Christ: Studies in Medieval Religion and Literature''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 1995. Page 5. {{ISBN|978-0-8122-1545-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Lux-Sterritt. Redefining Female Religious Life: French Ursulines And English Ladies in Seventeenth-Century Catholicism. Ashgate Pub Co (January 30, 2006). Page 61. {{ISBN|978-0-7546-3716-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Firmicus Maternus describes virago as women who take on a man's character and desire intercourse with women like men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Love Between Women: early Christian responses to female homoeroticism|last=Brooten|first=Bernadette|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-226-07591-4|location=Chicago|pages=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standard modern dictionaries define ''virago'' as either, in order of definition, (1) a "loud overbearing woman"; a "shrew".&lt;ref&gt;{Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged, Copyright (c) 1993 Merriam-Webster, Incorporated, first definition of "virago"}&lt;/ref&gt; or (2) a woman of "great stature, strength, and courage"&lt;ref  name=MWdict /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/virago&lt;/ref&gt; Thus virago continues to be associated with both the naming of a woman who has either (1) a domineering, abrasive and spiteful manner, or (2) has risen above cultural and [[sexism|gender stereotypes]] to embody a [[virility|virile]] heroism; for example, the [[British Royal Navy]] christened at least four warships ''[[HMS Virago|Virago]]''.

==Vulgate Bible==
The [[Vulgate]] Bible, translated by [[Jerome]] and others in the 4th century C.E., was an early Latin translation of the Hebrew Bible [[Hebrew Bible|Old Testament]]. In Genesis 2:23, Jerome uses the words ''Vir'' for man and ''Virago'' for "woman" attempting to reproduce a pun on "male" and "female" (''ish'' and ''ishah'') that existed in the Hebrew text.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Jerome, Robert Hayward. ''Saint Jerome's Hebrew questions on Genesis.'' Oxford University Press, USA (August 10, 1995) Page 113. {{ISBN|978-0-19-826350-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Kraus. ''Gender Issues in Ancient and Reformation Translations of Genesis 1-4.'' Oxford University Press, USA (December 17, 2011). Page 182. {{ISBN|978-0-19-960078-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vulgate reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Dixitque Adam hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis et caro de carne mea haec vocabitur '''virago''' quoniam de viro sumpta est.''
&lt;br&gt;
"And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called woman, because she was taken out of man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Middle English poem ''[[Cursor Mundi]]'' retains the Latin name for the woman in its otherwise Middle English account of the creation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Quen sco was broght be-for adam, '''Virago''' he gaf her to nam; þar for hight sco '''virago''', ffor maked of the man was sco.'' (lines 631–34)
&lt;br&gt;
"When she was brought before Adam, Virago was the name he gave to her; Therefore she is called Virago, For she was made out of the man."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6313">'''Virgilius the Sorcerer''' is a [[fairy tale]] about the poet [[Virgil]] by [[Andrew Lang]] who included it in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]''.

==Virgil's powers==
Medieval legends attributed [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] powers to the poet [[Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings|Virgil]], but even among these legends, this tale attributes a very high level of power to him.

Among his accomplishments in the tale, Virgilius is a quick thinker, using his magical powers to defeat corruption and military attacks and spirits. One of his spells was to make an army immobile, turn men to stone, or create a river out of nowhere, encircling them so they could not proceed. Although he wins many challenges, including a magician's battle, wily schemes also help his cause. Among his creations, he invents and animates a horse, rider and dogs out of copper to assert his will.

Virgilius avenges the trickery of his first love for publicly humiliating him before finding true love at last, and creating the city of [[Naples]] for her.

==Synopsis==
The story begins –
&lt;blockquote&gt;Long, long ago there was born to a Roman knight and his wife Maja a little boy called Virgilius. While he was still quite little, his father died, and the kinsmen, instead of being a help and protection to the child and his mother, robbed them of their lands and money, and the widow, fearing that they might take the boy's life also, sent him away to [[Spain]], that he might study in the great University of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One holiday, when walking, he came upon an evil spirit that was trapped; the spirit offered him magical books in exchange for setting him free. Virgilius demanded the books, and the knowledge how to use them, first; then he freed the spirit. It grew to an enormous size, so the quick-witted Virgilius declared he did not believe it came out of the hole, and the spirit, to prove it, went back in whereupon Virgilius quickly trapped it again.

He studied magic for many days gaining a wonderful reputation for his powers ("he was much thought of as showing promise of great learning"). This was cut short when his mother sent for him because she was ill and could no longer look after their affairs. When he arrived home, his rich relatives were displeased because his presence meant they could no longer rob their kinsmen. They were, however, related to the emperor, who put off the matter of giving Virgilius his due. His enemies attacked him but Virgilius used his magic to drive them off or cast spells on them. The emperor himself went to him without effect until a magician came into camp and was hired to battle Virgilius. Virgilius had a hard time fighting the magician, but reached the emperor in secret with a proposition: he would stop the fight if he could have justice, compelling the emperor to agree.

Virgilius then fell in love with a woman named Febilla. She told him that she would let him visit her by drawing him up in a basket to a tower. Once he was in the basket, she lifted it only half way, leaving him a dangling target of the crowd's ridicule. The emperor ordered his release, but the next day, no fire in Rome would light. Virgilius told them to bring Febilla to a scaffold in the market place and take fire from her. Fire started about her and she had to stand there until everyone had re-lit their fires. The emperor threw Virgilius into prison with a death sentence,  but when he was brought up, thirsty Virgilius asked for water. When the guards brought him a pail of water, Virgilius jumped into it, saying he was going to Sicily and magically vanished.

Andrew Lang has heavily bowdlerized his sources here; in the original Medieval tradition, the fire could only be rekindled from her vagina. The story was very popular with Renaissance artists. The [[Metropolitan Museum]] has a Venetian ''confittiera'' (ca. 1475&amp;ndash;1500) showing Febilla standing on the square with raised skirt, a gift by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/arlo/ho_17.190.730a,b.htm Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://alaintruong.canalblog.com/archives/2008/11/23/11465448.html Les cahiers d'Alain Truong]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on Rome===
The fairy tale says that it is unknown how he reconciled with the emperor, but he next made statues of the gods of every country, including Rome, with bells in their hands, and the bells would ring if they intended treachery toward Rome, so the Romans would send their armies against them. 

A country that hated them sent men to Rome; they claimed to be diviners and to have dreamed of gold, and then, with the Senate's permission, dug up the gold they had buried the night before. The [[Rule of three (writing)|third]] time, they told the Senate it was under the Capitol and they would dig for them, for their generosity; they undermined the Capitol and stole away. Immediately after, the statues fell and were ruined.  

Much crime followed in the city. Virgilius had a copper horse and rider made and ordered all men indoors. Only the honest obeyed, and the horse trampled those it found outside. The next day, the surviving thieves tried to use ropes and grapples to stop it, and used rope ladders to escape it. Two copper dogs were added, to jump up and bite them to death.

Virgilius fell in love with a foreign princess, the daughter of a sultan, and carried her away from her father. She was a guest in his house, wondering at the marvels, until she wished to return to her father. Virgilius returned her, but the sultan ordered his death. Virgilius cast a spell on him and his court and carried the princess away again. Then, thinking Rome not fine enough, he built a marvelous city for her, which was [[Naples]].

==Commentary==
The technique of tricking  spirit is a motif also found in ''[[The Spirit in the Bottle]]'' and with genies in ''[[The Fisherman and the Jinni]]''.

The legend that he had been trapped in a basket was a common medieval tale, warning of the power of love to make fools of men.

There is a reference to the "Black Book" he uses as the source of his spells which in popular culture can be a book containing lists or evil deeds.

The '''woman's film''' is a [[film genre]] which includes women-centered narratives, female protagonists and is designed to appeal to a female audience. Woman's films usually portray "women's concerns" such as problems revolving around domestic life, the family, motherhood, self-sacrifice, and [[Romance (love)|romance]].{{sfn|Doane|1987|pp=152&amp;ndash;53}} These films were produced from the [[Silent film|silent era]] through the 1950s and early 1960s, but were most popular in the 1930s and 1940s, reaching their zenith during [[World War II]]. Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films characterized by some of the elements of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s. The work of directors [[George Cukor]], [[Douglas Sirk]], [[Max Ophüls]], and [[Josef von Sternberg]] has been associated with the woman's film genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor1-first = Angela | editor1-last = Howard | editor2-first = Frances M. | editor2-last = Kevenik | title = Handbook of American Women's History | url = | publisher =  Garland | location = New York | year = 1990 | chapter = | chapterurl = | isbn = 978-0-8240-8744-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Crawford]], [[Bette Davis]], and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] were some of the genre's most prolific [[movie star|stars]].{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}}

The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]]'s silent films. [[Film historian]]s and critics defined the genre and canon in retrospect. Before the woman's film became an established genre in the 1980s, many of the classic woman's films were referred to as [[Melodrama#Film|melodrama]]s.

Woman's films are films that were made ''for'' women by predominantly male screenwriters and directors whereas [[women's cinema]] encompasses films that have been made ''by'' women.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=153}}

==Definition==

When the woman's film was still at a nascent stage, it was not regarded as a fully independent genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=29}} [[Mary Ann Doane]], for example, argued that the woman's film is not a "pure genre" because it is crossed and informed by a number of other genres such as melodrama, [[film noir]], the gothic, and [[horror film]].&lt;ref&gt;Doane cited in Altman 1998, pp. 28&amp;ndash;29.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, film scholar Scott Simmon argues that the woman's film has remained "elusive" to the point of having its very existence questioned. This elusiveness, he argues, is partially due to the fact that the woman's film is an oppositional genre which can only be defined in opposition to male-centered genres like the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and [[Mob film|gangster film]].{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=68}} It has also been noted that it is a critically rather than industrially constructed genre, having been defined in retrospect rather than at the time of the films' production.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=28}} The woman's film was seen as closely related to and even synonymous with melodrama.&lt;ref name="modleski"&gt;Modleski, Tania (1984). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1225094 "Time and Desire in the Woman's Film"]. ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' '''23''' (3): 19&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms commonly used to describe the woman's film were "drama", "romance", "love story", "comedy drama", and "soap opera".&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Stephen (1993). "Melo Talk: On the Meaning and Use of the Term 'Melodrama' in the American Trade Press". ''[[Velvet Light Trap|The Velvet Light Trap]]'' '''32''' (3): 66&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 1980s, the woman's film has been an established film genre.{{sfn|Altman|1998|p=32}} Film scholar Justine Ashby, however, has observed a trend in [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]] that she calls "generic eclipse" whereby films that adhere to all the fundamental tenets of the woman's film are subsumed under other genres. ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943) and ''[[Two Thousand Women]]'' (1944), for example, have been described and promoted as war films rather than woman's films.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

The woman's film differs from other film genres in that it is primarily addressed to women.{{sfn|Doane|1987|p=3}} Cinema historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] argues that the first of three purposes of the woman's film is "to place a woman at the center of the story universe".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} In most other and particularly men-oriented film genres the opposite is the case as women and their concerns have been assigned minor roles. [[Molly Haskell]] explains that "if a woman hogs this universe unrelentingly, it is perhaps her compensation for all the male-dominated universes from which she has been excluded: the gangster film, the western, the war film, the policier, the rodeo film, the [[adventure film]]".{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=155}} The second purpose of the woman's film, according to Basinger, is "to reaffirm in the end the concept that a woman's true job is that of being a woman". A romantic ideal of [[love]] is presented as the only "career" that will guarantee happiness and that women should aspire to.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} The third purpose of the genre, as suggested by Basinger, is "to provide a temporary visual liberation of some sort, however small – an escape into a purely romantic love, into sexual awareness, into luxury, or into the rejection of the female role".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=13}} Basinger argues that the major – if not only – action of the woman's film and its biggest source of drama and tragedy is the necessity to make a choice.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=19}} The heroine will have to decide between two or more paths that are equally appealing but mutually exclusive as, for example, romantic love and a fulfilling job. One path will be right and consistent with the film's overall morality and the other path will be wrong but it will provide liberation. As the films' heroines were punished for following the wrong path and ultimately reconciled to their roles as women, wives, and mothers, Basinger argues that woman's films "cleverly contradict themselves" and "easily reaffirm the status quo for the woman's life while providing little releases, small victories or even big releases, big victories".{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=10}}

==Identifying characteristics==
Unlike male-centered movies which are frequently shot outdoors, most woman's films are set in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]],{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} which defines the lives and roles of the female protagonist.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=181}} Whereas the events in woman's films &amp;ndash; weddings, proms, births &amp;ndash; are [[socialization|socially]] defined by nature and society, the action in male films &amp;ndash; chasing criminals, participating in a fight &amp;ndash; is story-driven.{{sfn|Basinger|1994|p=9}}

The themes in woman's and male-oriented films are often diametrically opposed: fear of separation from loved ones, emphasis on emotions, and human attachment in women's films, as opposed to fear of intimacy, repressed emotionality, and individuality in male-oriented movies.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=24}} The plot conventions of woman's films revolve around several basic themes: love triangles, unwed motherhood, illicit affairs, the rise to power, and mother-daughter relationships.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=163, 166}} The narrative pattern depends on the activity engaged in by the heroine and commonly includes sacrifice, affliction, choice, and competition.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=157}} The maternal melodrama, the career woman comedy, and the paranoid woman's film, a subgenre based on suspicion and distrust, are the most frequent subgenres.{{sfn|Walsh|1986|p=125}} Female madness, [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[hysteria]], and [[amnesia]] were frequent plot elements in Hollywood's woman's films of the 1940s. This trend took place when Hollywood tried to incorporate aspects of [[psychoanalysis]]. In the medical discourse in films like ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942), ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948), mental health is visually represented by beauty and mental illness by an unkept appearance; health was restored if the female protagonist improved her appearance.{{sfn|Doane|1986|pp=153, 155}} [[Friendship]] among women was fairly common,{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} although the treatment was superficial and focused more on women's dedication to men and female-male relationships than on their friendships with each other.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|pp=36&amp;ndash;40}}

[[File:Annex - Stanwyck, Barbara (Stella Dallas) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|In [[King Vidor]]'s ''[[Stella Dallas (1937 film)|Stella Dallas]]'' (1937), Barbara Stanwyck plays a [[Working class|working-class]] mother who sacrifices her connection to her daughter in order to help her become part of an [[Upper class|upper-class]] world.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=46}}]]
The woman's films that were produced in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]] have a strong thematic focus on [[Social class|class]] issues and questions of economic survival whereas the 1940s woman's film places its protagonists in a middle- or upper-middle-class world and is more concerned with the characters' emotional, sexual, and psychological experiences.{{sfn|McKee|2014|pp=24&amp;ndash;25}}

The female protagonist is portrayed as either good or bad.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=164}} Haskell distinguishes three types of women that are particularly common to woman's films: the extraordinary, ordinary and the "ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary". The extraordinary women are characters like [[Scarlett O'Hara]] and [[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]] who are played by equally extraordinary actresses like [[Vivien Leigh]] and Bette Davis. They are independent and emancipated "aristocrats of their sex" who transcend the limitations of their sexual identities. The ordinary women, in contrast, are bound by the rules of their respective societies because their range of options is too limited to break free of their limitations. The ordinary woman who becomes extraordinary is a character who "begins as a victim of discriminatory circumstances and rises, through pain, obsession, or defiance, to become mistress of her fate."{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=160&amp;ndash;61}} Depending on the type of heroine a film champions, a film can be either socially conservative or progressive.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=28}} Certain archetypal characters appear in many woman's films: unreliable husbands, the other man, a female competitor, the reliable friend, usually an older woman, and the sexless male, frequently depicted as an older man who offers the protagonist security and luxury but makes no sexual demands on her.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|pp=165&amp;ndash;66}}

A common motif in Hollywood's woman's films is that of the [[doppelgänger]] sisters (often played by the same actress), one good and one bad who vie for one man as [[Bette Davis]] in her double role in ''[[A Stolen Life (1946 film)|A Stolen Life]]'' (1946) and [[Olivia de Havilland]] in ''[[The Dark Mirror (film)|The Dark Mirror]]'' (1946).{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=78}} The good woman is portrayed as passive, sweet, emotional, and asexual whereas the bad woman is assertive, intelligent, and erotic. The conflict between them is resolved with the defeat of the bad woman.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Lucy (1983). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1225070 "Two-Faced Women: The 'Double' in Women's Melodrama of the 1940s"]. ''Cinema Journal'' '''23''' (1): 24&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; A central element of the 1980s British woman's film is the motif of escape. Woman's films allow their respective female protagonists to escape their everyday lives and their socially and sexually prescribed roles. The escape can take the form of a journey to another place such as the [[USSR]] in ''[[Letter to Brezhnev]]'' (1985) and [[Greece]] in ''[[Shirley Valentine (film)|Shirley Valentine]]'' (1989) or education as in ''[[Educating Rita (film)|Educating Rita]]'' (1983) and sexual initiation as in ''[[Wish You Were Here (1987 film)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Ashby|2010|p=155}}

==History==
The beginnings of the genre can be traced back to [[D. W. Griffith]], whose one- and two-reelers ''[[A Flash of Light]]'' (1910) and ''[[Her Awakening]]'' (1911) feature the trademark narratives of repression and resistance that would later define a majority of women's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|pp=68&amp;ndash;69, 71}} Other predecessors of the genre include women-centered [[serial film]]s such as ''[[The Exploits of Elaine]]'' (1914) and ''[[Ruth of the Rockies]]'' (1920).{{sfn|Hollinger|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TA8iYChqyb0C&amp;pg=PA36 36]}}

The woman's film genre was particularly popular in 1930s and 1940s, reaching its zenith during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="russel"&gt;Russel, Catherine (1994). [http://www.filmstudies.ca/journal/pdf/cj-film-studies32_Russell_mourning.pdf "Mourning the Woman's Film: The Dislocated Spectator in ''The Company of Stranger''"]. ''Canadian Journal of Film Studies'' '''3''' (2): 25&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The film industry of that time had an economic interest in producing such films as women were believed to comprise a majority of movie-goers. In line with this perception, many woman's films were prestigious productions which attracted some of the best stars and directors.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=45}} Some film scholars suggest that the genre as a whole was well-regarded within the film industry,{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=193}} while others argue that the genre and term "woman's film" had derogatory connotations and was used by critics to dismiss certain films.{{sfn|Haskell|1987|pp=154&amp;ndash;55}} 

Production of women's films dropped off in the 1950s as melodrama became more male-centered and as [[soap opera]]s began to appear on television.&lt;ref name="russel"/&gt; Although [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] continued to make films marked by some of the features and concerns of the traditional woman's film in the second half of the 20th century, the term itself disappeared in the 1960s.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=184}}

The genre was revived in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heung | first = Marina | authorlink = | editor-first = Lucy | editor-last = Fischer | title = Imitation of Life: Douglas Sirk, Director | url = | publisher =  [[Rutgers University Press]] | location = [[New Brunswick, New Jersey]] | year = 1991 | chapter = 'What's the matter with Sarah Jane?': Daughters and Mothers in Douglas Sirk's ''Imitation of Life'' | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=NxHbph9wFJsC&amp;pg=PA302 | isbn = 978-0-8135-1644-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to create modern versions of the classic woman's film, updated to take account of new social norms, include [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]'' (1974), ''[[An Unmarried Woman]]'' (1978) by [[Paul Mazursky]], [[Garry Marshall]]'s ''[[Beaches (film)|Beaches]]'' (1988), and ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes]]'' (1991) by [[Jon Avnet]]. Similarly, the 2002 films ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'' and ''[[Far from Heaven]]'' took their cues from the classic woman's film.{{sfn|Langford|2005|p=49}} Elements of the woman's film have reemerged in the modern [[horror film]] genre. Films such as [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Carrie (1976 film)|Carrie]]'' (1976) and [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' (1979) subvert traditional representations of femininity and refuse to follow the traditional marriage plot. The female protagonists in these movies are driven by something other than romantic love.{{sfn|Greven|2011|pp=91&amp;ndash;140}}

Within [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British cinema]], [[David Leland]] returned to the formula of the 1980s woman's film in ''[[The Land Girls (film)|The Land Girls]]'' (1998). The film tells the story of three young women during World War II and offers its heroines the opportunity to escape their old lives. ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]'' (2002) emphasizes the key generic theme of female friendship and casts the heroine in a conflict between the restrictions of her traditional [[Sikh]] upbringing and her aspirations to become a [[Association football|football player]]. [[Lynne Ramsay]]'s ''[[Morvern Callar (film)|Morvern Callar]]'' is based on the woman's film tradition; a young woman escapes to Spain and pretends to be the author of her boyfriend's novel. While Morvern's journeys and transformations allow for liberation, she ends up where she started.{{sfn|Ashby|2010|pp=162, 163&amp;ndash;65, 166&amp;ndash;68}}

==Response==
Jeanine Basinger notes that woman's films were often criticized for reinforcing conventional values, above all, the notion that women could only find happiness in love, marriage and motherhood. However, she argues that they were "subtly subversive". They implied that a woman could not combine a career and a happy family life, but they also offered women a glimpse of a world outside the home, where they did not sacrifice their independence for marriage, housekeeping, and childrearing. The pictures depicted women with successful careers as journalists, pilots, car company presidents, and restaurateurs.{{sfn|Basinger|2010|p=163}} Similarly, Simmon notes that the genre offered a mixture of repression and liberation, in which repressive narratives are regularly challenged, partly via [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]] and acting but also by conflicts within the narratives themselves. He further states that such resistances were present in some of the earliest woman's films and became the rule with [[Douglas Sirk]]'s postwar American woman's films.{{sfn|Simmon|1993|p=71}} Others have argued, however, that the narratives of these films offer only the repressive perspective and that viewers must read the texts "against the grain" to be able to find a liberating message.{{sfn|Hollinger|1998|p=35}} Critics such as Haskell have criticized the term "woman's film" itself. She writes: &lt;blockquote&gt;What more damning comment on the relations between men and women in America than the very notion of something called the 'woman's film'? ... A film that focuses on male relationships is not pejoratively dubbed a 'man's film' ..., but a 'psychological drama.'"{{sfn|Haskell|1987|p=154}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some woman's film have been met with critical acclaim. Woman's films that were selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant" include ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), ''[[Imitation of Life (1934 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1934), ''[[Jezebel (film)|Jezebel]]'' (1938), ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939), ''[[The Lady Eve]]'' (1941), ''[[Now, Voyager]]'' (1942),&lt;ref&gt;LaPlace, Maria.

{{zombies}}
A '''zombie walk''' is an organized public gathering of people who dress up in [[zombie]] costumes. Participants usually meet in an urban center and make their way around the city streets and public spaces (or a series of taverns in the case of a '''zombie pub crawl''') in an orderly fashion. Zombie walks can be organized simply for entertainment or with a purpose, such as setting a [[world record]] or promoting a charitable cause. Originating in North America during the 2000s, zombie walks have occurred throughout the world.

==Format==
Zombie walks are relatively common in large cities, especially in North America. Some have been established as annual traditions, though others are organized as spontaneous [[flash mob]] events or [[performance art]]. The complexity and purpose of zombie walks varies. As an advanced technique to heighten interest and realism, some zombie mobs will "eat" victims to create new zombies, in sight of onlookers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2728235416012736070&amp;ei=0_30SPSTBoSKqQPfpc0B&amp;q=sf+zombie+mob+2005 |title=Zombies attack willing "bystanders" |publisher=Google |date=July 30, 2005 |accessdate=January 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124022356/http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2728235416012736070&amp;ei=0_30SPSTBoSKqQPfpc0B&amp;q=sf+zombie+mob+2005 |archivedate=January 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some participants occasionally dress up as soldiers who are called in to contain the outbreak, or survivors who are trying to defend themselves from the onslaught of the zombie horde. Some events are staged as spoof [[Demonstration (people)|political rallies]] organized "to raise awareness of zombie rights", with participants carrying placards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/arts/articulate/200604/s1627099.htm |title=ABC News: They came, they saw, they lurched |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=April 30, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zombie walks have also been staged as "[[hunger marches]]" with the intent of raising awareness of [[world hunger]] and collecting items for [[food bank]]s.&lt;ref name="dailyiowan1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyiowan.com/2009/09/21/Metro/13034.html |title=Iowa City's fourth-annual Zombie Walk collects a record-breaking number |work=[[The Daily Iowan]] |date=September 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{clear left}}

==History==

===Gencon 2000===
'''The earliest zombie walk styled event on record''' was put together rather last-minute at the [[Gen Con]] gaming convention in [[Milwaukee]] in August 2000. The event was created to poke good-natured fun at the ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' [[LARP]]ers that were taking over large portions of the convention, and disrupt their games. Michael Yates, Mark Stafford, Jacob Skowronek and several others organized the event with roughly 60 participants. The event was later recorded in the book ''40 Years of Gencon''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laws|first1=Robin D.|title=40 Years of Gencon|isbn=1589780973}}&lt;/ref&gt; with photos and recollections from the organizers. While it was rumored that the organizers were arrested and thrown out of the convention for their flash mob of zombies, they were simply questioned by security before being told to disband.

===Annual Trash Film Orgy film festival===
Another early zombie walk was held in [[Sacramento, California]] on August 19, 2001.&lt;ref name="RedfernSteiger2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nick Redfern|author2=Brad Steiger|title=The Zombie Book: The Encyclopedia of the Living Dead|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=94QsBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT613|date=18 August 2014|publisher=Visible Ink Press|isbn=978-1-57859-531-0|page=613}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McDonald2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Megan McDonald|title=Stink and the Midnight Zombie Walk|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=97kojzX8njIC&amp;pg=PA127|date=12 February 2013|publisher=Candlewick Press|isbn=978-0-7636-6422-0|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaffenrothMorehead2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kim Paffenroth|author2=John W.

The event, billed as "The Zombie Parade", was the idea of Bryna Lovig, who suggested it to the organizers of Trash Film Orgy&lt;ref name="tfoproductions.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tfoproductions.com|title=TFO Productions|publisher=TFO Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a way to promote their annual midnight film festival.&lt;ref name="PulliamFonseca2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=June Michele Pulliam|author2=Anthony J.

The event was traditionally held as the kick off to the six-week film festival at Sacramento's historic [[Crest Theatre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Carla|title=This year's trash films have their share of delights|url=http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article2603309.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=McClathcy News|publisher=Sacramento bee|date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 2014 when the theatre's general manager of 28 years, Laura "Sid" Garcia-Heberger, couldn't reach a lease renewal agreement with the building owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Carla|title=Crest’s longtime manager to end run on up note|url=http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/movies-news-reviews/article2835148.html|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=McClatchy News|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the film festival's change of venue, TFO continues the walk as part of a free all-ages event, the "Carnival of the Dead", which includes [[food truck]]s from local vendors, make up stations, live bands, contests, games, and a projected movie in the park at the end of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Zombies to terrorize R Street for 15th year|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=26 August 2015|url=http://www.sacbee.com/entertainment/article32465130.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TFO Zombie Walk &amp; Carnival of the Dead|url=http://sacramento.downtowngrid.com/listings/tfo-zombie-walk-carnival-of-the-dead/|accessdate=26 February 2015|agency=Downtown Sacramento Grid|publisher=Sacramento grid|date=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacramento Zombie Walk|url=http://saczombiewalk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The streets in downtown Sacramento comprising the walk's route are shut down by the city in order to safely accommodate the large numbers of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2014/05/29/preparing-for-zombies-city-to-ward-off-crush-of.html|title=Preparing for zombies: City to ward off crush of undead by closing streets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toronto and Sherbrooke walk===
'''The first gathering specifically billed as a "Zombie Walk" occurred in October 2003 in [[Toronto]],'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oZIlm84F2oC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=better+off+dead+sarah+lauro+toronto+zombie+walk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OqJbMv2GXk&amp;sig=qyIEewwwnm7-8Mau9e4VpwWN7Ac&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=D6K7UY3RMtPOqwH7-IGIBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=better%20off%20dead%20sarah%20lauro%20toronto%20zombie%20walk&amp;f=false |title=Chapter 3: Zombies Invade Performance Art...And Your Neighborhood – Better Off Dead: The Evolution of the Zombie As Post Human |publisher=[[Fordham University Press]] |year=2011 |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by local horror movie fan Thea Munster and with only seven participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/Exd-volume04-Issue01/Volume4Issue01#page/n9/mode/1up|title= Zombie Walk 2003 |publisher=Equalizing X Distort Blogspot |accessdate=June 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "zombie demonstration" occurred in [[Sherbrooke]], [[Quebec]], on November 1, 2003, organized by a local grassroots organization, with 60 participants walking on a one kilometer course downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives-2001-2012.cmaq.net/es/node/14119.html |title=Manifestation des Zombies contre le néo-libéralisme |publisher=CMAQ.net |date=November 3, 2003 |accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another zombie march was organized the next year by the same group in Sherbrooke, with nearly 200 participants. In subsequent years, the Toronto Zombie Walk has grown tremendously in size, with the 2014 event playing host to more than 15,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blogto.com/city/2009/10/toronto_zombie_walk_2009/ |title=Toronto Zombie Walk 2009 |publisher=Blogto.com |date=October 26, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zombie Walk has spread to [[Vancouver]], creating the zombie walk tradition in that city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouverhalloween.com/vh_ZombieWalk.html |title=Vancouver Halloween Vancouver Zombie Walk |publisher=Vancouverhalloween.com |date=July 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613172144/http://www.vancouverhalloween.com/vh_ZombieWalk.html |archivedate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 2005, over 400 participants proceeded through Vancouver's [[Pacific Centre]] mall, travelled on the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|SkyTrain]] (referred to for the event as the "SkyBrain" or the "BrainTrain"), and continued 35 blocks to [[Mountain View Cemetery (Vancouver)|Mountain View Cemetery]].

===Gaining popularity===
The mid to late 2000s saw an exponential gain in popularity for zombie walks, due largely to the success of [[zombie films]] at the time, such as the [[Resident Evil (film)|''Resident Evil'' movies]], ''[[28 Days Later]]'', [[Zack Snyder]]'s ''[[Dawn of the Dead (2004 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'', [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Land of the Dead]]'', and ''[[Zombieland]]''. Documentation of zombie walks consequently began to appear more often in [[Mainstream media|mainstream news media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-10-09/features/0910080095_1_zombie-undead-walk |title=A Chance To Get In Touch With Your Inner Zombie |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=October 9, 2009 |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and blogs. Zombie walks soon spread across North America and to cities around the globe, such as [[Mar del Plata]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goringa.net/post/imgenes/5035/zombie-walk-mar-del-plata-2011.html |title=Zombie Walk Mar Del Plata 2011 |publisher=Goringa! |accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rio de Janeiro]] had its first zombie walk on November 2, 2007 ([[Day of the Dead]]) and the event has become annual since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://g1.globo.com/rio-de-janeiro/noticia/2012/11/no-dia-de-finados-jovens-se-vestem-de-zumbis-na-praia-de-copacabana.html |title=No Dia de Finados jovens se vestem de zumbis na Praia de Copacabana |language=Portuguese |publisher=Organizações Globo |accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 29, 2006, nearly 900 "zombie walkers" gathered at the [[Monroeville Mall]] outside of [[Pittsburgh]], which served as the set of George A. Romero's classic zombie film ''[[Dawn of the Dead (1978 film)|Dawn of the Dead]]'', to participate in Pittsburgh's first annual Walk of the Dead.&lt;ref name="post-gazette2006"&gt;Donaldson, Bob, and Roberts, Larry.

Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Guinness officially recognized a new record for the world's largest gathering of zombies on October 30, 2010, at the third annual New Jersey Zombie Walk on the Asbury Park Boardwalk in [[Asbury Park]]. Guinness recorded 4,093 zombies at the event, though organizers, police, and fire officials estimate more than 5,000 zombies were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monda |first=Michael |title=Zombies invade Asbury Park to set Guinness World Record |url=http://videos.nj.com/star-ledger/2010/10/zombies_invade_asbury_park_to.html |accessdate=October 31, 2010 |newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]] |date=October 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In July 2011, more cities would attempt to break this world record.

'''''South Brazil'''''

The Zombie Walk, annually held in Curitiba, South Brazil, it's known to bear 15,000 to 25,000 zombies and people. Held during the Brazilian Carnival holidays, Curitiba is known to be not much fond of the famous Brazilian festivity preferring instead to host the Psycho Carnival rock festival in which the Zombie Walk was derived off. Many people from states who also do not like samba or the carnival associated acts go to Curitiba for the Zombie Walk and rock festivals around the city.

==Pub crawl variant==

Some zombie walks incorporate [[pub crawl]]ing, during which participants visit multiple bars over the course of the walk. The first large-scale zombie pub crawl was held in [[Minneapolis]] on October 15, 2005. The crawl consisted of roughly 150 participants in zombie costumes moving from bar to bar in the city's [[Northeast, Minneapolis|Northeast]] district. The Minneapolis "Zombie Pub Crawl" has since become an annual event and attendance has grown exponentially; each year it takes place in a different area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Horgen, Tom.[http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/dining/31116719.html?elr=KArksD:aDyaEP:kD:aUt:aDyaEP:kD:aUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU Nightlife: 'Dead' ahead]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101210913/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/dining/31116719.html?elr=KArksD%3AaDyaEP%3AkD%3AaUt%3AaDyaEP%3AkD%3AaUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaULPQL7PQLanchO7DiU |date=November 1, 2014 }} ''[[Star Tribune]]''.

In 2007, zombies used bicycles to travel around town in the initial Ride of the Living Dead event in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]. An offshoot of the non-zombie summer Handlebars and Bars bicycle pub crawl, this event began with about 40 riders in its debut, and has since grown exponentially. In 2014, the event attracted over 400 zombie bicyclists and featured indie-rock bands from the Milwaukee-Chicago corridor as entertainment throughout the day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Handlebars-and-BarsRide-of-the-Living-Dead Handlebars and BarsRide of the Living Dead | Facebook]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
In 2006, a young woman in [[Bloomington, Indiana]] reported to police that a group of "zombies" attacked her car by covering the vehicle in "purple goo"; the zombies in question turned out to be participants in a small, local zombie walk, and several arrests were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldtimesonline.com/stories/2006/11/01/news.1101-HT-A3_LJB09259.sto |title=Woman reports zombie attack |work=[[The Herald-Times]] |accessdate=January 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2006 Vancouver Zombie Walk, an incident occurred in which two impatient drivers attempted to drive their cars through a crowd of zombies headed down Robson Street: this resulted in some severe injuries among the zombies, but no damage to the vehicles. Another incident involved a pair of zombies using a brick to shatter the window of a man's car; both zombies were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldengod.net/2006/09/07/vancouver-zombiewalk-2006-cbc-footage/ |title=Vancouver Zombie Walk 2006 CBC TV Coverage |publisher=Goldengod.net |date=September 7, 2006 |accessdate=January 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722065855/http://www.goldengod.net/2006/09/07/vancouver-zombiewalk-2006-cbc-footage/ |archivedate=July 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the annual Zombie Shuffle in [[Melbourne]] saw the largest attendance in its five-year history, but some locals complained of the mess that the zombie "gore" left behind, as well as the walk's disruption of a play for [[Preschool education|preschoolers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/opinion/ghoul-chant-is-gory-gory-hallelujah/story-e6frfhqf-1225862262752 |title=Ghoul chant is gory, gory hallelujah |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 and 2012, participants in the [[Minneapolis]] Zombie Pub Crawl broke store windows and caused other damage to the area in which the event was held. Many residents see the event as disruptive to the life of the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2013/10/11/zombie-crawl-organizers-add-security-to-fight-nimby-vibe|title=Zombie Pub Crawl adds security as some Cedar-Riverside businesses moan|first=Jon|last=Collins|date=October 10, 2011|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a Russian zombie walk in support of [[Pussy Riot]] in [[Omsk]], [[Siberia]] was banned by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.ria.ru/society/20120816/175253222.html |title=Siberia's Omsk Bans Zombie Parade in Support of Pussy Riot |publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/politics/zombie-parade-church-ban-820/ |title='Zombie Parade' banned in Siberia |publisher=[[RT (TV network)|RT]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, a shooting occurred at the ZombiCon in [[Fort Myers, Florida]]. &lt;ref name="Mullen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/18/us/zombicon-shooting-fort-myers-florida/index.html|title=Deadly shooting sparks panic at ZombiCon event in Fort Myers, Florida|last=Mullen|first=Jethro|author2=Joe Sutton|date=October 18, 2015|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1 person was killed and 5 others were wounded. Lawsuits led to cancellation of the event the next year. &lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/story/news/2016/09/25/no-zombicon-fort-myers-2016-public-relations-firm-confirms/91091336/|title=Zombicon canceled for 2016 as lawsuits swirl|last=Braun|first=Michelle|date=September 25, 2016|publisher=News-Press|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
