The '''Ardagh Hoard''', best known for the '''Ardagh Chalice,''' is a hoard of [[Metalworking|metalwork]] from the 8th and 9th centuries. Found in 1868 by 2 young local boys, Jim Quinn and Paddy Flanagan, it is now on display in the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in [[Dublin]].  It consists of the chalice, a much plainer stemmed cup in [[copper-alloy]], and four [[Brooch|brooches]], three elaborate [[pseudo-penannular]] ones, and one a true [[pennanular brooch]] of the thistle type; this is the latest object in the hoard, and suggests it may have been deposited around 900 AD.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, 185&lt;/ref&gt; 

The chalice ranks with the [[Book of Kells]] as one of the finest known works of [[Insular art]], indeed of [[Celtic art]] in general, and is thought to have been made in the 8th century AD. Elaborate brooches, essentially the same as those worn by important [[Laity|laypeople]], appear to have been worn by monastic clergy to fasten [[vestment]]s of the period.

==Find==
[[File:Ardagh chalice.jpg|thumb|left|260px|The Ardagh Chalice, centrepiece of the hoard]]
The hoard was found in late September 1868 by two boys, Jim Quin and Paddy Flanagan, digging in a potato field on the south-western side of a ''rath'' ([[Ringfort|ring fort]]) called [[Ardagh Fort|Reerasta]], beside the village of [[Ardagh, County Limerick]], Ireland. Paddy Flanagan remained in Ireland and is buried in the Pauper's Graveyard in NewcastleWest. Jim emigrated to Australia, spending his later years in Melbourne. He is buried in [[Fawkner_Crematorium_and_Memorial_Park|Fawkner Memorial Park]] in the city following his death there in 1934.

The chalice held the other items, covered merely by a slab of stone; the pieces must have been interred in a hurry, probably temporarily, as though the owner probably intended to return for them at a later time. The brooches found with the chalice show that it was not buried until the [[Viking]] period. It was sold to George Butler, Catholic [[Bishop of Limerick]], by Quin's mother.

==The chalice==
[[File:Ardagh chalice from below.jpg|thumb|The chalice seen from below]]
The chalice is a large, two-handled silver cup, decorated with gold, gilt bronze, brass, lead pewter and enamel, which has been assembled from 354 separate pieces; this complex construction is typical of early Christian Irish metalwork. The main body of the chalice is formed from two hemispheres of sheet silver joined with a rivet hidden by a [[gilt-bronze]] band. The names of the apostles are incised in a frieze around the bowl, below a girdle bearing inset gold wirework panels of animals, birds, and geometric [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]]. Techniques used include hammering, engraving, [[lost-wax casting]], [[filigree]] [[applique]], [[cloisonné]] and [[vitreous enamel|enamel]]. Even the underside of the chalice is decorated (photo above). 

According to the art historian [[Lawrence Stone]] (writing before the discovery of the [[Derrynaflan Chalice|Derrynaflan Hoard]]): "Here the Irish artist has shown a capacity for classical restraint by a deliberate decision to prevent the ornamentation from spreading so copiously as to blur the proportions... contrasting markedly with the lavish ornamental spread of the almost contemporary [[Tara Brooch]] and the still more elaborate systems of the later period. The bulk of the decoration consists of exquisitely drawn spiral or interlace patterns, given depth by the soldering of two layers of gold thread one on top of the other. At intervals are set cloisonné enamel bosses of blue and red, the complicated manufacture of which shows direct continuity with the Anglo-Saxon jewellers' craft of the preceding century. But apart from the extraordinary perfection of execution of this elaborate decoration, what gives to the Ardagh Chalice its outstanding position in Irish metalwork is the strictness of the relationship between the simple swelling lines of the cup and its base and the arrangement of the glittering studs, bands, and roundels that adorn its surface."&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 18&lt;/ref&gt; The standard monograph is L.S. Gógan, ''The Ardagh Chalice''.

The chalice is similar to the only other major early Irish example to survive, the [[Derrynaflan Chalice]], found in the neighbouring [[County Tipperary]].  That was found with a [[paten]] and liturgical strainer.  At that time the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of [[Munster]] were the [[Eóganachta]], while their allies and possible cousins the [[Uí Fidgenti]] ruled in the Limerick area (see Byrne 2001; Begley 1906). Although the early suggestion that the chalice was [[Metal fabrication|fabricated]] at [[Clonmacnoise]] and stolen from there by a Limerick Dane is widely circulated, this is unprovable. A Munster origin is just as likely if not more so given the 1980 discovery of the sister Derrynaflan Hoard. A Clonmacnoise origin is not mentioned at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150610194650/http://www.museum.ie/en/list/artefacts.aspx?article=bfcd87b3-c3b1-489c-84f3-5c8bc08cc471 The Ardagh Chalice; Object Number: IA:1874.99]. [[National Museum of Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The chalice was featured on a £1 value [[Definitive postage stamps of Ireland|definitive postage stamp]] issued by [[An Post]] between 1990 and 1995 as part of the series ''Irish Heritage and Treasures'' designed by Michael Craig. Two [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] trophies are modelled on the Chalice: the [[O'Duffy Cup]] and the [[Sam Maguire Cup]].

'''Beaumont Street''' is a street in the centre of [[Oxford]], [[England]].

The street was laid out from 1828 to 1837 with elegant terraced houses in the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]]. Before that, it was the location of [[Beaumont Palace]], now noted by a plaque near the junction with [[Walton Street]]. [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] considered it "''the finest street ensemble of Oxford.''"&lt;ref name="pevsner"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Buildings of England: Oxfordshire |last1=Sherwood |first1=Jennifer |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner | year=1974 | publisher=[[Penguin Books]] | pages=324–325 | isbn=0-14-071045-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard I of England]] (reign 6 July 1189 – 6 April 1199) and [[John, King of England]] (reign 6 April 1199 – 19 October 1216) the sons of [[Henry II of England]] were both born at [[Beaumont Palace]] in Oxford on 8 September 1157 and 24 December 1166 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Vivian|title=Kings &amp; Queens|year=1996|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=0-00-472295-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the western end is [[Worcester College]] and the junction with [[Walton Street]] to the north and [[Worcester Street]] to the south. Halfway along to the north is [[St John Street, Oxford|St John Street]]. To the south is the [[Oxford Playhouse]], designed by Sir [[Edward Maufe]] and built in 1938, where many [[University of Oxford|University]] productions are held. To the north at the eastern end is the [[Ashmolean Museum]]. Opposite the eastern end is the [[Martyrs' Memorial]]. Here, Beaumont Street adjoins [[St Giles' Street, Oxford|St Giles']] to the north and [[Magdalen Street]] to the south. Oxford's foremost hotel, the [[Macdonald Randolph Hotel|Randolph]], is on the corner with Magdalen Street, designed by [[William Wilkinson (architect)|William Wilkinson]] in the [[Victorian Gothic]] style and built in 1864.&lt;ref name="pevsner" /&gt; An extension was added in 1952 to the west, designed by [[J. Hopgood]].

The Institute of Archaeology, part of the [[School of Archaeology]] in the [[University of Oxford]], was established in 1962 and is located at 36 Beaumont Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/institute.html Institute of Archaeology], [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/ School of Archaeology], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

In poem "Wherefrom"&lt;ref&gt;"[https://archive.org/details/amongflowersand00bourgoog Among the flowers, and other poems] by Francis William Bourdillon. 1878. Publisher "Marcus Ward"&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Francis William Bourdillon]] a British poet and translator wrote about Beaumont Street legend:


''Just at the end of Beaumont Street,

''In front of Worcester walls,

''Strange shrieks of woe the passer greet,

''As every footstep falls.''


The street is a favoured location for [[dentist]]s and [[physician|doctor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.19beaumontstgp.nhs.uk/ 19 Beaumont Street Surgery — Dr MacLennan &amp; Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014034210/http://www.19beaumontstgp.nhs.uk/ |date=14 October 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.28beaumontstreet.co.uk/ 28 Beaumont Street Medical Practice — Drs Sichel and Ferguson].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.33beaumontstreet.com/ 33 Beaumont Street — Specialist Dental Practice, Oxford].&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also known as the '''Emile Bell''', after a [[#Legend|legend about its casting]], and as the '''Bell of [[Bongdeoksa]] Temple''', where it was first housed.

The bell was commissioned by [[Gyeongdeok of Silla|King Gyeongdeok]] to honor his father, [[Seongdeok of Silla|King Seongdeok]]. However, King Gyeongdeok never lived to see the casting of the bell, as he died in 765 A.D. The bell was finally cast in 771 A.D., during the reign of Gyeongdeok's son, [[Hyegong of Silla|King Hyegong]].

Now stored in the [[Gyeongju National Museum|National Museum]] of [[Gyeongju]], the bell was designated as the 29th [[national treasures of Korea|national treasure of Korea]] on December 12, 1962. It measures 3.33 meters high, 2.27 meters in diameter, and 11 to 25 centimeters in wall thickness. The Gyeongju National Museum weighed it in 1997, and found that its weight was 18.9 tons.&lt;ref&gt;Official Site of Korea Tourism: [http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=804389 The Divine Bell of King Seongdeok]&lt;/ref&gt;

When rung, it is said to have been heard from 40 miles away on a clear day..{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The bell is considered a masterpiece of [[Unified Silla]] art. It is unique among Korean bronze bells because of the presence of a small hollow tube near the hook. The whole structure, including its decorative elements, produces a wide range of sound frequencies; the tube absorbes high frequency waves, contributing to a distinctive [[Beat (acoustics)|beat]].&lt;ref&gt;Beat Maps of King Song-Dok Bell, Beat Map Drawing Method of Bell Type Structures and Beat Maps of the King Seong-deok Divine Bell by Kim Seok Hyun. http://www.ndsl.kr/ Another article can search at JSV 2005.3 by Yi JangMu and Yi CiUk&lt;/ref&gt;

The hook of the bell is in the shape of a [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]'s head. There are many relief patterns on the bell, including are flower patterns along the rim and shoulder. There are also reliefs of [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] flowers, grass reliefs, and a pair of two ''[[apsaras]]es'' (heavenly maidens). The striking point of the bell (''dwangja'') is also in the shape of a lotus and sits between two of the apsarases reliefs. The bottom of the bell is in a [[rhombus|rhombic]] shape, lending it a look unique among bells of [[Orient|the Orient]].

The inscriptions on the bell, over a thousand [[hanja]], are a fine example of [[Korean calligraphy]] and carving. They provide detailed information about the bell and why it was cast.

The column the bell hangs on is quite firm. Even a column made with the same diameter, out of modern [[alloy]] might bend by weight of the bell, yet the bell still hangs on an ancient column that has lasted for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;나의 문화유산답사기(literally ''My Cultural Heritage Exploration''.) book 3 chapter 9, by Yu HengJun&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==
The bell is commonly known as the '''Emile Bell''' in both Korean and English. ''Emile'', pronounced "em-ee-leh," is an ancient [[Silla]] term for "mommy".

According to legend, the first bell that was cast produced no sound when it was struck. The bell was recast many times but with no success. The king that had wanted the bell cast died after a while and his young son took over with the help of the queen. The son carried out what his father had started but still he didn't have any success. Later, a monk dreamed that if a child was cast into the metal, the bell would ring. The monk then took a child from the village and had her cast into the metal. When the bell was complete, the bell made the most beautiful sound when struck.

Some, however, believe the legend may actually be a modern invention, and that the story and name originated in the 1920s. A story that was published about the "Eomilne bell" or "Earmilne bell" (어밀네 종) may have been distorted in retelling.&lt;ref&gt;http://cha.korea.kr/gonews/branch.do?act=detailView&amp;type=news&amp;sectionId=co_sec_1&amp;categoryId=&amp;dataId=155312736 (Korean), also fiction section of the '매일신보(Official newspaper of the [[Governor-General of Korea]], published by the Japanese colonial government). One picture of the link is original text of Earmilne bell. Opponents reference is 326 page of ''The Passing of Korea'' (Homer Bezaleel Hulbert, 1906, a story about other bell in Seoul and Japanese records about 1920).&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent argument is that legend about other bell became confused with the legend of the Emile bell.&lt;ref&gt;326 page of The Passing of Korea.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://orumi.egloos.com/4061904 (Korean) References of this post is a article of journal called Byeolgungon(별건곤, 別乾坤), 23rd(1929.9.27).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Building information modeling ''' ('''BIM''') is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of places. '''Building information models''' ('''BIMs''') are files (often but not always in proprietary formats and containing proprietary data) which can be extracted, exchanged or networked to support decision-making regarding a building or other built asset. Current BIM software is used by individuals, businesses and government agencies who plan, design, construct, operate and maintain diverse [[hard infrastructure|physical infrastructure]]s, such as water, refuse, electricity, gas, communication utilities, roads, railways, bridges, ports and tunnels.

== BIM origins and elements==
The concept of BIM has existed since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles |last1=Eastman |first2=David |last2=Fisher |first3=Gilles |last3=Lafue |first4=Joseph |last4=Lividini |first5=Douglas |last5=Stoker |first6=Christos |last6=Yessios |date=September 1974 |title=An Outline of the Building Description System |publisher=Institute of Physical Planning, Carnegie-Mellon University |url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED113833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|title=BIM Handbook: a Guide to Building Information Modeling for owners, managers, designers, engineers, and contractors|date=2008|publisher=John Wiley|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9780470185285|edition=1st|pages=xi-xii}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 June 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eastman2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eastman|first1=Chuck|last2=Tiecholz|first2=Paul|last3=Sacks|first3=Rafael|last4=Liston|first4=Kathleen|year = 2011 | title =  BIM Handbook: A Guide to Building Information Modeling for Owners, Managers, Designers, Engineers and Contractors | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=2nd |pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'building model' (in the sense of BIM as used today) was first used in papers in the mid-1980s: in a 1985 paper by Simon Ruffle eventually published in 1986,&lt;ref&gt;Ruffle S. (1986) "Architectural design exposed: from computer-aided-drawing to computer-aided-design" Environments and Planning B: Planning and Design 1986 March 7 pp 385-389. [http://epb.sagepub.com/content/13/4/385.abstract Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; and later in a 1986 paper by Robert Aish&lt;ref&gt;Aish, R. (1986) "Building Modelling: The Key to Integrated Construction CAD" CIB 5th International Symposium on the Use of Computers for Environmental Engineering related to Building, 7–9 July.&lt;/ref&gt; - then at [[GMW Architects|GMW Computers Ltd]], developer of [[RUCAPS]] software - referring to the software's use at London's Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref&gt;cited by Laiserin, Jerry (2008), Foreword to Eastman, C., ''et al'' (2008), ''op cit'', p.xii&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Building Information Model' first appeared in a 1992 paper by G.A. van Nederveen and F. P. Tolman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0926-5805(92)90014-B |title=Modelling multiple views on buildings |year=1992 |last1=Van Nederveen |first1=G.A. |last2=Tolman |first2=F.P. |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=215–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the terms 'Building Information Model' and 'Building Information Modeling' (including the acronym "BIM") did not become popularly used until some 10 years later. In 2002, [[Autodesk]] released a [[white paper]] entitled "Building Information Modeling,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laiserin.com/features/bim/autodesk_bim.pdf|title=Autodesk (2002). Building Information Modeling. San Rafael, CA, Autodesk, Inc.|author=|date=|website=laiserin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other software vendors also started to assert their involvement in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2002) "[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue15/feature01.php Comparing Pommes and Naranjas]", ''The Laiserin Letter'', December 16, 2002.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; By hosting contributions from Autodesk, [[Bentley Systems]] and [[Graphisoft]], plus other industry observers, in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/bim/index.php The BIM Page]", ''The Laiserin Letter''.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Laiserin helped popularize and standardize the term as a common name for the digital representation of the building process.&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, in his foreword to Eastman, et al (2008, ''op cit'') disclaimed he had coined the term, adding "it is my opinion that the historical record ... shows that Building Information Modeling was not an innovation attributable solely to any individual or entity." (p.xiii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Facilitating exchange and interoperability of information in digital format had previously been offered under differing terminology by Graphisoft as "Virtual Building", Bentley Systems as "Integrated Project Models", and by Autodesk or Vectorworks as "Building Information Modeling".

The pioneering role of applications such as RUCAPS, [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]] and [[Reflex (building design software)|Reflex]] has been recognized by Laiserin&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://laiserin.com/features/issue17/feature02.php LaiserinLetterLetters]" (see Laiserin's comment to letter from John Mullan), ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 06 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the UK's [[Royal Academy of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="RAEng-Ingram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Philip Medal for engineer behind revolution in Building Information Modelling (22 June 2016)|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/news/news-releases/2016/june/prince-philip-medal-for-engineer-behind-revolution|website=Royal Academy of Engineering|publisher=RAEng|accessdate=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Graphisoft had been developing such solutions for longer than its competitors, Laiserin regarded its [[ArchiCAD]] application as then "one of the most mature BIM solutions on the market."&lt;ref&gt;Laiserin, J. (2003) "[http://www.laiserin.com/features/issue19/feature01.php Graphisoft on BIM]", ''The Laiserin Letter'', January 20, 2003.{{unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following its launch in 1987, ArchiCAD became regarded by some as the first implementation of [[Building Information Modeling|BIM]],&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;Lincoln H. Forbes, Syed M. Ahmed,  (2010) ''Modern Construction: Lean Project Delivery and Integrated Practices'', CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cinti Luciani, S. Garagnani, R. Mingucci (2012) "BIM tools and design intent. Limitations and opportunities", in K. Kensek, J. Peng, ''Practical BIM 2012 - Management, Implementation, Coordination and Evaluation'', Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; as it was the first CAD product on a personal computer able to create both 2D and 3D geometry, as well as the first commercial BIM product for personal computers.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;&lt;ref name=Quirk&gt;{{cite web|last1=Quirk|first1=Vanessa|title=A Brief History of BIM|url=http://www.archdaily.com/302490/a-brief-history-of-bim|website=Arch Daily|date=7 December 2012|accessdate=14 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

==Definition==
The US National Building Information Model Standard Project Committee has the following definition:

:''Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a digital representation of physical and functional characteristics of a facility. A BIM is a shared knowledge resource for information about a facility forming a reliable basis for decisions during its life-cycle; defined as existing from earliest conception to demolition.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |title=Frequently Asked Questions About the National BIM Standard-United States - National BIM Standard - United States |publisher=Nationalbimstandard.org |accessdate=17 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016190503/http://www.nationalbimstandard.org/faq.php#faq1 |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional building design was largely reliant upon two-dimensional [[technical drawings]] (plans, elevations, sections, etc.). Building information modeling extends this beyond [[3D modeling|3D]], augmenting the three primary spatial dimensions (width, height and depth) with time as the fourth dimension ([[4D BIM|4D]])&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-01&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|title=4D BIM or Simulation-Based Modeling|publisher=structuremag.org|date=|accessdate=29 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528051608/http://structuremag.org/article.aspx?articleID=1234|archivedate=28 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cost as the fifth ([[5D BIM|5D]]).&lt;ref name=4DBIM-R-02&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cadsoft-consult.com/blogs/architecture/2009/09/ashrae-introduction-to-bim-4d-and-5d/|title= ASHRAE Introduction to BIM, 4D and 5D |publisher=cadsoft-consult.com |date= |accessdate=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
More recently there are also references to a sixth dimension (6D) representing building environmental and sustainability aspects, and a seventh dimension (7D) for through-life facility management, although there are conflicting definitions ([[6D BIM]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Theory of Evolution BIM 3D-7D|url=https://bimestimate.eu/en/the-theory-of-evolution-bim-3d-7d/|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BIM 3D, 4D, 5D, 6D, 7D|url=http://www.bimpanzee.com/bim-3d-4d--5d--6d---7d.html|accessdate=5 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
BIM therefore covers more than just geometry. It also covers spatial relationships, light analysis, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components (for example, manufacturers' details).

BIM involves representing a design as combinations of "objects" – vague and undefined, generic or product-specific, solid shapes or void-space oriented (like the shape of a room), that carry their geometry, relations and attributes. BIM design tools allow extraction of different views from a building model for drawing production and other uses. These different views are automatically consistent, being based on a single definition of each object instance.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"&gt;{{cite web |last=Eastman |first=Chuck |date=August 2009 |title=What is BIM? |url=http://bim.arch.gatech.edu/?id=402}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM software also defines objects parametrically; that is, the objects are defined as parameters and relations to other objects, so that if a related object is amended, dependent ones will automatically also change.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt; Each model element can carry attributes for selecting and ordering them automatically, providing cost estimates as well as material tracking and ordering.&lt;ref name = "Eastman, C"/&gt;

For the professionals involved in a project, BIM enables a virtual information model to be handed from the design team ([[architect]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[surveying|surveyor]]s, [[civil engineering|civil]], [[structural engineering|structural]] and [[building services]] [[engineer]]s, etc.) to the main contractor and subcontractors and then on to the owner/operator; each professional adds discipline-specific data to the single shared model. This reduces information losses that traditionally occurred when a new team takes 'ownership' of the project, and provides more extensive information to owners of complex structures.

==BIM throughout the project life-cycle==
Use of BIM goes beyond the planning and design phase of the project, extending throughout the building life cycle, supporting processes including [[cost management]], [[construction management]], [[project management]] and [[facilities management|facility operation]].

===Management of building information models===
Building information models span the whole concept-to-occupation time-span. To ensure efficient management of information processes throughout this span, a BIM manager (also sometimes defined as a [[Virtual design and construction|virtual design-to-construction]], VDC, project manager – VDCPM) might be appointed. The BIM manager is retained by a design build team on the client's behalf from the pre-design phase onwards to develop and to track the object-oriented BIM against predicted and measured performance objectives, supporting multi-disciplinary building information models that drive analysis, schedules, take-off and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=/ep/channel/gsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112145341/http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/channelView.do?pageTypeId=17109&amp;channelPage=%2Fep%2Fchannel%2FgsaOverview.jsp&amp;channelId=-24291|date=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|title=Senate Properties modeling guidelines|publisher=Gsa.gov|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226194436/http://www.senaatti.fi/document.asp?siteID=2&amp;docID=588|archivedate=26 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies are also now considering developing BIMs in various levels of detail, since depending on the application of BIM, more or less detail is needed, and there is varying modeling effort associated with generating building information models at different levels of detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.autcon.2010.11.027 |title=Analysis of modeling effort and impact of different levels of detail in building information models |year=2011 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akcamete |first2=Asli |last3=Akinci |first3=Burcu |last4=Atasoy |first4=Guzide |last5=Kiziltas |first5=Semiha |journal=Automation in Construction |volume=20 |issue=5 |pages=601–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BIM in construction management===
Participants in the building process are constantly challenged to deliver successful projects despite tight budgets, limited manpower, accelerated schedules, and limited or conflicting information. The significant disciplines such as [[Architectural engineering|architectural]], [[Structural engineering|structural]] and [[mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]] designs should be well coordinated, as two things can’t take place at the same place and time. Building Information Modeling aids in collision detection at the initial stage, identifying the exact location of discrepancies.  
   
The BIM concept envisages virtual construction of a facility prior to its actual physical construction, in order to reduce uncertainty, improve safety, work out problems, and simulate and analyze potential impacts.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Deke |last1=Smith |year=2007 |title=An Introduction to Building Information Modeling (BIM) |journal=Journal of Building Information Modeling |url=http://www.wbdg.org/pdfs/jbim_fall07.pdf |pages=12–4}}{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sub-contractors from every trade can input critical information into the model before beginning construction, with opportunities to pre-fabricate or pre-assemble some systems off-site. Waste can be minimised on-site and products delivered on a just-in-time basis rather than being stock-piled on-site.&lt;ref name = "Smith 2007"/&gt;

Quantities and shared properties of materials can be extracted easily. Scopes of work can be isolated and defined. Systems, assemblies and sequences can be shown in a relative scale with the entire facility or group of facilities. BIM also prevents errors by enabling conflict or 'clash detection' whereby the computer model visually highlights to the team where parts of the building (e.g.:structural frame and building services pipes or ducts) may wrongly intersect.

===BIM in facility operation===
BIM can bridge the information loss associated with handling a project from design team, to construction team and to building owner/operator, by allowing each group to add to and reference back to all information they acquire during their period of contribution to the BIM model. This can yield benefits to the facility owner or operator.

For example, a building owner may find evidence of a leak in his building.  Rather than exploring the physical building, he may turn to the model and see that  a water [[valve]] is located in the suspect location.  He could also have in the model the specific valve size, manufacturer, part number, and any other information ever researched in the past, pending adequate computing power. Such problems were initially addressed by Leite and Akinci when developing a vulnerability representation of facility contents and threats for supporting the identification of vulnerabilities in building emergencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1061/(ASCE)CP.1943-5487.0000171 |title=Formalized Representation for Supporting Automated Identification of Critical Assets in Facilities during Emergencies Triggered by Failures in Building Systems |year=2012 |last1=Leite |first1=Fernanda |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |journal=Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic information about the building, such as sensor measurements and control signals from the building systems, can also be incorporated within BIM software to support analysis of building operation and maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1061/41052(346)10 |chapter=Requirements and Evaluation of Standards for Integration of Sensor Data with Building Information Models |title=Computing in Civil Engineering |year=2009 |last1=Liu |first1=Xuesong |last2=Akinci |first2=Burcu |isbn=978-0-7844-1052-3 |pages=95–104 |editor1-first=Carlos H. |editor1-last=Caldas |editor2-first=William J. |editor2-last=O'Brien}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been attempts at creating information models for older, pre-existing facilities. Approaches include referencing key metrics such as the [[Facility Condition Index]] (FCI), or using [[3D scanner|3D laser-scanning]] surveys and [[photogrammetry]] techniques (both separately or in combination) to capture accurate measurements of the asset that can be used as the basis for a model. Trying to model a building constructed in, say 1927, requires numerous assumptions about design standards, building codes, construction methods, materials, etc., and is therefore more complex than building a model during design.

One of the challenges to the proper maintenance and management of existing facilities is understanding how BIM can be utilized to support a holistic understanding and implementation of [[Facility management|building management]] practices and “[[Total cost of ownership|cost of ownership]]” principles that support the full life cycle of a building.&amp;nbsp; An [[American National Standards Institute|American National Standard]] entitled ''APPA 1000 – Total Cost of Ownership for Facilities Asset Management'' incorporates BIM to factor in a variety of critical requirements and costs over the [[Life-cycle assessment|life-cycle]] of the building, including but not limited to: replacement of energy, utility, and safety systems; continual maintenance of the building exterior and interior and replacement of materials; updates to design and functionality; and recapitalization costs.

=== BIM in land administration and cadastre ===
BIM can potentially offer some benefit for managing stratified [[cadastre|cadastral]] spaces in urban built environments. The first benefit would be enhancing visual communication of interweaved, stacked and complex cadastral spaces for non-specialists. The rich amount of spatial and semantic information about physical structures inside models can aid comprehension of cadastral boundaries, providing an unambiguous delineation of ownership, rights, responsibilities and restrictions. Additionally, using BIM to manage cadastral information could advance current land administration systems from a 2D-based and analogue data environment into a 3D digital, intelligent, interactive and dynamic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atazadeh|first=Behnam|last2=Kalantari|first2=Mohsen|last3=Rajabifard|first3=Abbas|last4=Ho|first4=Serene|last5=Ngo|first5=Tuan|date=2016-03-01|title=Building Information Modelling for High-rise Land Administration|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tgis.12199/abstract|journal=Transactions in GIS|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/tgis.12199|issn=1467-9671}}&lt;/ref&gt; BIM could also unlock value in the cadastral information by forming a bridge between that information and the interactive lifecycle and management of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/Global/Land_Journal_March-April_2016.pdf#page24|title=Filling the space|author1=Behnam Atazadeh |author2=Mohsen Kalantari |author3=Abbas Rajabifard |author4=Tom Champion |date=23 February 2016|website=RICS Land Journal|publisher=Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BIM software==
The first software tools developed for modelling buildings emerged in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and included workstation products such as Chuck Eastman's Building Description System and GLIDE, [[RUCAPS]], [[Sonata (building design software)|Sonata]], Reflex and [[Gable CAD|Gable 4D Series]]. The early applications, and the hardware needed to run them, were expensive, which limited widespread adoption. ArchiCAD's Radar CH, released in 1984 was the first modelling software made available on a personal computer.&lt;ref name=Quirk /&gt;

Due to the complexity of gathering all the relevant information when working with BIM on a building project some companies have developed software designed specifically to work in a BIM framework. These packages differ from architectural drafting tools such as [[AutoCAD]] by allowing the addition of further information (time, cost, manufacturers' details, sustainability and maintenance information, etc.) to the building model.

There is a BIM module in open source CAD software [[FreeCAD]].

===Non-proprietary or openBIM standards===
BIM is often associated with [[Industry Foundation Classes]] (IFCs) and [[aecXML]] – data structures for representing information. IFCs have been developed by [[buildingSMART]] (the former International Alliance for Interoperability), as a neutral, non-proprietary or open standard for sharing BIM data among different software applications (some proprietary data structures have been developed by CAD vendors incorporating BIM into their software).

Poor software interoperability has long been regarded as an obstacle to industry efficiency in general and to BIM adoption in particular. In August 2004 a US National Institute of Standards and Technology ([[NIST]]) report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gallaher |first1=Michael P. |last2=O'Connor |first2=Alan C. |last3=Dettbarn |first3=John L. |last4=Gilday |first4=Linda T. |date=August 2004 |title=Cost Analysis of Inadequate Interoperability in the U.S. Capital Facilities Industry |doi=10.6028/NIST.GCR.04-867 |publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology |page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservatively estimated that $15.8 billion was lost annually by the U.S. capital facilities industry due to inadequate interoperability arising from "the highly fragmented nature of the industry, the industry’s continued paperbased business practices, a lack of standardization, and inconsistent technology adoption among stakeholders".

An early example of a nationally approved BIM standard is the AISC ([[American Institute of Steel Construction]])-approved CIS/2 standard, a non-proprietary standard with its roots in the UK.

====Malaysia====
BIM implementation is targeted towards BIM Stage 2 by the year 2020 led by the Construction Industry Development Board (CIDB Malaysia). Under the Construction Industry Master Plan 2016-2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CITP|url = http://www.citp.my/|website = www.citp.my|access-date = 2016-02-12|last = CITP}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is hoped more emphasis on technology adoption across the project life-cycle will induce higher productivity.

====Singapore====
The Building and Construction Authority (BCA) has announced that BIM would be introduced for architectural submission (by 2013), structural and M&amp;E submissions (by 2014) and eventually for plan submissions of all projects with gross floor area of more than 5,000 square metres by 2015. The BCA Academy is training students in BIM.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bca.gov.sg/publications/BuildSmart/others/buildsmart_11issue9.pdf BuildSmart]'' (BCA magazine), December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Korea====
Small BIM-related seminars and independent BIM effort existed in South Korea even in the 1990s. However, it was not until the late 2000s that the Korean industry paid attention to BIM. The first industry-level BIM conference was held in April, 2008, after which, BIM has been spread very rapidly. Since 2010, the Korean government has been gradually increasing the scope of BIM-mandated projects. McGraw Hill published a detailed report in 2012 on the status of BIM adoption and implementation in South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://analyticsstore.construction.com/index.php/2012-business-value-of-bim-in-korea-smartmarket-report-english.html|title=Lee, G., J.

====United Arab Emirates====
Dubai Municipality issued a circular (196) in 2014 mandating BIM use for buildings of a certain size, height or type. The one page circular initiated strong interest in BIM and the market responded in preparation for more guidelines and direction. In 2015 the Municipality issued another circular (207) titled 'Regarding the expansion of applying the (BIM) on buildings and facilities in the emirate of Dubai' which made BIM mandatory on more projects by reducing the minimum size and height requirement for projects requiring BIM. This second circular drove BIM adoption further with several projects and organizations adopting UK BIM standards as best practice. In 2016, the UAE's Quality and Conformity Commission set up a BIM steering group to investigate statewide adoption of BIM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionweekonline.com/article-36590-bim-summit-2015-calls-for-greater-co-operation/|title= BIM Summit 2015 calls for greater co-operation|publisher=ConstructionWeekOnline.com|accessdate= 6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Through the new D.l. 50, in April 2016 Italy has included into its own legislation several European directives including 2014/24/EU on Public Procurement. The decree states among the main goals of public procurement the "rationalization of designing activities and of all connected verification processes, through the progressive adoption of digital methods and electronic instruments such as Building and Infrastructure Information Modelling".&lt;ref&gt;D.lgs. 50/2006, art. 38 com. 1 lett. h&lt;/ref&gt; A norm in 8 parts is also being written to support the transition: UNI 11337-1, UNI 11337-4 and UNI 11337-5 were published in January 2017, with five further chapters to follow within a year.

In early 2018 the Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport issued a decree creating a governmental BIM Mandate compelling public client organisations to adopt a digital approach by 2025, with an incremental obligation which will start on 1 January 2019.&lt;ref name="Ciribini-21Mar2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ciribini|first1=Angelo|last2=De Giuda|first2=Giuseppe|last3=Valaguzza|first3=Sara|title=UK PROCUREMENT FRAMEWORK INFORMS ITALY’S MOVE TO MANDATE BIM|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/people/uk-procurement-framework-informs-italys-move-manda/|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=BIM Plus|date=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Norway====
In Norway BIM has been used increasingly since 2008. Several large public clients require use of BIM in open formats (IFC) in most or all of their projects. The Government Building Authority bases its processes on BIM in open formats to increase process speed and quality, and all large and several small and medium-sized contractors use BIM. National BIM development is centred around the local organisation, buildingSMART Norway which represents 25% of the Norwegian construction industry.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The BIM Association of Slovakia, "BIMaS", was established in January 2013 as the first Slovakian professional organisation focused on BIM. Although there are neither standards nor legislative requirements to deliver projects in BIM, many architects, structural engineers and contractors, plus a few investors are already applying BIM. A Slovakian implementation strategy created by BIMaS and supported by the Chamber of Civil Engineers and Chamber of Architects has yet to be approved by Slovakian authorities due to their low interest in such innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bimas.sk BIMaS.sk], BIMaS website. Accessed: 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
A July 2015 meeting at Spain’s Ministry of Infrastructure [Ministerio de Fomento] launched the country’s national BIM strategy, making BIM a mandatory requirement on public sector projects with a possible starting date of 2018.&lt;ref name=BIMplusSpain&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knutt|first1=Elaine|title=Spain launches BIM strategy with pencilled-in 2018 mandate|url=http://www.bimplus.co.uk/news/spain-launches-bim-strategy-pencilled-2018-mandate/|accessdate=20 August 2015|work=Construction Manager: BIMplus|date=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a February 2015 BIM summit in Barcelona, professionals in Spain's [[Autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of [[Catalonia]] established a BIM commission (ITeC) to drive the adoption of BIM in the region.&lt;ref name="ITeC"&gt;{{cite web|title=La Comissió Construïm el Futur (transl: The Commission Building the Future)|url=https://itec.cat/serveis/bim/comissio-construim-el-futur/|website=ITeC|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
Since 2009 through the initiative of buildingSmart Switzerland, then 2013, BIM awareness among a broader community of engineers and architects was raised due to the open competition for [[Basel]]'s Felix Platter Hospital&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110135358/http://www.felixplatterspital.ch/fileadmin/pdf/Neubau/Gesamtleistungswettbewerb_Felix_Platter_Spital_simap.pdf|date=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a BIM coordinator was sought. BIM has also been a subject of events by the Swiss Society for Engineers and Architects, SIA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sia.ch/de/der-sia/berufsgruppen/technik/jahrestagung-2013|title=jahrestagung 2013 - sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|work=sia - schweizerischer ingenieur- und architektenverein|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====

In May 2011 UK Government [[Chief Construction Adviser to UK Government|Chief Construction Adviser]] [[Paul Morrell]] called for BIM adoption on UK government construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/roundtable/|title=BIM Roundtable Discussion|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell also told construction professionals to adopt BIM or be "Betamaxed out".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/news/adopt-bim-or-be-betamaxed-out-says-morrell/5018263.article|title=Adopt bim or be 'Betamaxed out' says Morrell|work=Building Design|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2011 the UK government published its BIM strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ktn.innovateuk.org/web/modernbuiltktn/articles/-/blogs/new-construction-strategy?ns_33_redirect=%2Fweb%2Fmodernbuiltktn%2Farticles|title=Modern Built Environment - innovateuk|publisher=Ktn.innovateuk.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; announcing its intention to require collaborative 3D BIM (with all project and asset information, documentation and data being electronic) on its projects by 2016. Initially, compliance will require building data to be delivered in a vendor-neutral '[[COBie]]' format, thus overcoming the limited interoperability of BIM software suites available on the market. The UK Government [[BIM Task Group]] led the government's BIM programme and requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bimtaskgroup.org/|title=BIM Task Group - A UK Government Initiative|publisher=Bimtaskgroup.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a free-to-use set of UK standards and tools that define 'level 2 BIM'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://toolkit.thenbs.com/articles/the-level-2-bim-package|title=The level-2 BIM package|publisher=BIM Task Group|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the UK Government published a new central web portal as a point of reference for the industry for BIM Level 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bim-level2.org/ |title=BIM Level 2|publisher=BSI Group|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIM Task Group continues to develop BIM adoption within the government departments.

Outside of government, industry adoption of BIM from 2016 has been led by the UK BIM Alliance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/|title=UK BIM Alliance|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed to champion and enable the implementation of BIM Level 2 by 2020, and to connect and represent organisations, groups and individuals working towards digital transformation of the UK's built environment industry. Established as an independent, not-for-profit, collaboratively-based organisation, the UK BIM Alliance's structure has been developed around an executive team&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukbimalliance.org/about-us/executive-team/|title=UKBIMA Executive Team|first=WebCider Business|last=Solutions|date=|website=ukbimalliance.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three core activity areas: engagement, programme and operations (internal support and secretariat functions).

[[National Building Specification]] (NBS), owned by the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), publishes research into BIM adoption in the UK. There have now been six annual surveys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/puttingTheIintoBIM.asp|title=Putting the 'I' into BIM|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2012.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2012|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbsNationalBimSurvey_2013.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2013|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/bim/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2014.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2014|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenbs.com/topics/BIM/articles/nbs-national-bim-report-2015.asp|title=NBS National BIM Report 2015|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NBS2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thenbs.com/knowledge/national-bim-report-2016|title=NBS National BIM Report 2016|publisher=Thenbs.com|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The April 2016 survey of 1,000 UK construction professionals revealed that BIM adoption had increased from 13% in 2010 to 54% in 2015.&lt;ref name="NBS2016" /&gt;

===North America===

====Canada====
Several organizations support BIM adoption and implementation in Canada: the Canada BIM Council (CANBIM, founded in 2008),&lt;ref name="Canada BIM Council"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canbim.com/ |title=Canada BIM Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institute for BIM in Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibc-bim.ca/ |title=Institute for BIM in Canada (IBC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[buildingSMART Canada]] (the Canadian chapter of [[buildingSMART]] International).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buildingsmartcanada.ca/ |title=buildingSMART Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States of America====
The [[Associated General Contractors of America]] and US contracting firms have developed various working definitions of BIM that describe it generally as:

:''an object-oriented building development tool that utilizes 3-D modeling concepts, information technology and software interoperability to design, construct and operate a building project, as well as communicate its details.''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Although the concept of BIM and relevant processes are being explored by contractors, architects and [[real estate developers|developers]] alike, the term itself has been questioned and debated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|title=AECbytes Archived Articles|publisher=Aecbytes.com|accessdate=17 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021134606/http://www.aecbytes.com/newsletter/2004/issue_5.html|archivedate=21 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with alternatives including [[Virtual Building Environment]] (VBE) and virtual design and construction (VDC) also considered. Unlike some countries such as the UK, the US has not adopted a set of national BIM guidelines, allowing different systems to remain in competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/setting-a-standard-in-building-information-modeling_o|title=Setting a Standard in Building Information Modeling (Architect Magazine)|last=Shapiro|first=Gideon Fink|date=May 2, 2014|website=www.architectmagazine.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BIM is seen to be closely related to [[Integrated Project Delivery]] (IPD) where the primary motive is to bring the teams together early on in the project.&lt;ref&gt;AIA, C.C., A working Definition: Integrated Project Delivery. 2007, McGraw Hill Construction{{page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full implementation of BIM also requires the project teams to collaborate from the inception stage and formulate model sharing and ownership contract documents.

The [[American Institute of Architects]] has defined BIM as "a model-based technology linked with a database of project information",{{ref|definition}} and this reflects the general reliance on database technology as the foundation. In the future, structured text documents such as [[specifications]] may be able to be searched and linked to regional, national, and international standards.

===Africa===

====Nigeria====
BIM has the potential to play a vital role in the Nigerian AEC sector. In addition to its potential clarity and transparency it may help promote standardization across the industry. For instance, Utiome&lt;ref&gt;Utiome, Erezi, Drogemuller, Robin, &amp; Docherty, Michael (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/76076/ "BIM-based lifecycle planning and specifications for sustainable cities of the future : a conceptual approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that, in conceptualizing a BIM-based knowledge transfer framework from industrialized economies to urban construction projects in developing nations, generic BIM objects can benefit from rich building information within specification parameters in product libraries, and used for efficient, streamlined design and construction. Similarly, an assessment of the current 'state of the art' by Kori&lt;ref&gt;Kori, S. (2013). Toward Adoption of Building Information Modelling in the Nigeria AEC industry. MSc, University of Salford, Manchester.&lt;/ref&gt; found that medium and large firms were leading the adoption of BIM in the industry. Smaller firms were less advanced with respect to process and policy adherence.
There is little or less adoption of BIM in the built environment due to resistive nature of construction industry to changes or new ways of doing things. Till now, Nigerian construction industry is still working with the 2D conventional CAD system in services and structural designs, although the production could be in 3D system. There is virtually 0% utilization of 4D and 5D systems.

====South Africa====
The South African BIM Institute, established in May 2015, aims to enable technical experts to discuss digital construction solutions that can be adopted by professionals working within the construction sector. Its initial task was to promote the SA BIM Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biminstitute.org.za/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no mandated or national best practice BIM standards or protocols in South Africa. Organisations implement company-specific BIM standards and protocols at best (there are isolated examples of cross-industry alliances).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In February 2016, Infrastructure Australia recommended: "Governments should make the use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) mandatory for the design of large-scale complex infrastructure projects. In support of a mandatory rollout, the Australian Government should commission the Australasian Procurement and Construction Council, working with industry, to develop appropriate guidance around the adoption and use of BIM; and common standards and protocols to be applied when using BIM.”&lt;ref name="BIMCrunchFeb2016"&gt;{{cite news|title=Infrastructure Australia recommend BIM mandate for large-scale projects|url=http://bimcrunch.com/2016/02/infrastructure-australia-recommend-bim-mandate-for-large-scale-projects/|accessdate=16 August 2016|work=BIM Crunch|date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Zealand====
In 2015, many projects in the rebuilding of [[Christchurch]] were being assembled in detail on a computer using BIM well before workers set foot on the site. The New Zealand government started a BIM acceleration committee, as part of a productivity partnership with the goal of 20 per cent more efficiency in the construction industry by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;''New Zealand Herald'', Tuesday 14 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anticipated future potential==
BIM is a relatively new technology in an industry typically slow to adopt change. Yet many early adopters are confident that BIM will grow to play an even more crucial role in building documentation.&lt;ref name=kensek2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kensek|first1=Karen|last2=Noble|first2=Douglas|year = 2014 | title =  Building Information Modeling:  BIM in Current and Future Practice | location = Hoboken, New Jersey|publisher=John Wiley|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents claim that BIM offers:
#Improved visualization
#Improved productivity due to easy retrieval of information
#Increased coordination of construction documents
#Embedding and linking of vital information such as vendors for specific materials, location of details and quantities required for estimation and tendering
#Increased speed of delivery
#Reduced costs

BIM also contains most of the data needed for [[building performance]] analysis.&lt;ref name=Kensek1&gt;{{cite book|last=Kensek|first=Karen|year = 2014 | title = Building Information Modeling | location = Hoboken, New York|publisher=Routledge|edition=1st |pages=152–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building properties in BIM can be used to automatically create the input file for [[building performance simulation]] and save a significant amount of time and effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmani Asl|first=Mohammad|author2=Saied Zarrinmehr|author3=Wei Yan|title=Towards BIM-based Parametric Building Energy Performance Optimization|journal=ACADIA 2013|url=http://cumincad.scix.net/cgi-bin/works/Show?acadia13_101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, automation of this process reduce errors and mismatches in the building performance simulation process.

[[Green Building XML]] (gbXML) is an emerging schema, a subset of the Building Information Modeling efforts, focused on green building design and operation. gbXML is used as input in several energy simulation engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gbxml.org/|title=Welcome - Green Building XML Schema|publisher=Gbxml.org|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of modern computer technology, a large number of building performance simulation tools are available. When choosing which simulation tool to use, the user must consider the tool's accuracy and reliability, considering the building information they have at hand, which will serve as input for the tool. Yezioro, Dong and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.04.014 |title=An applied artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation tools |year=2008 |last1=Yezioro |first1=Abraham |last2=Dong |first2=Bing |last3=Leite |first3=Fernanda |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=612–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed an artificial intelligence approach towards assessing building performance simulation results and found that more detailed simulation tools have the best simulation performance in terms of heating and cooling electricity consumption within 3% of mean absolute error.

Explorations are underway to pair computer network users' personal, private and public authentication choices, geographic mapping systems and evolving cloud computing security architecture models, together, to offer customers of geospatial securitization services intuitive new ways to organize their personal, private and public applications and storage.  For individuals, businesses and government authorities who generate and manage building information, new ways to discover, share and work on data, within the context of particular places on earth, will be offered.  David Plager, AIA, conjectures that today's web will give way to tomorrow's geo-web where data will be structured first by place (e.g. a postal address) and then by space (Personal (one user), Private (a group of users) and Public (all users)).{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===BIM-GIS integration===
#Industrial Foundation Class (IFC) and City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) are two primary and popular standards for BIM-[[GIS]] integration.
#BIM provides improved solutions for satisfying user requirements with BIM-GIS integration supported by spatio-temporal analysis.&lt;ref name=song&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Yongze|author2=Xiangyu Wang|title=Trends and Opportunities of BIM-GIS Integration in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction Industry: A Review from a Spatio-Temporal Statistical Perspective|journal=ISPRS Int. J. Geo-Inf.|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2220-9964/6/12/397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building information science===
BIM will develop as building information science involving systematic theories, concepts, methods, technologies, applications and management for the digitization, visualization, quantitative analysis and decision-making of whole project life cycles in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry.&lt;ref name=song /&gt;

The '''Church of the Holy Saviour''' (or  ''Badia Grande'') is a [[Catholic]] Church located in  [[Alcamo]], in the [[province of Trapani]].

== Description ==
This Church, adjoining the nunnery of ''Badia Grande'' (today a grammar school) was already existing in 1300, it was rebuilt then in the middle of the 16th century and in the years 1690–97. it was restored in 1737 and embellished with [[stucco]]es.
Very interesting are the classical [[façade]], with portals in the windows, and its square [[bell-tower]], with four [[pointed arch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weagoo.com/it/card/13545/chiesa-del-ss-salvatore&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church was closed for several years because of the damages suffered during the [[1968 Belice earthquake]]. Until some years ago, every Wednesday evening they celebrated the [[Holy Mass]] in Latin, accompanied by the [[Gregorian chant]] and polyphonic ones of the del [[choir]] Jacopone da Todi. Inside the Church there are cultural activities connected with the sacred chants, the old one in particular, thanks to the same choir that uses this building on Sunday afternoon and on Wednesday evening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alqamah.it/2013/06/17/tela-del-700-restaurata-tornera-nella-chiesa-del-ss-salvatore-di-alcamo/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Works ===
The church has one nave with a [[barrel vault]] and five altars.
Inside it there are beautiful works of great artistic value, among which ten [[stucco]] statues:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trapaniplus.it/schedacosedavedere.php?cosadavedere=141&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two great angels in the  [[Presbytery (architecture)|presbitery]] and eight [[allegorical]] statues on the walls (Religion, Faith, Patience, Renounce to World, Vigilance, Happiness, Charity and Hope) made by Serpotta’s pupil, Bartolomeo Sanseverino (1758). 
* The [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] (1759–60), a painting on the high altar 
* [[saint Benedict]] among a group of saints, a [[fresco]] on the vault by [[Carlo Brunetti]] 
* the sacrificial Lamb among Angels, a fresco on the vault by Carlo Brunetti 
* Saint [[Benedict of Nursia]], a marble statue realized by [[Antonino Gagini]] (1545) 
* The [[Ecstasy of Saint Teresa]], assigned to  [[Pietro Novelli]], on the first right altar 
* The [[Assumption of Mary]], assigned to Pietro Novelli, on the first left altar
* The [[Annunciation]]: oval paintings by [[Baldassare Massa]]
In 1982 the ovals of the Annunciation were stolen, together with the [[high reliefs]] of [[saint Michael the Archangel]] and with saint [[John Baptist]], one of them was bought again at  [[Sotheby's]] auction in  1994 for 25 millions of liras.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricd.it/files/resources/201106170939550.17.06%20-%20Ad%20Alcamo%20chiesa%20riapre%20dopo%2043%20anni.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Tabernacle ===
The marble  [[tabernacle]], in high relief and about four metres high, was made by Antonino Gagini and  Baldassare Massa (1557–1558). The [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]], among for kneeling angels, is surmounted by a [[Crucifix]] above the figures of  [[saint John the Apostle]], the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Holy Ghost]] as a dove and among four angels’ heads:[5]  there are also the scene of the [[Flagellation]] and the figure of saint John Baptist with Jesus’[[baptism]], saint Michael the Archangel while defeating [[Satan]],  the chasing away of the rebel angels into [[hell]], and finally the [[coat of arms]] of Alcamo and  of  the [[abbess]] Margherita di Montesa.&lt;ref name="guad"&gt;Gianni Guadalupi, Mariano Coppola, Alcamo, introduzione di Vincenzo Regina(collana Grand Tour), Milano, Grafiche Mazzucchelli, 1995, {{ISBN|88 216 0615 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

She made Baldassare Massa (a sculptor from Palermo) complete the work started by  [[Gagini]] and inserted seven scenes of the [[Passion of Jesus]], two oval paintings representing saint Benedict and the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Redeemer]], and a depiction of [[God the Father]] with his open arms. 
The marble tabernacle of the [[Holy Sacrament]] was later gilded by Giovan Leonardo Bagolino, a painter from [[Verona]] and [[Sebastiano Bagolino]]’s father.&lt;ref name="guad"/&gt;

== Nunnery ==
The sisters of the [[nunnery]] came from noble families; besides religious practices, they created works of sacred [[handicraft]] such as plastic polish and ceroplastics, and probably [[vestments]].
To avoid the suppression of the convent, owing to the 1866 Laws, they opened a school from  1862 onwards; in fact the sisters administrated a College for Civil Damsels with three classes working inside it;&lt;ref name=conc&gt;Carlo Cataldo: La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.226; ed.Campo, Alcamo, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; besides reading and writing correctly, they devoted themselves to [[embroidery]], the study of [[arithmetics]], geography and Italian. In the final year they studied history, music and French; the boarding fee also included  books, equipment and any [[medical care]].

The convent was suppressed in 1906: the remaining nuns were moved to the nunnery of [[Badia Nuova]], and the premises were first used as barracks, then as schools (primary, nursery  and training  school). 
Today they are utilised by the secondary school "[[Pietro Maria Rocca]]".&lt;ref name=conc/&gt;

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5201">'''Contemporary Tibetan art''' refers to the art of modern Tibet, or Tibet after 1950. It can also refer to art by the [[Tibetan diaspora]], which is explicitly political and religious in nature. Contemporary Tibetan art includes modern [[thangka]] (religious scroll paintings) that resemble ancient thangka, as well as radical, [[avant-garde]], works.

==Historical Tibetan art==
For more than a thousand years, [[Tibetan art]]ists have played a key role in the cultural life of [[Tibet]]. From designs for painted furniture to elaborate murals in religious buildings, their efforts have permeated virtually every facet of life on the [[Tibetan plateau]]. The vast majority of surviving artworks created before the mid-20th century are dedicated to the depiction of religious subjects, for the most part being distemper on cloth or murals. They were commissioned by religious establishments or by pious individuals for use within the practice of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and were manufactured in large workshops by uncredited artists. These works not only document spiritual concepts but also demonstrate the vitality of Tibetan [[aesthetics]] over the centuries in terms of the cross-fertilisation of stylistic influences from other Chinese, Nepalese, and Indian styles.

== After 1950 ==
Historical Tibetan art followed a formal system of art making that was used to spread Tibetan religious culture.  However, in 1950, the [[People's Republic of China]] gained sovereignty over [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] while still granting autonomy to the area.  This changed the social reality of life in Tibet, and modern Tibetan artists use their work as a mode of self-expression and exploration of their new, complex national identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anonymous: Contemporary Tibetan Art|last=Weingeist|first=Rachel Perera|publisher=ArtAsiaPacific|year=2013|isbn=|location=Hong Kong|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Tibetan artwork often conflicts with traditional artwork commissioned for religious purposes, and identity was largely tied to place, family lines, [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan language]], and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], with art serving as the transmission of the religion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, Tibetan art after 1950 raises questions of how [[globalization]] effects national and [[cultural identity]], the conflict between tradition and modernity, and the influence of religion in a more [[Secularity|secular]] age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gyatso|first=Nathalie|date=July 1, 2008|title=Tibetan Art Today|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;AuthType=ip,uid&amp;db=aft&amp;AN=505320320&amp;scope=site|journal=Art Press|volume=347|pages=52–59|via=EBSCO Host}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyatso's work incorporates pencils and stickers on paper using the technique of the Tibetan thankga.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He applies kitsch stickers to penciled images of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], and often adds commentary in speech bubbles.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These colorful children's stickers often take the form of characters from American movies and media, such as [[The Simpsons]] and [[Spider-Man|Spiderman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gonkargyatso.com/exhibition/2015|title=Exhibitions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a cheap, consumerist appearance that contrasts with the meticulous and deliberate nature of their application.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These images draw the viewer's attention to the conflict between the meditative and spiritual aspects of Buddhism and worldly materialism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gyatso draws on his training in traditional art techniques to create work that explores Western consumer interests, the relationship between capitalism and culture, as well as the conflict between tradition and modernity, spirituality and materialism, and religion and secularism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9912">The '''Dante Society of America''' was founded in 1881 through the leadership of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], who in turn served as the society's first three presidents.  One of the oldest scholarly societies in North America, the DSA predates both the [[Modern Language Association]], founded in 1883, and the [[American Historical Association]], founded in 1884. The society's mission, first formulated at its founding and now renewed and reinvigorated for the twenty-first century,  is to encourage the study and appreciation of the time, life, works, and cultural legacy of [[Dante Alighieri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dantesociety.org/|title=Welcome|date=|publisher=Dante Society|accessdate=2016-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Deutsche Dante-Gesellschaft (founded in 1865) it is the second-oldest scholarly organization devoted to the study of this medieval Italian poet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/dsa Dante Society of America.] JSTOR. Retrieved 10 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dante Society of America is also one of the first scholarly societies in the United States to welcome women among its founding members. The current president is [http://italian.berkeley.edu/people/albert-ascoli/ Albert Russell Ascoli] of the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==Early History==
The society was formally established in 1881 under the leadership of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Charles Eliot Norton]], who also served as its first three presidents.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dantesociety.org/about-society|title=About the Society|last=|first=|date=2014-01-09|website=|publisher=Dante Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the impetus of Longfellow, both as a translator and as an educator, the Dante Society of America might never have come into being.  Scholar [[Karl Witte]] had initiated and sustained an early Deutsche Dante-Gesellschaft in Germany for a dozen years before it ceased its activities in 1877. One year earlier, a similar group had come together in Oxford, with scholar Edward Moore at its helm, but it was Longfellow, with his translation of the Italian epic poem, who first brought the Americans [[James Russell Lowell]] and [[Charles Eliot Norton]] to his table at Craigie House (now a [https://www.nps.gov/long/index.htm national historic site]) to discuss Dante.

While Longfellow was designated the first president of the Society, the actual inauguration did not take place until May 16, 1882, two months after Longfellow's death. There, the forty-eight members mourned the loss of Longfellow, while electing Lowell to continue the leadership of the Society.

Founded in Cambridge, Mass., the society has always been closely associated with [[Harvard University]], due in no small part to the lasting influence of these three professors. Harvard was one of the first American universities to make instruction in modern languages (in addition to classical languages) part of its curriculum. [[Edward Everett Hale]], an early member of the Society, remembered his Italian lessons and Longfellow's lectures at Harvard: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Longfellow read the whole of Dante with us and we were well prepared for this by what we had read with [[Pietro Bachi|[Pietro] Bachi]] ... And I can say that when we came to hear Longfellow lecture, we were more than prepared for his lectures by the very thorough work which Bachi had done in this same subject with us.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dante in America. A historical and bibliographical study.|last=Koch|first=Theodore|publisher=Ginn and Company|year=1896|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

James Russell Lowell took over Longfellow's course upon his resignation in 1855. Twenty-two years later, he would resign his chair at Harvard to accept the appointment of United States Minister to Spain and pass the course on to a professor in the history of art, Charles Eliot Norton. Norton's classes were described by another early member of the Society, [[William Roscoe Thayer]]: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;To read Dante with Norton was almost an act of worship. There was in his voice something wonderfully stirring and wholly incommunicable. As he reached a favorite passage his face became radiant and his tones more tender. He explained fully from every side,-- verbal, textual, literary, spiritual ... In his interpretation of Dante Norton had one immense advantage which neither Lowell nor any other English-speaking Dantist has possessed: he had a specialist's knowledge of mediaeval art. So the thirteenth century lived for him not merely in its poetry, theology, and chronicles, but in paintings and statues in its churches and town halls, and its palaces and dwellings ... he could compass the whole circle of experience and the ideals of that world of which the Divine Comedy is the supreme expression in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Letters of Charles Eliot Norton|last=Norton|first=Charles Eliot|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|year=1913|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another early goal of the Society was to create a specialized library of Dante literature. Few works by Italian scholars on Dante were available in the United States. The three volume commentary on the Comedy by [[:it:Giosafatte Biagioli|G. Biagioli]] first published in Paris in 1816 and later reissued by Neapolitan publisher Rondinella in 1868, could be found on the [http://fig.lib.harvard.edu/fig/?bib=007459877 shelves] of the Harvard College Library. So too the 1887 edition of Pietro Fraticelli's commentary, originally published in 1860 by G. Barbera of Florence. These might have been supplemented by [[Cesare Balbo]]'s ''Vita di Dante'', or some of [[Ugo Foscolo|Foscolo's]] essays, but it was under the direction of [[William Coolidge Lane]], an assistant librarian at the Harvard College Library and member of the Society, that an extensive scholarly collection began to take shape.  Charles Eliot Norton's bequest would both broaden and deepen the collection. A 1890 catalog of the collection compiled by Lane and issued by the Harvard Library listed over 1200 volumes on Dante, including over three hundred different editions of the Divine Comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=William Coolidge|date=1890|title="The Dante Collection in the Harvard College Library and the Boston Public Library"|url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044058115965|journal=Bibliographical Contributions|volume=XXIV|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the collection at Harvard is regarded as the third largest on the subject in the world.&lt;ref name="trecc"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/dante-society-of-america_%28Enciclopedia-Dantesca%29/ "Dante Society Of America"], [[Tommaso Pisanti]], ''Enciclopedia Dantesca'' (1970).

== Early Women Members ==
From its founding, membership in the Dante Society of America was open to women. This was unusual for the time, as membership in other early scholarly societies in North America such as the [[American Philosophical Society]] and the [[Modern Language Association]] were not generally open to women. The first annual report of the Society listed Miss S.L. Butler, Mrs. C. Dupee, Miss Heloise Durant, Mrs. S. A. Gordon, Miss Fannie L. Payson, and Mrs. A.L. Wister as founding members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 16, 1882|title=First Annual Report of the Dante Society|jstor=40114201|journal=Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|volume=1|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, Yale Ph.D. and Smith professor [[Mary Augusta Scott]] would become the first woman to serve on the Executive Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Twenty-first Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|jstor=40165834|journal=Annual Report of the Dante Society of America|volume=21|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott was followed by Margaret Jackson in 1907, Anna Lyman Mason Gray in 1913 and Katherine V. Spencer in 1915. Other early female members of note include [[Anna Eliot Ticknor]], [[Isabella Stewart Gardner]], and [[Caroline Healey Dall]].

==Publications==
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the Society  published an important series of concordances: E.A. Fay, ''Concordance of the Divine Comedy'' (1888); E.S. Sheldon and A.C. White, ''Concordanza delle opere italiane in prosa e del canzoniere di D.'' (1905); E.K. Rand, E.H. Wilkins, and A.C. White, ''D. Alagherii operum latinorum concordantiae'' (1912); E.H. Wilkins and T.G. Bergin, ''Concordance to the D. C.'' (1965).&lt;ref name=trecc/&gt;

Today the Society produces the peer-reviewed journal, ''Dante Studies,'' under the editorship of [https://rll.uchicago.edu/faculty/steinberg Justin Steinberg,]  published by [[Johns Hopkins University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.press.jhu.edu/journals/dante-studies Dante Studies.] Johns Hopkins University Press.

'''''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|ドラゴンクエストIV 導かれし者たち|Doragon Kuesuto Fō Michibikareshi Monotachi|lit. "Dragon Quest IV: The Guided Ones"}}. Known in English speaking parts of Europe and in Australia as '''''Dragon Quest: The Chapters of the Chosen''''', on the Nintendo DS.}}, originally published as '''''Dragon Warrior IV''''' in North America, is a [[role-playing video game]] and the fourth installment of the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' video game series developed by [[Chunsoft]] and published by [[Enix]]. It was originally released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] on 11 February 1990 in Japan. A North American NES version followed in October 1992, and would be the last ''Dragon Quest'' game localized and published by Enix's [[Enix#North America|Enix America Corporation]] subsidiary prior to its closure in November 1995, as well as the last ''Dragon Quest'' game to be localized into English prior to the localization of ''[[Dragon Warrior Monsters]]'' in December 1999. The game was [[enhanced remake|remade]] by Heartbeat for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], which eventually was available as an [[Ultimate Hit]]s title. This was followed with a second remake developed by [[ArtePiazza]] for the [[Nintendo DS]], released in Japan on 22 November 2007. This remake was released in Australia on 11 September 2008, in Europe on 12 September 2008&lt;ref name="eurorelease"&gt;{{cite web | title=EXPERIENCE DRAGON QUEST IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND ZENITHIA TRILOGY ANNOUNCED FOR EUROPE | url=http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/37219/DRAGON-QUEST-The-Chapters-of-the-Chosen | publisher=MCV | date=2008-05-21 | accessdate=2008-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on September 16, 2008. A version based on the Nintendo DS remake for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]] was released in 2014.

''Dragon Quest IV'' differs from the rest of the series by breaking up the game into five distinct chapters, each of which focuses on a different protagonist or protagonists. The first four are told from the perspective of the Hero's future companions and the fifth one, from the hero's perspective, brings all the characters together as they start their journey to save the world.&lt;ref name="NP46"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Staff |date=March 1993 |title= ''Dragon Warrior IV'' |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=46 |pages= 82–87 | publisher= Nintendo of America| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PlayStation remake adds a sixth chapter, which is retained in the DS remake.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Dragon Quest IV.png|left|thumb|The Hero and the party with a wagon that is able to travel through one of selected dungeon areas in the NES version of ''Dragon Quest IV'', where menu commands and character stats are displayed]]
''Dragon Quest IV'' offered several new features over the first three titles, while carrying on many of those introduced in the previous games.&lt;ref name="NP46"/&gt; Similar features included are the day and night cycles, the ability to travel via ship and a flying vehicle (this time, a hot air balloon), and the three levels of keys. They are Thief, Magic and Ultimate (originally localized as Final). There are also travel doors, which allow the party to move a great distance on the world map with little travel. Unlike the Hero in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'', the Hero of ''Dragon Quest IV'' is not required to be in the party at all once the wagon becomes available. Despite this, the Hero is again the character that possesses the most powerful healing and attack spells. Many spells, weapons, armor, and shops (including the vault/bank) function the same as in past games.

In addition to the new chapter-based storylines, an [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]] system called "Tactics" was implemented that allowed the player to provide strategies to the party members (who become [[Non-player character|NPCs]] in the final chapter), such as prioritizing damage, healing or MP conservation, while maintaining full control of the Hero. ''[[Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation]]'' and the remakes of IV allow tactics to be set for characters individually rather than using one tactics mode for all characters, as well as including the "Follow Orders" Tactics mode, which allows other characters to be controlled manually.&lt;ref name="kurt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3520/the_history_of_dragon_quest.php|title=The History of Dragon Quest|accessdate=2009-09-30|last=Kalata|first=Kurt|date=2008-02-04|work=Gamasutra|publisher=Gamasutra}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Tactics" system is seen as a precursor to ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'''s "[[Time-keeping systems in games#Pausable real-time|Gambits]]" system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Ben|title=A Warrior’s Quest: A Retrospective of Square-Enix’s Classic RPG Series|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/02/14/a-warrior-s-quest-a-retrospective-of-square-enix-s-classic-rpg-series.aspx|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=28 December 2011|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wagon, first introduced in this game, allows the player to choose which characters are used in battle. The wagon can also be seen in ''Dragon Quest V'' and ''Dragon Quest VI''. The first casino appears in this installment as a place to play several mini-games ([[slot machine]], [[poker]], and the Monster Betting that was introduced in ''[[Dragon Warrior III]]'') using tokens that could be traded for special items. Searching drawers and inside of jars was first introduced in this game as a means to find items. Small Medals, later Mini Medals, were introduced as a new item to search for and trade for special unique items from a secluded king.

Saving the game was made easier by allowing one to save a game in a House of Healing, rather than talking to a king.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; Also, the save ("Confession" in the DS remake) and EXP point to the next level-up ("Divination" in the DS remake) are now separate commands. Returning to the format of the original North American ''Dragon Warrior'', programmers allowed users to open a door using a command appearing in the top level of the menu (rather than requiring users to search through various characters' inventories for the key as in some previous games). The only requirement was that at least one character in the party needed to have an appropriate key in his or her inventory. Since this command was added, an unlocked door was added in this game, as well as large Castle Doors. However, this command was eliminated in later games and the remake, in which doors can be opened by attempting to walk through them.

==Synopsis==

===Plot===
In the original version, the game is divided into five [[chapter (books)|chapters]]. The first four provide back-story for the Hero’s party members, while the fifth follows the Hero himself or herself as he or she meets up with the other characters. 

Chapter One begins when a knight from Burland (Ragnar) is tasked to find children who have gone missing from a nearby town.  Ragnar finds and defeats the monster responsible for the abductions and returns the children to their homes. In doing so, he learns the monsters were looking for the Legendary Hero (in order to kill him or her), who is supposedly still a child.  Ragnar decides to leave his home and set out on a quest to protect him.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt;

Chapter Two follows the tomboyish Princess Alena and her two friends/mentors, tutor Borya (localized as Brey) and chancellor Kiryl (localized as Cristo) as she travels to prove her strength.&lt;ref name="kurt" /&gt; Partway through her journey, Alena’s father (the King) loses his voice after speaking of a dream he had depicting the end of the world. After restoring his voice, she travels to the town of Endor to enter a fighting tournament. She defeats all of the combatants except a warrior named Psaro the Manslayer (originally localized as Saro until he rescues Rosa from humans and changes his name to Necrosaro), who fails to appear. After the victory, she returns to her home castle to find all the inhabitants have gone missing, so she sets out to find out what happened to everyone.

Chapter Three follows a merchant named Torneko (localized as Taloon), a humble merchant working in a weapon shop in his hometown with his wife and young son.  His dream is to own his own shop and be the world's greatest merchant.  As he travels and performs favors at the towns he visits, Torneko eventually obtains permission to purchase a shop in Endor.  By finding the rare Silver Statuette in a nearby cave, Torneko is able to obtain the funds to purchase the shop and move his family to Endor. After establishing a successful business with his wife, he hears about a set of legendary weapons, which he sets out to find by funding the construction of an underground passageway to a neighboring continent.

Chapter Four follows Maya and Meena, two sisters seeking revenge for the murder of their father. By teaming up with a former student of their father (Oojam), they manage to plot a way into Keeleon Castle and find the man responsible.  They avenge their father’s murder by defeating the King of Keeleon, but are quickly defeated by the King's master and thrown in the dungeon. Oojam sacrifices himself to allow the sisters to escape the castle.  They then decide to flee the continent and head for Endor, where they hope to learn more about their new foe and about the Legendary Hero, whom they became aware of during their travels.

Chapter Five follows the game's [[protagonist]], known as the Hero.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt; It begins with the Hero’s hometown being attacked by monsters, led by Psaro the Manslayer. The Hero manages to escape, and is joined by the main characters of the previous chapters, as well as Hoffman, who drives the cart. Together, they spy on Psaro and discover that Estark, the Ruler of Evil (originally localized as Esturk), has been awakened. Their quest then becomes to travel to Estark’s palace and defeat him.

In the town of Strathbaile&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Izmit), the heroes have a dream that explains Psaro’s plan. Developing a deep hatred of humanity after the death of his [[Elf|elven]] girlfriend, Rose (originally localized as Rosa), at the hands of humans, Psaro plans to become the next Ruler of Evil using the power of [[Transmutation of species|evolution]] he obtained from the "Armlet of [[Alchemy|Transmutation]]" (an item Alena's party had obtained and given away in Chapter 2 as a ransom payment for a kidnapped woman.)  The party then obtains the four pieces of the Zenithian weapons and armor (sword, shield, body armor, and helm) to permit entry into Zenithian Castle. There, they meet the Zenith [[Dragon]], who takes them to Nadiria (originally localized as Evil World), where Psaro is undergoing his evolution into the new Ruler of Evil. There, they defeat his generals before challenging Psaro. After fighting a continually evolving form of Psaro, he is vanquished.

The PlayStation and DS remakes include a sixth chapter. This chapter focuses on the heroes working with Psaro to avenge the death of Rose, and finally put the world back in order. Throughout this chapter, Rose is revived and the party is able to defeat her true killer, the Dark Priest [[Aamon]] (originally localized as Radimvice), one of Psaro the Manslayer's subordinates who intended to take the secrets of evolution for himself and usurp Psaro the Manslayer, setting all plans in motion that drove Psaro to his insanity.

===Characters===
[[File:Dragon Quest IV characters.jpg|thumb|Characters of ''Dragon Quest IV'': ''(top row, from left)'' Torneko, Kiryl, Alena, Meena, and Maya; ''(bottom row)'' Ragnar, the Male Hero, the Female Hero, and Borya]]
These are the main characters of the story, and are controllable party members during their introduction chapters (Chapters 1-4). When they join the Hero in Chapter 5, the other party members become NPC characters that are only controlled by the ''Tactics'' command. In the re-releases, this setting can be changed to ''Follow Orders'', which allows the player to choose their actions. Also, with the re-releases, many of the character's names were changed to be closer, or incorporate their Original Japanese names.

* '''Hero''' ''(Male Hero is named Solo, while the Female Hero is named Sofia) &lt;ref&gt;Dragon Quest 4 Japanese Playstation Manual&lt;/ref&gt; ''The main character of the game, who's eighteen-years-old and does not appear until Chapter 5. The Hero can use the best equipment, and is the only character who can learn lightning spells and the most powerful healing spell in the game, Omniheal (originally localized as HealUsAll). In the DS remake, the Hero also learns Gigasword, the game's most powerful single-target attack spell. The player can choose the name and gender of the hero. The gender of the hero has little impact to the story, only affecting some dialogue, although a few optional weapons, pieces of armor, and accessories can only be equipped by female characters. In the remakes, the Hero first appears during a short prologue chapter before Chapter 1.&lt;ref name="NP230"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Loe |first= Casey|date=July 2008 |title= A flight of Dragons |journal= [[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=230 |pages= 50–57| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url=|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|'''Ragnar McRyan'''|ライアン|''Ryan''|''originally localized as Ragnar''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Captain of the Burland (a Scottish English speaking land) army, and Royal Knight. He investigates a case of children who are disappearing throughout the kingdom which is causing havoc and despair throughout the kingdom. He first appears in Chapter 1. He also cameos in Chapters 2 (Inn by Endor) and 3 (Endor Casino). He is the classic Warrior or Soldier, specializing in melee combat with no magical abilities, and he also has a very low base agility score, so he will often strike last out of all the party members. Ragnar is the last character to join the Hero in Chapter 5, having coincidentally set out to kill the Marquis de Leon (originally localized as Keeleon) at the same time the party arrives.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Tsarevna]] Alena'''|アリーナ姫|''Arîna Hime''|''Arlina'', ''originally localized as Princess Alena''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Tomboyish Princess of the Zamoksva (a Russian dialect English speaking land)&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (''originally localized as Santeem'') Kingdom. She is bored of the palace life and wishes to travel the world, much to the dismay of her father and his officials who urge her to act more like a woman instead of a tomboy. This could be due to the possibility that she had overheard her father discuss a dream he had with his chancellor and wishes to do something to ease his fears. She first appears in Chapter 2 but joins after the party cures Kiryl with a [[Feverfew]] Root (originally localized as "Padequia Root"). She is the classic Fighter or Martial Artist, preferring to use claws as a weapon though she can use other weapons as well.
* {{nihongo|'''Borya'''|ブライ|''Burai''|''originally localized as Brey''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Alena's tutor. He's a magician who travels with Alena to look after her because he promised her late mother to do so. He learns Ice attack magic, and more [[buff (computer gaming)|buff and debuff]] spells than Maya, such as ''Oomph'' and ''Acceleratle''; in the DS remake, he also learns ''Snoop'' (localized as ''MapMagic'' in other games in the series), a spell generally associated with the thief class which reveals the location of treasures. He first appears in Chapter 2, and he joins the party to search for a Feverfew Seed to cure Kiryl's sickness right away.
* {{nihongo|'''Kiryl'''|クリフト|''Kurifuto''|''Clift'', ''originally localized as Cristo''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A priest (originally localized as chancellor) that travels along with Alena and Borya, and has feelings for Alena (but she is oblivious to it)&lt;ref name="DQ4Site"&gt;{{cite web|author=Square-Enix |year=2008 |title=Dragon Quest IV (Official Site) |url=http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |work= |accessdate=June 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620055852/http://na.square-enix.com/dq4/ |archivedate=June 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He can use healing and support magic, as well as instant death spells. He first appears in Chapter 2, but is recruited in Chapter 5 after the Hero finds a rare Feverfew Seed to grow into a Feverfew Root and to cure his sickness.
* {{nihongo|'''[[Torneko|Torneko Taloon]]'''|トルネコ|''Toruneko''|''originally localized as Taloon''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A weapons merchant from Lakanaba (an Irish English speaking town), who wishes to open his own store. He first appears in Chapter 3. He is much like the Merchant class in other Dragon Quest games, however he also learns abilities used by Jesters, Thieves and Dancers in other games in the series, when he joins the Hero in Chapter 5 he sometimes performs a random action in battle, such as summoning an army of merchants, throwing sand in the enemy's eyes, tripping and scoring a critical hit on an enemy or stealing an item from an enemy. In the DS remake, he learns four non-combat spells: ''padfoot'', which reduces the encounter rate, ''eye for distance'', which locates the nearest town, ''nose for treasure'', which reveals the number of remaining treasures in the area, and ''whistle'', which causes a [[random encounter]].
* {{nihongo|'''Maya'''|マーニャ|''Mânya''|''originally localized as Mara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; A dancer who works in Lassize Fayre (originally localized as Monbaraba) and is originally from Aubout du Monde (originally localized as Kievs) who can use magic, primarily fire and explosion attack spells. Her father, Mahabala&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; (originally localized as Edgar), died under mysterious circumstances. It is later revealed that he was murdered by Balzack, her father's apprentice, who was driven mad by the Secret of Evolution. She and her sister seek revenge. They both first appear in Chapter 4, and are the first to join the Hero in Chapter 5, after Meena reads the Hero's fortune.
* {{nihongo|'''Meena'''|ミネア|''Minea''|''originally localized as Nara''}}.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Maya's younger sister. She is a fortune teller that can use healing spells and wind attack spells, as well as support spells. Unlike Kiryl or the hero, she cannot learn any multi-target healing spells other than the ''Kerplunk'' spell (which knocks her out to heal everyone else at once), but only she can use her Tarot weapon as a battle item to generate random effects, similar to the Chance (or ''Hocus Pocus'') spell in other DQ games. Meena reads the Hero's fortune in Endor and joins because of the unique destiny she read.
* {{nihongo|'''Psaro'''|ピサロ|''originally localized as Saro and Necrosaro}} A monster who is the main villain of Chapter 5. In Chapter 6 of the PlayStation and DS remakes, he is a recruitable party member, seeking revenge against Aamon. Like the Hero, Psaro is a fighter / spellcaster hybrid, with a mixture of attack, healing, buff and debuff magic, and the ability to wield powerful weapons and wear heavy armour. Furthermore, Psaro can learn various special attacks (originally introduced to the series in [[Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation|Dragon Quest VI]]), and can use cursed equipment without penalty.

'''Non-Playable Characters:'''

These characters join the party temporarily. Unlike permanent party members, they cannot gain levels or [[experience point]]s, cannot change their equipment, and their actions in battle cannot be controlled through the ''Tactics'' command (instead, they are always lockd into their default AI mode).

* '''Healie''', a friendly Healslime who meets Ragnar during Chapter 1. He is an invaluable ally, providing free healing, saving Ragnar the trouble so he can concentrate on killing monsters. After Ragnar joins the party in Chapter 5, Healie can be seen in a human form in the courtyard of Keeleon Castle.
* '''Laurel''' &amp; '''Hardie''' (''originally localized as Laurent and Strom''), two mercenaries who Taloon can meet in Endor during Chapter 3. Hardie, a soldier, requests 400 Gold and simply uses a powerful physical attack each turn. Laurel, a magician, requests 600 and has a small, versatile magical repertoire along with an average physical attack which can cause paralysis. While unconnected story-wise, their naming in the DS remake is a nod to the early-20th century comedy duo, [[Laurel and Hardy]].
* '''Oojam''' (''originally localized as Orin''), he was a student of Maya and Meena's father that went into hiding after Balzack had killed his teacher. The girls seek him out during Chapter 4 to assist them in their quest for revenge. Oojam provides a powerful physical attack each turn, in addition to being able to pick locks. At the end of Chapter 4, Oojam appears to be mortally wounded fending off the guards of Palais de Léon (originally localized as Castle Keeleon) to allow Meena and Maya to escape, but it is revealed in Chapter 5 that a young woman who was fleeing the castle found him near-dead and managed to get him safely to the town of Vrenor so he can rest and recover.
* '''Hank Hoffman Junior''' (''originally localized as Hector''), a young man hanging out near Casabranca who is initially cold to people, having been betrayed by a friend. After the Hero finds the "Symbol of Faith" in a nearby cave, Hoffman offers to lend the party his services, and his wagon. He tags along for a short while until shortly after Torneko is recruited, then leaves his cart to the Hero so he can pursue his own endeavors in owning an inn. In the DS remake, he resurfaces later at the oasis where he opens up the "Immigrant Town" sidequest.
* '''Tom Foolery''' (''originally localized as Panon''), he is a performer who works at the same stage-house as Maya and Meena. While not particularly good at combat, Tom is necessary for one game mission which nets the Hero the Zenithian Helm.
* '''Orifiela''' (''originally localized as Lucia''), a Zenithian the party encounters at the Great World Tree, [[Yggdrasil]]. She needs the party to help her get back up to Zenithia, and provides the party with information regarding the Zenithian Sword.
* '''Sparkie''' (''originally localized as Doran''), a baby dragon found in Zenithia. Apparently, Zenithians have conducted research that suggests dragons mature faster than Zenithians do. He doesn't have great battle intelligence, but can occasionally mow down enemies or put them to sleep with a breath attack. In the remakes, he leaves the party once Rose is resurrected.

According to [[Yuji Horii]], he wanted to have something the player went around collecting as the previous ''Dragon Quest'' games had crests and orbs respectively. However, he did not want to do the same thing over again by forcing the player to collect a certain number of items before they beat the game; mini medals instead have nothing to do with clearing the game.&lt;ref name="Jump8"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:週刊少年ジャンプ|trans-title=[[Weekly Shōnen Jump]]|volume=45|year=1989|publisher=[[Shueisha]]|location=Japan|language=Japanese|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promotional illustrations for the Japanese version was drawn by famed manga artist [[Akira Toriyama]], whom provided the artwork for the previous games in the series and would continue to do so for every future installment.&lt;ref name=techbuffalo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technobuffalo.com/2014/10/11/history-of-dragon-quest-localizations-1989-to-2001/|title=History of Dragon Quest Localizations - 1989 to 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike all the other games up to this point, the changes in this version were not as radical. Among them were the usual religious/violence censorship, new graphics for the opening copyright and ending credits, and the betting in the Casino was slightly modified to allow more money being won during a bet.

=== PlayStation remake ===

[[File:Dragon Quest IV remake.jpg|right|thumb|One of overworld areas of the PlayStation ''Dragon Quest IV'' remake]]

''Dragon Quest IV'' was [[enhanced remake|remade]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on November 22, 2001 in Japan. It was developed by [[Heartbeat (company)|Heartbeat]] and published by Enix. The remake was developed using ''Dragon Quest VII's'' 3D graphics engine. The characters, towns, world maps, sound, battles and enemies all received updates. The character sprites were updated to match the original artwork for the characters in the original ''Dragon Quest IV'' Manual and artwork.
With this remake came several new features. Among these features were a new chapter in which Psaro is available as a party member (as well as a prologue chapter), an intra-party talk command similar to ''Dragon Quest VII'', and the ability to turn off the artificial intelligence for party members to allow for direct control of their attacks (except UC Party Members). The game sold over one million copies in Japan by the end of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Witham, Joseph | date=December 12, 2001 | title=Enix Ships 1 Million Copies of Dragon Quest IV | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/news/Q4-2001/121201b.html | work=RPGamer.com | accessdate=2008-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enix|Enix America]] originally planned to bring the remake to [[North America]] in 2002 and had even advertised this upcoming release on the back cover to the US instruction manual for ''Dragon Warrior VII'', but it was later canceled due to Heartbeat closing its video game development operations before the localization and translation could be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=August 22, 2001 | title=Dragon Quest IV Headed Stateside | url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/097/097618p1.html | work=IGN.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Eric Malenfant |author2=Eve C. |author3=Nicole Kirk | year=2002 | title=Enix Interview With Justin Lucas | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/features/e32k2-enix/index.html | work=RPGFan.com | accessdate=2009-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later explained that the cost and time that a different company would need to invest to complete the translation prevented Enix from passing this to another developer, as Heartbeat was the most familiar with their own design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Dwaine Bullock | year=2005 | title=Dragon Warrior IV: The Explanation | url=http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111214556/http://www.dqshrine.com/features/dw4.htm | archivedate=2009-01-11 | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nintendo DS remake ===

''Dragon Quest IV'' was later re-released for the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan in November 2007. The game has been remade into a 2D/3D hybrid, similar to the PlayStation version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Square Enix | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest 4 to 6 | url=http://www.square-enix.co.jp/dragonquest/4to6/ | work= | accessdate=September 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This release has kept many of the enhancements from the PlayStation, such as the slightly altered immigrant town, but has received enhanced upgrades to smooth the graphics further, and improved sound. This release also allows players to take manual control of all of their party members in the final two chapters.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

Shortly after the Japanese release, several people editing the Japanese ROM file discovered a near complete English translation along with Spanish, French, German, and Italian translations already inside the Japanese game.&lt;ref name=discovered&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2007/12/13/dragon-quest-iv-hides-a-partial-english-translation/|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=2016-06-08|date=2007-12-13|author=Spencer|title=Dragon Quest IV hides a partial English translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 9, 2008, Square Enix applied for a trademark to the title "Chapters of the Chosen", and speculation began that this was the new subtitle to ''Dragon Quest IV'' for an American release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Spencer | year=2008 | title=Siliconera » Square Enix trademarks Chapters of the Chosen (update: Dragon Quest IV?) | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2008/04/16/square-enix-trademarks-chapters-of-the-chosen-any-guesses/ | work= | accessdate=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2008, ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' was found to have a rating of E10+ by the ESRB, for Alcohol Reference, Animated Blood, Mild Fantasy Violence, Mild Language, Simulated Gambling, and Suggestive Themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=ESRB| year=2008 | title=Entertainment Software Rating Board | url=http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp | work= | accessdate=April 18, 2008}} - May need to input ''Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen'' to get result&lt;/ref&gt; An official release date of September 16, 2008 was finally established on the official North American site.&lt;ref name="NADS"/&gt; The game was released in Europe under the title ''Dragon Quest: Chapters of the Chosen'', omitting the number IV in a similar fashion to the European version of [[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]].&lt;ref name="eurorelease"/&gt;

This version of the game contains an entirely new translation of the script.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; It was claimed in Nintendo Power that the new translation has changed the names of many of the main characters, weapons and towns to be closer to, or include their original Japanese names, while adding several new localizations,&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; yet an analysis of the location and character names indicates the original localization of ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was closer to the original Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year= | title=List of Name Changes in the Zenithia Trilogy | url=https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/List_of_Name_Changes_in_the_Zenithia_Trilogy | work=Dragon Quest Wiki | accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version also uses the new spell naming convention first used in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King|Dragon Quest VIII]]'', such as the spell ''Beat'' from ''Dragon Warrior IV'' becoming ''Whack''.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; The western translations have been slightly changed in places where the Japanese version included sexual components, and the Japanese version's party talk feature was completely excised from the western versions.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt;

The Nintendo DS [[English language|English]] translation includes 13 regional dialects for the various areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=EBGAMES | year=2008 | title=EBGames.com - Buy Dragon Quest IV - Nintendo DS | url=http://www.ebgames.com/ds/games/dragon-quest-iv/71541 | work= | accessdate=June 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Burland now being Scottish, and Zamoksva being Russian.&lt;ref name="NP230"/&gt; Simon Carless of [[Gamasutra]] feels that the use of dialects can help some people to understand different cultures, saying, "It has the potential to nurture cross-language and cross-cultural understanding in a very intelligent manner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=23659|title= Analysis: The Implications of Dialect in Dragon Quest IV|work=News|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|first=Simon|last=Carless|date=2009-05-19|accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version also reintroduces the party talk feature removed from the international Nintendo DS releases, being translated into the appropriate language.

== Other media ==

=== Manga ===

A five volume manga called ''Dragon Quest: Princess Alena'' was released. It followed the story of Chapter 2, Alena's adventure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2005 |title=Dragon Quest Manga |url=http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |work= |accessdate=September 21, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822182900/http://www.dqshrine.com/ma/other/ |archivedate=August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Beth | last=Cato | year=2003 | title=Besu's Dragon Quest Slime Shrine:Manga: Dragon Quest IV: | url=http://www.slimeshrine.net/manga/DQIVmanga.html | work= | accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but begins to divert during the events in the Birdsong Tower. From this point forward, it introduces several new characters, including the evil Evil Leather [[Dominatrix]] Woman, and new locations, including an Arctic location and a haunted house. This story ends with Alena fighting Psaro and defeating him before he goes on with the Golden Bracelet to perfect the secret of evolution.

=== Soundtrack ===

As with every ''Dragon Quest'', [[Koichi Sugiyama]] composed the music and directed all the associated spinoffs. The song heard during gameplay depends on a number of factors. A specific track is always played for towns, another for caves or dungeons, another while the party is mounted on the hot air balloon, for instance. Lastly, while out in the world, each of the first four acts has its own theme song, as does the Hero—in act five, the theme song played depends on who is the first character in the formation.

The original ''Dragon Warrior IV'' was one of the few NES games to feature a ''[[crescendo]]'' during the battle music, a gradual increase in volume from soft to loud. This technique was rare for an NES game. However, the PlayStation and Nintendo DS versions do not feature the crescendo in the battle music. This level of detail can be found in the NES version's soundtrack, as well as the 2014 Android and iOS mobile releases.

''Dragon Quest IV ~The People Are Shown the Way~ Symphonic Suite'' is a compilation of music from ''Dragon Quest IV''. The first print of the album was in 1990, the London Philharmonic version came out a year later, and a reprint of the original was released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Lucy Rzeminski | year=2007 | title=Dragon Quest IV soundtrack | url=http://www.rpgfan.com/soundtracks/dq4-ss/index.html | work= | accessdate=August 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dragon Warrior IV'' was awarded "[[List of Game of the Year awards|Best Game Grand Prize]]", "Best RPG Game" and the "[[List of best-selling video games|Best-Seller Award]]" in ''[[Famitsu]]''{{'}}s 1990 awards, "Best Challenge" and 2nd place "Best Overall Game" in 1993 by ''[[Nintendo Power]]''.&lt;ref name="famitsu-award"&gt;[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.video/OccmuafYtzc Best Games of 1990], ''Famicom Tsushin''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NintendoPowerAwards"/&gt;

In August 2008, ''Nintendo Power'' ranked ''Dragon Warrior IV'' the 18th best [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] video game, describing it as the peak of the NES' ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series and praising it for its innovative five-act story that made it one of their favourite old-school role-playing games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 2008 |title= Best of the Best |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |volume= |issue=231 |page= 71| publisher= Future USA, Inc| id= |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Readers of ''[[Famitsu]]'' voted the game as the 14th best game of all time in a 2006 poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Edge Staff | date=March 6, 2006 | title=Japan Votes on All Time Top 100 | url=http://www.edge-online.com/features/japan-votes-all-time-top-100/ | work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] | accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, critics noticed with interest that the game's third chapter, Torneko's, departed largely from standard RPGs by making the only goal to collect money and by allowing players to have Torneko simply working in an in-game store.&lt;ref name="kurt"/&gt;

In Japan, the original Famicom version sold 3.1 million units, it's the fourth best selling game of the system, below its predecessor, ''Dragon Quest III''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Famicom Software| url=https://sites.google.com/site/gamedatalibrary/software-by-platform/famicom| work=Game Data Library | accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; One million of its sales occurred in its first day of release.&lt;ref name=sales2&gt;{{cite journal |title=Westward, Ho!

The PlayStation version of ''Dragon Quest IV'' was the 4th best-selling game in Japan in 2001 with over 1 million copies sold, and has sold nearly 1.2 million copies as of December 26, 2004.&lt;ref name="EBsales"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Famitsū Gēmu Hakusho 2002 |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2002 |location=Tokyo |language=Japanese |script-title=ja:ファミ通ゲーム白書2002 |trans-title=Famitsu Game Whitebook 2002 |chapter=2001年ゲームソフト年間売上TOP300 |trans-chapter=2001 Game Software Annual Sales Top 300 |url=http://geimin.net/da/db/2001_ne_fa/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=2001 Top 100 Japanese Console Game Chart | url=http://the-magicbox.com/Chart-BestSell2001.shtml | work=The-MagicBox.com | accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Japan Platinum Game Chart

"Ragnar McRyan is in no way a character designed off the back of some intense Japanese schoolgirl demographic focus testing", wrote [[Eurogamer]]'s Simon Parkin, pleased.&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Parkin, Simon | title= Dragon Quest IV: Chapters of the Chosen | date=September 15, 2008 | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/dragon-quest-iv-chapters-of-the-chosen-review | work=[[Eurogamer]] | accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequels===
''Dragon Quest IV'' is the first game in the series to spawn spin-offs. The merchant [[Torneko]] (also known as Taloon in the NES version) was popular enough to star his own series, in which he finds himself in quests in order to expand his store. These games are the ''Torneko no Daibouken'' sub-series (translated as ''Torneko's Great Adventure''), [[roguelike]] and [[random dungeon]] games produced by [[Enix]] (and [[Square Enix]]) and developed by [[Chunsoft]]. The success of the games later inspired the creation of the ''[[Mystery Dungeon]]'' series.

Ragnar, Healie, and Torneko all later appear as cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King#Development and release|Dragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King]]'' in the Monster Arena. Torneko later cameos in ''[[Dragon Quest: Shōnen Yangus to Fushigi no Dungeon|Dragon Quest Yangus]]'' as a merchant.

The '''Epitaph of Gllavenica''' is a 14th-century [[epitaph]], written on a [[shroud]], and embroidered by a monk named Savia from [[Ballsh]], [[Albania]]. Its name stems from the ancient name of [[Ballsh]]. The shroud is made of silk, linen and gold, and symbolizes the burial cloth of Jesus, used in Orthodox Good Friday's processions.&lt;ref&gt;Universiteti Shtetëror i Tiranës. Instituti Historisë e Gjuhësisë, Instituti i Historisë (Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë), "Studia Albanica, Volume 38, Issue 2" [https://books.google.com/books?id=_IRpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Gllavenica&amp;dq=Gllavenica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y2bpS6vDKNONsAahnaGZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically, stylistically and in the decorative motifs, it is one of the most perfect artifacts of this genre in the Balkans. The Epitaph represents the dead Christ lying on a linen, [[Saint Mary]], [[John the Apostle|John]], other [[Four Evangelists]], prophets and angels with spread wings. It was commissioned by the [[Albanians|Albanian]] ruler [[Gjergj Arianiti]] in 1373.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lIRpAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Gllavenica&amp;dq=Gllavenica&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y2bpS6vDKNONsAahnaGZCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwCQ Studia Albanica, Volume 37. 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the shroud was stolen from the [[National Historical Museum (Albania)|National Historical Museum of Albania]] in [[Tirana]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dawson, Linda White &amp; Andrea Dawson: Albania: a guide and illustrated journal. Bradt, 1995. page 42.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|verify|date=May 2010}}

In 2005 an international symposium assessed that the shroud should be restaured for the amount of 25-50k Euros because it risks to be irreparably deteriorated and damaged from the lights of the Albanian National Museum.&lt;ref name=""&gt;Albanian director of the Restoration Section of the Institute of Folklore of Albania declared that the lights of the museum are [[ultraviolet]] ones and as such they risk to damage the colors of the shroud {{cite web

{{main|figure drawing}}
A '''figure study''' is a [[drawing]] or [[painting]] of the human body made in preparation for a more composed or finished work;&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt; or to learn drawing and painting techniques in general and the human figure in particular. By preference, figure studies are done from a [[Model (art)|live model]], but may also include the use of other references&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phillipscollection.org/exhibitions/2012-02-04-exhibition-snapshot.aspx|title=Snapshot:Painters and Photography, Bonnard to Vuillard|publisher=The Phillips Collection|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the imagination of the artist. The live model may be clothed, or [[Nudity|nude]], but is usually nude for student work in order to learn human anatomy.

A related term in [[sculpture]] is a [[maquette]], a small scale model or rough draft of a proposed work. Drawings may also be preparatory for sculptural work.

Preparatory studies may be compositional, representing the entire proposed work, or may only be of certain details, such as hands and feet. Studies may be sketches completed in a relatively short length of time, or very detailed depending upon the artist's preferred methods. Drawings may concentrate on shapes and form, while studies in painting media are about color and lighting.

The term figure study is sometimes used in photography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/focus_nude/|title=In Focus: The Nude|publisher=The J Paul Getty Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; but does not seem to be clearly defined as different from [[nude photography]] in general, given the inherently finished nature of the medium. Photography students may do work that is for educational purposes, and an artist may take photographs with the intent of using them as references for paintings, but the terms ''figure study'' or ''nude study'' is usually not limited to these preparatory or educational photos. This usage may have begun in the 19th century, when some photographers called their nude images “studies for artists” merely to evade the censors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/exhibitions/2012/naked-before-the-camera|title=Naked before the Camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Beginning in the [[Renaissance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/anat/hd_anat.htm|title=Anatomy in the Renaissance|author=Bambach, Carmen|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing the figure from life has been considered the best way to learn how to draw, and the practice has been maintained into the present. Different drawing techniques and exercises have become standard, including [[Gesture drawing|gesture]], [[Contour drawing|contour]], and [[mass drawing]]s. For beginners first learning to draw, learning to correctly observe real objects is essential in order to learn three dimensional perspective and the effects of lighting. Live models are preferred but if not available, plaster casts of the figure may be used, never photographs.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open drawing groups===
Experienced artists continue to practice drawing the figure long after their formal education is completed by attending informal groups with no instruction that meet, often weekly, to share the cost of hiring a model. Known by various names, such as sketch groups, figure sessions, etc.; the format is similar to beginning or intermediate drawing classes, being three hours in total that start with a number of gestures and proceed to slightly longer poses, but rarely more than 20 minutes each, only time enough for studies. Such open drawing groups can be found in many locals in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfew.com/information/ateliers-figure-drawing/workshop.html|title=Figure drawing sessions and walk in ateliers|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in other countries that share the Western tradition of figure studies.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Figure Study of Musculature - Daniel Huntington.jpg|thumb|Brooklyn Museum - Figure Study of Musculature - Daniel Huntington]]

==Preparatory==
During the 16th to the 19th centuries, painters did numerous drawings and color studies in preparation for large works that might take a year or more to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aest/hd_aest.htm|title=The Aesthetic of the Sketch in Nineteenth-Century France|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the late 19th century studies have become less important as painters adopted of the [[wet-on-wet]], or alla prima painting technique, in which layers of wet paint are applied to previous layers of wet paint, the sketch being merely the first layer. However, the use of studies has been maintained by the [[academic art]] tradition.

[[File:Textile finishing machinery, Red Bridge Mills, Ainsworth - geograph.org.uk - 1584753.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Textile finishing machinery, Red Bridge Mills, [[Ainsworth, Greater Manchester|Ainsworth]], 1983]]
 
In [[textile manufacturing]], '''finishing''' refers to the processes that convert the [[weaving|woven]] or [[knitting|knitted]] cloth into a usable material and more specifically to any process performed after dyeing the [[yarn]] or [[textile|fabric]] to improve the look, performance, or "hand" (feel) of the finish textile or [[clothing]].{{sfn|Collier|1970|p=154}}{{sfn|Kadolph|pp= 330-341}} The precise meaning depends on context.

Some finishing techniques such as [[bleaching]] and [[dyeing]] are applied to yarn before it is woven while others are applied to the grey cloth directly after it is woven or knitted.{{sfn|Collier|1970|p=246}} Some finishing techniques, such as [[fulling]], have been in use with hand-weaving for centuries; others, such as [[mercerisation]], are byproducts of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Introduction==
In order to impart the required functional properties to the fiber or fabric, it is customary to subject the material to different types of physical and chemical treatments. For example, wash and wear finish for a [[cotton]] fabric is necessary to make it [[wikt:crease|crease]]-free or [[wrinkle]]-free. In a similar way, [[mercerising]], [[singeing]], [[flame retardant]], water repellent, [[waterproof]], [[anti-static]] and peach finishing achieve various fabric properties desired by consumers.

The use of 100% synthetic textiles has increased considerably since the development of textured yarns made of filaments, and the growing production of knit goods. The use of open weave has enabled production of lighter, [[breathable]], fabrics to ensure better wearing comfort.

The properties of [[petroleum]]-based [[synthetic fiber]]s, most important among them being [[polyamide]], [[polyester]] and [[polyacrylonitrile]], are essentially different from those of natural [[fibre crop|cellulosic]] and [[protein/wool]] fibers. Hence the sequence of finishing operations is likely to be different. While cellulosic fabrics require a [[resin]] finishing treatment to impart easy-care properties, synthetic fibers already exhibit these easy-care criteria and require only a heat setting operation.

===Purification and preliminary processes===
The '''grey cloth''',woven cotton fabric in its loom-state, not only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes.&lt;ref name="Finishing"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=68&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Finishing|title=Finishing|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://website.lineone.net/~davghalgh/cotton_finishing.html|title=Cotton finishing|last=GREENHALGH|first=DAVID|year=2005|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Singeing'''
{{Main|Singe#Textiles}}
::Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"/&gt;

*'''[[Desizing]]'''
::Depending on the size that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the size.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Scouring'''
::Scouring, is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called [[Boiler|kier]]s. The fabric is boiled in an [[alkali]], which forms a soap with free fatty acids ([[saponification]]). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] can be boiled under pressure, excluding [[oxygen]] which would degrade the [[cellulose]] in the fibre. If the appropriate [[reagent]]s are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"/&gt;

*'''Bleaching'''
{{Main|Textile bleaching}}
::Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an [[oxidizing agent]], such as dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]] or dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]]. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mercerising'''
{{Main|Mercerized cotton}}
::A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coloration===
Color is a sensation caused when white light from a source such as the sun is reflected off a pigment on the surface. The pigment selectively reflects certain wavelengths of light while absorbing others. A dye can be considered as a substance that can be fixed to a material that has these properties. The colour it reflects is defined by the structure of the molecule, and particular the parts of the [[chromogen]] molecule called the [[chromophore group]].
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two processes used to apply colour:

*'''Dyeing'''
{{Main|Dyeing}}
::Finally, cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration processes. Dyeing, for instance, is commonly carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved fastness to washing, rubbing and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Printing'''
{{Main|Textile printing}}
::Printing, on the other hand, is the application of colour in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs on to already dyed fabric is also possible. The common processes are [[block printing]], [[roller printing]] and [[screen printing]]

===Finishing===
'''Mechanical finishing'''
*'''Raising'''
::Another finishing process is raising. During raising, the fabric surface is treated with sharp teeth to lift the surface fibres, thereby imparting hairiness, softness and warmth, as in flannelette.

*'''Calendering'''
{{Main|Calender}}
::Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and relative speeds.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Chemical finishing'''
::Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects. 
*'''Shrinking (Sanforizing)'''
{{Main|Sanforization}}
::Mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standard finishes==

=== Quality-oriented ===
* [[Calendering]]
* [[Decatising]]
* [[Desizing]] for woven fabrics.
* [[Ironing|Pressing]]
* [[Textile bleaching|Scouring]] with detergents, alkaline solutions, or enzymes removes foreign matter.
* [[Shrinkage (fabric)|Shrinking]], [[Sanforization]]
* Shearing or [[singe#Textiles|singeing]] smooths the fabric by removing the fine protruding fibers on the surface of the fabric. Flame singeing is the standard process: the wet fabric is passed through an array of gas burners at a suitable distance to burn the [[Pill (textile)|pills]] off of its surface.

===Design-oriented===
* [[Textile bleaching|Bleaching]] of woven fabrics removes any prior color in order to obtain a uniform color during the dying process.
* [[Dyeing]] adds color.
* [[Textile printing|Printing]] adds color and pattern.
* [[Watered silk|Watering]] adds [[moiré pattern]]s.

===Handle-oriented===
* [[Fulling]] or ''waulking'' adds weight and density.
* [[Hydrophobic]] finishing produces a fabric that repels stains or water.
* [[Weighted silk|Weighting]] silk with metallic salts or polymer adds weight and improves handle.

==Special finishes for natural fibers==
'''Bio-polishing''' removes the protruding fibers of a fabric through the action of an [[enzyme]]. Enzymes, such as [[cellulase]] for cotton, selectively remove protruding fibers. These enzymes may be [[Catalysis|deactivated]] by an increase in temperature.

'''[[Mercerisation]]''' makes woven cotton fabric stronger, more lustrous, to have better dye affinity, and to be less abrasive.

'''[[Nap (textile)|Raising]]''' lifts the surface fibers to improve the softness and warmth, as in [[Flannel#Flannelette|flannelette]].

'''Peach Finish''' subjects the fabric (either cotton or its synthetic blends) to emery wheels, making the surface [[velvet]]-like. This is a special finish used mostly in garments.

'''[[Fulling]]''' or ''waulking'' is a method of thickening woollen material to make it more water-resistant.

'''[[Decatising]]''' to bring dimension stability to [[woollen]] fabrics.

'''[[Calendering]]''' makes one or both surfaces of the fabric smooth and shiny. The fabric is passed to through hot, fast-moving [[stainless steel]] cylinders.

'''[[Sanforization|Sanforizing]] or Pre-shrinking''' prevents a fabric and the produced garment from shrinking after production. This is also a mechanical finish, acquired by feeding the fabric between a roller and rubber blanket, in such a way the rubber blanket compresses the [[weft]] threads and imparts compressive shrinkage.

'''Crease-Resist finish''' or  "wash-and-wear" or "wrinkle-free" finishes are achieved by the addition of a chemical resin finish that makes the fiber take on a quality similar to that of synthetic fibers.

'''Anti-microbial finish''' causes a fabric to inhibit the growth of [[microbe]]s. The humid and warm environment found in textile fibers encourages the growth of the microbes. Infestation by microbes can cause cross-infection by [[pathogen]]s and the development of odor where the fabric is worn next to skin. In addition, stains and loss of fiber quality of textile substrates can also take place. With an aim to protect the skin of the wearer and the textile substrate itself, an anti-microbial finish is applied to textile materials.

==Special finishes for synthetic fibers==
'''[[Heat-setting]]''' of synthetic fabrics eliminates the internal tensions within the fiber, generated during manufacturing, and the new state can be fixed by rapid cooling. This heat setting fixes the fabrics in the relaxed state, and thus avoids subsequent shrinkage or creasing of the fabric. Presetting of goods makes it possible to use higher temperature for setting without considering the sublimation properties of dyes and also has a favorable effect on dyeing behavior and the running properties of the fabric. On the other hand, post-setting can be combined with some other operations such as Thermasol dyeing or optical brightening of polyester. Post-setting as a final finish is useful to achieve high dimensional stability, along with desired handle. Heat-setting is an important part in textile finishing.

'''Stiffening and filling process:''' A stiffening effect is desirable in certain polyamides and polyester materials (e.g. petticoats, collar inner linings), which can be done by reducing the mutual independence of structural elements of fabric by polymer deposition on [[coating]] as a fine film.

'''[[Hydrophile|Hydrophilic finishes]]''' compensate for lower moisture and water absorption capacity in synthetic fiber materials, which become uncomfortable in contact with skin. Certain products, based on modified (oxy-ethylated) polyamides, make the fabric more pleasant by reducing the cohesion of water so that it spreads over a larger area and thus evaporates more readily.

'''Anti-pilling finish''' alleviates [[Pill (textile)|pilling]], an unpleasant phenomenon associated with spun yarn fabrics, especially when they contain synthetics. Synthetic fibers are more readily brought to the surface of a fabric due to their smooth surface and circular [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], and due to their higher [[tensile strength]] and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] resistance. With [[knitting|knit]] "picking" also occurs: by abrasion, individual fibers work themselves out of yarn loops onto the surface, and the garment catches on a pointed or rough object. Knitting is susceptible to these effects due to the open weave and bulky yarn.

'''Anti-static finish''' prevents dust from clinging to the fabric. Anti-static effective chemicals are largely chemically [[Chemically inert|inert]] and require Thermasol or heat treatment for fixing on polyester fabrics. Polyether agents have been found to be useful but should not affect the dye-equilibrium on fiber, lest they impair the rubbing fastness.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} In general, Thermasol anti-static agents also have a good soil release action, which is as permanent as the anti-static effect. Anti-static finishes may also be of polyamide type, being curable at moderate temperatures.

'''Non-slip finishes''' give the filaments a rougher surface. Synthetic [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] and weft threads in loosely woven fabrics are particularly prone to slip because of their surface smoothness when the structure of fabric is disturbed and appearance is no longer attractive. [[Silica gel]] dispersions or silicic acid colloidal solutions are used in combination with latex polymer or [[acrylate]]s dispersions to get more permanent effect, along with simultaneous improvement in resistance to pilling or [[snag (textiles)|snagging]]. These polymer finishes are also capable of imparting a soft and smooth handle to synthetic fabric without making it water repellent.

'''[[Flame retardant|Fire Resistant or Flame Retardant finish]]:''' to reduce [[flammability]].

'''Anti-microbial finish:''' with the increasing use of synthetic fibers for carpets and other materials in public places, anti-microbial finishes have gained importance. Products which are commonly applied are brominated [[phenol]]s, [[quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], [[organosilver chemistry|organo-silver]] and tin compounds, which can be applied as solutions or dispersions. They can also be incorporated in a [[polymeric]] film deposited on the surface to achieve controlled release.

== Outline of story ==
[[File:25 tam back.jpg|thumb| Backside of Tibetan [[Historical money of Tibet|25 tam banknote]], dated 1659 of the Tibetan Era (= 1913 CE). On the right, the four harmonious animals are represented.]]
A popular scene often found as wall paintings in Tibetan religious buildings represents an elephant standing under a fruit tree carrying a monkey, a hare and a bird (usually a partridge, but sometimes a grouse, and in Bhutan a [[hornbill]]) on top of each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gruschke|first1=Andreas|title=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: The Qinghai part of Amdo|date=2001|publisher=White Lotus Press|location=Bangkok|isbn=9747534592|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GuKfAAAAMAAJ|series=The Cultural Monuments of Tibet's Outer Provinces: Amdo|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene refers to a legend which tells that four animals were trying to find out who was the oldest. The elephant said that the tree was already fully grown when he was young, the monkey that the tree was small when he was young, the hare that he saw the tree as a sapling when he was young and the bird claimed that he had excreted the seed from which the tree grew. So the bird was recognized by the other animals as the oldest, and the four animals lived together in co-dependence and cooperation, helping each other to enjoy the fruits of the tree. After the story is finished, it is revealed the partridge was the Buddha in a previous life.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/bud/j1/j1040.htm|title=The Jataka|volume=I|first=Robert|last=Chalmers|author-link=Robert Chalmers, 1st Baron Chalmers|year=1895|chapter=Tittira Jātaka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The story was meant as an illustration of cooperation and respect for seniority, and was told by the Buddha after some of his students had failed to pay due respect to the senior disciple [[Śāriputra]].&lt;ref name="Whitecross 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=Whitecross,|title="Virtuous Beings": The Concept of ''tha damtshig'' and Being a Moral Person in Contemporary Bhutanese Society|journal=Himalaya, the Journal of the Association for Nepal and Himalayan Studies|date=1 January 2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.macalester.edu/himalaya/vol28/iss1/6/|language=en|issn=2471-3716|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malalasekera 1938"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Tittira Jātaka (No.37)|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names|author-link=G P Malalasekera|first=G.P.|last=Malalasekera|volume=2|url=http://palikanon.com/english/pali_names/t/tittira_j_37_117_319_438.htm|year=1938|publisher=[[Pali Text Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the tale also describes the animals upholding the [[five precepts]] and teaching them to others.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005" /&gt; One of the oldest extant forms of the story is the [[Pali]] version, called the ''Tittira Jataka''.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}

== Themes ==
[[File:FourHarmoniousAnimalsROI.jpg|thumb|Wall painting, [[Sikkim]]|left|upright=0.5]]
Communal harmony and respect for seniority are the main moral of the story. Such respect stands in contrast with a [[pecking-order]] according to strength, size and power: it is {{em|the partridge}} which is most respected, not the elephant.&lt;ref name="Penjore 2005"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penjore|first1=Ugyen|title=Understanding the symbolism of Thuenpa Puen Zhi|url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=40,1531,0,0,1,0#.WI0s0FUrK70|via=The Buddhist Channel|accessdate=28 January 2017|work=Kuensel Online|date=2 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Buddha did sometimes downplay the value respecting older people merely for their age, in this story he illustrates that a senior person should nonetheless be respected for their experience, because, as Tachibana points out, "the maturity of age is generally the sign of much experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tachibana|first1=S.|title=The ethics of Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/?id=BRWyqi2K4WUC|date=1992|publisher=[[Curzon Press]]|location=Richmond, Surrey|isbn=978-0-7007-0230-5|page=224|edition=Facsim.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the story led to the establishment of several rules of conduct with regard to respect for seniority in the context of the monastic life, in which the {{em|number of years ordained}} as a [[Bhikkhu|monk]] (''{{lang-sa|bhikṣu}}''; ''{{lang-pi|bhikkhu}}'') is measured, rather than {{em|age}}.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 1895" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Sarah|title=The Jatakas: Birth Stories of the Bodhisatta|date=2006|publisher=[[Penguin UK]]|isbn=9788184750348|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ay4WFGQtSy0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] explains the relation between respect for seniority and harmony, drawing from the story: "A hierarchy based on seniority, however, is both objective and, in the long run, less oppressive: One's place in the hierarchy is not a measure of one's worth.  Such a hierarchy also discourages the pride and competition that would come if bhikkhus could fight their way up the hierarchy by outdoing the measurable merit of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/bmc2.pdf|title=The Buddhist Monastic Code|date=2013|publisher=[[Metta Forest Monastery]]|year=|isbn=|edition=3rd|volume=II|location=California|page=92|pages=|quote=|author-link=Thanissaro Bhikkhu|via=|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Thanissaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four animals represent the different [[habitats]] of the animal world—the sky, the trees, the ground, and underground.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}} The partridge assumes the role of the most senior animal: in pre-modern India, the partridge was highly regarded for its intelligence and understanding  of language.&lt;ref name="Gutierrez 2014"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=The Parrot’s Voice and the Partridge’s Feathers: The Languaging of Animals and Animal Language in Early Indian Texts|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/28521|first=Andrea Lorene|last=Gutiérrez|publisher=[[The University of Texas]]|type=M.A. Thesis|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excreting of the seed of the tree is relevant, because some Indian trees are believed to only sprout when the seed is excreted by a bird, thus further amplifying the concept of cooperation and mutual dependence.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|53}} The image of the animals standing on each other’s shoulders, on the back of a patient elephant, also portrays social and environmental harmony: the bird finds a seed and plants it, then the rabbit waters it, and the monkey fertilizes it. Once the seed sprouts and begins to grow, the elephant protects it. After some time, the small plant grows into a big, beautiful tree full of healthy fruit. By working together and using their individual talents, the four friends are able to reach and enjoy the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.folklife.si.edu/resources/pdf/Signs/Bhutan/BH_PRG_03.pdf|title=The Four Harmonious Friends|last=|first=|date=12 June 2008|website=[[Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary source for the Buddhist legend of the four harmonious brothers is the ''[[Vinaya Pitaka|Vinayavastu]]'' ({{bo|w='dul ba'i gzhi}}), which forms the first section of the [[Kangyur]], the canon of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Dagyab 2016" /&gt;{{rp|107}}&lt;ref name="sagaster" /&gt; In canons of other Buddhist traditions, such as in the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravāda]] Buddhism, and in the texts of the [[Mahāsāṃghika]], [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] and [[Sarvāstivāda]] orders, almost the same ''Jātaka'' tale is found in the ''Vinaya'' and ''Jātaka'' collections. The [[Dharmaguptaka]] and [[Mahīśāsaka]] orders did not consider the story part of the ''Jātaka'', however, and only included it in their ''Vinayas''. [[Bhikkhu Analayo]] believes that originally the story was not considered a previous life of the Buddha, but only a [[didactic]] [[parable]] taught by the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Analayo 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|title=Canonical Jātaka Tales in Comparative Perspective: The Evolution of Tales of the Buddha's Past Lives|journal=Fuyan Buddhist Studies|date=2012|volume=7|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/38470683/CanonicalJatakas.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1485644573&amp;Signature=et7fWx%2FMyFxtAwEa%2BgTKug1ISow%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DCanonical_Jataka_Tales_in_Comparative_Pe.pdf|publisher=Fuyan Buddhist Institute|location=[[Hsinchu]]|issn=2070-0512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old Irish]] scholar [[Eleanor Hull]] has pointed out that the story may reveal a custom of the ancient world to determine the date based on the life spans of different animals. Stories dealing with the question which animal lives the longest are found throughout the world. Asiatic versions of the story usually feature three animals, as indeed, the Pali and Chinese versions of the ''Jātaka'' do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hull|first1=Eleanor|author-link=Eleanor Hull|title=The Hawk of Achill or the Legend of the Oldest Animals|journal=Folklore|date=December 1932|volume=43|issue=4|pages=377, 383|doi=10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0015587X.1932.9718462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ralston|first1=W.R.S.|title=The Bible of Tibet: Tibetan Tales from Indian Sources|date=2012|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1-136-20297-1|page=302|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eoiZAeFA_8YC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the fourth animal not present in the Pali version, the hare—it was included in later versions.&lt;ref name="Beer 2003" /&gt;{{rp|51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kimball|first1=Mike|title=Our heritage is already broken: meditations on a regenerative conservation for cultural and natural heritage|journal=Human Ecology Review|date=2016|page=13|doi=10.4225/13/581fcdf8dc329|url=http://hdl.handle.net/1885/100985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Freedom to Create Prize''' was established in 2008 to foster prosperity in the developing world by investing in the creative foundations of society. The Freedom to Create Prize was awarded from 2008 to 2011 to support and recognise artists who strive for social change in places where there is no "freedom to create".

== Freedom to Create Prize ==
The '''Freedom to Create Prize''' celebrates the power of art to promote social justice and inspire the human spirit. The Prize is open to artists in all creative fields. Artwork is assessed on its ability to accomplish one or all of the following: promote social justice, build societal foundations, and inspire the human spirit.

Each year, US$125,000 in prize money is awarded across three categories: Main, Youth and Imprisoned Artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-FAQ.asp Freedom to Create Prize FAQ] 'freedomtocreate.com'&lt;/ref&gt;

| '''[[Sister Fa]] (Fatou Diatta)''' || [[Senegal]] || Sister Fa has taken enormous personal risks to champion the rights of women and girls in West Africa. One of the most widely recognised female rap artists in Senegal, she has devoted her life’s work to raising awareness of the dangers of [[female genital mutilation]], a practice, in theory, has been outlawed by the state, but which in fact, continues across Africa and infringes on the basic rights of women and girls. Using her music to speak out, Sister Fa encourages women to educate themselves and to create a movement for social change. || bgcolor=gold | First Prize
|-
| '''[[Ayat Al-Gormezi]]''' || [[Bahrain]] || Ayat Al-Gormezi, a poet and student at the Faculty of Teachers in Bahrain, was arrested in February 2011 because she recited a poem which criticised government policy in [[Pearl Roundabout|Pearl Square]]. Ayat was subjected to harassment, defamation, intimidation and threats of rape and murder whilst in prison, where she served two months of a one-year sentence as the first female [[prisoner of conscience]] in Bahrain. Ayat has become a symbol of resistance to repression in Bahrain, encouraging thousands of young people and women to take to the streets to express their opinions and stand up for justice. || bgcolor=silver | Second Prize
|-
| '''[[Ramy Essam]]''' || [[Egypt]] || Ramy Essam began the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|25th January Revolution]] in Egypt purely as a participant, but was soon called upon by his fellow protesters to provide a soundtrack to their struggles and was quickly labelled as the ‘singer of the revolution’. He rose to prominence during the revolution with a collection of songs that captured the fear, optimism and defiant demand for change that was sweeping across the country. Ramy spent 18 days in [[Tahrir Square]] as an integral part of the revolution, writing music and performing songs to motivate the protesters, risking his life and suffering threats and attacks from the military police, but refusing to leave until [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak’s]] regime collapsed. || bgcolor=cc9966 | Third Prize
|-
| '''Rachelle Agbossou''' || [[Benin]] || Rachelle is the first female dance choreographer in Benin, one of the smallest and most densely populated regions in Africa. She formed ‘Compagnie Walo’ which uses a mix of contemporary and traditional dance to focus on social issues that impact communities in Benin.

|-
| '''Song Byeok''' || [[North Korea]] || Growing up in North Korea, based on his artistic skills, Song Byeok was selected at the age of 24 to become an official state propagandist. His faith in the Dear Leader was only shaken when [[North Korean famine|famine struck North Korea]] in the 1990s and millions of people died, including Song’s mother, father and sister. Before escaping for South Korea, he endured torture at the hands of the regime after being captured while attempting to cross into China to secure food for his starving family. Now dedicated to promoting freedom, he paints acrylic pieces as satires of [[Kim Jong-Il]]. Song’s art represents a global call for reconciliation between North and South Korea and a demand for the Kim regime to reveal the truth about the situation in North Korea. || Finalist
|-
| '''[[Tarik Samarah]]''' || [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] || Tarik Samarah is a Bosnian photographer who works in artistic and documentary photography. His ‘Srebrenica’ billboard campaign exhibited images of the [[Srebrenica massacre]] on large commercial billboards as a way of raising awareness about events that took place during the Srebrenica Genocide. Tarik’s photographs are a powerful and haunting glimpse into the legacy of the genocide that took place in the heart of Europe on the threshold of the 21st century. Almost 8,000 innocent men were killed, during only the fourth genocide to be officially recognised by the UN. Tarik took numerous risks to get to the heart of where these events took place to take these disturbing images, and his work has been censored and banned numerous times. || Finalist
|-
| '''Thet Sambath''' and '''Rob Lemkin''' || [[Cambodia]] || Thet Sambath spent 10 years gaining the trust of former [[Khmer Rouge]] perpetrators and persuaded them to confess their crimes on film in order to understand this most mysterious of genocidal events – both for himself as a victim of the [[Khmer Rouge Killing Fields|Killing Fields]], his fellow Cambodians and the word as a whole. The film ''[[Enemies of the People (film)|Enemies of the People]]'' not only tells a previously untold story, brought to the screen with the support of Rob Lemkin, but also suggests a more peaceful way to deal with violence. || Finalist

==== Reaction ====
2010 Freedom to Create Prize panelist and former First Lady of Egypt, [[Jehan Sadat]], said:
"The artists who have been selected as finalists in this year's Freedom to Create competition know full well the price they are paying to express their ideas, hopes, and dreams for their people and their nations. 
They have endured harsh criticisms, and in some cases, have placed themselves in grave danger.  As a result, they have done more than expose the ills plaguing their societies.  They have provided solutions and alternatives, and by so doing, they are trying to change the world.  Each exemplifies the power of art, music, and the written word."

== Freedom to Create Prize Exhibition ==

The Freedom to Create Prize Exhibition was a yearly travelling exhibition of notable entries from that year's Freedom to Create Prize. The 2009, 2010, and 2011 Prize Exhibitions were held in various cities around the world, including [[London]], [[New York City]], [[Harare]], [[Kabul]], [[Cairo]], [[Mumbai]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Xiamen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-2009-Exhibition-London.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-2009-Exhibition-NewYork.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-2009-Exhibition-Harare.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-2009-Exhibition-Kabul.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Prize-2010-Exhibitions.asp 2010 Freedom to Create Prize Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom to Create Forum ==

In 2010, Freedom to Create launched a new initiative, the Freedom to Create Forum. The forum was a series of panel discussions which aimed to debate the challenges and opportunities for women in building creative and prosperous lives, families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomtocreate.com/Forum.asp 2010 Freedom to Create Prize Forum]'freedomtocreate.com'&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural forum was held on 24 November 2010, at the [[American University in Cairo]]. The panel featured guest of honour and 2010 Prize judge [[Jehan Sadat|Jehan Sedat]], moderator and international broadcaster [[Femi Oke]] and was accompanied by [[Mariane Pearl]], Dalia Ziada, [[Kimberle Crenshaw|Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw]] and Dianne Laurance. It focused on the misuse of traditional, cultural, and religious dogmas that hinder opportunities for women.

There were two Freedom to Create Forums held in 2011. The first was held in New York, featuring a discussion on female entrepreneurship and empowerment in developing countries. The panel featured [[Mary Ellen Iskenderian]], Francine LeFrak, [[Lauren Bush]], and moderator Femi Oke. The second Forum was held in Cape Town, featuring women who have challenged structures keeping women vulnerable in their communities. The panel included keynote speaker [[Graça Machel]], panelists [[Unity Dow]], Chouchou Namegabe, and [[Molly Melching]], and moderator [[Gcina Mhlophe]].

Godzilla's contemporaries included Godzookie, and the Barnstormers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
The original members of Godzilla were [[Tomie Arai]], Ken Chu, [[Karin Higa]], Arlan Huang, [[Byron Kim]], Bing Lee, Colin Lee, Janet Lin, Mei-Lin Liu, Margo Machida, Stephanie Mar, Yong Soon Min, Helen Oji, Eugenie Tsai, Charles Yuen and Garson Yu.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|last=Chang|first=Alexandra|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=0195335791|editor-last=Marter|editor-first=Joan M.|location=|pages=344}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 24, 1914|title=Karen Higa (1966-2013)|url=http://artforum.com/passages/id=45076|journal=ARTFORUM|last1=Joselit|first1=David|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Godzilla's members were previously involved in [[Basement Workshop]] and [[Asian American Arts Centre|Asian American Art Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hyperallergic.com/330442/a-brief-history-of-the-art-collectives-of-nycs-chinatown/|title=A Brief History of the Art Collectives of NYC’s Chinatown|last=Wong|first=Ryan|date=February 7, 2017|website=Hyperallergic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members decided to name the organization "Godzilla" after Japanese movie monster [[Godzilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-ken-chu-1|title=Interview with Ken Chu, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective organized "slide slams" where hundreds of artists had the opportunity to display their work as well as view other artists' works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who We Be: A Cultural History of Race in Post-Civil Rights America|last=Chang|first=Jeff|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2014|isbn=1466854650|location=|pages=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godzilla also published a national newsletter that included member-written opinion pieces, coverage of Asian American art from across the United States, and calls for artwork. Because Godzilla members rejected formally becoming a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)3 organization]], rotating volunteer committees coordinated much of its work. The Godzilla logo and newsletters were designed and produced by Charles Yuen.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Other notable artists and arts professionals who later joined Godzilla include artists [[Paul Pfeiffer (artist)|Paul Pfeiffer]], [[Zhang Hongtu]], [[Nina Kuo]], [[Allan deSouza]], and art critic Alice Yang.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Whitney Biennial Protest ===
In the spring of 1991, members of Godzilla published a letter highlighting the historic absence of Asian American artists in the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]'s [[Whitney Biennial|Biennial]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/23/arts/art-expressing-the-hyphen-in-asian-american.html|title=ART; Expressing the Hyphen in 'Asian-American'|last=Karmel|first=Pepe|date=1995-04-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-15|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/04/identity-politics-that-forever-changed-art.html|title=The Reviled Identity Politics Show That Forever Changed Art|date=2016-04-21|work=Vulture|access-date=2017-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective chose to call attention to this absence in part because of the Whitney Biennial's influence in establishing trends in the American art scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://as-ap.org/content/oral-history-interview-margo-machida-1|title=Interview with Margo Machida, Co-Founder, Godzilla {{!}} Art Spaces Archives Project|website=as-ap.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Godzilla's letter, Whitney Museum director David Ross met with Godzilla members Tsai, Machida, Pfeiffer and others to discuss plans to expand minority representation the Whitney's curatorial staff, which was intended to in turn improve the representation of minority artists in the Whitney's future biennials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Tsai was subsequently appointed as a curator at the Whitney in 1994.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10106">'''Intangible Asset Finance''' is the branch of [[finance]] that deals with [[intangible assets]] such as [[patents]] (legal intangible) and [[reputation]] (competitive intangible). Like other areas of finance, intangible asset finance is concerned with the interdependence of [[Value (economics)|value]], [[risk]], and [[time]].

== Basic principles ==

In 2003, one estimate put the [[economic equilibrium]] of intangible assets in the U.S. [[economy]] at $5 trillion, which represented over one-third or more of the value of U.S. domestic [[corporations]] in the first quarter of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RmFLUk7NydQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Intangible+Assets:+Values,+Measures+and+Risks,&amp;sig=W2d87NPMzvfWlTDrmUNijOziu-8#PPA28,M1 "A Trillion Dollars A Year In Intangible Investment," Leonard Nakamura in '''Intangible Assets: Values, Measures and Risks''' at 28, Hand &amp; Lev, Oxford University Press (2003).]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the goals of people working in this field is to unlock the "hidden value" found in intangible assets through the techniques of finance. Another goal is to measure how firm performance correlates with intangible asset [[management]].

Intangible assets include [[business processes]], Intellectual Property (IP) such as [[patents]], [[trademarks]], [[reputation]]s for [[ethics]] and [[integrity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[safety]], [[sustainability]], [[security]], and [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]]. Today, these intangibles drive [[cash flow]] and are the primary sources of risk. Intangible asset information, [[management]], [[risk forecasting]] and [[risk transfer]] are growing services as the [[economic base]] divests itself of physical [[assets]]. Rights to tangible and intangible assets are intangible, and can be traded globally.&lt;ref&gt;Gio Wiederhold; ''Valuing intangible Capital, Multinationals and Taxhavens''; Springer Verlag, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business models ==

A number of intangible asset business models have evolved over the years.

*'''Patent Licensing &amp; Enforcement Companies ("P-LECs")''': These are firms that acquire patents for the sole purpose of securing licenses and/or damages awards from infringing parties. Perhaps the most famous P-LEC is [[NTP, Inc.]], which has successfully asserted patents related to email [[push technology]]. Another name for a P-LEC is "[[patent troll]]," although this is viewed as a pejorative reference. Recently, [[hedge funds]] have raised capital for the specific purpose of investing in patent litigation.   One such hedge fund is Altitude Capital Partners, which is based in [[New York City]].
*'''Royalty stream securitizers''': These are firms that are engaged in the buying and selling of what are essentially specialized [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]]. The assets that are securitized are typically intellectual properties, such as patents, that have been bearing royalties for a period of time. Royalty Pharma is a well known firm that uses this business model, and which has done by far the largest and most high-profile deals in this space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedeal.com/newsweekly/features/a-seller's-market.php#bottom "A seller's market," The Deal, September 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Royalty Pharma handled what many consider to be the first [[pharmaceutical]] patent-backed securitization to be rated by [[Standard and Poors]], which involved a patent on the [[HIV]] drug [[Zerit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rESRFPqSKzQC&amp;pg=PA487&amp;lpg=PA487&amp;dq=zerit+patent+securitization&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sN9S5ZWcrM&amp;sig=LhlE-nYfxXddjCKeoGql6ap5KxM&amp;hl=en#PPA487,M1 "Avoiding Transaction Peril," Heller et al., in '''From Ideas to Assets: Investing Wisely in Intellectual Property''' at 487, Bruce Berman, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The other parties involved in the Zerit transaction were [[Yale]] (the owner of the patent) and [[Bristol Myers Squibb]].
*'''Reinsurers''': These are firms that use the techniques of [[reinsurance]] to mitigate intangible asset risks. In the same way that some firms issue [[Catastrophe bond|cat bonds]] to mitigate the risks associated with [[extreme weather]], [[earthquake]]s, or other natural disasters, firms exposed to substantial intangible risk can issue "intangible asset risk-linked securities" that transfer intangible risk to hedge funds and other players in the capital markets with a sufficient appetite for risk. Steel City Re, which is based in [[Pittsburgh]], is a [[thought leader]] regarding the use of risk transfer techniques to protect and recover intangible asset value.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steelcityre.com/accelerating_innovation.shtml Steel City Re]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Market makers''': Firms that are working to provide more [[liquidity]] to the market for intellectual property. Early [[market maker]]s offered on-line intellectual property exchanges where buyers and sellers could exchange rights in licensed intellectual property, usually patents. On April 22, 2008, Ocean Tomo reported&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceantomo.com/press/Europe_Auction_Catalogue_Release_4.22.08.pdf Ocean Tomo Press Release April 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; that it had transacted approximately $70 million in its IP auctions across [[Europe]] and the [[United States]]. In 2009, The Intellectual Property Exchange International (IPXI), headquartered in Chicago, will begin operations as the world’s first [[stock exchange]] with an intellectual property focus.
*'''Investment Research Firms''': Companies that provide specific advice to investors on intellectual property issues.   Recently, hedge fund managers have been hiring patent [[Lawyer|attorneys]] to follow and handicap outcomes in high-stakes patent cases.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

== Significant transactions ==

*'''1997''':  [[David Bowie]] securitizes the future royalty revenues earned from his pre-1990 music catalogue by issuing [[Bowie Bonds]].
*'''2000''': BioPharma Royalty Trust completes the $115 million securitization of a single Yale patent with claims covering [[Stavudine]], which is a [[reverse transcriptase inhibitor]] and the active ingredient in the drug Zerit. This was the first publicly rated patent securitization in the U.S. At the time of the deal, Bristol Myers Squibb had the exclusive rights to distribute Zerit in the U.S. Not long after closing slow sales of Zerit along with an accounting [[scandal]] at Bristol Myers Squibb triggered the accelerated and premature [[amortization]] of the transaction. Many observers believe that this deal was ultimately unsuccessful because of a lack of [[Diversification (finance)|diversification]] as it involved a single patent and a single [[licensee]].
*'''2005''': UCC Capital Corporation securitization of BCBG [[Max Azria]]'s royalty receivables generated from worldwide intellectual property rights worth $53 million. This transaction is recognized as the first "whole company securitization" involving primarily intangible assets. UCC Capital Corporation was founded by Robert W. D'Loren, and was acquired by [[NexCen Brands, Inc.]] in 2006. NexCen sold substantially all of its assets to Levine Leichtman Capital Partners in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/05/13/idUS107689+13-May-2010+BW20100513 NexCen Press Release, May 13, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''2005''': Ocean Tomo holds its first live IP auction. Although proceeds from the first auction were unremarkable, the relative success of the Ocean Tomo auctions that followed showed that the live auction is a reasonably viable business model for monetizing intellectual property.
*'''2006''':  [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s film rights securitization in conjunction with [[Ambac Financial Group]] to provide a triple-A financial guarantee on a [[credit facility]] for Marvel backed by a slate of 10 films to be produced by Marvel Studios and [[intellectual property]] related to some of Marvel’s most popular [[comic book]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambac.com/pdfs%5CDeals%5Cmarvel.pdf Ambac's press release, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government, societies, think tanks, and other non-profits ==

On June 23, 2008, the [[United States National Academies]] hosted a one-day conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] entitled "Intangible Assets: Measuring and Enhancing Their Contribution to Corporate Value and Economic Growth."

[[The Intangible Asset Finance Society]] provides a forum for finance, innovation, legal and management professionals to discover better ways to create, capture and preserve the value of intangible assets.

The Athena Alliance is a non-profit organization dedicated to
public education and research on the emerging global [[information economy]]. On April 16, 2008 it published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.athenaalliance.org/pdf/IntangibleAssetMonetization.pdf "Intangible Asset Monetization: The Promise and the Reality"]&lt;/ref&gt; a widely circulated working paper on the topic of intangible asset finance.

'''''Ironclad''''' is a 2011 British action adventure [[war film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ironclad-v533401|work=Allmovie|title=Ironclad|accessdate=10 November 2012|author=Buchanan, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Jonathan English]]. Written by English and Erick Kastel, based on a screenplay by Stephen McDool, the cast includes [[James Purefoy]], [[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]], [[Kate Mara]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Vladimir Kulich]], [[Mackenzie Crook]], [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Charles Dance]].&lt;ref name="SouthWalesEcho"/&gt; The film chronicles the [[First Barons' War|siege]] of [[Rochester Castle]] by [[John, King of England|King John]] in 1215.&lt;ref name="SouthWalesEcho"/&gt; The film was shot entirely in [[Wales]] in 2009 and produced on a budget of $25&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt;

==Plot==
A prologue describes how the barons of [[Kingdom of England|England]], aided by the [[Knights Templar]], fought against tyrannical [[John, King of England|King John]] in a [[First Barons' War|war]] that lasted more than three years. It ended with the King signing the [[Magna Carta]], a document granting rights to all English [[franklin (class)|freemen]].

King John regrets succumbing to the pressure of the barons to sign the Magna Carta.  Soon after, he hires an army of pagan [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danish]] mercenaries under the leadership of a warlord, Captain Tiberius, to restore John's absolute authority over the kingdom, under the presumption that the [[Pope]] has agreed to keep Christian missionaries out of their lands in [[Denmark]].

The Abbot Marcus leads three Templar knights (who have taken vows of silence) on a pilgrimage to [[Canterbury]] and they take shelter from the rain at Darnay Castle. One of the knights, Thomas Marshall, is assured by the [[abbot]] that Marshall's release from the Templar Order will be sought at Canterbury. By morning, King John arrives at the castle with his army and mercenaries. Baron Darnay signed the Magna Carta and in retribution John orders him hanged. The Abbot attempts to intervene and the King orders that the abbot's tongue be cut off. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall escapes the castle on horseback carrying the abbot; the two knights left behind are slain. The abbot dies before night of his wound, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain.

Once he has reached [[Canterbury]], Marshall meets with [[Stephen Langton|Archbishop Langton]], the author of the Magna Carta, and Baron [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|William d'Aubigny]], a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] for writing the Magna Carta. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do so is [[Rochester Castle]], the seat of Baron Cornhill and a strategic stronghold that controls southern England and allows access to [[London]] and the rest of the country.

[[File:Rochester Castle, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582414.jpg|thumb|300px|left|[[Rochester Castle]]]]
Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire, Guy, and a petty criminal named Jedediah, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] where, on arriving, they discover several Danish mercenaries have already claimed the [[Rochester Castle|castle]]; the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danes, and then claim Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Cornhill. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men leave if they wish; none accept.

A second assault sees the Danes' siege tower destroyed by a [[trebuchet]] crafted by the defenders from within the castle. John's forces then attempt to starve out the defenders. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off in haste to expedite affairs. As the season turns to winter, the hunger of the castle's occupants continue; Marshall leaves the castle under cover of night and then returns ahead of his pursuers with food stolen from the Danish camp. The castle morale is bolstered by Marshall's act and he gives in to the advances of Cornhill's young wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows.

The Danish leader, Tiberius, threatened by John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next attack and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos, d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armour and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep.

Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then hurled by the castle trebuchet into a [[keep]] wall. Cornhill tries to surrender but is stopped; he goes instead upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself. John's engineers have been preparing a mine under the keep's foundation, and they have a herd of pigs brought and put in the mine which is then stoked, set afire and the animal fat used to damage the keep's foundation, causing it to collapse; as the keep's walls come down, the final assault begins.

The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, the latter knocked unconscious by falling rubble. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed, until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after a long and savage duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and [[Kingdom of France|French]] army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England's new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that "We held".

The epilogue describes King John's death during his retreat and the reconstruction of [[Rochester Castle]], and how it, like the [[Magna Carta]], still stands.

==Production==
Actress [[Megan Fox]] was attached to the film when the film's production company, Mythic, began promoting it to investors at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]. Fox left the film and was later replaced by [[Kate Mara]]. Due to the decreased amount of credit and financing available in 2009, the budget of the film was reduced and the entire supporting cast was changed, with the exception of actors [[James Purefoy]] and [[Paul Giamatti]]. Producer Andrew Curtis described the financing of the film as "more complex than a [[Tube map|London Underground map]]" to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine; the film ended up crediting 18 executive producers.&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dawtrey | first = Adam | date = 7 May 2010 | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018859.html | title = 'Ironclad' overcomes finance obstacles | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 7 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates range from 95 to 140 knights supported by [[Crossbowman|crossbowmen]], sergeants, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Reginald Allen |title=Rochester Castle |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |location=London |year=1969 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; John did take the castle, most of the higher nobles being imprisoned or banished; and the French did not arrive in England until some six months after the siege had ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of England|year=1826|publisher=Talboys and Wheeler, and William Pickering (orig. James S. Virtue)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63wBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|first=David |last=Hume|authorlink=David Hume|accessdate=22 August 2011|page=83|chapter=11|quote=he was content to sacrifice, in this barbarous manner, the inferior prisoners only. The captivity of William de Albiney, the best officer among the confederated barons, was an irreparable loss to their cause}}&lt;/ref&gt; Characters departing significantly from the historical record include William d'Aubigny, who was not an ennobled wool merchant (nor was he tortured and killed in the siege).

The closing narration explains that this was one of the first victories that the [[Kingdom of France|French]] had that would eventually lead to total victory. However, not mentioned in the narriation was that after John's death in 1216, many of the English rebels preferred a weak English King in the person of nine-year-old [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] over an experienced [[Louis VIII of France|French monarch]] and thus rallied around Henry. The rebellion was defeated by Royalist supporters in 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.historyextra.com/feature/king-john-and-french-invasion-england |title=King John and the French Invasion |first=Sean |last=McGlynn |publisher=BBC History |date=1 January 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the castle itself is depicted realistically, the nearby [[Rochester Cathedral|Norman Cathedral]] and the City of Rochester itself are completely missing from the location shots.  In reality the Cathedral is only a few hundred yards from the castle walls and Rochester has been a substantial settlement since [[Roman Britain|Roman times]].

The film's [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] are depicted as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian-speaking]] [[Vikings|Viking]]-like pagans when [[Christianization of Scandinavia#Denmark|Denmark had been Christianized]] by that time. Also, King John's mercenaries were mostly [[Flemish]], [[Provence|Provençal]]s and [[Aquitaine|Aquitainian]]s, not Danes.

Thomas Marshal, the main character played by [[James Purefoy]], is based loosely upon medieval knight and statesman [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]].

The movie has the Knights Templar as amongst the ringleaders in the battle against John Lackland. In reality the Templars and King John had a cordial relation and they were one of the few powerful groups in England which John did not offend or alienate during his reign, and the Order was amongst his financial backers providing him with the necessary funds to wage war.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Jones (writer)|Jones, Dan]], ''The Templars. The Rise and Fall of God's Holy Warriors'', London, Head of Zeus, 2017, {{ISBN|9780525428305}}, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
''Ironclad'' received mixed to negative reviews from critics, with many calling it a guilty pleasure. It currently holds 43% critical score on Rotten Tomatoes, alongside a 41% audience score.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ironclad/?search=ironclad IRONCLAD]&lt;/ref&gt; Manohla Dargis, writing from The New York Times criticized the film for its emphasis on violent action scenes above a cohesive plot, stating that " “Ironclad” alternately feels, plays and sounds like an abridged television mini-series and a feature-length video game," and that "the action is cluttered and the story overly compressed," but conceded that the film was enthusiastic in its pursuit of violence to entertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dargis|first1=Manohla|title=Grant a Few Rights, See What Happens?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/08/movies/ironclad-with-paul-giamatti-and-derek-jacobi-review.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
A sequel called, ''[[Ironclad: Battle for Blood]]'', was announced as in development shortly after the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/a-sequel-to-ironclad-is-in-the-works-for-some-reason-20120515&lt;/ref&gt; It is directed by [[Jonathan English]] and set five years after the end of the first film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filminserbia.com/Film-In-Serbia/313/Ironclad-Battle-for-Blood-2013.shtml Ironclad: Battle for Blood (2013)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205133953/http://www.filminserbia.com/Film-In-Serbia/313/Ironclad-Battle-for-Blood-2013.shtml |date=5 December 2013 }} at FilminSerbia.com&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2013 a trailer was released,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYF0ObzRws IRONCLAD 2 Battle for Blood OFFICIAL TRAILER 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the film was released in March 2014. The sequel went on to receive deeply negative reviews, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 17% and many critics condemning the film for intensifying the faults from its predecessor. Leslie Felperin from The Hollywood Reporter criticized the film for its decreased budget, less famous ensemble, and "sloppier" retelling of medieval history, but complimented the film on its musical score, stating that "Andreas Weidinger's orchestral score, featuring choral elements and plenty of brass, represents a redeeming feature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Felperin|first1=Leslie|title='Ironclad: Battle for Blood': Film Review|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ironclad-battle-blood-film-review-717930|website=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 12, 2018, John Moore of [[Getty Images]] took a photograph of a [[Hondurans|Honduran]] child that would go viral as a depiction of [[Donald Trump]]'s [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|immigration policies]].&lt;ref name="foto-viral"&gt;[https://foto.gettyimages.com/news/politics/migrant-girl-the-story-behind-the-viral-photo/ "Migrant Girl: The Story Behind the Viral Photo"], ''Getty Images FOTO'', June 18, 2018.

Moore said that Border Patrol agents search people before taking them into custody. Prior to the search, the mother was told to put the child down.

Kungoni is both easily accessible, being about two hours
drive on bitumen from Lilongwe and three from Blantyre. Kungoni sits a little
above the lake plain, with views to the lake in one direction and the African
Rift Valley escarpment in the other. The site is landscaped and planted as a
botanic garden with a variety of tropical trees and shrubs.&lt;ref name="The Eye Malawi"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theeyemw.com/kungoni.php|title = The Eye Malawi|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The Kungoni Centre was established by the [[White Father]] Claude Boucher Chisale with the intention of giving the local carvers training in a variety of artistic forms with the intention of improving local incomes.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Besides the carvings, the Kungoni Centre has also developed a culture sector which includes the Chamare Museum, the research centre, local traditional dancing troupe and cultural courses. The centre employs over 120 carvers and is just setting up a new project called Kumbewu (The Seed). Kumbewu will offer skill training for women and serve as a site for various information sessions including Aids education, [[agricultural diversification]], money management and more.

==The Mua Mission==
[[File:Mua mission malawi.jpg|thumb|upright|Mua Mission.]]
The Mua Mission was founded by the [[White Fathers]] in 1902 when the buildings of the first big mission house were built and which still stand today. The first church was finished in 1905 and opened at Christmas. The church which is used today was established in 1971 on the same ground and a lot of things of the old church have been adopted. The Kungoni Centre has been created by Father Claude Boucher Chisale in 1976, after Father Boucher already worked with artists in Nsipe. Originally it was just set up as a project of helping the local artists but the cultural part developed.

==Carving Centre==
[[File:Carving center rand.jpg|thumb|The Carving Centre.]]
The Carvings are the essential and the core activity of the Kungoni Centre.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} In the beginning Father Boucher founded the Carving Centre to teach the local artists new techniques. Today the Carving Centre is used by the experienced, established carvers to teach the young and emerging artist. The artworks are sold to tourists or shops everywhere in the country with a special view on a [[Fair value|fair price]] for the carvers so they can support their families. In 2009 the [[art gallery]] was opened to give carvers and the public a better sense of the carving history. The gallery documents, the thirty years of work performed in the community and the advancement of the themes and craftsmanship of the pieces. The Kungoni carvings are that popular, that it is even possible to find some in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican museum]] and in the [[Buckingham Palace]] and in Churches and private collections in [[Africa]], [[Europe]], and [[North America]].

==Cultural offerings==

===Chamare Museum===
The '''Chamare Museum'''&lt;ref name="visit-dedza" /&gt;  provides the visitor with an introduction to
the richness of the Chewa, Ngoni and Yao cultures of central and southern
Malawi, as well as a little on the [[Batwa]] people, the original and now vanished
inhabitants of Malawi. The Museum has three rooms containing photographs, text
panels, and displays of objects from the three cultures. There is also some
coverage of the early history of missions in the Mua area.&lt;ref name="theeyemw.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.theeyemw.com/kungoni.php|title = The Eye Malawi|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = The Eye Malawi|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum also displays [[Nyau]] masks. Nyau or Gule wamkulu  is the ‘great dance’ of the Nyau secret societies of the [[Chewa people|Chewa]]. Gule
wamkulu was declared a ‘Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of
Humanity’ by UNESCO in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00142|title = UNESCO|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = UNESCO|publisher = UNESCO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/22afr_uk.htm|title = Gule wamkulu|date = |accessdate = 17 December 2014|website = Third proclamation of the masterpieces of the intangible heritage of humanity|publisher = UNESCO|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kungoni provides one of the best places in Malawi to
learn some of the stories of Gule wamkulu.

Chamare Museum also provides detailed information on the
rituals and rights of passage for the Chewa, Ngoni, and Yao people.&lt;ref name="theeyemw.com"/&gt; It also chronicles, the history of the White Fathers mission work in Malawi dating back to 1902. Included in the collection are the many years of field work and the gathering of cultural material and is the most extensive display for explaining to Malawians and visitors the cultural history of the three main tribal groups.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Courses===
The Centre offers cultural courses.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This courses combine the knowledge of Father Boucher, who has been a resident of Malawi for forty years, and his European view on the things. The cultural course offers Ngo's and faith based aid workers an orientation and inside into Malawian priorities and local realities. The course hopes to focus outsiders sensitively and effectively deliver their programs.

===Kafukufuku, the Research Centre===
The Kungoni Centre includes its own research centre, which archives huge amounts of information about the tribes, such as photographs, videos, books, and notices.&lt;ref name="The Eye Malawi"/&gt; There is general access to the Kafukufuku.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Dances===
One thing that is difficult to be seen for tourists in Malawi are the traditional dances even though they are an important part of the country's culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Kungoni Centre records, describes and performs these dances and it is even possible to take part.

===Kumbewu===
The Project Kumbewu supports local women and helps them in gaining financial independence.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They create decorative jewelry and useful accessories made out of natural materials (seeds, plants) which are sold at the Centre. The money they earn represents important additional income for the family and leads to an improved life situation. Above this the Kumbewu site offers courses dealing with topics of local concerns (Health, food, and agriculture). Most important Kumbewu is a place for solidarity and exchanging of the ideas between women.

===Namalikhate Chalets===
The Centre provides small chalets for travelers and visitor interested in the local culture.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''''Lady Cockburn and Her Three Eldest Sons''''' (1775) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[portrait]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Work began on the picture in 1773, and, in [[Grand Manner]] fashion, Reynolds exploited two classical paintings: the attitude of the child on the left was modelled on Cupid in [[Velázquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus|Toilet of Venus]]'' whilst the general composition was inspired by [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Charity''. The painting passed to Mister Cockburn's son George, and then to his daughter, Mister Hamilton, the wife of Sir James Hamilton.&lt;ref name=great&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CzQdLzuxWD4C&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=%22lady+cockburn%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA285,M1 Great Pictures as Seen and Described by Famous Writers], Esther Singleton, p285, 2007, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
It was bequeathed to London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng2077 Lady Cockburn and her Three Eldest Sons], [[National Gallery, London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is one of the few signed by Reynolds: Lady Cockburn's dress bears his signature and the year 1775.&lt;ref name=great/&gt;

Lady Cockburn (Augusta Anne Ayscough, 1749–1837) was the daughter of [[Francis Ayscough]]&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; and his wife Anne. She married [[Sir James Cockburn, 8th Baronet|Sir James Cockburn]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|ər|n}}, [[Scottish English]]: {{IPA-endia|ˈkobʌɾn|}}) the 8th Baronet and became Lady Cockburn of [[Langton, County Durham|Langton]] in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1769.&lt;ref name=burke&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq8KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=ayscough+berwick+augusta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fhCYrBUgAE&amp;sig=ANuOia0xH1Pox08WqTn3n6PvQZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=py4ySqe-AcOQjAftm5T5CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA268,M1 A General and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire], p268, 1832, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was made as the result of a large marriage settlement of twenty thousand pounds which was arranged by her maternal uncle, [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Sir George Lyttlelton]], her widowed mother and her brother George Edward Ayscough. The money was raised on her father's estate and included three houses in London and two farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=046-ah&amp;cid=-1#-1 Marriage settlement], The National Archives, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Cockburn's first three sons are depicted in the portrait. The first son, [[Sir James Cockburn, 9th Baronet|James]] (b. 1771), became the 9th baronet and [[Governor of Bermuda]] (1811–1819), and her second son, [[George Cockburn|George]] (b. 1772) became an [[Admiral of the Fleet]] and the 10th Baronet. Her third son, [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William]] (b. 1773) became the [[Dean of York]], and her fourth son, Alexander (b. 1776), became [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Ambassador#Extraordinary postings|envoy extraordinary]] and minister [[plenipotentiary]] to [[Württemberg]] and the [[Columbia District]] whilst her fifth son, [[Francis Cockburn|Francis]], (b. 1776) became a general after being involved in the early history of Canada as a colony and serving in diplomatic positions in the Bahamas and British Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4357 Cockburn, Sir Francis], Dictionary of Canadian Biography, accessed June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Cockburn's daughter, Augusta, was wed in 1807.&lt;ref name=burke/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6121">[[Image:Laosgoldenstupa.jpg|thumb|Monk repainting a [[Nāga]] (mythical multi-headed snake) at Pha That Luang]]
'''Lao Buddhist''' sculptures were created by the [[Lao people]] of Southeast Asia. They are typically made of bronze, although [[gold]] and [[silver]] images can also be found. The [[Vat Manorom]] is believed to be the oldest colossal Lao Buddhist sculpture. Today, the [[Sculpture park|sculpture gardens]] of [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat]] provide a modern twist to the ancient tradition.

==Media for the sculptures==
[[Lao people|Lao]] artisans have, throughout the past, used a variety of media in their sculptural creations. Of the metals, [[bronze]] is probably the most common, but [[gold]] and [[silver]] images also exist. Typically, the precious metals are used only for smaller objects, but some large images have been cast in gold, most notably the [[Phra Say|Phra Sai]] of the sixteenth century, which the Siamese carried home as loot in the late eighteenth century. It is enshrined at Wat Po Chai in [[Nongkhai]], Thailand, just across the [[Mekong]] River from [[Vientiane]]. The Phra Sai's two companion images, the [[Phra Seum|Phra Serm]] and [[Phra Souk]], are also in Thailand. One is in [[Bangkok]] and the other is in [[Lopburi]]. Perhaps the most famous sculpture in Laos, the [[Phra Bang]], is also cast in gold, but the craftsmanship is held to be of Sinhalese, rather than Lao, origin. Tradition maintains that relics of the Buddha are contained in the image.

[[Image:Buddhaimage7.JPG|thumb|left|Statue of "the Buddha calling the earth to witness," the most common representation of the Buddha. The Buddha's hands are in the ''bhūmisparsa mudrā'' (subduing Māra) position. ([[Haw Phra Kaew]] temple, Vientiane, Laos)]]
Bronze is an alloy of [[copper]], containing about two percent [[tin]]. Other materials are often added, however, and the balance of ingredients determines the characteristics of the bronze. In Laos, like Cambodia and Thailand, the bronze, which is called ''samrit'', includes precious metals, and often has a relatively high percentage of tin, which gives the newly-cast images a lustrous dark gray color. Other images, such as the Buddha of Vat Chantabouri in Vientiane, have a higher copper and, probably, gold content that give them a muted gold color.

===Notable sculptures===
A number of colossal images in bronze exist. Most notable of these are the [[Phra Ong Teu]] (16th century) of Vientiane, the Phra Ong Teu of Sam Neua, the image at [[Vat Chantabouri]] (16th century) in Vientiane and the image at [[Vat Manorom]] (14th century) in Luang Phrabang, which seems to be the oldest of the colossal sculptures. The Manorom Buddha, of which only the head and torso remain, shows that colossal bronzes were cast in parts and assembled in place.

Brick-and-mortar also seems to be a favorite medium for colossal images. Perhaps the most famous of these is the image of [[Phya Vat]] (16th century) in Vientiane, though apparently an unfortunate renovation completely altered the appearance of the sculpture, and it no longer resembles a Lao Buddha.

Wood is popular for small, votive Buddhist images that are often left in caves. Wood is also very common for large, life-size standing images of the Buddha.

The most famous two sculptures carved in semi-precious stone are the Phra Keo (The [[Emerald Buddha]]) and the Phra Phuttha Butsavarat. The Phra Keo, which is probably of Xieng Sen ([[Lanna|Chiang Saen]]) origin, is carved from a solid block of jade. It rested in Vientiane for two hundred years before the Siamese carried it away as booty in the late eighteenth century. It now serves as the [[palladium (mythology)|palladium]] of the Kingdom of Thailand, and resides at the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok. The Phra Phuttha Butsavarat, like the Phra Keo, is also enshrined in its own chapel at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Before the Siamese seized it in the early nineteenth century, this crystal image was the palladium of the Lao kingdom of [[Kingdom of Champasak|Champassack]].

Many mostly wooden Lao Buddhist sculptures have been assembled inside the [[Pak Ou caves]].&lt;gallery&gt;

==Modern developments==
[[Image:Buddha Park.jpg|thumb|[[Buddha Park]]]]
The religious art tradition of the region has received an original contemporary twist in the monumental fantastic [[Sculpture park|sculpture gardens]] of [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat]]: [[Buddha Park]] near [[Vientiane]], and [[Sala Keoku]] near [[Nong Khai]], [[Thailand]].

[[File:Louise von Panhuys.jpg|thumb|Louise von Panhuys, 1823]]
'''Louise von Panhuys''' née von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (October 10, 1763 – October 18, 1844) was a German botanical artist and landscape painter. 

==Early years==
Born Louise Friederike Auguste von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten in [[Frankfurt]], she was the sixth child of Charlene von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (1736&amp;ndash;1804), and Heinrich Carl von Barckhaus of Wiesenhütten (1725&amp;ndash;1793), who was later made a baron. She received artistic training from her mother, who was an amateur painter, and from a relative, Christian Georg Schütz the Elder. Through family connections, she made the acquaintance of the poet [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] early in life and they later corresponded.

She moved to [[Darmstadt]], probably after the death of her father, and lived with one of her brothers. Between 1802 and 1805 she took two long trips to England with her brother, where she made contact with English naturalists and botanical illustrators in order to continue her education as a painter. It appears that during this period she took private lessons with the well-known botanical painter [[James Sowerby]]. 

==Marriage==
In 1805, she married a widowed Dutch officer, Willem Benjamin van Panhuys (1764&amp;ndash;1816). In 1811, they traveled to [[Suriname]], where he had a coffee plantation inherited from his deceased first wife. They later acquired a sugar cane plantation there as well. In early 1816, Suriname—which has been occupied by the English since 1804—returned to Dutch rule. Willem was appointed Governor-General by King [[William I of the Netherlands]], but his tenure in office lasted only a few months as he died in July 1816. Louise then moved back to Frankfurt, where she lived in a house that had once belonged to [[Matthäus Merian the Younger]].

==Art==
Louise von Panhuys mainly painted watercolors of plant specimens, with attention to scientific accuracy. She was influenced by the botanical art of [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and the travel writings of [[Alexander von Humboldt]]. During her years in Suriname, she painted some 90 watercolors, now housed [[Frankfurt University Library]].

In 1898, her work was shown publicly for the first time by the [[Senckenberg Nature Research Society]]. More recently, exhibitions showcasing her work have been mounted by the Frankfurt University Library (1991) and the Frankfurter Sparkasse (2009).

'''''Man Proposes, God Disposes''''' is an 1864 oil-on-canvas painting by [[Edwin Landseer]].  The work was inspired by the search for [[Franklin's lost expedition]] which disappeared in the [[Arctic]] after 1845.  The painting is in the collection of [[Royal Holloway, University of London]].

==Background==
The painting depicts an imagined [[Arctic]] scene in the aftermath of Sir [[John Franklin]]'s [[Franklin's lost expedition|expedition in 1845]] to explore the [[Northwest Passage]].
 
The 134 men of Franklin's exhibition left [[Greenhithe]] in May 1845 on two steam-powered ironclad icebreakers, [[HMS Erebus (1826)|HMS ''Erebus'']] and [[HMS Terror (1813)|HMS ''Terror'']].  After five left the ship, the remaining 129 men were last seen by a whaling vessel in [[Lancaster Sound]] in July 1845, but then disappeared without trace into the ice.  The expedition was well-provisioned for a voyage of several years, but eventually, search parties were sent out as time passed and  no further sightings were made.  In 1854, [[Inuit]] recounted tales of sightings in 1850 to Captain [[John Rae (explorer)|John Rae]] of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]], and he found some dead bodies on [[King William Island]].  Rae also reported suspicions of cannibalism among the last survivors.

In 1859, [[Francis Leopold McClintock]] published ''The Voyage of the ''Fox'' in the Arctic Seas'', an account of his voyage on the [[Fox (ship)|''Fox'']] in search of Franklin from 1857 to 1859, and his discovery of the remains of two crew from ''Erebus'' on King William Island earlier in 1859, together with the ship's boat and other detritus.

The painting may also have been inspired by [[Caspar David Friedrich]]'s 1824 painting ''[[The Sea of Ice]]'', and [[Frederic Edwin Church]]'s ''[[The Icebergs]]'', which was first exhibited in New York in 1861 and shown in London in 1863.

==Origin of the title==
[[File:Armada_Medal_2.jpg|thumb]]
The phrase "Man proposes, but God disposes" is a translation of the Latin phrase "Homo proponit, sed Deus disponit" from Book I, chapter 19, of ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'', a 15th-century book by the German cleric [[Thomas à Kempis]]. A few modernized and paraphrased Bible translations use it as a translation of Proverbs 19:21, but the original of that verse is longer and more elaborate.

The phrase was also put on a Dutch commemorative medal celebrating the Elizabethan England Protestant victory in 1588 over the Catholic [[Spanish Armada]].

A similar but much earlier usage appears in the concluding lines of [[Lucian]]'s "Symposium" (circa 150 AD), quoting from the concluding lines of [[Euripides]]'s ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', ''[[Andromache (play)|Andromache]]'', ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'', and ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'' (5th century BC): "πολλὰ δ᾽ ἀέλπτως κραίνουσι θεοί" (loosely translated, "the gods bring many matters to surprising ends").

==Description==
The painting adopts the dark tones of Landseer's later works.  The scene shows two [[polar bear]]s among the scattered wreckage of the expedition – a telescope, the tattered remains of a [[red ensign]], a sail, and human bones, which [[William Michael Rossetti]] called "the saddest of ''[[Disjecta membra|membra disjecta]]''".  The image shows humanity and civilization defeated by "[[nature, red in tooth and claw]]", and can be seen as a commentary on the crisis of British triumphalism and imperialism in the middle of the 19th century.  

==Reception==
The painting was exhibited at the 1864 [[Royal Academy summer exhibition]].  [[Jane Franklin|Lady Franklin]] was invited to the exhibition, but avoided the "offensive" painting.

''[[The Art Journal]]'' described its "poetry, pathos, and terror " and "tragic grandeur", the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' noted an "epic" quality, and the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' praised its "sublimity of sentiment".

The painting was sold at auction to [[Thomas Holloway]] in 1881.  It currently hangs in the picture gallery of [[Royal Holloway, University of London]].  A college tradition requires temporarily covering the painting with a [[Union Flag]] during student examinations held in the gallery, in keeping with a longstanding superstition (since at least the 1970s) that the painting drives people mad when they sit by it.

'''Max Lehrs''' (24 June 1855, [[Berlin]] — 12 November 1938, [[Dresden]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Art history|art historian]] and long-time director of the [[Kupferstichkabinett, Dresden|Dresden Kupferstichskabinett]], 1896-1904, and 1908-1924, with the intervening as director in [[Berlin]]. He is especially noted for his work on 15th-century German and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[engraving|engravers]], and the numbers from his catalogues are still the most commonly used in modern references for many artists.  Lehrs went blind while still writing his works, which were completed with the help of his daughter and his memory, leading to some lapses in late works.

'''Ojo del Sol''', also called '''The Fish House''' by local residents, is a home designed in 1993 by architect [[Eugene Tssui]]. The building was constructed between 1994 and 1995 in a residential neighborhood of Berkeley California. The home’s name "Ojo Del Sol", Spanish for "Eye of the Sun", originates from the fifteen foot diameter eye-like window that faces south.&lt;ref name=WCA&gt;

* The overall draws from the tardigrade, the four-bedroom, two-story Tsui House is elliptical in shape and has [[parabolic arches]].
* The concrete forms create a concrete lattice structure which mimics the skeleton of the [[Cholla cactus]].
* The solar-heating system is based on the bone and vein structure of two dinosaurs, the [[Dimetrodon]] and the [[Stegosaurus]].
* The dimpled exterior surface enhances the aerodynamic efficiency by relieving wind friction like fish scales.

[[File:Oshiguma 3-face example.1922.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an ''oshiguma'', with impressions of 3 different kumadori and autographs-inscriptions for each; created in 1922]]

An '''oshiguma''' is an impression of the [[kumadori]] (face [[make-up]]) of [[kabuki]] [[actor]]s on a piece of cloth, usually silk or cotton, created as an [[artwork]] and memento.

Oshigumas are customarily made after the performance of a kabuki play, though not necessarily after every performance, and given as highly valued [[souvenirs]] of the event.  A single oshiguma may have face-impressions from one or several actors, usually all from the same show, illustrating the make-up designs for major characters in the [[Play (theatre)|play]].  It may also include [[autograph]]s, dates and additional inscriptions; sometimes other graphic elements are added to the design.

The same term can also be used to describe an artistic depiction of kabuki make-up created by other means, but intended to emulate the appearance of a face-print.

[[Image:PIEQF-02008.jpg|thumb|right|350px|PIEQF - Kite Aerial Photography by Scott Haefner USGS]]

The '''''Parkfield Interventional EQ Fieldwork''''' also known as '''''PIEQF''''' &lt;ref&gt;Mudie, Ella.[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/leon.2010.43.2.133 "The Spectacle of Seismicity: Making Art From Earthquakes"], Leonardo, Volume 43, Number 2, April 2010, pp. 133-139&lt;/ref&gt; can be seen as the seminal work of New Zealand born installation and performance artist [[D.V. Rogers]].

This early 21st century example of [[land art]] was installed temporarily in the remote township of [[Parkfield, California|Parkfield]],&lt;ref&gt;Petray, Josh.[http://www.pasoroblespress.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=2657 "Seismic Land Art Comes to Parkfield"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715050720/http://www.pasoroblespress.com/V2_news_articles.php?heading=0&amp;page=72&amp;story_id=2657 |date=15 July 2011 }}. ''Paso Robles Gazette'', 25 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Central California. A geologically interactive installation, this machine [[Earthworks (art)|earthwork]] operated autonomously for a total of 91 days between 18 August and 16 November 2008.

An [[earthquake shaking table]] was used in this seismic [[art intervention]] which was controlled by realtime reported Californian earthquakes detected by the [[US Geological Survey]] seismic monitoring network.

==Construction==
Rogers selected the location of Parkfield for its significance as the most densely monitored earthquake region in the world. [[USGS]] Seismologist Andy Micheal originally suggested the location. Parkfield is also the home of the USGS Parkfield Earthquake Experiment&lt;ref&gt;[https://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/parkfield/index.php "Parkfield Earthquake Experiment"]. [[USGS]], 23 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth ([[SAFOD]]). The region of Parkfield is located on the central section of the [[San Andreas Fault]].

The work consisted of installing a re-engineered earthquake shake table in a crudely excavated trench in a vacant field between the Parkfield Cafe and Parkfield [[CAL FIRE]] Station. Local contractors Frank Parlot and John Jamrog used a bulldozer and excavator to displace 125 cubic yards of earth on 9 June 2008 from the site.

Rogers originally intended to have the installation operational between 28 June and 28 September. Extreme hot weather, natural dust devils, software development and financial constraints pushed the system switch on date to 18 August 2008.

Software for the installation was developed by Dr. Geo Homsy (US), Stock Plum (NL), Mr. Snow (NZ), Andy Michael (USGS) and Peter Luka (US).

The installation was two years in planning, culminating in 77 days of assembly, and resulted in 91 days of continuous seismic data connectivity. The seismic interface control system was shut down on 16 November 2008. Eight days later the shake table was removed from site. Rogers and local landowner John Varian filled in the excavated trench and repatriated the site.

==Performance==
The ''Parkfield Interventional EQ Fieldwork'' was triggered by almost 4500 Californian seismic events. Individual event IDS were allocated and have been archived by USGS databases. 43000 [[webcam]] frames were disseminated live via the internet. 7,862,400 seconds (91 days) of analogue VCR video recording was collected.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Michael. [http://rt.airstrip.com.au/article/89/9345 "The Science-Art of Quakes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706100448/http://rt.airstrip.com.au/article/89/9345 |date=6 July 2011 }}. ''Real Time Arts'', Issue 89, February–March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation was extensively documented by filmmaker Christina McPhee along with a series of photographs with [[kite aerial photography]] produced by geologist and photographer Scott Haefner.

Influenced by the monumental and permanent land art earthworks&lt;ref&gt;Seeley, Don.[http://www.daringdesigns.com/earthworks.htm "Monumental Land Art of the United States"]. DaringDesigns.com, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; of the early 1970s, the installation was a conceptual [[feedback]] loop between the seismic activity of California and the mechanical reflection of these frequent seismic events which controlled the earthquake shake table. Each time an earthquake occurred an array of 5/8&amp;nbsp;inch steel rods attached to the earthquake shake table oscillated and resonated.

Today in Parkfield there is very little evidence to suggest that this earthwork actually took place.

'''''Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop's Grounds''''' is an 1823 painting by the nineteenth-century landscape painter [[John Constable]] (1776–1837). This image of [[Salisbury Cathedral]], one of England's most famous medieval churches, is one of his most celebrated works, and was commissioned by one of his closest friends, [[John Fisher (Anglican bishop)|John Fisher]], The Bishop of Salisbury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O56227/salisbury-cathedral-from-the-bishops-oil-painting-john-constable/ V&amp;A page]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Constable visited Salisbury in 1820 and made a series of oil sketches of the cathedral, which served as the model for this composition. The artist selected a viewpoint from the bishop's garden and included figures of Dr. Fisher and his wife at the bottom left. Following its exhibition at the 1823 Royal Academy, Constable observed: "My Cathedral looks very well....It was the most difficult subject in Landscape I ever had upon my Easel. I have not flinched at the work of the windows, buttresses, &amp;c. – but I have as usual made my escape in the Evanescence of the [[chiaroscuro|Chiaro-Oscuro]]". His patron took exception to the dark cloud over the cathedral, and when he commissioned a smaller replica, requested "a more serene sky". 

The painting embodies the full range of qualities of a quintessentially British [[landscape painting]] – the clouds, trees, a water meadow, cattle drinking at the edge of the pasture and the glorious architecture of a medieval cathedral – but all on a human scale.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Paintings like this one have so conditioned our view of rural Britain that it is now difficult to imagine a time when the countryside and country life were not held in such high regard.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

A version of the painting also resides at the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City.  It is slightly different in that it shows different weather and hence light.  Whereas the London version depicts the cathedral with an overcast sky, the version in the Frick shows the cathedral with a clear, bright sky.

A small version of the painting resides at the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]]. John Fisher gave it to his daughter as a wedding present.

There is an earlier, homonymous version (1821-1822) of this painting at [[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;http://masp.art.br/masp2010/acervo_detalheobra.php?id=662&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Fisher, seeing its sombre and grave colors, disliked it and asked for a happier, lighter one.

The '''Sculpture Park Erich Engelbrecht''' is located at the Château des Fougis, 03220 [[Thionne]], department of [[Allier]], France, and displays monumental massive steel sculptures of the German artist Erich Engelbrecht.

In 2001, Erich Engelbrecht bought the property with the intent of installing his Sculpture Park throughout the gardens and former farming and hunting fields of Château des Fougis

On loan from a private collection, the artist mounted also a second exhibition in the main wing of the castle, presenting some of his previous works like large-format tapestries, oil paintings, small steel figures and graphics.

The open air exhibition at the Sculpture Park is open to public viewing. The indoor exhibition can only be visited following a previous private appointment.

==Les Fougis (the site)==

&lt;blockquote&gt;''“In the 15th century, according to tradition, '''Les Fougis''' were the hunting grounds of the Bourbons. In 1495 records exist of financial payments between {{nowrap|Duke Charles the 3rd}} and {{nowrap|Hughes le Long}}, Lord of Fougis and provost of the Duke’s Hunting. Earlier still, there’s a reference to the Lord of Fougis in an inventory written in 1410 by {{nowrap|Pierre Bodet}} for {{nowrap|Guichard Dauphin}}, Lord of Jaligny. In fact, the family le Long were the registered holders of {{nowrap|les Fougis}} from 1461 onwards, through squire {{nowrap|Hugonin le Long}}, who was also provost of the Hunting of {{nowrap|Pierre the 2nd}}. The {{nowrap|Le Longs}} retained the ownership of {{nowrap|Les Fougis}} until 1727, the date on which the territory was bequeathed to a nephew, {{nowrap|Jean Berthier de Bizy}}. Their descendants retained it until the French Revolution. In 1802 it was bought by {{nowrap|Antoine Clayeux}}, whose family owns the site to the present day.''

''Rebuilt at the end of the 16th century (a doorway in classic style is dated 1593) the Fougis have walls pierced with more decorative openings. A description from {{nowrap|Nicolas de Nicolay}} in 1569 states {{nowrap|‘fort chasteau, terre et seigneurie…’}} (strong castle, land and lordship…)''

''The château is composed of a main rectangular building, flanked by two square towers on its southwest and northeast corners, and a round tower to the southeast. A second perpendicular wing to the north is also flanked by another square tower on its east corner. The walls are made of red and dark brown brickwork, paired to form lozenge patterns. The openings are framed with white limestone. The north façade and some windows to the other sides were modified throughout the end of the 19th century.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=GERMAIN |first1=Dominique LAURENT, Maurice PIBOULE, Anne REGOND... [et al.] ; sous la dir. de René |title=Châteaux, fiefs, mottes, maisons fortes et manoirs en Bourbonnais |date=2004 |publisher=Éditions De Borée |location=Romagnat |isbn=2-84494-199-0 |pages=539-540}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 19th to the 20th centuries, the house was completely renovated and remodelled. The main courtyard received arcades on both wings, one of them with a glazed loggia. The north wing became an extra floor for the extended family and services. The interiors present a language typical for the period.

After acquiring the property, Erich Engelbrecht undertook a multitude of renovation and building works on the fields and buildings to adapt Les Fougis for these exhibitions.

Some of his family members settled in Fougis, where they presently live and work.

==Erich Engelbrecht (the artist)==
'''Erich Engelbrecht''' ([[Bielefeld]], 27th October 1928 - [[Vichy]], France, 21st July 2011) was a German artist who left a [http://www.engelbrecht.fr/english/work/ multitude of works] in the fields of painting, graphics, tapestry, sculpture, architecture and poetry.

==Construction==

The first sculptures arrived in 2002 and until his death in 2011 he managed to create an open exhibition of 29 large monumental and (mostly) coloured sculptures. The last sculpture - the smallest - arrived just after his death.

All sculptures were produced in Germany and transported by road to Fougis, where they were finally assembled.

Two sculptures positioned at the entrance of the park were created in 1984 and came to the present place after originally guarding the entrance of his property in Germany for nearly a decade and being exhibited in Hamburg-[[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (Altonaer Balkon) for nearly another decade. Belonging to a private collection, theses two sculptures are displayed on loan to the sculpture park.

Some sculptures are distributed around the Château des Fougis, others follow a path designed by the artist.

The indoor exhibition, a selection of large-format tapestries, oil paintings, small steel figures and graphics of Erich Engelbrecht, all on loan from a private collection, was imagined and installed between 2002 and 20011 by the artist himself and his wife Mrs Waltraud Engelbrecht. It is displayed throughout the galleries and the two main reception rooms of the Château des Fougis, which where specially renovated to receive these works.

'''Shakuntala''' or '''Shakuntala looking for Dushyanta''' is an epic painting by celebrated Indian painter, [[Raja Ravi Varma]].

[[Raja Ravi Varma|Ravi Varma]], depicts [[Shakuntala]], an important character of [[Mahabaratha]], pretending to remove a thorn from her foot, while actually looking for her husband/lover, [[Dushyantha]], while her friends call her bluff.

Tapati Guha Thakurta, an art historian, wrote;
{{Pull quote|[T]his very gesture – the twist and turn of head and body – draws the viewer into the narrative, inviting one to place this scene within an imagined sequence of images and events. On its own, the painting stands like a frozen tableau (like a still from a moving film), plucked out of an on-running spectacle of episodes. These paintings also reflect the centrality of the "male gaze" in defining the feminine image. Though absent from the pictorial frame, the male lover forms a pivotal point of reference, his gaze transfixes Shakuntala, as also Damayanti, into "desired" images, casting them as lyrical and sensual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=V4-Su0whKa0C&amp;pg=PA69 | title=India's Immortal Comic Books: Gods, Kings, and Other Heroes | publisher=Indiana University Press | author=Karline McLain | year=2009 | pages=69 | isbn=9780253220523}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

At a location to be determined within each time zone, twelve screens are intended to be arranged in a circle within a [[pavilion]]&lt;ref name="Pavilion"/&gt;  meant to remain open for visitors twenty four hours per day.  The screens, connected online with the time-eyes, transmit the images from the twelve time zones.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;  As the earth rotates, the images transmitted by the time-eyes move within a pavilion's circle of screens where day and night may be vicariously experienced in parallel. 
 
Each pavilion, a circular structure of twenty four pairs of half cylinders, each pair of which resembles in horizontal cross section the [[Hopi]] symbol '''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;''' '''&lt;sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''' for universal brotherhood,&lt;ref name="Symbol"/&gt; is intended to allow twenty four points of entry for visitors while preventing local light from reaching the screens.  An arrangement of rooftop [[solar cell]]s is hypothesized to produce the necessary energy.&lt;ref name="Explosion"/&gt;

==Kernel team==
The kernel team consists of scientists (chiefly from the Institute of Computer Graphics and Algorithms at the [[Vienna University of Technology]]) and artists.  Its primary tasks are ongoing technical developments which maintain the integrity of the project and its hardware and software.

==Collaboration partners==
The collaboration partners are scientific and academic institutions which host the time-eye cameras, hardware and servers and participate in the project's international [[cross-cultural]] cooperation.

'''''The Gallery of HMS 'Calcutta' (Portsmouth)''''', also known as '''''Officer and Ladies on Board HMS Calcutta''''', is an 1876 oil painting by [[James Tissot]].  It depicts two ladies in fashionable clothing and a young naval [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]], standing on the [[quarter gallery]] at the stern of the Royal Navy warship [[HMS Calcutta (1831)|HMS ''Calcutta'']].  The painting is held by the [[Tate Gallery]] in London and measures {{convert|68.6|x|91.8|cm}}.

==Background==
[[HMS Calcutta (1831)|HMS ''Calcutta'']] was an 84-gun [[second rate]] [[ship of the line]], built from [[teak]] in [[Bombay]] in 1831.  After a period in reserve, she was recommissioned in 1855 to serve in the Baltic in the [[Crimean War]], and then served in the [[Second Opium War]] in the Far East in 1856-8.  She was the British ship of the line to visit Japan in 1858.  She became a gunnery training ship in 1865, and by 1876 was alongside [[HMS Cambridge (1815)|HMS ''Cambridge'']] in [[Portsmouth Dockyard]].  Astern of the ''Calcutta'' was the [[hulk (ship type)|hulk]] of [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1810)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] which housed the navy's gunnery school, [[HMS Excellent (shore establishment)|HMS ''Excellent'']].

Tissot was a French painter.  He left Paris after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and resided in London from 1871.  He knew [[James McNeill Whistler]] and [[Edgar Degas]], but turned away from [[Impressionism]],&lt;ref&gt;Paquette, Lucy. [https://thehammocknovel.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/tissots-brush-with-impressionism/ Tissot’s Brush with Impressionism]". Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  and made mainly portraits and [[genre painting]]s of the Victorian upper classes in a more polished [[academic art|academic]] style.

==Description==
The painting is typical of Tissot's work, depicting his subjects with almost photographic [[realism (arts)|realism]], with an ambiguous narrative that hints at risqué behaviour among the wealthy classes approaching or transgressing boundaries of propriety.  

Tissot's work depicts two women with a young man in a [[flirting|flirtatious]] situation, but with a dangerous sensual undercurrent of moral uncertainty.&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;"[https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/tissot-the-gallery-of-hms-calcutta-portsmouth-n04847 ''The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Portsmouth)'', c.1876]". Tate. Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  The man is dressed plainly in the uniform of a junior naval officer.  Each woman is wearing a [[1870s in Western fashion|fashionable]] gauzy white dress decorated with bows and ribbons, with a tightly fitting bodice over a corset and full skirts below the hips .  

One woman, in a dress decorated with yellow ribbons, is leaning over the railing of the ship's [[quarter gallery]], turning her head away as she hides her face from the naval officer behind her [[hand fan|fan]].  In the [[European hand fans in the 18th century]] [[language of the fan]], an open fan over left ear indicates "do not betray our secret".  Her [[hourglass figure]]&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt; is echoed by the curves of the gallery's iron railings. Tissot's reference to HMS ''Calcutta'' may be making a punning on the French phrase "Quel cul tu as" ("What an arse you have").  Another woman in similar white dress with yellow ribbons appears in Tissot's 1876 painting ''Summer''. 

The second woman in the painting, wearing a dress with blue ribbons, may be a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]], or possibly the officer's wife: he stands beside her, and wears a wedding ring, but he only has eyes for the first woman.  The overdressed woman have a touch of vulgarity.  The presence of others in the party is suggested by a line of chairs beside the windows of the gallery: perhaps they are sitting out a dance at a ball on board.  Several [[troop ship]]s are in the background, under smoky grey skies.  

Tissot pays attention to the details of the women's clothing and the ship's railings.  His realistic style takes its sense of colour and light from the Impressionists, but the asymmetric composition may be influenced by [[Japanese printmaking]]. 

Tissot made a [[drypoint]] version of the work in 1876, reproduced as an etching, {{convert|10.375|x|14.25|in|cm}}, with the subtitle ''Memory of a Ball on Board'' ("La Galerie du 'Calcutta' (Souvenir d'un bal à bord)").  It was printed in ''[[The Graphic]]'' magazine with the title "Souvenir of a Ball on Shipboard".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/37114/ The Gallery of HMS Calcutta (Souvenir of a ball on shipboard)]". [[National Gallery of Victoria]].  Retrieved 18 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Tissot's elegant depictions of passing fashions in sophisticated London society, with their ambiguous undercurrents, were criticised as immoral and superficial.  [[Oscar Wilde]] criticised Tissot and his "hard unscrupulousness in painting uninteresting objects in uninteresting ways".  [[Henry James]] contemptuously described ''The Gallery of HMS Calcutta'' as "hard, vulgar and banal".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (2001), 17&lt;/ref&gt;  

The painting was exhibited at the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] in London in 1877, after it had been sold to Scottish painter [[John Robertson Reid]].  It was later sold to [[Henry Trengrouse]].  After his death, it was bought by the [[Leicester Galleries]] in London in 1929 for 16 guineas, and then sold to [[Samuel Courtauld (art collector)|Samuel Courtauld]], who donated it to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt;

'''''The Magdalene Sisters''''' is a 2002 [[Cinema of Ireland|Irish]]-[[Cinema of United Kingdom|British]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Peter Mullan]], about three teenage girls who were sent to [[Magdalene Asylum]]s (also known as 'Magdalene Laundries') homes for women who were labelled as "fallen" by their families or society. The homes were maintained by individual religious orders in the [[Roman Catholic Church in Ireland]].

Peter Mullan has remarked that the film was initially made because victims of Magdalene Asylums had received no closure in the form of recognition, compensation or apology, and many remained lifelong devout Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Interview with Peter Mullan |url=http://www.themoviechicks.com/summer2003/mctmagdalene.html |quote=It was initially because it was unfinished.

She was spirited away early one morning by a priest and told she had "brought shame on her family". |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date= 7 February 2003 |accessdate=7 March 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though set in [[Ireland]], it was shot entirely on location in [[Dumfries and Galloway]], South-West Scotland.

==Plot==
Set in Ireland, beginning in 1964, so-called "fallen" women were considered sinners who needed to be redeemed. The film follows the stories of four young women - Margaret (raped by her cousin), Bernadette (too beautiful and coquettish), Rose (an unmarried mother) and Crispina (an intellectually disabled unmarried mother) - who are all forced by their families or caretakers into the Magdalene Asylum.
The film details the disastrous lives of the four girls whilst they are inmates, portraying their harsh daily regimen and their squalid living conditions put on at the laundries.

Each woman suffers unspeakable cruelty and violence from the Mother Superior, Sister Bridget, despite her gentle-faced appearance and outwardly soft-spoken demeanour. She is characterised as sadistic and almost inhuman at times, as conveyed through her merciless beating of Rose in full view of Bernadette, or when she mockingly laughs at Una as she hopelessly clutches at her fallen hair locks.

The film also criticises the hypocrisy and corruption within the staff of the laundries. Sister Bridget relishes the money the business receives and it is suggested that little of it is distributed appropriately. Those who liken themselves to [[Mary Magdalene]], who deprived herself of all pleasures of the flesh including food and drink, eat hearty breakfasts of buttered toast and bacon while the working women subsist on oatmeal. In one particularly humiliating scene, the women are forced to stand naked in a line after taking a communal shower. The nuns then hold a "contest" on who has the most pubic hair, biggest bottom, biggest breasts and smallest breasts. The corruption of the resident priest, Father Fitzroy, is made very clear through his sexual abuse of Crispina. However, as the years pass, automatic [[washing machine]]s start to appear, a modern [[household appliance]] whose growing ubiquity would eventually fatally undermine the economic viability of commercial laundries and make the Magdalene Asylums unsustainable.

Three of the girls are shown, to some extent, to triumph over their situation and their captors. Margaret, although she is allowed to leave by the intervention of her younger brother, does not leave the asylum without leaving her mark. When she deliberately asks Sister Bridget to step aside for her to freely pass and is sharply shot down, Margaret falls to her knees in prayer. The Mother Superior is so surprised, she only moves past her after the Bishop tells her to come along. Bernadette and Rose finally decide to escape together, trashing Sister Bridget's study in search for the key to the asylum door and engaging her in a suspenseful confrontation. The two girls escape her clutches and are helped to return to the real world by a sympathetic relative, their story optimistically ending when Rose boards a coach bound for the ferry to [[Liverpool]] and Bernadette becomes an apprentice hairdresser. Crispina's end, however, is not a happy one; she spends the rest of her days in a mental institution (where she was sent to silence her from revealing the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Father Fitzroy) and dies of [[anorexia]] at age 24. Her real name was also revealed to be Harriet.

The epilogue to the film gives a brief description of the lives of four of the inmates after the girls leave the asylum by the late 1960s. It is noted that the last Magdalene asylum closed in 1996.

== History ==
On May 24, 1983, ten women formed an [[affinity group]]  to prepare for the mass arrests planned for the International Day of Nuclear Disarmament protest of June 20, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,400 Anti-Nuclear Protesters Arrested|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB35CC6CE191FBE&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|publisher=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Direct Action Web Feature International Day 1983|url=http://www.reclaimingquarterly.org/web/handbook/DA-Handbk-IntlDay83-lo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were trained in [[civil disobedience]] by Livermore Action Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klehr|first=Harvey|title=Far Left of Center|date=January 1, 1988|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=0-88738-217-7|page=150|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YSmiFins9sC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=%22june+20,+1983%22+protest+anti-nuclear#v=onepage&amp;q=%22june%2020%2C%201983%22%20protest%20anti-nuclear&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The female membership grew over the next 3 years, as they evolved into a [[performance art]] and activist art group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boredom|first=Terminal|title=Field Guide to SF Art-Punk 1977-82ish|url=http://www.terminal-boredom.com/sfartguide.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding member Vicki Krohn Amorose &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krohn Amorose|first=Vicki|title=Author PagesBiography|url=https://www.amazon.com/author/vickikrohnamorose|work=Art-Write: The Writing Guide for Visual Artists|publisher=Luminare Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  originally coined the name ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' and she, along with founding member Denise Slattery, wrote the lyrics to the ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' song.

== Activities ==
On June 20, 1983, the group participated in the blockade of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. More than 1000 demonstrators were arrested, including three members of the Nuclear Beauty Parlor, and jailed for 11 days in tents on the grounds of the Alameda County Jail. The group gained their first media attention with a [[The San Francisco Examiner|San Francisco Examiner]] headline: ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Peggy|title=Nuclear Beauty Parlor a Hit in Jail|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|date=June 23, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cover art for side 1 Nuclear Beauty Parlor record.jpg|thumb|American activist group Nuclear Beauty Parlor's record cover]]
During November and December,1983, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor acquired non-profit status, under the title Bay Area Energy Action. [[Bill Graham (promoter)]], San Francisco music impresario, funded production of the ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' 45-RPM 7" single. The lyrics were set to music and the record was produced by the group's friend and ally, Stacy Baird. Side A, ''The Nuclear Beauty Parlor'', was performed by Re Styles and other members of [[The Tubes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Meltdown|first=Digital|title=The Nuclear Beauty Parlor/Awake split 7" (1983-320Kpbs)|url=http://digitalmeltd0wn.blogspot.com/2011/06/nuclear-beauty-parlorawake-split-7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Side B, ''Awake'', was recorded at OTR Studios under the direction of [[Cookie Marenco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marenco|first=Cookie|title=Discography|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/590314-Cookie-Marenco|work=Awake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Nuclear Beauty Parlor'' 45-RPM single was released and a press conference held on Dec 15,1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Derek|title=Microgrooves|newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian|date=March 21, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between January and April, 1984, the group solidified its identity as a performance art group with the goal of gaining media attention for the nuclear freeze movement. The record gained airplay and press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stefanac|first=Suzanne|title=Sing along with the Nuclear Beauty Parlor|newspaper=BAM Magazine|date=April 6, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 16, 1984, the group performs the first in a series of "Tax Day actions" at Rincon Annex Post Office in [[Rincon Center]]. Playing to the audience of taxpayers lined up in cars to meet the midnight tax-filing deadline, the Nuclear Beauty Parlor interacted as costumed waitresses, served weapon-themed food, and encourage people to: "Have one, you paid for it!" They attracted attention from TV and newspaper reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many Ask for More Time on Taxes|newspaper=[[San Francisco Examiner]]|date=April 17, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic National Convention]] was held in San Francisco on July 14 and 15, 1984. In conjunction with "A Vision of America at Peace", the Nuclear Beauty Parlor performed an original play with songs, titled "The First Lady Debate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoelterhoff|first=Manuela|title=Of Parades and Pinheads|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=July 18, 1984|quote=I bump into a group of young women wearing pink smocks that read "Nuclear Beauty Parlor."

On the eve of the Nov 6, 1984, presidential election, the group pasted thousands of anti-[[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] posters in downtown San Francisco, designed by artist [[Paul Mavrides]], who also designed the record jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mavrides|first=Paul|title=Published Work|url=http://artie.com/cm/art/artists/paulmavrides/resume.htm|work=The Nuclear Beauty Parlor, record jacket design and illustration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the posters were quickly removed after Ronald Reagan’s victory, photographer C. Baldwin captured the morning-after image and created a postcard.

A December 1984 ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' [[Ms. (magazine)|Magazine]] article on the group helped to boost record sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=T|title=The Ms.Gazette News From All Over|journal=[[Ms. Magazine]]|date=December 1984|volume=XIII|issue=6|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In their second Tax Day performance at Rincon Annex Post Office on April 15, 1985, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor dressed as couture nuclear weapons with price tags, and interacted with last-minute taxpayers, resulting in local TV and press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huges|first=Beth|title=Party Time for Tax Protesters on Final Day|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|date=April 16, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July and September, 1985, the group adapted their nuclear weapon costumes for The Fashion Show presented by [[New Langton Arts]]. An original script read by the MC accompanied the runway show, titled "The Nuclear Fashion Arsenal", which was also performed a second time at Fort Mason for the [[International Day of Peace]].

In the group's third Tax Day performance, April 15, 1986, at Rincon Annex Post Office, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor enacted taxpayer robberies with pink machine guns.

In the 1990s, The Nuclear Beauty Parlor record was housed in the Audio Visual Collection of the Swarthmore College Peace Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2898">'''Theatre Tulsa, Inc.''' is a [[community theatre]] company in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], USA. 

[http://www.theatretulsa.org/ Theatre Tulsa], the longest running community theatre west of the Mississippi and seventh in the nation, has had a prosperous but sometimes difficult history. The theatre has survived multiple wars, fires, and economic depressions.  Theatre Tulsa started as a small community theatre that played shows in a tent, and grew to the largest community theatre in the nation in the 1970s, followed by years of decline and a recent re-invigoration that includes the new creation of a Broadway Series main stage season, a Next Stage series season composed of new works, and a Family Series season for children, families, and arts education programming. 

Tulsa Little Theatre was incorporated December. 10, 1922 by Mrs. Bonnie Reed and Mrs. Hope Holway. Despite the [[Great Depression]], the group managed to raise money to build a theater which was christened with a performance of ''[[The Cradle Song]]'' in February 1932. Two years later, the group incorporated as Tulsa Little Theatre. Struggling through the next few years, the theater survived a threatened bank foreclosure in 1935 after a number of donors stepped in, and in 1940 the theater paid off its mortgage. During [[World War II]], it produced shows for military camps and veterans’ hospitals. Tulsa Little Little Theatre prospered, and by 1959 was the largest non-professional theater company in the country. In 1964, its membership was 8,000 strong. By 1972 it had the largest community theater membership in the nation and had counted 1.5 million members over the past 50 years.  In 1974 Tulsa Little Theatre changed its name to Theatre Tulsa, Inc. Theatre Tulsa remains active today producing 10 productions a year that include modern and classic [[drama]]s, [[comedies]], and [[musical theatre|musicals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.theatretulsa.org/|title=Theatre Tulsa|accessdate=2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre Tulsa has had many firsts; it was the first community theater in the country to premiere ''[[Our Town]]'' (1939) and ''[[All My Sons]]'' (1947); the musical ''[[Brownstone (musical)|Brownstone]]''(1985); “Miracle on 34th Street: A Musical Adaptation” (a 1993 original musical written for Theatre Tulsa); “''[[I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change]]''” (2003); and the first American production of ''[[Pitmen Painters]]'' (2011). Theatre Tulsa’s production of ''[[Forever Plaid]]'' sold out more than 400 shows in 1995 and 1996. Some noted performers, including [[Jeanne Tripplehorn]], [[Kristin Chenoweth]] and [[Sam Harris]], received their first stage experience with Theatre Tulsa.

A '''visionary environment''' or '''fantasy world''' is an extensive/large-scale artistic installations (buildings, sculpture parks, etc.) intended to capture intense subjective/personal experiences (dreams, fantasies, obsessions, etc.) of their creators. The subjective/personal nature of these projects often implies a marginal status for the artists involved, and there is a strong association between visionary environments and [[outsider art]].
