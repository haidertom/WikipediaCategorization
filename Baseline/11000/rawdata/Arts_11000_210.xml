During the '''20th century''' there was a huge increase in the variety of [[music]] that people had access to. Prior to the invention of mass market [[gramophone record]]s (developed in 1892) and [[radio broadcasting]] (first commercially done ca. 1919–20), people mainly listened to music at live [[Classical music]] concerts or [[musical theatre]] shows, which were too expensive for many lower-income people; on early [[phonograph]] players (a technology invented in 1877 which was not mass-marketed until the mid-1890s); or by individuals performing music or singing songs on an amateur basis at home, using [[sheet music]], which required the ability to sing, play, and read music. These were skills that tended to be limited to [[middle class|middle-class]] and [[upper class|upper-class]] individuals. With the mass-market availability of gramophone records and radio broadcasts, listeners could purchase recordings of, or listen on radio to recordings or live broadcasts of a huge variety of [[song]]s and musical pieces from around the globe. This enabled a much wider range of the population to listen to performances of [[Classical music]] [[symphony|symphonies]] and [[opera]]s that they would not be able to hear live, either due to not being able to afford live-concert tickets or because such music was not performed in their region.

[[Sound recording]] was also a major influence on the development of [[popular music]] genres, because it enabled recordings of [[song]]s and bands to be inexpensively and widely distributed nationwide or even, for some artists, worldwide. The development of relatively inexpensive reproduction of music via a succession of formats including [[vinyl record]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, [[compact disc]]s (introduced in 1983) and, by the mid-1990s, [[digital audio]] recordings, and the transmission or broadcast of audio recordings of music performances on radio, of video recordings or live performances on television, and by the 1990s, of audio and video recordings via the [[Internet]], using [[file sharing]] of [[digital audio]] recordings, gave individuals from a wide range of socioeconomic classes access to a diverse selection of high-quality music performances by artists from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arditi|first1=David|title=iTunes: Breaking Barriers and Building Walls|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03007766.2013.810849|website=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|publisher=Informa UK Limited|accessdate=31 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of [[multitrack recording]] in 1955 and the use of [[audio console|mixing]] had a major influence on [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music]], because it enabled [[record producer]]s to mix and overdub many layers of instrument tracks and vocals, creating new sounds that would not be possible in a live performance.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Allan. ''Cultural Production in and Beyond the Recording Studio''. Routledge, 2014. (Multitrack recording and mixing made the recording "...studio a tool of musical composition" in which producers could "...create a reality which could not actually exist" in a live performance. p. 25)&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[sound recording]] and [[audio engineering]] technologies and the ability to edit these recordings gave rise to new subgenres of classical music, including the [[Musique concrète]] (1949) and [[acousmatic]]&lt;ref&gt;Schaeffer, P. (1966), Traité des objets musicaux, Le Seuil, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; (1955) schools of electronic composition. In the 1970s, [[African-American]] [[hip hop music]]ians began to use the [[phonograph|record turntable]] as a musical instrument, creating rhythmic and percussive "[[scratching]]" effects by manipulating a [[vinyl record]] on the turntable.

In Beethoven's and [[Felix Mendelssohn]]'s time in the 19th century, the orchestra was composed of a fairly standard core of instruments which was very rarely modified. As time progressed, and as the Romantic period saw changes in accepted modification with composers such as [[Berlioz]] and [[Mahler]], the 20th century saw that instrumentation could practically be hand-picked by the composer. [[Saxophone]]s were used in some 20th-century orchestra scores such as [[Vaughan Williams]]' Symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Vaughan Williams)|No.6]] and [[Symphony No. 9 (Vaughan Williams)|9]] and [[William Walton]]'s [[Belshazzar's Feast (Walton)|''Belshazzar's Feast'']], and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. Twentieth-century orchestras  generally include a [[string section]], [[woodwinds]], [[brass instruments]], [[percussion]], [[piano]], [[celesta|celeste]], [[harp]](s),&lt;ref name="classical-orchestra-description-page"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Classical Orchestra Description Page|url=http://www.classiccat.net/iv/orchestra.info.php|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other instruments called for occasionally, such as [[electric guitar]]&lt;ref&gt;Lagnella, David. ''The Composer's Guide to the Electric Guitar''. Mel Bay Publications, 2003. (Ex. Composers Tim Brady, Steve Mackey, Rhys Chatham, René Lussie, Glenn Branca, Scott Johnson and Eliot Sharp used the electric guitar in their chamber works and orchestral works, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[electric bass]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker-Hall, Helen. ''Music by Black Women Composers: A Bibliography of Available Scores''. Center for Black Music Research, 1995. (Ex. Composer Margaret Harris-Schofield wrote ''Piano Concerto No. 2'' in 1971, scored for solo piano, full orchestra, electric bass and drums. p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century saw dramatic innovations in musical forms and styles. Composers and songwriters explored new forms and sounds that challenged the previously accepted rules of music of earlier periods, such as the use of [[altered chord]]s and [[extended chord]]s in 1940s-era [[Bebop jazz]]. The development of powerful, loud [[guitar amplifier]]s and [[sound reinforcement system]]s in the 1960s and 1970s permitted bands to hold large concerts where even those with the least expensive tickets could hear the show. Composers and songwriters experimented with new musical styles, such as genre fusions (e.g., the late 1960s fusion of [[jazz]] and [[rock music]] to create [[jazz fusion]]). As well, composers and musicians used new [[music technology (electric)|electric]], [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic, and digital instruments and musical devices]]. In the 1980s, some styles of music, such as [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[house music]] were created largely with [[synthesizer]]s and [[drum machine]]s. Faster modes of transportation such as [[jet flight]] allowed musicians and fans to travel more widely to perform or hear shows, which increased the spread of musical styles.

===Modernism===
{{Main article|Modernism (music)}}
In the early 20th century, many composers, including [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Giacomo Puccini]], and [[Edward Elgar]], continued to work in forms and in a musical language that derived from the 19th century. However, [[modernism]] in music became increasingly prominent and important; among the most important [[Modernism (music)|modernists]] were [[Alexander Scriabin]], [[Claude Debussy]], and post-[[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] composers such as [[Gustav Mahler]] and [[Richard Strauss]], who experimented with form, tonality and orchestration.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."&gt;Botstein 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferruccio Busoni|Busoni]], [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], and [[Franz Schreker|Schreker]] were already recognized before 1914 as modernists, and [[Charles Ives|Ives]] was retrospectively also included in this category for his challenges to the uses of tonality.&lt;ref name="Botstein 2001."/&gt; Composers such as [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel]], [[Darius Milhaud|Milhaud]], and [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]] combined classical and jazz idioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wooten|first1=Roy|title=Classical Music Meets American Jazz|url=http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807163225/http://nmaam.org/2016/04/20/classical-music-meets-american-jazz/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 August 2016|website=National Museum of African American Music|publisher=National Museum of African American Music|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nationalism===
{{Main article|Nationalism (music)}}
Late-Romantic and modernist nationalism was found also in British, American, and Latin-American music of the early 20th century. Composers such as [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Alberto Ginastera]], [[Carlos Chávez]], [[Silvestre Revueltas]], and [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] used folk themes collected by themselves or others in many of their major compositions.

===Microtonal music===
{{Main article|Microtonal music}}
In the early decades of the 20th century, composers such as [[Julián Carrillo]], [[Mildred Couper]], [[Alois Hába]], [[Charles Ives]], [[Erwin Schulhoff]], [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]] turned their attention to [[quarter tone]]s (24 equal intervals per octave), and other finer divisions. In the middle of the century composers such as [[Harry Partch]] and [[Ben Johnston (composer)|Ben Johnston]] explored [[just intonation]]. In the second half of the century, prominent composers employing microtonality included [[Easley Blackwood, Jr.]], [[Wendy Carlos]], [[Adriaan Fokker]], [[Terry Riley]], [[Ezra Sims]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[La Monte Young]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].

===Neoclassicism===
{{Main article|Neoclassical music}}
A dominant trend in music composed from 1923 to 1950 was neoclassicism, a reaction against the exaggerated gestures and formlessness of late Romanticism which revived the balanced forms and clearly perceptible thematic processes of earlier styles. There were three distinct "schools" of neoclassicism, associated with [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. Similar sympathies in the second half of the century are generally subsumed under the heading "[[Postmodern music|postmodernism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whittall 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental music===
{{Main article|Experimental music}}
A compositional tradition arose in the mid-20th century—particularly in North America—called "experimental music". Its most famous and influential exponent was [[John Cage]] (1912–1992).&lt;ref&gt;Grant 2003, 174&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cage, "an experimental action is one the outcome of which is not foreseen",&lt;ref&gt;Cage 1961, 39&lt;/ref&gt; and he was specifically interested in completed works that performed an unpredictable action.&lt;ref&gt;Mauceri 1997, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the composers who influenced [[John Cage]] were [[Erik Satie]] (1866–1925), [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874–1951) and [[Henry Dixon Cowell]] (1897–1965).

===Minimalism===
{{Main article|Minimal music}}
Minimalist music, involving a simplification of materials and intensive repetition of motives began in the late 1950s with the composers [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]], and [[Philip Glass]]. Later, minimalism was adapted to a more traditional symphonic setting by composers including Reich, Glass, and [[John Coolidge Adams|John Adams]]. Minimalism was practiced heavily throughout the latter half of the century and has carried over into the 21st century, as well as composers like [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Henryk Górecki]] and [[John Tavener]] working in the ''[[holy minimalism]]'' variant. For more examples see ''[[List of 20th-century classical composers]]''.

===Contemporary classical music===
{{Main article|Contemporary classical music}}

Contemporary classical music can be understood as belonging to the period that started in the mid-1970s to early 1990s, which includes [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term  may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many composers working in the early 21st century were prominent figures in the 20th century. Some younger composers such as [[Oliver Knussen]], [[Wolfgang Rihm]], [[Georg Friedrich Haas]], [[Judith Weir]], [[George Benson]], [[Richard Barrett (composer)|Richard Barrett]], [[Simon Bainbridge]], [[John Luther Adams]], [[Toshio Hosokawa]], [[Bright Sheng]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Tan Dun]], [[Magnus Lindberg]], [[Philippe Manoury]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]],  [[Hanspeter Kyburz]], [[James MacMillan]], [[Mark-Anthony Turnage]], [[Thomas Adès]], [[Marc-André Dalbavie]], [[Unsuk Chin]], [[Claus-Steffen Mahnkopf]], and [[Michael Daugherty]] did not rise to prominence until late in the 20th century. For more examples see ''[[List of 21st-century classical composers]]''.

==Electronic music==
[[File:Stockhausen 1991 Studio.jpg|thumb|[[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] in the electronic-music studio of [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]], Cologne in 1991]]
{{Main article|Electronic music}}

For centuries, instrumental music had either been created by singing, or using [[music technology#Mechanical|mechanical music technologies]], such as drawing a bow across a string that is strung on a hollow instrument or plucking taut gut or metal strings ([[string instruments]]), constricting vibrating air ([[Woodwind instrument|woodwinds]] and [[Brass instrument|brass]]) or hitting something to make rhythmic sounds ([[percussion instrument]]s). In the early twentieth century, [[music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic devices]] were invented that were capable of generating sound electronically, without an initial mechanical source of vibration. As early as the 1930s, composers such as [[Olivier Messiaen]] incorporated electronic instruments into live performance. While [[sound recording]] technology is often associated with the key role it played in enabling the creation and mass marketing of [[popular music]], new electric and electronic sound recording technology was used to produce art music, as well. The [[musique concrète]] (French: “concrete music”), developed about 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer and his associates, was an experimental technique using recorded sounds as raw material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musique concrète – Musical composition technique|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/musique-concrete|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[World War II]], some composers were quick to adopt developing electronic technology. Electronic music was embraced by composers such as [[Edgard Varèse]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Henri Pousseur]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Ernst Krenek]], [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]], [[Luciano Berio]], [[Herbert Brün]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]]. In the 1950s the film industry also began to make extensive use of electronic [[soundtrack]]s. Major rock groups that were early adopters of synthesizers include [[The Moody Blues]], [[The Beatles]],&lt;ref&gt;W. Everett, ''The Foundations of Rock: from "Blue suede shoes" to "Suite: Judy blue eyes"'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), {{ISBN|0-19-531023-3}}, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Monkees]],&lt;ref&gt;E. Lefcowitz, ''The Monkees Tale'' (San Francisco CA: Last Gasp, 1989), {{ISBN|0-86719-378-6}}, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Doors]].&lt;ref&gt;T. Pinch and F.

Folk music, in the original sense of the term as coined in the 18th century by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], is music produced by communal composition and possessing dignity, though by the late 19th century the concept of ‘folk’ had become a synonym for ‘nation’, usually identified as peasants and rural artisans, as in the [[Merry England|Merrie England movement]] and the [[Gaelic revival|Irish and Scottish Gaelic Revivals]] of the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Folk music was normally shared and performed by the entire community (not by a special class of expert or professional performers, possibly excluding the idea of amateurs), and was transmitted by word of mouth ([[oral tradition]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nettl|first1=Bruno|title=Folk Music|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/folk-music|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, folk music was also borrowed by composers in other genres. Some of the work of [[Aaron Copland]] clearly draws on American folk music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aaron Copland, 1900–1990: His Music Taught America About Itself|url=http://www.manythings.org/voa/people/Aaron_Copland.html|website=ManyThings.org|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important work on registering traditional [[Music of Southeastern Europe|tunes of the Balkanic region]] was that of [[Béla Bartók]] since it is probably the first composer who was interested in recording audios as well as analysing them from an ethnological point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Béla Bartók The Musical Quarterly Vol. 33, No. 2 (Apr., 1947), pp. 240–257&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluegrass music===
{{Main article|Bluegrass music}}

Bluegrass music is a form of [[American roots music]], and a related genre of [[country music]]. Influenced by the music of [[Appalachia]],&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cantwell, ''Bluegrass Breakdown:  The Making of the Old Southern Sound'' (University of Illinois Press, 2002), pgs 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluegrass has mixed roots in [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish]], [[Folk music of Scotland|Scottish]], [[Music of Wales|Welsh]],  and [[Folk music of England|English]]&lt;ref&gt;Musicologist [[Cecil Sharp]] collected hundreds of folk songs in the Appalachian region, and observed that the musical tradition of the people "seems to point to the North of England, or to the Lowlands, rather than the Highlands, of Scotland, as the country from which they originally migrated. For the Appalachian tunes...have far more affinity with the normal English folk-tune than with that of the Gaelic-speaking Highlander."

Olive Dame Campbell &amp; Cecil J. Sharp, ''English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, Comprising 122 Songs and Ballads, and 323 Tunes'', G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1917, pg xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; traditional music, and was also later influenced by the music of [[African-Americans]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Tennessee folklore sampler: selections from the Tennessee folklore society | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0Z90XdzMKE0C&amp;pg=PA324&amp;dq=i'm+working+on+a+building+song&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=flZ7TvlDiqK2B9vqse4P&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=i'm%20working%20on%20a%20building%20song&amp;f=false| chapter = Field Recordings of Southern Black Music | last = Nemerov | first = Bruce | pages = 323–324 | year = 2009 | publisher = Univ. of Tennessee Press | accessdate = 2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; through incorporation of [[jazz]] elements.

Settlers from the United Kingdom and Ireland arrived in [[Appalachia]] during the 18th century, and brought with them the musical traditions of their homelands. These traditions consisted primarily of English and Scottish [[ballad]]s—which were essentially unaccompanied narrative—and dance music, such as Irish [[reel (dance)|reel]]s, which were accompanied by a fiddle.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;Ted Olson, "Music — Introduction".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109–1120.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many older bluegrass songs come directly from the [[British Isles]]. Several Appalachian bluegrass ballads, such as "[[Pretty Saro]]", "[[Barbara Allen (song)|Barbara Allen]]", "[[The Cuckoo (song)|Cuckoo Bird]]" and "[[House Carpenter]]", come from [[England]] and preserve the English ballad tradition both melodically and lyrically.&lt;ref name="cuckoo"&gt;{{cite news|title=The beauty and mystery of ballads|last=Goldsmith|page=G5|first=Thomas|date=February 6, 2005 |work=[[Raleigh News &amp; Observer|The Raleigh News &amp; Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others, such as [[The Twa Sisters]], also come from [[England]]; however, the lyrics are about Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Jacobs, ''English Fairy Tales'', [[s:English Fairy Tales/Binnorie|transcript]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some bluegrass fiddle songs popular in Appalachia, such as "Leather Britches", and "[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]", have Scottish roots.&lt;ref&gt;Cecelia Conway, "Celtic Influences".  ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee, 2006), p. 1132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance tune [[Cumberland Gap (folk song)|Cumberland Gap]] may be derived from the tune that accompanies the Scottish ballad [[Bonnie George Campbell]].&lt;ref&gt;Song notes in ''Bascom Lamar Lunsford: Ballads, Banjo Tunes, and Sacred Songs of Western North Carolina'' [CD liner notes]. Smithsonian Folkways, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs have different names in different places; for instance in [[England]] there is an old ballad known as "[[A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me]]", but exactly the same song in North American bluegrass is known as "I Wish My Baby Was Born".&lt;ref&gt;the version performed by Tim Eriksen, Riley Baugus and Tim O'Brien for the Cold Mountain Soundtrack was based on this song and is lyrically identical to it&lt;/ref&gt;

In bluegrass, as in some forms of jazz, one or more instruments each takes its turn playing the melody and improvising around it, while the others perform  [[accompaniment]]; this is especially typified in tunes called [[Breakdown (music)#Bluegrass|breakdowns]]. This is in contrast to [[old-time music]], in which all instruments play the melody together or one instrument carries the lead throughout while the others provide accompaniment. Breakdowns are often characterized by rapid [[tempo]]s and unusual instrumental dexterity and sometimes by complex [[chord change]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A short History of Bluegrass Music|url=http://renoandharrell.com/content/short-history-bluegrass-music|website=Reno &amp; Harrell|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three major subgenres of bluegrass and one unofficial subgenre. [[Traditional bluegrass]] has musicians playing folk songs, tunes with simple traditional chord progressions, and using only acoustic instruments, with an example being [[Bill Monroe]]. [[Progressive bluegrass]] groups may use electric instruments and import songs from other genres, particularly rock &amp; roll. Examples include [[Cadillac Sky]] and [[Bearfoot (American band)|Bearfoot]]. "[[Bluegrass gospel]]" has emerged as a third subgenre, which uses [[Christian]] lyrics, soulful three- or four-part [[harmony]] singing, and sometimes the playing of [[instrumentals]]. A newer development in the bluegrass world is Neo-traditional bluegrass; exemplified by bands such as [[The Grascals]] and [[Mountain Heart]], bands from this subgenre typically have more than one lead singer. Bluegrass music has attracted a diverse following worldwide. Bluegrass pioneer Bill Monroe characterized the genre as: "[[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Holiness movement|Holiness]] and [[Baptists|Baptist]]. It's [[blues]] and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billmonroe.com/music/ "Bill Monroe: The Father of Bluegrass"], billmonroe.com, retrieved 17 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opera==
{{Main article|Opera#Contemporary, recent, and modernist trends}}

In the early years of the century, [[Richard Wagner|Wagnerian]] [[chromatic harmony]] was extended by opera composers such as [[Richard Strauss]] (''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'', 1905; ''[[Elektra (opera)|Elektra]]'', 1906–1908; ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'', 1910; ''[[Ariadne auf Naxos]]'', 1912; ''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'', 1917), [[Claude Debussy]] (''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', 1902), [[Giacomo Puccini]] (''[[Madama Butterfly]]'', 1904; ''[[La fanciulla del West]]'', 1910; ''[[Il trittico]]'', 1918), [[Ferruccio Busoni]] (''[[Doktor Faust]]'', 1916, posthumously completed by his student [[Philipp Jarnach]]), [[Béla Bartók]] (''[[Bluebeard's Castle]]'', 1911–17), [[Leos Janáček]] (''[[Jenůfa]]'', 1904; ''[[Destiny (Janáček)|Osud]]'', 1907; ''[[Kát´a Kabanová]]'', 1919-1921) and [[Hans Pfitzner]] (''[[Palestrina (opera)|Palestrina]]'', 1917).

Further extension of the chromatic language finally broke with tonality and moved into the style of [[atonal music]] in the early operas of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (''[[Erwartung]]'', 1909; ''[[Die glückliche Hand]]'', 1912) and his student [[Alban Berg]] (''[[Wozzeck]]'', 1925), both of whom adopted [[twelve-tone technique]] for their later operas: Schoenberg's ''[[Moses und Aron]]'', and Berg’s ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]''. Neither of these operas were completed in their composers’ lifetimes, however, so that the first completed opera using the twelve-tone technique was ''[[Karl V]]'' (1938) by [[Ernst Krenek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sitsky|first1=Larry|title=Music of the Twentieth-century Avant-garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook|date=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780313296895|page=238|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sgDJKVXraE0C&amp;pg=PA238&amp;lpg=PA238&amp;dq=first+completed+opera+using+the+twelve-tone+technique+was+Karl+V&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTID7SQzJP&amp;sig=vVRed7jJhbOWH034rXGx4s3YF2I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyl8iGj6TNAhUJ3mMKHa9zBiwQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=first%20completed%20opera%20using%20the%20twelve-tone%20technique%20was%20Karl%20V&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most important operas of the twenties and thirties were composed by the Russian [[Dmitri Shostakovich]] (''[[The Nose (opera)|The Nose]]'', 1928 and ''[[Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (opera)|Ledi Makbet Mtsenkovo Uyezda]]'' [Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District], 1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{Riding, Alan. Eyewitness Companions: Opera: Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the neoclassicism that became fashionable in the 1920s is represented by Stravinsky's [[opera buffa]] ''[[Mavra]]'' (1922) and his opera-oratorio ''[[Oedipus rex (opera)|Oedipus Rex]]'' (1927). Later in the century his last opera, ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'' (1951), also marks the end of the neoclassical phase of his compositions. Other operas of this period by composers identified as neoclassicists include [[Paul Hindemith]]'s ''[[Mathis der Maler (opera)|Mathis der Maler]]'' (1938), [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Voina y Mir (opera)|Voina y Mir]]'' (War and Peace, 1941–1943), [[Bohuslav Martinu]]'s ''[[Julietta aneb snár]]'' (1937) and [[Francis Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les mamelles de Tirésias]]'' (1945).{{cn|date=May 2018}}

In the sixties, it should be noted, the [[Bernd Alois Zimmermann]] opera, ''[[Die Soldaten]]'' (1965), had a great impact.{{Clarify|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--Big box-office success, was it? Or did it cause riots in cities across the globe?--&gt;   

One of the most particular{{Clarify|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--Is this meant in the sense of "peculiar", "exacting", or what?--&gt; operas of the seventies was ''[[Le Grand Macabre]]'', by György Ligeti. It deals with the subject of mortality through irony and collage.

The most internationally accepted post–World War II composer of operas was Englishman [[Benjamin Britten]] (''[[Peter Grimes (opera)|Peter Grimes]]'', 1945; ''[[The Rape of Lucretia]]'', 1946; ''[[Albert Herring (opera)|Albert Herring]]'', 1947; ''[[Billy Budd (opera)|Billy Budd]]'', 1951; ''[[Gloriana]]'', 1953; ''[[The Turn of the Screw (opera)|The Turn of the Screw]]'', 1954; ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream (opera)|A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', 1960; ''[[Owen Wingrave]]'', 1970; ''[[Death in Venice (opera)|Death in Venice]]'', 1973)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twentieth-Century Opera|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/entertainment/opera-twentieth-century-opera.html|website=Infoplease|publisher=Sandbox Networks, Inc.|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2018}}&lt;!--Links to a secondary link to the Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia article "Opera Glass".

Popular music includes [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] tunes, [[ballad]]s and singers such as [[Frank Sinatra]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilliland 1969, show 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship (particularly, the relative value) of classical music and popular music is a controversial question. [[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Richard Middleton]] writes:&lt;blockquote&gt;Neat divisions between "folk" and "popular", and "popular" and "art", are impossible to find... arbitrary criteria [are used] to define the complement of "popular". "Art" music, for example, is generally regarded as by nature complex, difficult, demanding; "popular" music then has to be defined as "simple", "accessible", "facile". But many pieces commonly thought of as "art" ([[George Frideric Handel|Handel's]] ''[[Hallelujah Chorus]]'', many [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] songs, many [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[aria]]s) have qualities of simplicity; conversely, it is by no means obvious that the [[Sex Pistols]]' records were "accessible", [[Frank Zappa]]'s work "simple", or [[Billie Holiday]]'s "facile".&lt;ref&gt;Middleton 1990, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mostly instrumental pieces creating sounds of a soothing, romantic, mood-elevating or generally relaxing nature.{{cn|date=May 2018}} [[Steven Halpern]]'s ''Spectrum Suite'', released in 1975, is generally credited as the album that began the new-age music movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wright|first1=Carol|title=Spectrum Suite – Steven Halpern|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/spectrum-suite-mw0000197106|website=AllMusic|publisher=All Media Network, LLC|accessdate=12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polka===
{{Main article|Polka}}
The polka, which first appeared in Prague in 1837, continued to be a popular form of dance music through the 20th century, especially in Czechoslovakia, Poland, and areas of the United States with a large population of central-European descent. A particularly well-known 20th-century example is [[Jaromír Vejvoda]]’s ''Modřanská polka'' (1927), which became popular during World War II in Czechoslovakia as "Škoda lásky" ("A Waste of Love"), in Germany as the ''Rosamunde-Polka'', and among the allied armies as the ''[[Beer Barrel Polka]]'' (as a song, known as "Roll out the Barrel"). In the United States, the "Eastern style" Polish urban polka remained popular until about 1965. Polka music rose in popularity in Chicago in the late 1940s after [[Walter Jagiello|Walter ‘Li’l Wally’ Wallace Jagiello]] created "[[Hunky Culture|honky]]" polka by combining the Polish-American rural polka with elements of Polish folksong and ''[[krakowiak]]''. A later, rock-influenced form is called "dyno" polka.&lt;ref&gt;Černušák, Lamb, and Tyrrell 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Perfumed Scorpion'''''&lt;ref&gt;Shah, I. (1978) A Perfumed Scorpion. Octagon Press. {{ISBN|0-86304-080-2}} (paperback edition)&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-fiction book by the [[Sufism|Sufist]] writer, [[Idries Shah]], that was first published by [[Octagon Press]] in 1978, the same year that he published two other major works: ''[[Learning How to Learn: Psychology and Spirituality in the Sufi Way]]'' and ''[[The Hundred Tales of Wisdom]]''.

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfill the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''A Perfumed Scorpion'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref name="IAN"&gt;Shah, T. In Arabian Nights: A Caravan of Moroccan Dreams. New York, NY: Bantam. pp. 215–216. {{ISBN|0-553-80523-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The book contains the substance of lectures given by the author at various universities in the United States under the aegis of the [[Institute for the Study of Human Knowledge]] and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]].  The ‘perfuming of a scorpion’ is a reference to a symbol used by [[Baha-ud-Din Naqshband Bukhari|Bahaudin Naqshband]] of Bukhara when he taught about the ubiquitous problem of hypocrisy and self-deception in both individuals and institutions: “Whoever might perfume a scorpion will not thereby escape its sting”.

The seven sections of the book deal in depth with this issue under headings such as Education, The Nature of Sufi Knowledge, The Path and the Duties and the Techniques, [[Teaching stories|Teaching Stories]], A framework for New Knowledge and Involvement in Sufi Study. Each section contains numerous illustrative anecdotes from contemporary life but is nevertheless rooted in the teaching patterns of [[Rumi]], [[Hafez|Hafiz]], [[Jami]], and other great Oriental sages who dealt with the need for, and the path to, knowledge and information before real progress can be made.

== Reception ==
''A Perfumed Scorpion'' was described by one reviewer as "... an invigorating and abrasive book, like jumping into icy water - hard to do, but you're glad you have done it." This reviewer also appreciated the way it dissolves in the attentive reader “the maiming effect of unconscious bias.”&lt;ref&gt;Books and Bookmen. May 1979&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the book continues and it has remained in print ever since it was published.

Philosopher of [[science]] and physicist [[Henri Bortoft]] used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Bortoft's ''[[The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science]]'' includes stories from ''[[Tales of the Dervishes]]'', ''[[The Exploits of the Incomparable Mulla Nasrudin]]'' and ''A Perfumed Scorpion''.

In May 2017, he endorsed Corbyn in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK general election]]. He wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': "So why will I be voting now? Jeremy Corbyn. It's not that I am naive enough to believe that one man (who is, of course, powerless without the people that support him) can fundamentally alter the nature of British politics, or that I think that if Labour wins that the UK will suddenly reflect his personal political convictions, or even that I believe that the prime minister actually runs the country. However for the first time in my adult life, and perhaps for the first time in British history, someone I would consider to be a fundamentally decent human being has a chance of being elected."&lt;ref name="theguardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/12/never-voted-before-jeremy-corbyn-changed-mind|title=By choice, I've never voted before.

== Biography ==
'''Arseny Nikiforovich Semionov''' was born January 23, 1911 in the village of Maksimkovo, Polotsk Uyezd, Vitebsk Governorate, Russian Empire in the family of the master-builder of railway bridges. His father died when Arseny was four years old. The future artist spent his childhood in the [[Belarus]]ian town of [[Bykhaw]].

In 1927 Arseny Semionov arrives in Leningrad. He worked as a general worker, while engaged in painting and drawing at the private art studio of Alfred Eberling, a famous art teacher and a member of [[AKhRR]] (Association of Artists of Revolutionary Russia). In 1930, Arseny Semionov took preparatory courses at the Academy of Fine Arts and in the same year he became a student of the [[Repin Institute of Arts|Institute of Proletarian Fine Art]].

[[Image:Sem184b.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Spring Day. 1959]]

Arseny Semionov years of study coincided with a radically reformed of institute and the whole system of art education. In 1932, the period ended, notorious in the history of the institute as "maslovschina". October 11, 1932 the Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars accept the decree "On creation of the Academy of Arts." Institute of Proletarian Art was transformed into the Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. Thus was the line be drawn under 15-year period of continuous transformations of the largest art institutions in the Soviet Union. However, it took several years to ensure that assemble disparate teaching force and a new way to build an art education. A new director of the Academy of Fine Arts sculptor T. A. Matveev and his Deputy for Academic Affairs Professor of Painting Akexander Savinovhis started this process. They invited for the teaching job at the institute professors [[Dmitry Kardovsky]], [[Alexander Osmerkin]], Semion Abugov, Yevgeny Lansere, Nikolai Radlov, Pavel Shillingovsky, [[Isaak Brodsky]] and others, many have made subsequently to the formation of the Leningrad school of painting.

In 1934 the director of the All-Russian Academy of Arts and the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture was appointed Isaak Brodsky, a student of Ilya Repin. To work at the Institute he attracts major artists and educators [[Konstantin Yuon]], Pavel Naumov, [[Boris Ioganson]], [[Alexander Lubimov]], [[Rudolf Frentz]], Nikolai Petrov, Vasily Shuhaev, Dmitry Kiplik, Nikolai Punin, Vasily Meshkov, Mikhail Bernshtein, Yefim Cheptsov, [[Ivan Bilibin]], Matvey Manizer, [[Piotr Buchkin]], Anna Ostroumova-Lebedeva, Alexander Karev, Leonid Ovsyannikov, Sergei Priselkov, Ivan Stepashkin, Konstantin Rudakov, and others. At the department of painting was re-established a system of individual creative workshops in which students continued their studies after the second course. Workshops led by professor Isaak Brodsky, Boris Ioganson, Vladimir Yakovlev, Dmitry Kardovsky, Alexander Osmerkin, Alexander Savinov, Rudolf Frentz, Pavel Shillingovsky. It was in the studio Dmitry Kardovsky Arseny Semionov was lucky to do in the years 1934–1937.

Methodology and views Kardovsky boiled down to the fact that, firstly, the Academy would give the student professional knowledge to the extent necessary for a mature implementation of the finished work of art – school, how loved to talk Kardovsky, common to all students regardless of their artistic inclinations and orientations. Talent does not ruin it, but its mediocre student enough to be useful worker in the life.

Second, studies should be carried out the influence of so-called "trends" in art. The task of the school – to give the student the knowledge and education, which is suitable for its development in any theoretical approach. Foundation of school – a study of the nature, utility – the study of art. The basis of learning – re-experience.

Third, the drawing should not be detached from the painting. A task, basically, need to be addressed comprehensively. Drawing – a means of mastering painting. Tone drawing – a means to organize color. The tone keep the unity of color. Therefore, the analysis of tone – the most important task for any art works. Finally, in the opinion of Kardovsky, the basis of all the work – identification of the disposition of nature.

Classes at the studio of Kardovsky, itself an outstanding personality of the teacher had a great influence on the fate of the young artist. His teaching methods and attitudes are deeply accepted by Arseny Semionov in his own teaching, which he has devoted almost half a century.

In 1937, shortly before graduation Institute in studio of Dmitry Kardovsky, Arseny Semenov became ill and was forced to stop training. After his recovery he obtained a certificate of completion of 5 courses of the department of painting without doing graduate work. He was sent to work in the Penza Art College. In 1938 Arseny Semionov accepted membership in the Penza Organization of Soviet Artists.

From 1939 to 1944 Arseny Semionov was in the Red Army's armored forces. He served in the Trans-Baikal and Mongolia. Party fights for [[Battles of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]]. From the first day of [[Great Patriotic War]] he participated in the battles. He rose from private to commander of a tank battalion. He was wounded five times, marked by military awards, including the [[Order of the Red Star]], [[Order of the Patriotic War]] the first and second degrees, and medals. In 1944, Arseny Semionov was discharged on the injury.

From 1944 to 1947 Arseny Semionov taught at the High School of Arts at the Surikov Arts Institute in Moscow. In 1946 Semionov take in members of the Moscow organization of Soviet artists, he started to have participation in Moscow exhibitions. However, the paintings were created after a long break at work, there were only samples, an attempt to find its way into art.

In September 1947 Arseny Semionov returned to Leningrad and received a lecturer at the faculty of general painting of the [[Vera Mukhina Institute|Leningrad Higher School of Industrial Arts named after Vera Mukhina]], where he worked for over forty years, nurtured several generations of artists. In the same 1947 he was accepted as a member of the Leningrad Union of Artists. Since the late 1940s Arseny Semionov participates in Exhibitions of Leningrad artists. Simultaneously he was working under graduate painting "Motherhood", and in 1951 after fifteen years of forced interruption ends Repin Institute of Arts.

Throughout his life, Arseny Semionov combined an active teaching career with creative activity. Its efficiency is striking. He painted cityscapes and landscapes, still lifes, genre scenes, portraits, and numerous etudes done from the life. He made creative trips to Staraya Ladoga, the Baltic States, Transcarpathia and Crimea. His personal Exhibitions were in Leningrad in 1966, 1977, and in Saint Petersburg in 2006.

In the works of late 1940s and early 1950s identified a number of themes and images, which tended artist. Leningrad motifs and ancient Russian cities would dominate in his works throughout life, although the methods of their scenic development will change in the direction of the artificial fixation of transience, the desire to convey the freshness and immediacy of color experience in the work of 1950–1960 years, to the search for more subtle and distributions of colors in the works of the late 1960s and 1970s, more decorative, based on the active use of local color and constructive drawing.

In the 1950s Arseny Semionov often spent a summer time in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]]. Here he painted city of [[Yalta]], [[Gurzuf]] town, picturesque corners of the old town and the rest on the seaside promenade. In the 1960s Semionov repeatedly traveled to the Baltic and the Carpathians, as well as visiting France and Italy. In his paintings appear more subtle and generalized colors. Disappears excessive fragmentation, it replaces the large wholeness and contemplation. Semionov often uses local color. In his painting is enhanced imagery and decorative. In some works of this period discern the influence of [[Sergei Ivanovich Osipov|Sergei Osipov]], a talented painter, with whom Arseny Semionov linked the long-standing friendship,  the creative journey, and common pedagogical work at the Department of Painting of the Vera Mukhina Institute.

In the 1970s Arseny Semionov successfully appealed to a relatively rare for him genre of still life, creating a variety of decorative and fine works of art. Among them are marked at the art shows and in publications "Still Life with a Flower"&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; (1972), "Still Life with antique sculpture"&lt;ref&gt;''The Fine Arts of Leningrad. Exhibition catalogue.'' – Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1976. – p.30.&lt;/ref&gt; (1971), "Still Life with Flowers"&lt;ref&gt;''The Portrait of Contemporary the Fifth Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1976. Catalogue.'' – Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1983. – p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; (1975), "Still life with teapot" (1972), "Still Life with Jug and Apples"&lt;ref&gt;''Our Contemporary The Second Exhibition of works by Leningrad artists of 1972. Catalogue''. -Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1973. – p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; (1971), and others.

Arseny Semenov rarely painted portraits. They were mostly images of family: his wife and daughter. Stand out self-portraits the artist painted them in the years 1950–1960. These works, in particular, [[:|"Self Portrait"]]&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.''- Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; (1962), open new facets of the artist's talents, making for a different look at the rest of his work. In a small laconic work Semionov used amazingly accurate means of expression, which allow him with the utmost frankness and depth to say about himself, about his generation and epoch.

In 1966 in Leningrad has been shown exhibition of works by Arseny Semionov, dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the artist and 20 years of his teaching work at the Department of Painting of the Vera Mukhina Institute. In 1977, in the halls of the Leningrad Union of Artists has been shown a joint exhibition of paintings by Arseny Semionov, Sergei Osipov, and Cyril Gushchin.&lt;ref&gt;''Arseny N. Semionov, Sergei I. Osipov, Kirill A. Guschin. Exhibition catalogue.'' – Leningrad: Khudozhnik RSFSR, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arseny Nikiforovich Semionov died on September 13, 1992 in Saint Petersburg at the eighty-second year of life. His paintings reside in Art museums and private collections in Russia, Japan, France, in the U.S., England, and throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;''Sergei V. Ivanov. Unknown Socialist Realism. The Leningrad School.'' – Saint Petersburg: NP-Print Edition, 2007. – p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arseny Semionov. Painting.

{{Western art history}}

The '''art of Europe''', or '''Western art''', encompasses the history of [[visual art]] in [[Europe]]. European [[prehistoric art]] started as mobile [[rock art|rock]] and [[cave painting]] art and was characteristic of the period between the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="Europeart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Written histories of European art often begin with the art of the [[Ancient Middle East]] and the [[Aegean civilisation|Ancient Aegean civilization]]s, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. Parallel with these significant cultures, art of one form or another existed all over Europe, wherever there were people, leaving signs such as carvings, decorated artifacts and huge standing stones. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with the [[Ancient Greek art|art of Ancient Greece]], adopted and transformed by [[Roman art|Rome]] and carried; with the Empire, across much of Europe, [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boardman (art historian)|Boardman, John]] ed., ''The Oxford History of Classical Art'', pp. 349-369, [[Oxford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0198143869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the art of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the [[Medieval art|Medieval]] period, to re-emerge in the [[Renaissance]], suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as "decay" during the [[Baroque]] period,&lt;ref&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]] excluded nearly all Baroque buildings from his mammoth tome ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''. The publishers eventually rectified this.&lt;/ref&gt; to reappear in a refined form in [[Neo-Classicism]]&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}.  "...in 1855 we find, for the first time, the word 'Renaissance' used — by the French historian Michelet — as an adjective to describe a whole period of history and not confined to the rebirth of Latin letters or a classically inspired style in the arts."&lt;/ref&gt; and to be reborn in [[Post-Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence upon European art, the commissions of the Church, architectural, painterly and sculptural, providing the major source of work for artists. The history of the Church was very much reflected in the history of art, during this period. In the same period of time there was renewed interest in heroes and heroines, tales of mythological gods and goddesses, great wars, and bizarre creatures which were not connected to religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Europe|url=http://www.slam.org/european/intro.html|work=Saint Louis Art Museum|publisher=Slam|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular [[ideology]] at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist.

European art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, [[classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Byzantine]], [[Medieval]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]], [[Modernism|Modern]] and [[Postmodern]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Prehistoric art==
{{main article|Prehistoric_art#Europe}}

European prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/prese.htm|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: [[Stone age]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze age]], and [[Iron age]]. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings.

[[File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]].]]
Much surviving [[prehistoric art]] is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female [[Venus figurines]] such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24,000–22,000 BC) found across central Europe;&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 8-16, 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; the 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall [[Löwenmensch figurine]] of about 30,000 BCE has hardly any pieces that can be related to it.  The [[Swimming Reindeer]] of about 11,000 BCE is one of the finest of a number of [[Magdalenian]] carvings in bone or antler of animals in the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], though they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Joachim, "Prehistoric Europe, §II: Palaeolithic 3. Portable art" in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012; Sandars, 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75-80&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] from the [[European Iron Age]] and the Bronze Age [[Trundholm sun chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 253-257, 183-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest European cave art dates back 40,800, and can be found in the [[El Castillo Cave]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwong|first=Matt|title=Oldest cave-man art in Europe dates back 40,800 years|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/06/14/cave-paintings-europe.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cave painting sites include [[Lascaux]], [[Cave of Altamira]], [[Grotte de Cussac]], [[Pech Merle]], [[Cave of Niaux]], [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Font-de-Gaume]], Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (Cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), [[Coliboaia cave]] from [[Romania]] (considered the oldest cave painting in central [[Europe]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/06/romanian-cave-may-boast-central.html |title=Romanian Cave May Boast Central Europe's Oldest Cave Art &amp;#124; Science/AAAS &amp;#124; News |publisher=News.sciencemag.org |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magura,&lt;ref name="Europeart" /&gt; Belogradchik, Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Prehistoric Europe|last=Gunther|first=Michael|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/timelines/europe/prehistoric.html|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion.  One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes.  Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.  Cave paintings, undertaken with only the most rudimentary tools, can also furnish valuable insight into the culture and beliefs of that era.

The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] represents a very different style, with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing.  The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Other less numerous groups of rock art, many engraved rather than painted, show similar characteristics. The Iberian examples are believed to date from a long period perhaps covering the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early Neolithic.

Prehistoric [[Celtic art]] comes from much of [[Iron Age Europe]] and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. There are human heads and some fully represented animals, but full-length human figures at any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo.  As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, it almost entirely vanishes, but the style continued in limited use in the [[British Isles]], and with the coming of Christianity revived there in the [[Insular style]] of the Early Middle Ages.

==Ancient Classical art==
{{Main article|Minoan art|Ancient Greek art|Roman art}}
[[File:Minoan Ceramic - Can.jpg|thumb|upright|Minoan Ceramic Art]]

The [[Minoan culture]] is regarded as the oldest civilization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaniotis|first=Angelos|title=Ancient Crete|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml;jsessionid=B732A8D81DF46C77A25A3DA2625360A9|work=Oxford Bibliographies|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minoan culture existed in [[Crete]] and consisted of four periods: Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and the Postpalatial period between 3650 BC and 1100 BC. Not much of the art remained from the Prepalatial times, and most of artefacts still existing today are Cycladic [[statuettes]] and [[pottery]] fragments. The most prosperous period of the Cretan civilization was Neopalatial period and most of the artefacts are from this era. A large number of artefacts from the Protopalatial can be seen today in Cretan museums.
Pottery – most popular in the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BC) – was characterized by thin walled vessels, subtle, symmetrical shapes, elegant spouts, and decorations, and dynamic lines. Dark and light values were often contrasted in Minoan pottery.  The spontaneity and fluidity of the Protopalatial period later were transformed to a more stylized form of art with dissociation of naturalism in the Neopalatial period.&lt;br /&gt;The [[palace]]s served as organizational, commercial, artistic, worshipping, and agricultural centres in the Cretan civilization. Cretan palaces were built without defensive walls and exhibited a central [[courtyard]] which was embraced by a number of buildings. The central courtyard served as the main meeting place of the people. The palaces had [[throne room]]s, cult chambers, and [[theatre]]s where people could gather at special events. Columns and staircases were part of the artistic expression and it is believed that they served as metaphorical elements.&lt;br /&gt;The Minoan palaces are richly painted with [[painting]]s. Minoan painting was unique in that it used wet fresco techniques; it was characterized by small waists, fluidity, and vitality of the figures and was seasoned with elasticity, spontaneity, vitality, and high-contrasting colours.&lt;br /&gt;Not much of the [[sculpture]] survived from the Minoan civilization. The best known example of sculptures is the [[Snake Goddess]] figurine. The sculpture depicts a goddess or a high priestess holding a snake in both hands, dressed in traditional Minoan attire, cloth covering the whole body and leaving the breasts exposed. Exquisite [[metal work]] was also a characteristic of the Minoan art. Minoan metal masters worked with imported gold and copper and mastered techniques of wax casting, [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]], [[gilding]], nielo, and [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minoan art|url=http://www.ancient-greece.org/art/minoan-art.html|work=Greek art|publisher=Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]] had great painters, great sculptors, and great architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek [[marble sculpture]] is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art.  Painting on the [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or by later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in 5–6 BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local [[Etruscan art]] of Italy. [[Roman sculpture]], is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics.  Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy, especially at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=Art-and-archaeology.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'oeil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Painting|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the surviving painted portraits from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portrait]]s of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]].  They give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had.  A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period. [[Early Christian art]] grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its [[iconography]] from these sources.

==Medieval==
{{main article|Medieval art}}

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''[[Saint Matthew]]'' from the ''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]].]]

Most surviving art from the [[Medieval]] period was religious in focus, often funded by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], powerful ecclesiastical individuals such as [[bishop]]s, communal groups such as [[abbey]]s, or wealthy secular [[patron]]s. Many had specific liturgical functions—processional [[Christian cross|crosses]] and [[altarpiece]]s, for example.

One of the central questions about Medieval art concerns its lack of realism. A great deal of knowledge of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in art and understanding of the human figure was lost with the fall of [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. But realism was not the primary concern of Medieval artists. They were simply trying to send a religious message, a task which demands clear iconic images instead of precisely rendered ones.

'''Time Period''': 6th century to 15th century

===Byzantine===
[[File:Helios in His Chariot.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Byzantine art}}
Byzantine art overlaps with or merges with what we call Early Christian art until the [[iconoclasm]] period of 730-843 when the vast majority of artwork with figures was destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding. After 843 until 1453 there is a clear Byzantine art tradition. It is often the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with production centered on Constantinople. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental frescos and mosaics inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to mosques.

===Early Medieval art===
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
[[Migration period art]] is a general term for the art of the "barbarian" peoples who moved into formerly Roman territories.  [[Celtic art]] in the 7th and 8th centuries saw a fusion with Germanic traditions through contact with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] creating what is called the Hiberno-Saxon style or [[Insular art]], which was to be highly influential on the rest of the Middle Ages.  [[Merovingian art]] describes the art of the [[Franks]] before about 800, when [[Carolingian art]] combined insular influences with a self-conscious classical revival, developing into [[Ottonian art]]. [[Anglo-Saxon art]] is the art of England after the Insular period.  [[Illuminated manuscript]]s contain nearly all the surviving painting of the period, but architecture, metalwork and small carved work in wood or ivory were also important media.

===Romanesque===
[[File:WinchesterBibleJeremiah(cover).GIF|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Romanesque art}}
Romanesque art refers to the period from about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century.  This was a period of increasing prosperity, and the first to see a coherent style used across Europe, from Scandinavia to Switzerland.  Romanesque art is vigorous and direct, was originally brightly coloured, and is often very sophisticated. [[Stained glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] on metalwork became important media, and larger sculptures in the round developed, although [[high relief]] was the principal technique.  Its architecture is dominated by thick walls, and round-headed windows and arches, with much carved decoration.

===Gothic===
[[File:Folio 79r - Pentecostes excerpt.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Gothic art}}
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with Gothic architecture in 1140, but Gothic painting did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style. Gothic sculpture was born in France in 1144 with the renovation of the Abbey Church of S. Denis and spread throughout Europe, by the 13th century it had become the international style, replacing Romanesque. International Gothic describes Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art merges into Renaissance art at different times in different places. During this period forms such as painting, in fresco and on panel, become newly important, and the end of the period includes new media such as prints. {{Clear}}

{{main article|Renaissance art}}
The [[Renaissance]] is characterized by a focus on the arts of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]], which led to many changes in both the technical aspects of painting and sculpture, as well as to their subject matter. It began in [[Italian Renaissance|Italy]], a country rich in Roman heritage as well as material prosperity to fund artists. During the Renaissance, painters began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s more authentically. Artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. [[Sculpture|Sculptors]], too, began to rediscover many ancient techniques such as [[contrapposto]]. Following with the [[Humanism|humanist]] spirit of the age, art became more secular in subject matter, depicting ancient [[mythology]] in addition to Christian themes. This genre of art is often referred to as [[Renaissance Classicism]]. In the North, the most important Renaissance innovation was the widespread use of [[oil paint]]s, which allowed for greater colour and intensity.

===From Gothic to the Renaissance===
During the late 13th century and early 14th century, much of the painting in Italy was Byzantine in Character, notably that of [[Duccio]] of Siena and [[Cimabue]] of Florence, while [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Rome]] was more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style.

In 1290 [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] began painting in a manner that was less traditional and more based upon observation of nature. His famous cycle at the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], [[Padua]], is seen as the beginnings of a Renaissance style.

Other painters of the 14th century were carried the Gothic style to great elaboration and detail. Notable among these painters are [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the technique of painting in [[oil paint|oil]]s rather than [[tempera]], led itself to a form of elaboration that was not dependent upon the application of gold leaf and embossing, but upon the minute depiction of the natural world. The art of painting textures with great realism evolved at this time. Dutch painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] were to have great influence on Late Gothic and Early Renaissance painting.

===Early Renaissance===
The ideas of the Renaissance first emerged in the city-state of [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The sculptor [[Donatello]] returned to classical techniques such as [[contrapposto]] and classical subjects like the unsupported nude—his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire. The sculptor and architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] studied the architectural ideas of ancient Roman buildings for inspiration. [[Tommaso Masaccio|Masaccio]] perfected elements like composition, individual expression, and human form to paint frescoes, especially those in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], of surprising elegance, drama, and emotion.

A remarkable number of these major artists worked on different portions of the [[Florence Cathedral]]. Brunelleschi's dome for the cathedral was one of the first truly revolutionary architectural innovations since the Gothic flying buttress. Donatello created many of its sculptures. Giotto and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] also contributed to the cathedral.

===High Renaissance===
High Renaissance artists include such figures as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raffaello Sanzio]].

The 15th-century artistic developments in Italy (for example, the interest in perspectival systems, in depicting anatomy, and in classical cultures) matured during the 16th century, accounting for the designations "Early Renaissance" for the 15th century and "High Renaissance" for the 16th century. Although no singular style characterizes the High Renaissance, the art of those most closely associated with this Period—Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian—exhibits an astounding mastery, both technical and aesthetic. High Renaissance artists created works of such authority that generations of later artists relied on these artworks for instruction.
These exemplary artistic creations further elevated the prestige of artists. Artists could claim divine inspiration, thereby raising visual art to a status formerly given only to poetry. Thus, painters, sculptors, and architects came into their own, successfully claiming for their work a high position among the fine arts. In a sense, 16th- century masters created a new profession with its own rights of expression and its own venerable character.

===Northern art up to the Renaissance===
[[Early Netherlandish painting]] developed (but did not strictly invent) the technique of [[oil painting]] to allow greater control in painting minute detail with realism—[[Jan van Eyck]]&amp;nbsp;(1366–1441) was a figure in the movement from [[illuminated manuscript]]s to [[panel painting]]s.

[[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450?–1516), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter, is another important figure in the Northern Renaissance. In his paintings, he used religious themes, but combined them with grotesque fantasies, colourful imagery, and peasant folk legends. His paintings often reflect the confusion and anguish associated with the end of the Middle Ages.

[[Albrecht Dürer]] introduced Italian Renaissance style to Germany at the end of the 15th century, and dominated [[German Renaissance art]].

In European art, Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements—[[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]]. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. The work of [[El Greco]] is a particularly clear example of [[Mannerism]] in painting during the late 16th, early 17th centuries. [[Northern Mannerism]] took longer to develop, and was largely a movement of the last half of the 16th century.   Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama in their search for beauty. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and [[Diego Velázquez]].

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  [[Flemish Baroque painting]] shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

Baroque art is often seen as part of the [[Counter-Reformation]]—the artistic element of the revival of spiritual life in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Additionally, the emphasis that Baroque art placed on grandeur is seen as [[Political absolutism|Absolutist]] in nature. Religious and political themes were widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures were characterised by a strong element of drama, emotion and theatricality. Famous Baroque artists include [[Caravaggio]] or [[Rubens]].&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com/BaroqueArt.html |title=Baroque Art |publisher=Arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colours with dark undertones. Pomp and grandeur were important elements of the Baroque artistic movement in general, as can be seen when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] said, "I am grandeur incarnate"; many Baroque artists served kings who tried to realize this goal. Baroque art in many ways was similar to Renaissance art; as a matter of fact, the term was initially used in a derogative manner to describe post-Renaissance art and architecture which was over-elaborate.&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"/&gt; Baroque art can be seen as a more elaborate and dramatic re-adaptation of late Renaissance art.

By the 18th century, however, Baroque art was falling out of fashion as many deemed it too melodramatic and also gloomy, and it developed into the [[Rococo]], which emerged in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |title=Ancien Regime Rococo |publisher=Bc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the Baroque used rich, strong colours, Rococo used pale, creamier shades. The artistic movement no longer placed an emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Rococo art also contrasted the Baroque as it often refused symmetry in favor of asymmetrical designs. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of [[Far East|Far Eastern Asia]], resulting in the rise in favour of [[porcelain]] figurines and [[chinoiserie]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/chinoiserie.aspx#3-1E1:chinoise-full|title=chinoiserie facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about chinoiserie|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century style flourished for a short while; nevertheless, the Rococo style soon fell out of favor, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning. [[Neoclassicism]] in many ways developed as a counter movement of the Rococo, the impetus being a sense of disgust directed towards the latter's florid qualities.

==Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Academism and Realism==
{{Main article|Neoclassicism|Romantic art|Academic art|Realism (arts)}}
[[File:Amor-Psyche-Canova-JBU01.JPG|thumb|right|Neoclassical art, inspired by different classical themes, was characterised by an emphasis on simplicity, order and idealism. In the image [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' (1787-1793)]]

Throughout the 18th century, a counter movement opposing the Rococo sprang up in different parts of Europe, commonly known as [[Neoclassicism]]. It despised the perceived superficiality and frivolity of Rococo art, and desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was in part also influenced by the Renaissance, which itself was strongly influenced by classical art. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as [[the Enlightenment]]; the Enlightenment was idealistic, and put its emphasis on objectivity, reason and empirical truth. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], which saw great works of Neoclassical architecture spring up during this period; Neoclassicism's fascination with classical antiquity can be seen in the popularity of the [[Grand Tour]] during this decade, where wealthy aristocrats travelled to the ancient ruins of Italy and Greece. Nevertheless, a defining moment for Neoclassicism came during the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century; in France, Rococo art was replaced with the preferred Neoclassical art, which was seen as more serious than the former movement. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsz.org/neoclassicism-art/ |title=Art in Neoclassicism |publisher=Artsz.org |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Antonio Canova|Canova]], and [[Jacques-Louis David]] are among the best-known neoclassicists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;James J. Sheehan, "Art and Its Publics, c. 1800," United and Diversity in European Culture c. 1800, ed. [[Tim Blanning]] and [[Hagen Schulze]] (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830, [[Romanticism|Romantic art]].]] 

Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, so did [[Romanticism]] reject the ideas of the Enlightenment and the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists. Romanticism rejected the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, and opted for a more individual and emotional approach to the arts.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/introduction.html |title=General Introduction to Postmodernism |publisher=Cla.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanticism placed an emphasis on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions, and sought a highly personal approach to art. Romantic art was about individual feelings, not common themes, such as in Neoclassicism; in such a way, Romantic art often used colours in order to express feelings and emotion.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; Similarly to Neoclassicism, Romantic art took much of its inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, yet, unlike Neoclassical, this inspiration was primarily used as a way to create symbolism and imagery. Romantic art also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from [[medieval]]ism and [[Gothic art|Gothic]]ism, as well as mythology and [[folklore]]. Among the greatest Romantic artists were [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[John Constable]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Thomas Cole]], and [[William Blake]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Most artists attempted to take a centrist approach which adopted different features of Neoclassicist and Romanticist styles, in order to synthesize them. The different attempts took place within the French Academy, and collectively are called [[Academic art]]. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau]] is considered a chief example of this stream of art.

In the early 19th century the face of Europe, however, became radically altered by [[industrialization]]. Poverty, squalor, and desperation were to be the fate of the new [[working class]] created by the "revolution". In response to these changes going on in society, the movement of [[realism (arts)|Realism]] emerged. Realism sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. Similarly, while Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] was a literary as well as an artistic movement. The great [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] painters include [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]] (both considered as [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s), and [[Thomas Eakins]], among others.

The response of architecture to industrialisation, in stark contrast to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. Although the railway stations built during this period are often considered the truest reflections of its spirit – they are sometimes called "the cathedrals of the age" – the main movements in architecture during the Industrial Age were revivals of styles from the distant past, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]. Related movements were the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], who attempted to return art to its state of "purity" prior to [[Raphael]], and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which reacted against the impersonality of mass-produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship.

==Modern art==
{{main article|Impressionism|Post Impressionism|Fauvism|Cubism|Modern art|Modernism|Late modernism}}
[[File:Monet Houses of Parliament, Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Impressionism was known for its usage of light and movement in its paintings, as in [[Claude Monet]]'s 1902 ''[[Houses of Parliament (Monet series)|Houses of Parliament, sunset]]]]''
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|right|[[Art &amp; Language]] are known for their major input on conceptual art.|299x299px]]
Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major artistic movement, [[Impressionism]]. The Impressionists pioneered the use of light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human eye. [[Edgar Degas]],
[[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of [[Post-Impressionism]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] are the best known Post-Impressionists.

Following the Impressionists and the [[Post-Impressionists]] came [[Fauvism]], often considered the first "modern" genre of art. Just as the Impressionists revolutionized light, so did the fauvists rethink [[color]], painting their canvases in bright, wild hues. After the Fauvists, [[modern art]] began to develop in all its forms, ranging from [[Expressionism]], concerned with evoking emotion through objective works of art, to [[Cubism]], the art of transposing a three-dimensional reality onto a flat canvas, to [[Abstract art]]. These new art forms pushed the limits of traditional notions of "art" and corresponded to the similar rapid changes that were taking place in human society, technology, and thought.

[[Surrealism]] is often classified as a form of Modern Art. However, the Surrealists themselves have objected to the study of surrealism as an era in art history, claiming that it oversimplifies the complexity of the movement (which they say is not an artistic movement), misrepresents the relationship of surrealism to [[aesthetics]], and falsely characterizes ongoing surrealism as a finished, historically encapsulated era. Other forms of Modern art (some of which border on [[Contemporary art]]) include:

{{Main article|Contemporary art|Postmodern art}}
Modern art foreshadowed several characteristics of what would later be defined as postmodern art; as a matter of fact, several modern art movements can often be classified as both modern and postmodern, such as [[pop art]]. Postmodern art, for instance, places a strong emphasis on irony, parody and humour in general; modern art started to develop a more ironic approach to art which would later advance in a postmodern context. Postmodern art sees the blurring between the high and fine arts with low-end and commercial art; modern art started to experiment with this blurring.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;
Recent developments in art have been characterised by a significant expansion of what can now deemed to be art, in terms of materials, media, activity and concept. [[Conceptual art]] in particular has had a wide influence. This started literally as the replacement of concept for a made object, one of the intentions of which was to refute the commodification of art. However, it now usually refers to an artwork where there is an object, but the main claim for the work is made for the thought process that has informed it. The aspect of commercialism has returned to the work.

There has also been an increase in art referring to previous movements and artists, and gaining validity from that reference.

[[Postmodernism]] in art, which has grown since the 1960s, differs from [[Modernism]] in as much as Modern art movements were primarily focused on their own activities and values, while Postmodernism uses the whole range of previous movements as a reference point. This has by definition generated a relativistic outlook, accompanied by irony and a certain disbelief in values, as each can be seen to be replaced by another. Another result of this has been the growth of commercialism and celebrity. Postmodern art has questioned common rules and guidelines of what is regarded as '[[fine art]]', merging [[low culture|low art]] with the fine arts until none is fully distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'', Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of postmodernism, the fine arts were characterised by a form of aesthetic quality, elegance, craftsmanship, finesse and intellectual stimulation which was intended to appeal to the [[upper class|upper]] or educated classes; this distinguished high art from low art, which, in turn, was seen as tacky, [[kitsch]], easily made and lacking in much or any intellectual stimulation, art which was intended to appeal to the masses. Postmodern art blurred these distinctions, bringing a strong element of kitsch, commercialism and [[camp (style)|campness]] into contemporary fine art;&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; what is nowadays seen as fine art may have been seen as low art before postmodernism revolutionised the concept of what high or fine art truly is.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; In addition, the postmodern nature of contemporary art leaves a lot of space for individualism within the art scene; for instance, postmodern art often takes inspiration from past artistic movements, such as Gothic or Baroque art, and both juxtaposes and recycles styles from these past periods in a different context.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;

Some [[Surrealism|surrealist]]s in particular [[Joan Miró]], who called for the "murder of painting" (In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods and his desire to "kill", "murder", or "rape" them in favor of more contemporary means of expression).&lt;ref&gt;M. Rowell, ''Joan Mirό: Selected Writings and Interviews'' (London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1987) pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  have denounced or attempted to "supersede" painting, and there have also been other anti-painting trends among artistic movements, such as that of [[Dada]] and [[conceptual art]]. The trend away from painting in the late 20th century has been countered by various movements, for example the continuation of [[Minimal Art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], [[Neo-minimalism|Neo Geo]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and [[Stuckism]] and various other important and influential painterly directions.

'''Basil Ionides''' (20 June 1884 – 23 September 1950) was a British architect who published two best-selling books, ''Colour and Interior Decoration'' (1926) and ''Colour in Everyday Rooms'' (1934).  He is best known for his 1929 interior design of the rebuilt [[Savoy Theatre]] in London.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Biography==
Ionides was born in [[Scotland]], the fourth son of Luke Ionides and grandson of [[Alexander Constantine Ionides]], [[Greeks|Greek]] ambassador to London.&lt;ref name=codexgeo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects – DSA Architect Biography Report (June 19, 2008, 11:44 pm)|publisher=www.codexgeo.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328002933/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317|archive-date=28 March 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[Glasgow School of Art]] 1900–1903.  While there, he wrote architecture articles.  He served his apprenticeship with Alexander Nisbet Paterson, during which he designed his first building, the double villa in Winton Drive, when he was only 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.primelocation.com/SAGR/SAGL/Brochures/SAGL192317B1.PDF |title=A handsome, early Victorian detached villa in an affluent enclave |publisher=media.primelocation.com |accessdate=19 June 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of his apprenticeship in 1904 or 1905, he moved to London and joined the office first of [[Leonard Stokes]] and then of [[Harold Ainsworth Peto]].&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;[http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317 Profile of Basil Ionides at the ''Dictionary of Scottish Architects'' (2006).] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328002933/http://www.codexgeo.co.uk/dsa/architect_full.php?id=M000317 |date=28 March 2007 }} Retrieved on 19 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ionides entered independent practice in 1908 and designed a number of English houses.  During the [[First World War]], he served in the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Naval Reserve]] and was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]].  He relinquished the commission, however, preferring to serve as an ordinary [[seaman]], as he did not like giving orders to more experienced men.  He was injured in 1917 and returned to private practice, particularly performing interior work.&lt;ref name=Dictionary/&gt;

Ionides married the Honourable Nellie Samuel (1883–1962),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p11830.htm#i118300 Information about Nellie Samuel and Basil Ionides at thePeerage.com.] Retrieved on 19 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the widow of Walter Henry Levy, daughter of the [[Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted|1st Viscount Bearsted]], in 1930 after meeting her while he was decorating her residence in [[Berkeley Square]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/03/arts/art-architecture-when-good-eye-and-goodly-fortune-come-together.html?pagewanted=all |title=ART/ARCHITECTURE; When Good Eye And Goodly Fortune Come Together – New York Times|publisher=query.nytimes.com|accessdate=19 June 2008|last=Owens|first=Mitchell | date=3 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was an expert in Oriental [[porcelain]] and collected art works, many of which were donated to Richmond Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderven-vanderven.com/media/VandervenMedia/letter_tefaf2004.html|title=Vanderven &amp; Vanderven Oriental Art|publisher=www.vanderven-vanderven.com|accessdate=19 June 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618221434/http://www.vanderven-vanderven.com/media/VandervenMedia/letter_tefaf2004.html|archivedate=18 June 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basil and Nellie had one child, Adam, who died at the age of nine.

Ionides was an important [[Art Deco]] designer.  He was best known as the architect (with Frank A.

{{Pan-African|right}}
'''Black orientalism''' is an intellectual and cultural movement found primarily within [[African-American]] circles. While similar to the general movement of [[Orientalism]] in its negative outlook upon [[Western Asia]]n - especially Arab - culture and religion, it differs in both its emphasis upon the role of the [[Arab slave trade]] and the [[Coolie]] slave trade in the historic dialogue between [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and the [[Arab world|Arab]] - and greater [[Muslim world|Muslim]] - world, as well as a lack of colonial promotion over the Middle East region as was promoted by European orientalism in the same region. The term "black orientalism" was first used by Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui]] in his critique of [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s documentary ''Wonders of the African World''. Supporters of this movement include writers such as [[Chinweizu Ibekwe|Chinweizu]].

==Black orientalism and Afrocentrism==
Black orientalism, prior to its appropriation by religious Christian black nationalists, was formulated within the context of [[Afrocentrism]]; Jackson later wrote that it was [[Molefi Kete Asante]] who formed the base of its black orientalism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Adoption of Islam is as contradictory to the [[African diaspora|Diasporan]] Afrocentricity as [[Christianity]] has been. Christianity has been dealt with admirably by other writers, notably [[Maulana Karenga|Karenga]]; but [[Islam]] within the African- American community ha [sic] yet to come under Afrocentric scrutiny. Understand that this oversight is due more to a sympathetic audience than it is to the perfection of Islam for African-Americans. While the [[Nation of Islam]] under the leadership of [[Elijah Muhammad]] was a transitional nationalist movement, the present emphasis of [[Islam in the United States|Islam in America]] is more cultural and religious.  --Molefi Kete Asante, ''Afrocentricity'' (1988)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reaction by Muslim writers==
The term "black orientalism" was first used by Kenyan academic [[Ali Mazrui]] in his Internet critique of [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]]'s documentary ''Wonders of the African World''. Mazrui had criticized the film for having markedly deemphasized the history of Islam in Africa, to the point where the history of Nigeria - half of whose population is Muslim - was all but absent from the general coverage by the documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~africa/sources/mazruigates2.htm ''Black Orientalism? Further Reflections on "Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.''], by Ali Mazrui, November 11, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was later used by [[Sherman Jackson]] in an article for ''[[Islamica Magazine]]'', which criticized Black orientalism as a backlash from the oft-conservative Christian [[African studies]] scholars who have seen [[African American Muslims|Black Islam]] as a political threat of sorts. The article was later included in his book ''Islam and the Blackamerican''.

'''Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design''' (CSAD) is one of the five schools that comprise [[Cardiff Metropolitan University]]. It originated as the Cardiff School of Art in 1865.

==History==
Cardiff School of Art &amp; Design opened in 1865 as the Cardiff School of Science &amp; Art&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cardiffmet.ac.uk/alumni/Pages/Our-History.aspx |title=The History of Cardiff Metropolitan University  |publisher=CMU |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with lessons initially taking place on the top floor of the Cardiff Free Library and Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |page=7 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867 a distinct School of Art was formed, based on the Art Night School, with 65 young pupils aged between 9 and 17. In 1868 an older intake was accepted, of 50 'artisan' students between 17 and 25 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SScGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=%22Milo+ap+Griffith%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TrNoVPnyFNPhaIeHgPgH&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Milo%20ap%20Griffith%22&amp;f=false |title=Sixth Annual Report 1867&amp;ndash;68 |chapter=The Headmaster's Report |publisher=Cardiff Free Library and Museum and Science and Art Schools |date=1868 |pages=13–14 |accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, a new six-storey campus was built in Howard Gardens, Cardiff, with large studios facing north. The building was designed by the Cardiff City Architect, John Dryburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Newman |first1=John |title=The Buildings of Wales: Glamorgan |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DpUMspCtpNIC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=%22Howard+gardens%22+gallery+cardiff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NhfLUs34K8yh7AbS4oAQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Howard%20gardens%22%20gallery%20cardiff&amp;f=false |place= |publisher=Penguin Books |page=306 |year=2001 |isbn=0-14-071056-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School merged with other colleges in 1976 to become part of South Glamorgan Institute of Higher Education (later Cardiff Institute of Higher Education and the University of Wales Institute Cardiff).&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; It is the oldest constituent part of Cardiff Metropolitan University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/into-university/az-uni-colleges/cardiff-university-of-wales-institute-458889.html |title=

In 2013, Cardiff Metropolitan University put its 2.25 acre Howard Gardens campus up for sale with the intention of moving to a new site in summer 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Sion Barry |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/commercial-property/cardiff-metropolitan-university-puts-howard-6280232 |title=

In the 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] the Art &amp; Design panel rated 95% of the research submission as international standard, with 70% rated as either Internationally Excellent or World Leading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csad.uwic.ac.uk/csad/research.htm Research areas &amp; RAE assessment results]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is home to a number of highly regarded international standard research groups which range across the humanities, art, design and sciences as well as the Centre for [[Ceramic]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artcolleges/InfoAll/introduction/ac_id/62|title=Introduction - Cardiff School of Art and Design|publisher=saatchi-gallery.co.uk|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Combination Platter'''''  is a 1993 drama&lt;ref name="Combination Platter Background Information"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; film directed by Tony Chan and starring [[Jeffrey Lau]], Colleen O'Brien, and Lester Chit-Man Chan. It is the directorial debut of Tony Chan.

The film follows the story of Robert (Jeffrey Lau), a young [[illegal immigrant]], who lives in [[Flushing, Queens]], seeking to marry a U.S. citizen so he can stay in the country legally.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Letterboxd Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;

==Plot==
The film details the difficulties faced by young [[undocumented immigrant]] Robert (Jeffrey Lau), working at a low-paying job at a Szechuan restaurant in Flushing, [[Flushing, Queens]], New York.&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; Robert wants to obtain U.S. citizenship and is told that this is possible if he marries an American woman (which is played by O'Brien).&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Letterboxd Overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; He initially frets the idea, but decides to Americanize himself in the shortest time possible.&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes Summary"/&gt; The character, in addition, sends money to his parents, along with letters which show a false positivity of his life in America.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; One waiter, Sam (Lester "Chit Man" Chan) receives major debts which causes him to pocketing communal tips.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Robert is impressed by a pair of regulars, a young white man, and his Asian- American girlfriend.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

His boss (Thomas K. Suing) thinks business is too slow to create tax penalties for sponsoring Robert,&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; and if he were to do so, it would take Robert about five years to get his card. He also wants to bring his parents to America.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; A classy woman offers from $25, 000 to $50, 000 to marry Robert for convenience.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; Later, he lets his street-smart friend Andy sets him up with a shy, lonely white woman (Colleen O' Brien).&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; They're relationship is inconclusive; they have hardly anything in common and not much to say to each other.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; They end up breaking up with her because he admits he is using her.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Things get bad at work. Robert affronts Sam about his theft and gets him fired.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt; Later on, the [[Department of Immigration and Citizenship|Department of Immigration]] raids the restaurant, with Robert closely hiding in the walk-in freezer.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt; He returns to work with the plight still undecided and watches as the young white man proposes to his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Album ratings
| rev1 = ''[[TV Guide]]''
| rev1Score = {{Rating|3|5}}&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;
}}

Reviews for ''Combination Platter'' have been mild. Praise has been given to film's plot. Kevin Thomas of ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote "Chan, whose parents own the actual restaurant in the film, is able to break through the monolithic view whites so often have of Chinese people.&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;" Meanwhile, ''[[TV Guide]]'' wrote a similar comment, {{quote|"Chan's film confronts racial stereotyping by telling the stories of those too often excluded from the table of mass culture.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;"}} ''TV Guide'' also wrote, "''Combination Platter'' presents some New York neighborhoods rarely shown in films or on TV and Chan utilizes his limited locations with aplomb."

Praise was especially given to the characters of the film. David Mills of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Colleen O'Brien is touching as a shy white woman who goes out with Robert, unaware of his need for a marriage of convenience.&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;" He also commented, "Chan surrounds Robert with an interesting mix of characters... street-smart buddy Andy, who is helping him find a wife, seems especially hip when he's speaking in New Yawk-inflected English. Lester "Chit-Man" Chan brings scowling authenticity to the part of Sam, the grumpy waiter who likes to insult his American customers in Chinese, right in front of their faces." ''TV Guide'' also wrote positively of Sam, "Lester "Chit Man" Chan's foul-tempered Sam is much more fun.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;

In addition, the film was exalted for its reflection of conflicts of the community. ''TV Guide'' wrote, {{quote|"The restaurant reflects the conflicts of the community: white vs. Asian; "ABC"s vs. immigrants; Hong Kong vs. Taiwan; and Mandarin-speaking vs. Cantonese-speaking.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;"}} David Mills of ''The Washington Post'' wrote, "The multilingual dialogue in ''Combination Platter'' (with occasional English subtitles)... examines ... cultural conflicts among the Chinese—between immigrants and "ABCs" (American-born Chinese), between those who speak Cantonese and those who speak Mandarin.&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;" Kevin Thomas of ''Los Angeles Times'' wrote, "within the restaurant's staff there is a language barrier&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; between those Chinese who speak only Cantonese and those who speak only Mandarin. Then there's the owner's... American-born niece Jennie (Ellen Synn), the restaurant's cashier, who knows neither dialect--and eats Chinese food with a fork instead of chopsticks." In addition, he wrote of the conflict, "Jennie's unfamiliarity with her ancestral language puts her in a situation&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt; similar to that of the restaurant's only white employee (Colin Mitchell), who's razzed by his friends for working in a Chinese restaurant in the first place."

==Trivia==
The film is shot in the restaurant Szechuan Inn, which is owned by Chan's parents.&lt;ref name="tv guide review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LA review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp review"/&gt;

'''Dangler''' is a literary term meaning a [[plotline]] that is metaphorically left to "dangle" or "hang".  A ''dangler'', or ''dangling plotline'', is a [[plot device]] in fiction where a plotline is forgotten, phased out and eventually dropped, thus a resolution is never achieved.  Although dangling plotlines can occur in all forms of media, they typically appear in comic books, movies and book sequels, where the original writer or creative team can be replaced.&lt;ref&gt;http://dollhousewiki.fox.com/thread/2975709/DOLLHOUSE+Season+1+WRAP-UP%3A+Top+10+Plot+Danglers!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uncannyxmen.net/db/article/showfaq.asp?fldAuto=18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dexterwiki.sho.com/page/Dexter%3A+Plot+Holes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons for danglers ==
Typically, a writer will pepper the main story with smaller back-stories.  It then becomes evident to the reader that these smaller back-stories have the potential to build up into a bigger story and reach a conclusion of some sort.

Editorial mandate can also force a writer to drop a building plotline due to fan backlash or an editor's lack of interest to pursue such a plot.

== Examples of danglers ==
In [[television]], when a creative team fears that their show may not be picked up for another season, they will end the [[season finale]] with a [[cliffhanger]] in order to conjure a fan outcry and interest to continue the series.  When the series is not picked up for another season, the cliffhanger creates a dangling plotline.  Usually the original writer, fan of the series, or the company who produced the series, will look to another form of media to continue the story. ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' was able to resolve some dangling plotlines due to the release of the [[Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me|theatrical film]]. ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' got its own comic book series appropriately named ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', which was written by series creator [[Joss Whedon]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darkhorse.com/Comics/14-111/Buffy-the-Vampire-Slayer-Season-8-1&lt;/ref&gt; In an extremely rare occasion, ''[[Futurama]]'' was continued six years later through [[direct-to-DVD]] films, which eventually led to the resurrection of the series in its original television format.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.speedbumpstudios.com/futurama/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[comic book]]s, it is a common practice for writers to resolve their own dangling plotlines in other comic books within the [[shared universe]].  A good example is [[Frank Tieri (comics)|Frank Tieri]], who started a [[Weapon X]] story in [[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]], who then later became the writer of his own Weapon X series and as the series ended abruptly, was forced to continue some of his side-stories in a miniseries called ''Weapon X: Days of Future Now''.&lt;ref&gt;''Weapon X: Days of Future Now'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;  One lingering plotline left a character in limbo from the ''Weapon X'' series until Frank Tieri took the reins of ''[[New Excalibur]]'',&lt;ref&gt;New Excalibur #8-15&lt;/ref&gt; where he proceeded to close this character's storyline, five years later.  [[Chris Claremont]] and [[Warren Ellis]] are also known for continuing their own stories throughout other books they write for.  In a similar fashion, [[Mark Millar]] has continued the story of an ever-dangling character, [[Clyde Wyncham]], all throughout his runs on ''[[Marvel 1985]]'', ''[[Kick-Ass (comic book)|Kick-Ass]]'', ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' and ''[[Old Man Logan]]''.

Because of the unsatisfying nature of having a plotline dangle, fans sometimes take matters into their own hands.  One famous example of this, the numerous directors and writers in the ''[[Halloween (franchise)|Halloween]]'' series each had different directions for their story of [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]].  This left many [[plot holes]] and dangling storylines after each movie.  Seemingly unconnected, the movies would end with a cliffhanger and continue with absolutely no mention of the previous movie's occurrences.  To remedy this mess of [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]], [[Chaos Comics]] published a comic book series to bridge the gaps between all the movies into one continuous [[canon (fiction)|canon]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3024">The '''Enid Blyton Society''' was formed in 1995 by collectors of [[Enid Blyton]]'s work Norman Wright, Tony Summerfield and Michael Rouse. It was originally named the '''Enid Blyton Literary Society''', to distinguish it from other organisations with similar aims, such as the Enid Blyton Book and Ephemera Collectors' Society, but was renamed after the latter's closure.{{sfnp|Stoney|2011|loc=2969–2976|ps=}}

The call for material for the first ''Enid Blyton Society Journal'', edited by Tony Summerfield, met with a response which allowed a 32-page magazine to be issued in 1996. The journal flourished, and now has full-colour covers with around ninety pages per issue becoming the norm.

Just as the journal flourished, so the 'Enid Blyton Day' is still going strong,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Enid Blyton Society Day May 12th 2012 |url=http://peakirk.blogspot.com/2012/05/enid-blyton-society-day-may-12th-2012.html |work=Peakirk Books |publisher=Peakirk Books |accessdate=28 May 2012 |author=My Photo  Heather Lawrence |date=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with over a hundred in attendance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stella &amp; Roses Books at the Enid Blyton Day |url=http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/blyton_fair.php |work=Blyton Books |publisher=Stella &amp; Rose's Books |accessdate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408211635/http://www.blytonbooks.co.uk/articles/blyton_fair.php |archivedate=8 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at each event.

'''Environmental sculpture''' is sculpture that creates or alters the environment for the viewer, as opposed to presenting itself figurally or monumentally before the viewer. A frequent trait of larger environmental sculptures is that one can actually enter or pass through the sculpture and be partially or completely surrounded by it. Also, in the same spirit, it may be designed to generate shadows or reflections, or to color the light in the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;[[Britannica]] Online: [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9032735/environmental-sculpture]  '''"20th-century art form intended to involve or encompass the spectators rather than merely to face them; the form developed as part of a larger artistic current that sought to break down the historical dichotomy between life and art."'''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sculpture as environment ==
[[File:Eberhard Bosslet Intervention Bauzeichnung La Restinga II voll El Hierro 1983.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eberhard Bosslet]] construction drawing ''La Restinga II, El Hierro'', 1983]]

Julia M. Bush emphasizes the nonfigurative aspect of such works: "Environmental sculpture is never made to work at exactly human scale, but is sufficiently larger or smaller than scale to avoid confusion with the human image in the eyes of the viewer."&lt;ref&gt;(Busch, p.&amp;nbsp;27)."A Decade of Sculpture: the New Media in the 1960s" (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; Ukrainian-born [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Louise Nevelson]] is a pioneer of environmental sculpture in this sense. Busch (p.&amp;nbsp;27) also places the sculptures of [[Jane Frank]], as well as some works by [[Tony Smith (sculptor)|Tony Smith]] and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], in this category. Some environmental sculpture so encompasses the observer that it verges on architecture.

[[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], [[Duane Hanson]], [[Edward Kienholz]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Christo]], and [[Michael Heizer]] are well known practitioners of the genre, although Segal and Hanson's work is figural. Many figurative works of George Segal, for example, do qualify as environmental, in that—instead of being displayed on a pedestal as presentations to be gazed upon—they occupy and perturb the setting in which they are placed. A well known instance of this is the pair of Segal figures that sit on and stand next to one of the public benches in [[New York City]]'s Sheridan Square; anyone can sit amongst them.

A less known but more appropriate example is [[Athena Tacha]]'s {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} park ''Connections'' in downtown Philadelphia (between 18th St. and 19th St. two blocks north of Vine St.), created as a landscape art environment after her winning a competition in 1980 (where Segal was actually one of the finalists).  It was the first park designed entirely by an artist "sculpting the land" with planted terraces, rock clusters and paths (completed in 1992).

[[File:Lumen Poem 1985.jpg|thumb|''Lumen Poem'', by [[Jean-Max Albert]], 1985]]
A second sense of the term "environmental sculpture", with a somewhat different emphasis, is sculpture ''created for'' a particular set of surroundings. Thus, contemporary sculptor Beth Galston writes: "An environmental sculptor plans a piece from the very beginning in relationship to its surroundings. The site is a catalyst, becoming part of the creative process."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bethgalston.com/AboutEnvSculpt.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This is quite different from a Nevelson sculpture, which can usually be moved from place to place, like a conventional sculpture, without losing its meaning and effectiveness.

By Galston's definition, an environmental sculpture is not merely [[site-specific art]] as many conventional, figurative, marble monuments were created for specific sites.  Galston stresses that environmental sculpture entails the idea that the piece also functions to alter or permeate the existing environment or even to create a new environment in which the viewer is invited to participate: "The finished sculpture and site become one integrated unit, working together to create a unified mood or atmosphere," she writes. Many of the large, site-specific, [[minimalist]] sculptures of [[Richard Serra]] also qualify as environmental sculpture, in both senses described here. Much of what is called "[[land art]]" or "[[earth art]]" could also be termed environmental sculpture under this definition. [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]] and [[Alan Sonfist]] (which see) are among notable current practitioners of [[land art]].

Since the mid-seventies, French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]] worked with [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] structures, deconstructing and re-arranging the elements of surrounding architecture or including the site into the sculpture&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Suner,''Les sculptures de visées du Parc de La Villette'', Urbanisme no 215, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sculptures Bachelard]].

Since 1983 German artist [[Eberhard Bosslet]] makes interventions on ruins, so-called "Re/formations and side effects"; he refers to the conditions of industrial and residential buildings by white painted lines or black painted color fields. In 1999 the artist Elena Paroucheva created her concept for pylons, integrating energy networks with sculptures.http://www.art-elena.com/

==Site-specific art and environmental art==
[[File:Spiral-jetty-from-rozel-point.png|thumb|right|''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' by [[Robert Smithson]] from atop Rozel Point, in mid-April 2005]]
The term "[[site-specific art]]" is sometimes used interchangeably with "[[environmental art]]".  [[Louise Nevelson]], for instance is a pioneer American environmental artist with sources disagreeing on classifying her work as "environmental sculpture". The terms "environment sculpture", "site-specific art", and "environmental art" have not yet completely stabilized in their meanings.

A reason for blurred definitions is that much of site-specific and environmental art was created from 1970 on for public spaces all over the United States, sponsored by federal (GSA and NEA) or state and city [[Percent for Art]] competitions, and many of the artists were women trying to succeed outside the established art-gallery world.  Younger art historians will have to sort out the development of this marginalized "movement" and the importance of artists such as [[Olga Kisseleva]], [[Patricia Johanson]], [[Athena Tacha]], Mary Miss, [[Alice Adams (artist)|Alice Adams]], [[Elyn Zimmerman]], [[Merle Temkin]] and others who, from the early 1970s on, won and executed large outdoor public art commissions with new formal, kinesthetic and social underpinnings. Many of these artists were also ecologically conscious and created works that could offer a further definition of "environmental sculpture": art that is environmentally friendly and cares for the natural environment.

'''Exodus''' is an American [[thrash metal]] band formed in 1979 in [[Richmond, California]].&lt;ref name="Enter Night"&gt;{{cite book |last = Wall |first = Mick |title = Enter Night: A Biography of Metallica (page 119) |publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]] |date = May 10, 2011 |isbn = 0-312-64989-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have gone through numerous lineup changes, two extended hiatuses, and the deaths of two former band members. Their current lineup consists of guitarists [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] and [[Lee Altus]], bassist Jack Gibson, drummer [[Tom Hunting]], and lead vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]]. Hunting is one of the original members, and departed from Exodus twice, in 1989 and 2004, but rejoined in 2007. Holt joined the band about two years after its formation, and is the only member of Exodus to appear on all their releases.

Since its formation, Exodus has released ten studio albums, two live albums, one compilation album, and a [[Let There Be Blood|re-recording]] of their [[Bonded by Blood|first album]]. Along with [[Metallica]] (whose longtime lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]] was an original member of Exodus), [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Death Angel]], [[Vio-lence|Vio-Lence]], [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]] and [[Lȧȧz Rockit]], they are often credited as pioneers of the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exodus To Release 'Blood In, Blood Out' Album In October|url=http://www2.gibson.com/News-Lifestyle/Shared/2011/June/Gibson-Interview-Kirk-Hammett-of-Metallica.aspx|work=[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|gibson.com]]|date=June 5, 2011|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legendary metal band Exodus, formed in Richmond, set to release 10th studio album|url=http://richmondstandard.com/2014/09/legendary-metal-band-exodus-formed-richmond-set-release-10th-studio-album/|work=richmondstandard.com|date=September 24, 2014|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have sold over five million albums worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/29011/Exodus-Announces-Hometown-Gig |title=Exodus Announces Hometown Gig - The Gauntlet Heavy Metal News |website=Thegauntlet.com |date=October 3, 2013 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exodus had particular success in the mid-to-late 1980s with their first three studio albums: ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'' (1985), ''[[Pleasures of the Flesh]]'' (1987) and ''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'' (1989). The critical praise given to ''Fabulous Disaster'' garnered attention from major labels, including [[Capitol Records]], with whom Exodus signed in 1989. The band released two more studio albums (''[[Impact Is Imminent]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992) before disbanding in 1994. After temporarily reuniting in 1997–1998, Exodus reformed once again in 2001, and since then, they have released five more studio albums, the most recent being  ''[[Blood In, Blood Out (Exodus album)|Blood In, Blood Out]]'' (2014). The band is currently writing a follow-up album, tentatively due for release in late 2019 or early 2020.&lt;ref name="new album blabbermouth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exoduss-next-album-will-be-very-violent-and-very-heavy/|title=EXODUS's Next Album Will Be 'Very Violent And Very Heavy'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation and early years (1979–1983)===
[[File:Gary Holt Slayer Kiev 03.JPG|thumb|right|Guitarist [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] has been a member of Exodus since 1981, and is the only member to have performed on all of the band's albums.]]

The initial lineup of Exodus was formed in the late 1970s by guitarists [[Kirk Hammett]] and Tim Agnello, drummer/vocalist [[Tom Hunting]], and vocalist Keith Stewart, while they attended high school together. The band added bass guitarist Carlton Melson in 1980, and the quintet began making a name for themselves playing backyard parties and various school functions. They played mostly cover songs in the vein of 1970s hard rock and [[New wave of British heavy metal]] (NWOBHM) acts but also developed some of their own original songs. Stewart soon left the band and Hunting became the band's sole vocalist for some time. Carlton Melson was replaced in 1981 by bass guitarist Geoff Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carlton Melson interview|url=http://pestwebzine.com/index/carlton_melson/0-1457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Agnello would also leave the group, moving to New York City and staying involved in the music industry as a guitar player, manager, and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tim Agnello interview|url=https://www.cmalliance.org/alife/you-can-call-me-al/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left Exodus to perform as a power trio until a replacement was found in Hammett's friend and Exodus roadie [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvMDgl0z_ZA|title = Exodus / Slayer's Gary Holt - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction?|date = April 8, 2015|accessdate = November 18, 2015|website = YouTube|publisher = LoudWire|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1981, Hammett met El Cerrito resident [[Paul Baloff]] at a North Berkeley house party, a friendship that was started – according to Hammett – by their shared admiration for punk rock and 1970s heavy metal music. Baloff became the band's lead vocalist and the quintet recorded a 3-track demo tape in 1982 consisting of the songs "Whipping Queen", "Death and Domination" and "Warlord", a release which would be Hammett's only recording with Exodus. The band's music began to incorporate elements of [[hardcore punk]] into their NWOBHM roots, and Exodus were considered the pioneers of the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene. In November 1982, Exodus opened a show at San Francisco's [[Old Waldorf]] venue for [[Metallica]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encycmet.com/live/26.shtml ENCYCLOPEDIA METALLICA – Concert Info: San Francisco, Old Waldorf California Nov 29, 1982] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604222532/http://encycmet.com/live/26.shtml |date=June 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a then-relatively unknown (and unsigned) band from Los Angeles. As the band began playing more shows in Bay Area clubs, they gained a large, fervent fan base known for their violent concert behavior.

In early 1983, Hammett left Exodus to join [[Metallica]] on the recommendation of manager / producer [[Mark Whitaker (record producer)|Mark Whitaker]], leaving Gary Holt to effectively take creative control of the band. Hammett was replaced short term by Mike Maung, followed by [[Evan McCaskey]], before the band finally found a permanent replacement in guitarist [[Rick Hunolt]]. Geoff Andrews also left to start an early incarnation of pioneering [[death metal]] band [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], and was replaced by bass guitarist Rob McKillop.

In the spring of 1984, Exodus entered Turk Street Studios with producer [[Doug Piercy]] to record demos of songs that would later appear on their debut album. The band was signed to New York-based Torrid Records and Exodus prepared to enter [[Prairie Sun Recording Studios]] that summer.

===''Bonded By Blood'' and rise in popularity (1984–1991)===
[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 30.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]], who replaced [[Paul Baloff]], was a member of Exodus from 1986 to their first breakup in 1994, and again from 2002 to 2004. He rejoined the band once again in 2014.]]
The band recorded their first album, ''[[Bonded by Blood]]'', in the summer of 1984 with the bands manager [[Mark Whitaker (music producer)|Mark Whitaker]] producing. 1984 concert photos from Exodus shows at [[Aquatic Park (Berkeley)|Aquatic Park]]'s Eastern Front Metal Festival (with [[Slayer]] and [[Suicidal Tendencies]]) and [[Bay Area thrash metal#Ruthie's Inn, Berkeley|Ruthie's Inn]] (with [[Megadeth]] and Slayer) were included on the album sleeve inserts. Originally titled ''A Lesson in Violence'', the album was not released until April 1985 amidst creative and business setbacks. Whilst ''Bonded By Blood'' is considered a highly influential [[thrash metal]] album today, critics have regarded the delay in its release as having hindered the impact the album could have had. As Allmusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia would later write in his review for the album: "Had it been released immediately after it was recorded in 1984, Exodus' ''Bonded by Blood'' might be regarded today alongside [[Metallica]]'s ''[[Kill 'Em All]]'' as one of the landmark albums responsible for launching the thrash metal wave."&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|author=Eduardo Rivadavia |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bonded-by-blood-mw0000192933 |title=Bonded by Blood - Exodus &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exodus promoted the album by going on tour with [[Venom (band)|Venom]] and [[Slayer]]. Four songs from their performance of April 5, 1985 at Studio 54 in New York City were filmed and released on home video as ''Combat Tour Live: The Ultimate Revenge''. The band subsequently toured or played selected shows with bands like [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]], [[Megadeth]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[King Diamond (band)|King Diamond]], [[Possessed (band)|Possessed]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Nuclear Assault]] and [[Hirax]].

Shortly after touring for ''Bonded by Blood'' was complete, Paul Baloff was fired from the band allegedly due to his behavior related to alcohol and substance abuse, and was replaced by [[Steve Souza|Steve "Zetro" Souza]], who had previously been the lead vocalist for Legacy, an early incarnation of fellow Bay Area thrashers [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Baloff went on to form the band Piranha in 1987.

Exodus' line-up remained stable for the recording of their next two albums, and the underground success attained with ''Bonded by Blood'' would lead to the group's signing to [[Sony Music|Sony]]/[[Combat Records]], who released the band's second effort ''[[Pleasures of the Flesh]]'' in 1987. The album was engineered by then-unknown [[Sylvia Massy]], who would go on to produce two releases by progressive rock band [[Tool (band)|Tool]]. In support of ''Pleasures of the Flesh'', Exodus toured with the likes of [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Lȧȧz Rockit]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].

''[[Fabulous Disaster]]'', the group's third full-length album, was released in 1989. A [[music video]] for the song "[[The Toxic Waltz (song)|The Toxic Waltz]]" would receive consistent rotation on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |title=The History of American Thrash |publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver.com]] |accessdate=September 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125083043/http://www.revolvermag.com/magazine/article/the-history-of-american-thrash |archivedate=November 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While promoting ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus embarked on the [[Headbangers Ball Tour|Headbangers Ball]] tour with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Helloween]], which brought the band to a wider audience.

After the success of ''Fabulous Disaster'', Exodus signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1989, who released the band's fourth album ''[[Impact is Imminent]]'' the following year. Prior to recording the album, Tom Hunting left the band for personal reasons; he was replaced by [[John Tempesta]] on drums. In 1991, the band released their first live album, ''[[Good Friendly Violent Fun]]'', which was recorded during their 1989 tour.

===''Force of Habit'', hiatus, and temporary reunion (1991–2000)===
[[File:Exodus Rockharz 2018 33.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Jack Gibson joined Exodus in 1997 as bass guitarist and has been with the group ever since.]]

After the release of ''Good Friendly Violent Fun'', the band toured sporadically for a year. Bass guitarist McKillop was replaced by Michael Butler before the group recorded and released their next studio album titled ''[[Force of Habit]]'' in 1992. This album was something of a departure from the band's signature sound, containing several slower, "heavier" songs with less emphasis on the thrash aspect of their older material. The 11-minute song "Architect of Pain" is a good example of the change of direction, having a much slower, grindier feel than the usual high tempo thrash they had become known for. After touring for ''Force of Habit'' was completed, behind-the-scenes issues as well as a changing musical environment prompted the band to split up.

Holt and Hunting formed the groove / thrash metal outfit Wardance in the mid 90's playing several shows around the Bay Area and recording a 4 song demo, but the group never gained momentum and eventually disbanded.

Holt and Hunting reunited with Paul Baloff and Rick Hunolt for a short Exodus tour in 1997. The lineup was completed with Wardance bassist Jack Gibson. They released a live album titled ''[[Another Lesson in Violence]]'' recorded at the [[Trocadero Transfer]] in front of a home town audience. However, the group disbanded again the following year, in part due to a falling out with record label Century Media over the way promotion for the live album was handled, and over an aborted attempt at a live concert video which was filmed but never released due to a financial dispute.

===Second reformation, death of Paul Baloff and ''Tempo of the Damned'' (2001–2004)===
In 2001, Exodus reformed once again with the 1997 lineup, initially to play the [[Chuck Billy (vocalist)|Chuck Billy]] benefit [[Thrash of the Titans]] concert. There was talk of recording a new studio album and the band continued to play shows in and around the San Francisco Bay Area.

However, on February 2, 2002, Paul Baloff died after suffering a stroke. Former vocalist Steve Souza was brought back into the band to finish the rest of their concert commitments. Although it appeared to outsiders that with Baloff's death Exodus would cease to exist, guitarist Gary Holt was determined to release a new studio album. The result was 2004's ''[[Tempo of the Damned]]'' released on [[Nuclear Blast Records]]. An oddity of the recording sessions was that one track, "Crime of the Century", was dropped under mysterious circumstances. The song chronicled Exodus's time under Century Media (of which Nuclear Blast is a subsidiary). Although it was publicly denied, rumors swirled that Century Media forced the song off the record. "Crime of the Century" was replaced with "Impaler", a song which was written when Kirk Hammett was still in the band, and was previously featured on the ''Another Lesson in Violence'' live record.

===Feud with Steve Souza, new members and ''Shovel Headed Kill Machine'' (2004–2006)===
[[File:Rob Dukes, Exodus 5.jpg|thumb|left|Vocalist [[Rob Dukes]] was one of three new members to join Exodus in 2005. He was part of the band until 2014.]]
Steve Souza once again left the band due to business and personal differences in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/singer-zetro-souza-quits-exodus-again/ |title=Singer Zetro Souza Quits Exodus (Again) |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 13, 2004 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a feud between himself and Gary Holt, who subsequently issued a statement in which he was heavily critical of Souza, claiming he had suddenly left the band while on tour only a day before they were due to leave for a show in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exodus-guitarist-fat-ass-zetro-souza-is-human-crap/ |title=Exodus Guitarist: 'Fat Ass' Zetro Souza Is 'Human Crap' |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=September 13, 2004 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Exhumed (band)|Exhumed]] frontman Matt Harvey filled in for the Mexico City date&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXHUMED Frontman Says Singing For EXODUS In Mexico Was An 'Honor'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exhumed-frontman-says-singing-for-exodus-in-mexico-was-an-honor/|website=Blabbermouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Steev Esquivel (ex-[[Defiance (band)|Defiance]] and [[Skinlab]]) played on the fall South American dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SKINLAB Singer To Front EXODUS On Rescheduled South American Tour|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/skinlab-singer-to-front-exodus-on-rescheduled-south-american-tour/|website=Blabbermouth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band eventually found a permanent replacement in Rob Dukes.

In 2005, Rick Hunolt left the band to focus on his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/exodus-confirm-guitarist-rick-hunolt-s-departure/ |title=Exodus Confirm Guitarist Rick Hunolt's Departure |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=August 4, 2005 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]] guitarist [[Lee Altus]]. Tom Hunting also took leave of the band following a re-occurrence of the nervous problems that led to his temporary departure in 1989. Hunting was replaced with [[Paul Bostaph]] who had previously played with [[Slayer]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. The revamped line up released the album ''[[Shovel Headed Kill Machine]]'' in 2005. The tour for the album led to extensive travel of the US, Europe, and Japan, as well as their first-ever visit to Australia.

===Reunion with Tom Hunting and the ''Exhibit'' albums (2007–2013)===
Tom Hunting returned to the band in March 2007 in time to record and release their 8th studio album ''[[The Atrocity Exhibition... Exhibit A]]''. They performed at the [[Wacken Open Air]] Festival in the summer of 2008. In April 2009, Exodus embarked on a co-headlining North American tour with [[Kreator]] and also featuring [[Belphegor (band)|Belphegor]], [[Warbringer]], and Epicurean. Exodus then went on tour supporting [[Arch Enemy]] along with [[Arsis]] and [[Mutiny Within]].

Exodus provided the voices of the customers at the Duncan Hills Coffee Shop and five of the sick people in [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[Metalocalypse]]''.

Exodus released a re-recording of their 1985 debut album ''Bonded by Blood'' entitled ''[[Let There Be Blood]]'' in 2008. Gary Holt released the following statement about the band's decision to revisit their debut album: "After many years in the planning and discussion stage, we have finally completed the re-recording of 'Bonded By Blood'. We have decided to call it 'Let There Be Blood' and it is our way of paying homage to [late singer] Paul Baloff by showing how relevant these songs we had written together still are. We aren't trying to replace the original; that's impossible anyway. We are just giving these songs the benefit of modern production. It's something we talked about before Paul's death and it's always been important to us to do. We were super excited about entering the studio once again to record these classics, and now it's back to writing the next studio record!"{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The album ''[[Exhibit B: The Human Condition]]'' was recorded in northern California with British producer Andy Sneap ([[Megadeth]], [[Arch Enemy]], [[Kreator]]) and released on Nuclear Blast Records in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134987 |title=Exodus: New Album Pushed Back To May - Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=February 12, 2010 |accessdate=March 28, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063706/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=134987 |archivedate=June 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced in January 2010 that Exodus was to be on [[Megadeth]]'s ''[[Rust in Peace]]'' 20th Anniversary tour along with [[Testament (band)|Testament]].

Exodus co-headlined with [[Kreator]], Suicidal Angels and [[Death Angel]] on the Thrashfest tour in late 2010 and were one of the headlining bands at Wacken Open Air 2011.

Exodus toured with [[Rob Zombie]] and Slayer in 2011 on their Hell on Earth tour as the opening act. Gary Holt filled in for Slayer guitarist [[Jeff Hanneman]] during the tour after Hanneman contracted [[necrotizing fasciitis]] caused by a spider bite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=154594 |title=Slayer With Exodus Guitarist Gary Holt: First Video Footage From Soundwave Kick Off Show - Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=March 28, 2016 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt filled in for Hanneman again on Slayer's next tour in the summer of 2012.

Exodus has been credited as one of the pioneers of the [[thrash metal]] genre, which achieved mainstream popularity in the 1980s and early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenplec.com/live-reviews/exodus-in-the-button-factory-review/|title=Exodus in the Button Factory - Review • Live Review|publisher=goldenplec.com|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-steve-zetro-souza-of-exodus/|title=Interview - Steve "Zetro" Souza of Exodus|publisher=crypticrock.com|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtownmagazinenyc.com/exodus-singer-steve-zetro-souza-talks-playstation-theater-shows-with-king-diamond-next-album-disney-and-more/|title=Exodus singer Steve "Zetro" Souza talks Playstation Theater shows with King Diamond, next album, Disney and more|publisher=downtownmagazinenyc.com|date=November 12, 2015|accessdate=January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fullinbloommusic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullinbloommusic.com/overkill-biography-dd-verni-blitz-ellsworth.html|title=Exodus - Biography - Bonded by Blood - Gary Holt - Paul Baloff - Kirk Hammett|website=fullinbloommusic.com|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is often credited as the first [[Bay Area thrash metal]] band to exist,&lt;ref name="fullinbloommusic.com"/&gt; predating [[Metallica]], who were originally from Los Angeles.

Exodus' main influences include [[AC/DC]], [[Angel Witch]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Deep Purple]], [[Diamond Head (band)|Diamond Head]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Motörhead]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], [[Ted Nugent]], [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[Sweet Savage]], [[Thin Lizzy]], [[Tygers of Pan Tang]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]], [[Van Halen]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getreadytorock.com/pure_metal/exodus.htm|title=Interview with Tom Hunting and Gary Holt of Thrash metal rock band Exodus|publisher=Get Ready to ROCK!|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-zetro-souza-bands-don-t-survive-off-record-sales-anymore/|title=Steve 'Zetro' Souza: Bands Don't Survive Off Record Sales Anymore|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 8, 2012|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loudwire|Loudwire.com]] placed Exodus at number five on its list of the 10 Best Thrash Bands of All Time, calling them "The original kings of the Bay Area thrash scene", and saying that "While their uncompromising sound and uneven output in the coming decades kept world domination and platinum success ever at bay, you'd be hard passed to finger any other band, short of Slayer, perhaps, that's flown the thrash flag as proudly and unwaveringly as Exodus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/best-thrash-metal-bands/|title=10 Best Thrash Metal Bands of All Time|publisher=[[Loudwire|Loudwire.com]]|date=August 15, 2013|accessdate=January 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been debated whether or not Exodus belongs in the "Big Five" of thrash metal with [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], due to their involvement with the early 1980s thrash metal scene. [[VH1]] stated, "Much is made of Thrash's Big Four: Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. True devotees know, however, that Big Five is the actual proper figure and that Exodus is the band that completes the quintet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/25827/10-greatest-thrash-metal-debut-albums/|title=10 Greatest Thrash Metal Debut Albums Of All Time|publisher=[[VH1|VH1.com]]|date=June 11, 2015|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthrax guitarist [[Scott Ian]] also stated that, "People talk about the 'Big Four' all the time, but back then it was really the 'Big Five' because Exodus were just as important and just as influential as everybody else." Megadeth founder [[Dave Mustaine]] said in a 1990 interview that the "Big Four" were Exodus, Slayer, Metallica and Megadeth, adding that "Exodus are a much better band – I really like Exodus. [[Gary Holt (musician)|Gary Holt]] and [[Rick Hunolt]] are really great guitar players. I like Scott Ian, but anyone else in that band kind of bores me. Having a disco thing is not what I think having a metal band is all about, and that guy had the audacity to say that he and I should together! I felt like saying what are you planning to do? Open a disco fashion shop?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl/articles_hotmetal1990.html|title=The Big Four|publisher=megadeth.rockmetal.art.pl|date=September 1990|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Ian and Mustaine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/anthrax-guitarist-says-expanded-big-four-should-include-exodus/|title=Anthrax Guitarist Says Expanded 'Big Four' Should Include Exodus|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 18, 2012|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-mustaine-says-exodus-would-have-been-most-qualified-candidate-for-expanded-big-four-2/|title=Dave Mustaine Says Exodus Would Have Been Most Qualified Candidate For Expanded 'Big Four'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 6, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holt has agreed that Exodus should be included in the "Big Five" of thrash metal because they "were there at the start of thrash metal with Metallica in the real early '80s.

It's not the truth. There's them, and Overkill, Testament and Exodus. You could also talk about [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], if you want to get down to it. It doesn't bother me — I'm content where I'm at."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/steve-zetro-souza-isnt-bothered-by-exodus-not-being-part-of-big-four-it-doesnt-really-matter-to-me/|title=STEVE 'ZETRO' SOUZA Isn't Bothered By EXODUS Not Being Part Of 'Big Four': 'It Doesn't Really Matter To Me'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 5, 2017|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television and radio==
Before becoming a comedian Martinez appeared in the [[BBC]] children's drama series ''[[Grange Hill]]'' from 1994–1998, and has acted in other drama series such as ''[[Holby City]]''.

In August 2005 she appeared in the BBC sitcom ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Extras episodes#Series 1 .282005.29]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008 Martinez made global headlines when (live on [[Channel 4 News]]) she became the first [[Olympic torch]] bearer to pull out of the London relay in protest over China's treatment of Tibet.

In April 2009 she appeared on the [[BBC Radio 4]] stand-up comedy show, [[4 Stands Up]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f4ptw |title=BBC Radio 4 – 4 Stands Up |publisher=BBC |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012 she made her debut appearance on BBC Radio 4's topical panel show ''[[The News Quiz]]'', alongside regulars [[Jeremy Hardy]] and [[Sandi Toksvig]]. She appeared on ''The News Quiz'' again in January and July 2013.

Martinez has become a regular face on television, including appearances on ''[[The Frank Skinner Show]],'' in [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]]'s comedy series ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', ''[[Russell Howard's Good News]]'' [[BBC Three]], [[The Jonathan Ross Show]], ITV's [[Loose Women]], ''[[Free Speech]]'' BBC3, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]]'s ''[[The Saturday Night Show]]'' with [[Brendan O'Connor (media personality)|Brendan O'Connor]], ''[[Adam Hills Tonight]]'' and ''Spicks &amp; Specks''.

==Campaigner==
On 8 December 2012, Martinez launched a campaign ''War on Welfare''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |title=Martinez brings star quality to fresh assault on coalition's 'war on welfare' – Disability in the News |publisher=The Fed Online |accessdate=21 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204013255/http://www.thefedonline.org.uk/disability-in-the-news/martinez-brings-star-quality-to-fresh-assault-on-coalition-s-war-on-welfare |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which pledged to get 100,000 supporters to sign a petition calling for an end to government cuts for [[disability benefits]] and an independent impact assessment of the government's welfare changes. The petition attracted 5,000 signatures in the first 48 hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/17717 |title=Welfare petition aims for ten thousand backers by New Year's Day |publisher=Ekklesia |accessdate=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved its target of 100,000 supporters on 30 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/war-welfare-petition-100000-sign-2870513|title=100,000 sign War on Welfare petition asking for assessment of cuts to the sick and disabled|first=Steve|last=Robson|date=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An outspoken opponent of welfare reform by the government, she uses her public profile to raise issues about disability and fight for a fairer system. Martinez said: "As a disabled person in the media, I want to help give this issue a voice. It's morally wrong for the government to target those in need instead of saving money by targeting the real causes of this crisis – and close tax loopholes and regulate the financial sector. To me, it's a human rights issue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|title=Disability Information Scotland|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130423211500/http://www.update.org.uk/news-detail.php?page=563|archivedate=23 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is patron of a number of charities.&lt;ref name=Personally&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.personallyspeakingbureau.com/speaker/francesca-martinez/ |title=Francesca Martinez – Personally Speaking Bureau|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CAF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team/|title=Our Team – Contact a Family|accessdate=16 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604052159/http://www.cafamily.org.uk/what-we-do/our-team|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has challenged the government in numerous TV interviews, including on ''[[Newsnight]]'' and ''[[This Week (BBC TV series)|This Week]]''.

Martinez has become a respected social commentator, speaking at meetings and demos across the UK, as well as being a key part of the People's Assembly Against Austerity.

In 2015 she helped organise [[This Changes Everything (book)|This Changes Everything]], a one-day event on climate and social justice, with [[Naomi Klein]], [[Russell Brand]], and many other speakers. The event was streamed globally and aimed to kick-start a movement to unify the left against climate change.

In 2013 she was nominated for a Women in Public Life Award, and won the Public Affairs Achiever of the Year Award. In April 2014 she was named as one of Britain's most influential women in the BBC Woman's Hour power list 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woman's Hour Power List 2014 – Game Changers|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03zy4m5/profiles|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also nominated for Red Magazine's Woman of the Year Award 2014 and for a European Diversity Hero of the Year Award 2014.

In July 2015, Martinez endorsed [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2015|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="newstatesman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bush|first=Stephen|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/07/25-campaign-groups-and-activists-back-jeremy-corbyn-labour-leader|title=25 campaign groups and activists back Jeremy Corbyn for Labour leader|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=29 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, along with numerous other celebrities, she toured the UK to support Corbyn's bid to become [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref name="jc4pmtour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jc4pmtour.com/|title=#JC4PM|publisher=jc4pmtour|date=28 July 2015|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilkinson|first=Michael|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12134051/Celebrities-to-tour-Britain-in-Jeremy-Corbyn-For-Prime-Minister-musical-show.html|title=Celebrities to tour Britain in 'Jeremy Corbyn For Prime Minister' musical show|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=1 February 2016|accessdate=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, she performed at the Keep Corbyn rally in Brighton in support of [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s [[Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party leadership campaign, 2016|campaign]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Labour Party leadership election]].&lt;ref name="doncasterfreepress"&gt;{{cite news |last=Burke|first=Darren|url=https://www.doncasterfreepress.co.uk/news/tv-star-comedians-line-up-for-jeremy-corbyn-rally-in-doncaster-1-8090226|title=TV star comedians line up for Jeremy Corbyn rally in Doncaster|work= |location=Doncaster|publisher=''[[Doncaster Free Press]]''|date=26 August 2016|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gowers Review of Intellectual Property''' was an independent review of UK [[intellectual property]] (IP) focusing on [[copyright law of the United Kingdom|UK copyright law]] that was published in December 2006. The then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Gordon Brown]] commissioned [[Andrew Gowers]] to lead the review in December 2005. The Review was published on 6 December 2006 as part of the Chancellor's annual pre-budget report. The review concludes that the UK's intellectual property system is fundamentally strong but made 54 recommendations for improvements.

== Recommendations ==

=== Instruments - Balance ===
* 1 - "Amend section 60(5) of the [[Patents Act 1977]] to clarify the research exception to facilitate experimentation, innovation and education"
* 2 - "Enable educational provisions to cover [[distance learning]] and [[interactive whiteboards]] by 2008 by amending sections 35 and 36 of the [[Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988]]"
* 3 - "The [[European Commission]] should retain the length of protection on sound recordings and performers’ rights at 50 years"
* 4 - "Policy makers should adopt the principle that the term and scope of protection for IP rights should not be altered retrospectively"&lt;ref name="official-documents6"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Andrew| first = Gowers| title = Gowers Review of Intellectual Property| publisher = HM Treasury| date = December 2006   | page =6 | url = http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/0118404830/0118404830.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instruments - Coherence ===
* 5 - The Patent Office "should undertake joint working with African patent offices from mid-2007, with the aim of:
** helping them to take advantage of the flexibilities currently existing in the WTO/TRIPS architecture where appropriate; and
** encouraging them to make positive use of IP rights through dissemination of information in patents"
* 6 - "Encourage the international community under the auspices of the WTO to review the TRIPS status of the least developed countries prior to 2016 and consider whether further extension for reaching TRIPS compliance would be appropriate"
* 7 - "Government should encourage WTO members to ratify the amendments to TRIPS to make importation of drugs easier and cheaper"&lt;ref name="official-documents6"/&gt;

=== Instruments - Flexibility ===
* 8 - "Introduce a limited [[private copying]] exception by 2008 for [[format-shifting]] for works published after the date that the law comes into effect. There should be no accompanying [[Tax|levies]] for consumers"
* 9 - "Allow private copying for research to cover all forms of content. This relates to the copying, not the distribution, of media"
* 10a - "Amend s.42 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 by 2008 to permit libraries to copy the master copy of all classes of work in permanent collection for archival purposes and to allow further copies to be made from the archived copy to mitigate against subsequent wear and tear"
* 10b - "Enable libraries to [[format-shift]] archival copies by 2008 to ensure records do not become obsolete"
* 11 - "Propose that [[Directive 2001/29/EC]] be amended to allow for an exception for creative, transformative or derivative works, within the parameters of the [[Berne Three Step Test]]."
* 12 - "Create an exception to copyright for the purpose of caricature, parody or pastiche by 2008"

== Private copying ==
The review coincided with a 2006 survey carried out on behalf of the National Consumer Council, which indicated that over half of British adults infringe copyright law by duplicating and [[ripping]] music CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=National Consumer Council |date=2006-05-11 |title=Shake-up 'absurd' copyright laws, says NCC |url=http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003200223/http://www.ncc.org.uk/news_press/pr.php?recordID=271 |archivedate=2007-10-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the review, in January 2008 the government initiated a public consultation period on proposals to legalise personal copying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7176538.stm|title=Copying CDs could be made legal|date=2008-01-08|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright terms extension ==
On November 27, 2006, it was reported that Gowers would not recommend for the [[copyright term]] of recorded music to be extended from the current 50 years after the date of recording. The [[British Phonographic Industry]] and prominent musicians, such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]], had lobbied for an extension to 95 years, matching the length of copyright provided in the United States; other musicians, such as [[Dave Rowntree]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] provided counteropinions. The Gowers Review found that the UK, compared with the USA, suffers no apparent impediment to creativity due to this disparity. To coincide with the publication of the review on the 6 December a full-page advertisement entitled [[Fair play for musicians]], was taken in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' of December 7, stating "We call upon the UK Government to support the extension of copyright on sound recordings", and was signed by over 4,500 musicians, including a few dead ones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lessig.org/blog/against_term_extension/ Lessig Blog: Ok, so I'm wrong]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussions==
Richard Sargeant, a civil servant who wrote large amounts of the Review,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/23/europe_music_copyright_term/ The Register: EU votes for longer music copyright]&lt;/ref&gt; was later hired by [[Google]]. In January 2009, as Google's "public policy manager", he called for reforms to incorporate exemptions similar to the United States' [[fair use]] doctrine into UK and Europe copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/jan/22/google-calls-for-uk-copyright-reforms The Guardian: Google calls for UK copyright reforms]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High-level design''' (HLD) explains the architecture that would be used for developing a software product. The architecture diagram provides an overview of an entire system, identifying the main components that would be developed for the product and their interfaces.
The HLD uses possibly nontechnical to mildly technical terms that should be understandable to the administrators of the system. In contrast, [[low-level design]] further exposes the logical detailed design of each of these elements for programmers.

== Purpose ==
* Preliminary design—In the preliminary stages of a software development, the need is to size the project and to identify those parts of the project that might be risky or time consuming.
* Design overview—As the project proceeds, the need is to provide an overview of how the various sub-systems and components of the system fit together.

In both cases the high-level design should be a complete view of the entire system, breaking it down into smaller parts that are more easily understood. To minimize the maintenance overhead as construction proceeds and the lower-level design is done, it is best that the high-level design is elaborated only to the degree needed to satisfy these needs.

== High-level design document ==
A high-level design document or HLDD adds the necessary details to the current project description to represent a suitable model for coding. This document includes a high-level architecture diagram depicting the structure of the system, such as the database
architecture, application architecture (layers), application flow (navigation), security architecture and technology architecture.&lt;ref&gt;https://people.ok.ubc.ca/rlawrenc/research/Students/CJ_05_Design.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design overview ==
A high-level design provides an overview of a system, product, service or process.

Such an overview helps supporting components be compatible to others.

The highest-level design should briefly describe all platforms, systems, products, services and processes that it depends on and include any important changes that need to be made to them.

In addition, there should be brief consideration of all significant commercial, legal, environmental, security, safety and technical risks, issues and assumptions.

The idea is to mention every work area briefly, clearly delegating the ownership of more detailed design activity whilst also encouraging effective collaboration between the various project teams.

Today, most high-level designs require contributions from a number of experts, representing many distinct professional disciplines.

Finally, every type of end-user should be identified in the high-level design and each contributing design should give due consideration to customer experience.

The '''history of erotic depictions''' includes [[painting]]s, [[sculpture]], [[photograph]]s, [[drama|dramatic arts]], [[music]] and [[writing]]s that show scenes of a [[human sexuality|sexual]] nature throughout time. They have been created by nearly every civilization, ancient and modern. Early cultures often associated the sexual act with supernatural forces and thus their religion is intertwined with such depictions. In Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan and China, representations of sex and [[erotic art]] have specific spiritual meanings within native religions. The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] produced much art and decoration of an erotic nature, much of it integrated with their religious beliefs and cultural practices.&lt;ref name = east&gt;{{cite book| last = Rawson| first = Phillip S.| title = Erotic art of the east; the sexual theme in oriental painting and sculpture| publisher = Putnam| year = 1968| location = New York| id = {{LCC|N7260.R35}}| page = 380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = romans&gt;{{cite book| last = Clarke| first = John R.| title = Roman Sex: 100 B.C. to A.D. 250| publisher = Harry N. Abrams| date = April 2003| location = New York| isbn = 0-8109-4263-1| page = 168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent times, as communication technologies evolved, each new technique, such as [[printing]], [[photography]], [[film|motion pictures]] and [[computer]]s, has been adapted to display and disseminate these depictions.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, [[Dean Kuipers]] (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes through history==
In early times, erotic depictions were often a subset of the indigenous or religious art of cultures and as such were not set aside or treated differently than any other type. The modern concept of [[pornography]] did not exist until the [[Victorian era]]. Its current definition was added in the 1860s, replacing the older one meaning writings about [[prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name = pleasures&gt;{{cite book| last = Sigel| first = Lisa| title = Governing Pleasures. Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2002| isbn = 0-8135-3001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in an English medical dictionary in 1857 defined as "a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robley Dunglison|Dunglison, Robley]] (1857). ''Medical lexicon. A dictionary of medical science'', 1857 edition, s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-d2.html#dunglison "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1864, the first version of the modern definition had appeared in [[Webster's Dictionary]]: "licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to [[bacchanalia]]n orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii."&lt;ref&gt;''An American dictionary of the English language'', new and revised edition (1864), s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-w.html#webster "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of what today refers to explicit pictures in general. Though some specific sex acts were regulated or prohibited by earlier laws, merely looking at objects or images depicting them was not outlawed in any country until 1857. In some cases, the possession of certain books, engravings or image collections was outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that actually restricted viewing sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

When large-scale [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] of [[Pompeii]] were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the [[Roman Empire]]. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in [[Naples]], and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the [[Obscene Publications Act]] of 1857.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.&lt;ref name = libido7&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: Victorian Obsessions and Fin-de-Siècle Predilections| work = Libido, The Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date = May 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn07.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography has existed throughout recorded history and has adapted to each new medium, including photography, cinema, video, and computers and the internet.

The first instances of modern pornography date back to the sixteenth century when sexually explicit images differentiated itself from traditional sexual representations in European art by combining the traditionally explicit representation of sex and the moral norms of those times.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The first amendment prohibits the U.S. government from restricting speech based on its content. Indecent speech is protected and may be regulated, but not banned. Obscenity is the judicially recognized exception to the first amendment. Historically, this exception was used in an attempt to ban information about sex education, studies on nudism, and sexually explicit literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=Debbie-Anne|last2=Kyle|first2=Deva A.|date= Fall 2002|title=Obscenity and Pornography|journal=Georgetown Journal of Gender and The Law|volume=4|issue=1|pages=137–168|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/grggenl4&amp;div=3&amp;id=&amp;page=|subscription=yes|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s in the United States, attempts were made to shut down the pornography industry by prosecuting individuals on prostitution charges. In the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]'', the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] ruled to distinguish prostitution as an individual taking part in sexual activities in exchange for money versus an individual who is portraying a sexual act on-screen as part of their acting performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/488/1311.html|website = Findlaw|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Porn In The U.S.A.|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/porn-in-the-usa-21-11-2003|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early depictions==
[[File:VenusWillendorf.jpg|thumb|The [[Venus of Willendorf]], a figurine with exaggerated [[sexual characteristics]]]][[File:Vulve stylisée.JPG|thumb|A prehistoric [[petroglyph]] of a [[vulva]]]]

===Palaeolithic and mesolithic===
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s and carvings. Some of the more common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human [[genitalia]]. Nude human beings with exaggerated sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. [[Venus figurines]]). Recently discovered cave art at [[Creswell Crags]] in England, thought to be more than 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia.

===Greek and Roman===
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] often painted sexual scenes on their [[ceramic art|ceramics]], many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of [[homosexuality|same-sex relations]] and [[pederasty]]. Greek art often portrays sexual activity, but it is impossible to distinguish between what to them was illegal or immoral since the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of pornography. Their art simply reflects scenes from daily life, some more sexual than others. Carved [[phallus|phalli]] can be seen in places of worship such as the temple of [[Dionysus]] on [[Delos]], while a common household item and protective charm was the [[herma|herm]], a statue consisting of a head on a square plinth with a prominent phallus on the front. The Greek male ideal had a small penis, an aesthetic the Romans later adopted.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Herm of Dionysos| publisher = The Getty Museum, J.Paul Getty Trust| url = http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=9917| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams | first = Cecil| title = Why does so much ancient Greek art feature males with small genitalia?| work = The Straight Dope| publisher = Chicago Reader| date = 9 December 2005| url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/051209.html| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also created the first well-known instance of [[lesbianism in erotica|lesbian eroticism]] in the West, with [[Sappho]]'s ''Hymn to Aphrodite'' and other [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Williamson | first =Margaret| title =Sappho's Immortal Daughters| publisher =Harvard University Press| year =1995| location = Cambridge, MA| isbn =  0-674-78912-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury god.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Priapus]] figure from Pompeii. Large phalli were considered undesirable for men to possess and often depicted for comic effect in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history/&gt;]]

There are numerous sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Pompeii and Herculaneum]] but the original purposes of the depictions can vary. On one hand, in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], there is a ritual flagellation scene that is clearly associated with a religious cult and this image can be seen as having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the [[Warren Cup]]. Sex acts that were considered [[taboo]] (such as those that defiled the purity of the mouth) were depicted in [[thermae|baths]] for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a [[marble]] statue showing the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] having sex with a [[goat]], a detailed depiction of [[bestiality]] considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the [[Secret Museum, Naples]].&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hemingway | first = Seán| title = Roman Erotic Art| journal = Sculpture Review| volume = 53| issue = 4| pages = 10–15| publisher = National Sculpture Society| date = Winter 2004| url = http://www.sculpturereview.com/| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peruvian===
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their [[pottery]]. At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is [[anal sex]], with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare.  Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often, an infant is depicted [[breastfeeding]] while the couple has sex. [[Fellatio]] is sometimes represented, but [[cunnilingus]] is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] speculates that their purpose was much different than that of other early cultures. He states that the Moche believed that the world of the dead was the exact opposite of the world of the living. Therefore, for [[funeral]] offerings, they made [[wiktionary:vessel|vessels]] showing sex acts such as [[masturbation]], [[fellatio]] and [[anal sex]] that would not result in offspring. The hope was that in the world of the dead, they would take on their opposite meaning and result in fertility. The erotic pottery of the Moche is depicted in Hoyle's book ''Checan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/6/4/399 book-review (In ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', Vol. 6, 1966) of ''Checan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indiaerotic1.jpg|right|thumb|Prince and his lady on a terrace at night (India)]]

There has been a long tradition of erotic painting in the East. [[History of India|India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and other lands produced copious quantities of art celebrating the human faculty of love. The works depict love between men and women as well as same-sex love. One of the most famous ancient [[sex manual]]s was the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', written by [[Vātsyāyana]] in India during the first few centuries [[Common Era|CE]]. Another notable treatise on human sexuality is [[The Perfumed Garden]] by the Tunisian Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, dating to the fifteenth century.

In Japan, the erotic art found its greatest flowering in the medium of the [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]]. The style is known as {{nihongo|''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]''|春画|spring pictures}} and some of its classic practitioners (e.g. [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]]) produced a large number of works. Painted hand scrolls were also very popular. Shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity despite occasional attempts to suppress them, the first of which was a ban on erotic books known as {{nihongo|''kōshokubon''| 好色本}} issued by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Kyōhō]] 7 (1722).  Shunga only ceased to be produced in the 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| last = Parent| first = Mary N, PhD| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese Architecture and Art net users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese tradition of the erotic was also extensive, with examples of the art dating back as far as the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368). The erotic art of China reached its peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = dreams&gt;{{cite book| last = Bertholet| first = L.C.P.| title = Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China: From the Bertholet Collection| publisher = Pepin Press| date = October 1997| isbn = 90-5496-039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both China and Japan, eroticism played a prominent role in the development of the novel. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the work by an [[Heian period|11th-century Japanese]] noblewoman that is often called "the world's first novel," traces the many affairs of its hero in discreet but carnal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Puette | first =William J.| title =The Tale of Genji: A Reader's Guide | publisher =Tuttle Publishing| year =2004| isbn =  0-8048-3331-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Ming Dynasty|16th-century China]], the still more explicit novel ''[[The Plum in the Golden Vase]]'' has been called one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels|four great classical novels]] of Chinese literature. ''The Tale of Genji'' has been celebrated in Japan since it was written, but  ''The Plum in the Golden Vase'' was suppressed as pornography for much of its history, and replaced on the list of four classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Roy | first =David Tod| title = The Plum in the Golden Vase or, Chin P'ing Mei : The Gathering, Volume I | publisher = Princeton University Press | year =1993| isbn =  0-691-06932-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European===
Erotic scenes in [[medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s also appeared, but were seen only by those who could afford the extremely expensive hand-made books. Most of these drawings occur in the [[wiktionary:margin|margins]] of [[book of hours|books of hours]]. Many medieval scholars think that the pictures satisfied the medieval cravings for both erotic pictures and religion in one book, especially since it was often the only book someone owned. Other scholars think the drawings in the margins were a kind of moral caution, but the depiction of priests and other ranking officials engaged in sex acts suggests political origins as well.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

It was not until the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] that sexually explicit images entered into any type of mass circulation in the western world. Before that time, erotic images, being hand made and expensive, were limited to upper class males. Even the [[British Museum]] had a [[Secretum (room)|Secretum]] filled with a collection of ancient [[erotica]] donated by the upper class doctor, [[George Witt (collector)|George Witt]] in 1865. The remains of the collection, including his scrapbooks, still reside in Cupboard 55, though the majority of it has recently been integrated with the museum's other collections.&lt;ref name = rude&gt;{{cite journal| last = Giamster| first = David| title = Sex and Sensibility at the British Museum| journal = History Today| volume = 50| issue = 9| pages = 10–15| publisher = History Today| date = September 2000| url = http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=10989&amp;amid=10989| accessdate = 2006-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old master print|Prints]] became very popular in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very suitable for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display.  Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the [[engraving]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]] in particular.  An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an ''Allegory of Copulation'' where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench.  Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levinson| first = Jay A.

The loves of classical gods, especially those of [[Jupiter]] detailed in [[Ovid]] provided many subjects where actual sex was the key moment in the story, and its depiction was felt to be justified.  In particular [[Leda and the Swan]], where the god appeared as a [[swan]] and seduced the woman, was depicted very explicitly; it seems that this—rather strangely—was considered more acceptable because he appeared as a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bull |first = Malcolm | title = The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = February 21, 2005| location = USA |isbn = 978-0-19-521923-4 |page = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- (Commented out until referenced) Nonetheless, the most famous painted depictions of the subject, by [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were apparently later destroyed by the French royal family, and a further version by [[Correggio]] was attacked by a cousin of the King in a fit of depression.--&gt; For a period ending in the early 16th century the boundaries of what could be depicted in for display in the semi-privacy of a Renaissance palace seemed uncertain.  Michelangelo's ''Leda'' was a fairly large painting showing sex in progress, and one of the hundreds of illustrations to the book the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of 1499 shows Leda and the Swan having sex on top of a [[Royal entry#Classical influence|triumphal car]] watched by a crowd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lefaivre| first = Liane| title = Leon Battista Alberti's 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili': re-cognizing the architectural body in the early Italian Renaissance| publisher = MIT Press| date = April 1, 2005| location = Cambridge, Mass.| url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10496| isbn = 978-0-262-62195-3| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071122064432/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=10496| archivedate = November 22, 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- (commented out until referenced, also no value judgments please! The hard to imagine statement is OR) It is hard to imagine equivalently prominent works outside the specialized genre of erotica from about 1530 until the 19th century.  After the early fifteenth century both large paintings for palaces, and small prints for collectors, cease to show either actual sex or explicit female pudenda.  The pattern for female nudes was set by the [[Dresden Venus]] of [[Giorgione]] (ca. 1510), where a reclining female nude is shown frontally, but not explicitly, and by herself.  [[Titian]] and others largely continued this pattern, and the [[Rokeby Venus]] by [[Velázquez]] (1640s) provides a rear-view version.  The [[Little Masters]] in Germany produced many very small prints - often just two inches tall - of erotic subjects, for middle-class collectors, but were not as explicit as the artists of thirty years before.--&gt;

In the 16th century an attempt to print erotic material caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] published ''[[I Modi]]'' in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 "postures" or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the [[Pope Clement VII]] and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the [[engraving]]s on a series of erotic paintings that [[Giulio Romano]] was doing as a commission for the [[Palazzo del Te]] in [[Mantua]]. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until [[Pietro Aretino]] came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit [[sonnet]]s ("both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful")&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = Imodi&gt;{{cite book| last = Lawner| first = Lynne, ed.| title = I Modi; the sixteen pleasures: an erotic album of the Italian Renaissance| publisher = Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston| year = 1989| isbn = 0-8101-0803-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison.  ''I Modi'' was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems and the pictures, making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imodi"/&gt;

In the 17th century, numerous examples of pornographic or erotic literature began to circulate. These included ''L'Ecole des Filles'', a French work printed in 1655 that is considered to be the beginning of pornography in [[France]]. It consists of an illustrated dialogue between two women, a 16-year-old and her more worldly cousin, and their explicit discussions about sex.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], many of the French free-thinkers began to exploit pornography as a medium of social criticism and [[satire]]. [[Libertine]] pornography was a subversive social commentary and often targeted the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and general attitudes of [[sexual repression]]. The market for the mass-produced, inexpensive pamphlets soon became the bourgeoisie, making the upper class worry, as in England, that the morals of the lower class and weak-minded would be corrupted since women, slaves and the uneducated were seen as especially vulnerable during that time. The stories and illustrations (sold in the galleries of the [[Palais Royal]], along with the services of prostitutes) were often [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and full of misbehaving priests, monks and nuns, a tradition that in French pornography continued into the 20th century. In the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]], pornography was also used as political commentary; [[Marie Antoinette]] was often targeted with fantasies involving orgies, lesbian activities and the paternity of her children, and rumours circulated about the supposed sexual inadequacies of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].&lt;ref name = libido2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = libido4&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: the French Revolution and the spread of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated pornography| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date=February 2003 |url=http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn04.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the Revolution, the famous works of the [[Marquis de Sade]] were printed.

The English answer to this was ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (later abridged and renamed ''[[Fanny Hill]]'') written in 1748 by [[John Cleland]]. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term [[penis]]. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the [[Bishop of London]] and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but ''Fanny Hill'' continued to be published and is one of the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.&lt;ref name = libido3&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: England bites back with Fanny Hill| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc| date = January 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn03.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the first practical process of [[photography]] to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name = timeline&gt;{{cite web| last = Cross| first = J.M., PhD| title = Nineteenth-Century Photography: A Timeline| work = the Victorian Web| publisher = The University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore| date = 2001-02-04| url = http://victorianweb.org/photos/chron.html | accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier photographic methods, his [[daguerreotype]]s had stunning quality and detail and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, an académie was a [[depictions of nudity|nude]] study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; [[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.—Part the First.

This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

In 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.&lt;ref name = glasgow&gt;{{cite web| last = Schaaf| first = Larry| title = The Calotype Process| publisher = Glasgow University Library| year = 1999| url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html| accessdate = 2006-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. Also, the reduction in exposure time made a true mass market for pornographic pictures possible. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them profited by selling illicit pornography to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

The Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers took advantage of the [[postal system]] to send out photographic cards in plain wrappings to their subscribers. Therefore, the development of a reliable international postal system facilitated the beginnings of the pornography trade. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was used to ostensibly study the human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as "[[French postcard]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hZHAAAAMAAJ|first=Philip|last=Herbst|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=1997|isbn=9781877864971|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
{{details|Pornographic magazine}}

During the Victorian period, illegal pornographic periodicals such as ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880, circulated clandestinely among circles of elite urban gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/652322 "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad,"] ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[halftone]] printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time.&lt;ref name = timeline /&gt; The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, [[woodcut]]s and line cuts for illustrations.&lt;ref name = halftone&gt;{{cite web| last = St. John| first = Kristen|author2=Linda Zimmerman| title = Guided Tour of Print Processes: Black and White Reproduction| publisher = Stanford library| date = June 1997| url = http://library.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/print.html| accessdate = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first format that allowed pornography to become a mass market phenomena, it now being more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

First appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude (often, [[burlesque]] actresses were hired as models) and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; while these would now be termed [[softcore pornography|softcore]], they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as "art magazines" or publications celebrating the new cult of [[naturism]], with titles such as ''[[Photo Bits]]'', ''Body in Art'', ''Figure Photography'', ''Nude Living'' and ''Modern Art for Men.''&lt;ref name = history /&gt; ''Health and Efficiency'', started in 1900, was a typical naturist magazine in Britain.&lt;ref name = H&amp;E&gt;{{cite web| title = About H&amp;E Naturist |publisher = ''Health and Efficiency Naturist'' |url = http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061014062706/http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm |archivedate = 2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early form of pornography were [[comic book]]s known as [[Tijuana bible]]s that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from [[cartoon]]s and culture.&lt;ref name = tijuana&gt;{{cite book| last = Adelman| first = Bob|author2=Richard Merkin| title = Tijuana Bibles: Art and Wit in America's Forbidden Funnies, 1930s-1950s| publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster| date = September 1, 1997| location = New York| isbn = 0-684-83461-8| page = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the word "[[pinup]]" was coined to describe pictures torn from men's magazines and calendars and "pinned up" on the wall by U.S. soldiers in [[World War II]]. While the '40s images focused mostly on legs, by the '50s, the emphasis shifted to [[breast]]s. [[Betty Grable]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] were two of the most popular pinup [[model (person)|models]]. In the second half of the 20th century, pornography evolved into the men's magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Modern Man'' of the 1950s. In fact, the beginning of the modern men's glossy magazine (or girlie magazine) can be traced to the 1953 purchase by [[Hugh Hefner]] of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe to use as the centerfold of his new magazine ''Playboy''. Soon, this type of magazine was the primary medium in which pornography was consumed.&lt;ref name = girlie&gt;{{cite book| last = Gabor| first = Mark| title = The Illustrated History of Girlie Magazines| publisher = Random House Value Publishing| date = February 27, 1984| location = New York| isbn = 0-517-54997-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In postwar Britain digest magazines such as ''Beautiful Britons'', ''Spick'' and ''Span'', with their interest in nylons and underwear
and the racier ''Kamera'' published by [[Harrison Marks]] were incredibly popular. The creative force behind ''Kamera'' was Harrison Marks' partner [[Pamela Green]]. These magazines featured nude or semi-nude women in extremely coy or flirtatious poses with no hint of pubic hair.

''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', started by [[Bob Guccione]] in England in 1965, took a different approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. ''Penthouse'' was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and [[wiktionary:full frontal nudity|full frontal nudity]], both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the [[buttocks]] as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured [[sexual penetration]], [[lesbian]]ism and homosexuality, [[group sex]], masturbation, and [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]] in the more hard-core magazines such as ''[[Hustler]]''.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = girlie /&gt;

Magazines for every taste and fetish were soon created due to the low cost of producing them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable and one of the first being ''Physique Pictorial'', started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, [[Athletic Model Guild]] photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in a very clear yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years.&lt;!--awkward statement--&gt; The magazine was innovative in its use of props and [[costume]]s to depict the now standard gay icons like [[cowboy]]s, [[gladiator]]s and [[sailor]]s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = out&gt;{{cite web| last = Bianco| first = David| title = Physique Magazines| work = Planet Out History |publisher = PlanetOut Inc| url = http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html| accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830161616/http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moving pictures==
{{details|Pornographic film}}
[[File:Johann Schwarzer movies about 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Images from early Austrian erotic films by Johann Schwarzer.]]
Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen [[Eugène Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner (under the name "Léar") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film ''[[Le Coucher de la Mariee]]'' had Louise Willy performing a bathroom [[striptease]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;Richard Abel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22Louise+Willy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LDEqT9y5HsbWrQeoqLDADA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louise%20Willy%22&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of early cinema''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23440-5}}, p.518&lt;/ref&gt; Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm |title=Léar (Albert Kirchner) |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm |title=Eugène Pirou |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896 ''Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance''&lt;ref&gt;Produced by James A. White and shot by William Heise for the Edison Manufacturing Co. in 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; was released as a short [[kinetoscope]] film featuring a gyrating [[belly dancer]] named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, ''The May Irwin Kiss'' contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips ("the mysteries of the kiss revealed"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; A [[tableau vivant]] style is used in short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;Produced by [[Frederick S. Armitage]] for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored [[body stocking]] in a direct frontal pose&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; that provides a provocative view of the female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/d21.html|title=The Birth of the Pearl|website=Library of Congress|year=1901|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pose is in the style of [[Botticelli]]'s [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]].

Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''Black and White and Blue'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', "the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is ''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge''" made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a [[wiktionary:tryst|tryst]] with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian ''El Satario'' might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that "the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is "a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robertson| first = Patrick| title = Film Facts| publisher = Billboard Books| date = December 2001| isbn = 0-8230-7943-0| page = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Austria]], [[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which was able to produce 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, when the company was dissolved by the censorship authorities and the films destroyed.

Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web| last = Corliss| first = Richard| title = That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic| work = Time Magazine| publisher = Time inc| date = March 29, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1043267,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120524121526/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html| archivedate = May 24, 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur [[cinematography]]. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of [[Harrison Marks]] were "soft core", but considered risqué in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. [[Lasse Braun]] was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/dk.php Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality] - "...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969)."&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the [[Color Climax Corporation]] quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer for the next couple of decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold "under the counter" or (sometimes) shown in "members only" cinema clubs.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph]]'' (also known as ''Mona''), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mehendale| first = Rachel| title = Is porn a problem?| work = Sex | pages = 17, 22| publisher = The Daily Texan| date = February 9, 2006| url = http://www.tsp.utexas.edu/FrontPage/TSMweb/advertising%20supplements/Valentines%20Day/valentines.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 film ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''), and to be reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Edmonson| first = Roger|author2=Cal Culver |author3=Casey Donovan | title = Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star| publisher = Alyson Books| date = October 1998| isbn = 1-55583-457-4| page = 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena.

''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' followed in 1973 and many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, with [[William Rotsler]] saying in 1973, "Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division.

==Video and digital depictions==
{{details|Internet pornography}}

[[File:Cinta ligas 009.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Digitally altered erotic photograph]]

By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = time /&gt;

Erotic [[CD-ROM]]s were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s because they brought an unprecedented element of interactiveness and fantasy. However, their poor quality was a drawback and when the [[Internet]] became common in households their sales declined. About the same time as the video revolution, the Internet became the preferred source of pornography for many people, offering both privacy in viewing and the chance to interact with people. The recent influx of widely available technology such as [[digital camera]]s, both moving and still, has blurred the lines between erotic films, photographs and amateur and professional productions.
It allows easy access to both formats, making the production of them easily achieved by anyone with access to the equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs. Digital media is revolutionary in that it allows photographers and filmmakers to manipulate [[image]]s in ways previously not possible, heightening the [[drama]] or eroticism of a depiction.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

[[High-definition video]] shows signs of changing the image of pornography as the technology is increasingly used for professional productions.  The porn industry was one of the first to adopt the technology and it may have been a deciding factor in the format competition between [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nystedt| first = Dan|author2=Martyn Williams| title = Japanese Porn Industry Embraces Blu-Ray Disc| work = PC World |publisher = PC World Communications, Inc.| date = July 30, 2007| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135222-c,dvdtechnology/article.htm| accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the clearer sharper images it provides have prompted performers to get cosmetic surgery and professional grooming to hide imperfections that are not visible on other video formats. Other adaptations have been different camera angles and techniques for close-ups and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Richtel| first = Matt| title = In Raw World of Sex Movies, High Definition Could Be a View Too Real| work = The New York Times| publisher = The New York Times| date = January 22, 2007| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/business/media/22porn.html| accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The anthology contains an introduction by editor Michael Cart, and the 12 stories. Cart's six-page introduction declares the theme of the anthology to be "what it might mean to be gay, lesbian, or transgender."&lt;ref&gt;Cart, Michael. "Introduction." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction introduces each author, briefly describes their story entry, and provides a very brief note about how the story confronts the concept of [[sexual identity]]. Three stories feature [[transgender]] characters, and two explore how [[nationality]] and [[language barrier]]s interact with sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; Most of the stories are written from the perspective of people in their late teens or 20s.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt;

The title of the anthology is taken from [[David Levithan]]'s short story, "A Word From the Nearly Distant Past," which is the first short story in the book: "He has no idea how beautiful the ordinary becomes once it disappears."&lt;ref&gt;Levithan, David. "A Word From the Nearly Distant Past." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The short stories in the book are:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*'''"A Word From the Nearly Distant Past" by David Levithan'''—Written as if it were a message from gay men in the past to gay teens today, this story is told in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]. The unnamed narrators (the plural pronoun "we" is used throughout the work) describe how a few young men are seen in the present going to a boyfriend's house, dancing alone, attending an LGBTQ [[prom]], etc. The narrators express knowledge about how these young men feel, and urge them to live life fully. The story is 13 pages long. David Levithan wrote the novel Two Boys Kissing as a full-length version of this story.
*'''"Happily Ever After" by [[Eric Shanower]]'''—This short story is told in [[Comics|comic book]] format. Two high school teenage boys seem to be in love, but their relationship is in trouble because Mark has difficulty accepting he is gay. The two discover a [[genie]] (the comically named Genie-Fouadi-Wadi-Wasr-Ras-Daroun-Boun-Ali-Meht-Ma-Hani-Pal the Perspicacious) in a bottle who grants them each a wish. The unnamed narrator wants Mark to love him, but a horrified Mark demands that the genie remove his homosexuality. The genie grants each teen his wish. Three years pass. Both men (now in college) are miserable, but because "when a genie grants a wish, it comes true"&lt;ref&gt;Shanower, Eric. "Happily Ever After." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; the genie must intervene again. The story is 13 pages long.
*'''"My Life As A Dog" by Ron Koertge'''—At first, this is a [[Fantasy literature|fantasy story]] told in the first-person singular by Noah, a dog with very human emotions and intelligence. But at points throughout the story, the text changes to look like a screenplay. The screenplay describes a teenage boy, Noah, who has apparently been hit by a car. Noah has quarrelsome parents, and his father is particularly [[Homophobia|homophobic]]. The screenplay-like text reveals that Noah is [[closeted]] and has a boyfriend, Robbie, who is not. Noah and Robbie quarrel over whether Noah should [[Coming out|come out]], but Noah refuses because his father already treats him like a dog. The reality of Noah's situation becomes apparent through the story, as well as the truth about Noah's accident. The short story is 26 pages long.
*'''"Trev" by [[Jacqueline Woodson]]'''—Trev Louis Johnson is a six-year-old transgender boy. He is biologically female but already Trev knows he is a boy. Trev knows he is "wrong down there"&lt;ref&gt;Woodson, Jacqueline. "Trev." In ''How Beautiful the Ordinary: Twelve Stories of Identity.'' Michael Cart, ed. New York: HarperTeen, 2009, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; but his father and brother have a great deal of difficulty handling Trev's gender identity. Trev himself struggles to understand his gender as he begins first grade, and learns the story of his great-aunt Dane. This story is nine pages long.
*'''"My Virtual World" by [[Francesca Lia Block]]'''—Primarily written as a series of e-mails from "Boy Blue" to "Ms. R.E." (e.g., misery), this story tells about the growing friendship between Garret and Rebecca, two people who have never met and communicate primarily online. Over the course of the emails, Garret reveals that he is a [[transsexual]] who was born female, and who may have attempted suicide. Rebecca also has a secret (revealed in part at the end of the story), and has engaged in [[Self-harm|cutting]]. The two emotionally troubled people bond, with their future revealed in a traditionally-written narrative text. The short story is 13 pages long.
*'''"A Dark Red Love Knot" by [[Margo Lanagan]]'''—Tom Coyne is an English teenager living in the past (possibly the 17th century). He works as a [[Hostler|stableboy]] at a local inn. The [[first-person narrative]] briefly describes how Tom saw Bess (the innkeeper's daughter) meeting with her lover (a handsome [[highwayman]]) one night in the stables. Tom tells how he recently lost his sexual virginity to a soldier in the King's army. Desiring to see his lover again, Tom tells the innkeeper about his daughter's sexual indiscretion in the hopes this will bring the King's men to the inn. Consumed only by his own desire to see his soldier, Tom does not consider the consequences of his actions (which lead to tragedy). The short story is 29 pages long.
*'''"Fingernail" by [[William Sleator]]'''—Lep is a young [[Thai people|Thai]] with little education who speaks no English. Although he has had homosexual sex with other Thai men, it is unsatisfying to him. He meets Bernard, a French tourist. They make love and spend much time together. Bernard returns to France, and Lep works hard to learn English. Bernard returns to [[Thailand]], but Lep realizes Bernard is insanely [[Jealousy|jealous]]. He accuses Lep of having sex with other men all the time, and one night tries to smother him in bed. Lep forgives Bernard. Bernard's jealousy worsens. After a final act of treachery, Lep refuses to see Bernard any longer. Lep must decided whether his love for Bernard was real, and whether knowing Bernard was worth it. The story is told in [[Non-native pronunciations of English|broken English]], as if written by a non-native speaker of English. The story is 22 pages long.
*'''"Dyke March" by [[Ariel Schrag]]'''—Told in comic book format, this short story depicts the major events that occur every half hour one evening as an unnamed lesbian attends a [[pride parade]]. Various events occur (planning for the parade, [[Text messaging|texting]] friends, dancing, etc.) and she experiences various emotions (eagerness, [[paranoia]], awe, hunger, etc.). Her ability to deal with the things she sees and experiences, conveyed comically and primarily in visual form, is the basis of the story. This story is five pages long, and is the shortest in the book.
*'''"The Missing Person" by [[Jennifer Finney Boylan]]'''—Written in the first-person, the narrator of this story, Jimmy, is a boy who, during the summer between the [[Eighth grade|eighth]] and [[ninth grade]], decides he wants to be a girl. The story describes "Jenny's" first experience as she dresses in girls' clothing that belongs to her older sister and goes to a local [[fair]]. A [[subplot]] about a [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] [[Student exchange program|exchange student]] who becomes trapped in a wall [[Framing device|bookends]] the narrative, providing a [[metaphor]] for what the transsexual narrator feels. The story is 18 pages long.
*'''"First Time" by Julie Ann Peters'''—Jesi and Nicolle are two lesbians about to have their first sexual encounter. The short story is told in the first-person narrative by both people. The text is split into two [[Column (typography)|columns]], with Jesi's narrative on the left and Nicolle's on the right.  Each girl remembers important things which have happened during their relationship (such as the first time they hugged) as they prepare to engage in sex, engage in [[foreplay]], and consummate the sex act.  The text is somewhat sexually explicit (primarily the description of body parts).&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; The story is 31 pages long.
*'''"Dear Lang" by [[Emma Donoghue]]'''—This short story is written in the form of a letter from a 40-year-old [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]] (a masculine lesbian) to her 16-year-old daughter, Lang. The woman reveals that she used to be [[Same-sex marriage|partnered]] with Lang's mother, Cheryl. Cheryl received [[artificial insemination]] and gave birth to Lang when the narrator was 24 years old. Two years later, the two women's relationship ended and Cheryl won [[child custody|custody]] of Lang. The narrator reveals much of her own life story and her current situation through the letter, and talks about the hopes she has as a parent for both Lang and for her own child (her current partner is pregnant). The story is 35 pages long.
*'''"The Silk Road Runs Through Tupperneck, N.H." by [[Gregory Maguire]]'''—Faroukh Rahmani is an 18-year-old [[Iranian American]]. In danger of losing his college scholarship after failing a class, he takes a make-up summer course in music at the fictional Tupperneck College in Tupperneck, [[New Hampshire]]. He meets the impossibly handsome, muscular, and talented Blaise D'Anjou, a [[French American]] music student. Faroukh struggles with poverty, family relationships, and his own sexual desire for the emotionally cold, distant Blaise. But the revelation of a tragedy in Blaise's family brings the two men together. This first-person narrative is interspersed with a [[Narrative mode#Third-person view|third-person singular]] narrative, describing events 15 years later as Faroukh brings his two young children to New Hampshire to attend a concert at Tupperneck College. The sacrifices a gay person makes for one's family, in the face of tragedy, and to secure a career form the basis of both narratives, which are tied together at the end of the novella. The story is 117 pages long.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Critical reception==
A review in the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' called the anthology "refreshing" and chose the stories by Lanagan and Maguire.&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; The review cited the main character in William Sleator's "Fingernail" as "compelling", and said Ron Koertge's "My Life as a Dog" contained "an ingenious metaphor for coming out".&lt;ref name="Chow" /&gt; ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' concluded that the book contained "&lt;nowiki&gt;[p]&lt;/nowiki&gt;rovocative, quality content."&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; The journal cited Shanower's "Happily Ever After" and Block's "My Virtual World" as the best stories in the collection.&lt;ref name="Kirkus" /&gt; Reviewer Gillian Engberg, writing in ''Booklist'', found the experimentation in narrative styles "inventive" and the stories "raw &lt;nowiki&gt;[and]&lt;/nowiki&gt; moving", and concluded the anthology was "a groundbreaking addition to young-adult literature".&lt;ref name="Engberg" /&gt; Erin Williams, reviewing the book of the [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays|PFLAG]] National Blog, found the collection "unique" because "...the stories vary from spiritually philosophical to personal histories to comic strips—all dealing with teen GLBT experiences."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.pflag.org/2009/11/book-review-how-beautiful-ordinary.html Williams, Erin. "Book Review: ''How Beautiful the Ordinary''."] [[Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays|PFLAG]] National Blog. November 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying: The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune''''' is a humorous 1952 book  by [[Shepherd Mead]]. It inspired a successful 1961 [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|musical of the same name]], which was made into a [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (film)|movie]] in 1967.

==Description==
The book is a satire of an instructional manual, very similar in form and subject matter to Stephen Potter's ''[[Gamesmanship]]''. ''How to Succeed'' satirizes office life in the United States in the guise of a [[self-help book]]. Its subtitle is "The Dastard's Guide to Fame and Fortune".

==Inspiration==
''How to Succeed'' was inspired by Mead's corporate experiences at the [[Benton &amp; Bowles]] advertising agency, which he joined in 1936 as a mail-room clerk, eventually working his way up to a vice-presidency. During his journey up the [[corporate ladder]], Mead wrote the book in his spare time—before work and on weekends. The book was a best-seller.

==Musical adaptation==
In 1961, the book was adapted into [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|a musical]] with songs by [[Frank Loesser]] and a [[libretto]] by [[Abe Burrows]], with minor input by others. The musical differs significantly from the book. It satirizes Mead's own career by depicting the rise of eager young J. Pierrepont Finch, a window-washer who joins a huge corporation by starting in the mail room, and becomes chairman of the board two weeks later. The musical starred [[Robert Morse]] as the young striver J. Pierrepont Finch, [[Rudy Vallee]] as the company president J.B. Biggley, and [[Charles Nelson Reilly]] as Biggley's perpetually peeved nephew Bud Frump.

The musical was a smash hit, with a Broadway run of 1,417 performances between October 1961 and March 1965. It won eight [[Tony Awards]] and the 1962 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for best drama. It was adapted into [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (film)|a movie]], also starring Morse and Vallee with [[Anthony 'Scooter' Teague]] as Frump, in 1967. It was successfully revived on Broadway in 1995, starring [[Matthew Broderick]] as Finch, and again in 2011 with [[Daniel Radcliffe]] playing the role. Then in 2012, [[Darren Criss]] played the role of Finch for a three-week engagement, and was replaced by [[Nick Jonas]] who took the lead until the show closed on May 20, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |title=How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying |url=http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13723/How-to-Succeed-in-Business-Without-Really-Trying |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226204423/http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/13723/How-to-Succeed-in-Business-Without-Really-Trying |archivedate=December 26, 2012 |work=[[Playbill]] |access-date=September 7, 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The [[Library of Congress]] catalogs the 1995 reprint as non-fiction under "business books", with the subject headings "Success in business", "Management", and "Career development".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Library of Congress LCCN Permalink 52012031|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/94048421|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{human appearance}}
'''Human physical appearance''' is the outward [[phenotype]] or look of human beings.

There are infinite variations in human phenotypes, though society reduces the variability to distinct categories. Physical appearance of humans, in particular those attributes which are regarded as important for [[physical attractiveness]], are believed by [[anthropologist]]s to significantly affect the development of personality and [[social relations]]. Humans are acutely sensitive to their physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson-Fye|first=EP|url=https://modificazione.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/anthropological-perspectives-on-physical-appearance-and-body-images.pdf|format=PDF|editor-last=Cash|editor-first=Thomas F.|title=Anthropological Perspectives on Physical Appearance and Body Image|date=2012|department=Body Image and Its Disorder in Anthropology|publisher=Academic Press|volume=1|page=19|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-384925-0.00003-1|accessdate=August 9, 2018|quote=[Cases] of immigration have repeatedly shown that if a person who is obese believes that his or her body is beyond individual control but is placed into a medical system that assumes individual rational actors in its treatments, adherence is likely to be low and those treatments are ineffective...[Young] ethnic Fijian women associated the thin body ideal with a particular lifestyle that they found desirable}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some differences in human appearance are [[genetics|genetic]], others are the result of [[senescence|age]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] or [[disease]], and many are the result of personal [[adornment]].

Some people have linked some differences, with [[Race (classification of human beings)|ethnicity]], such as skeletal shape, [[prognathism]] or elongated stride. Different cultures place different degrees of emphasis on physical appearance and its importance to social status and other phenomena.

== Factors affecting physical appearance ==
Various factors are considered relevant in relation to the physical appearance of humans.

=== Physiological differences ===
Humans are distributed across the globe with the exception of Antarctica, and form a variable species. In adults, average weight varies from around 40 kilos for the smallest and most lightly built tropical people to around 80 kilos for the heavier northern peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropometric Reference Data for Children and Adults: United States, 2003–2006|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr010.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Size also varies between the sexes, the [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans being more pronounced than that of [[chimpanzee]]s, but less than the dimorphism found in gorillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shea|first=Brian T.|title=The ontogeny of sexual dimorphism in the African apes|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=1985|volume=8|issue=2|pages=183–188|doi=10.1002/ajp.1350080208}}&lt;!--|accessdate=9 March 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The colouration of skin, hair and eyes also varies considerably, with darker pigmentation domination in tropical climates and lighter in polar regions.
*Genetic, ethnic affiliation, geographical ancestry.
* [[Human height|Height]], [[body weight]], [[human skin color|skin tone]], [[androgenic hair|body hair]], [[sexual organ]]s, [[mole (skin marking)|moles]], [[birthmark]]s, [[freckle]]s, [[hair color]], [[hair texture]], [[eye color]], [[human eye|eye]] shape (see [[epicanthic fold]]), [[human nose|nose]] shape (see [[nasal bridge]]), [[ear]]s shape (see [[earlobes]]), [[body shape]]
*Body deformations, mutilations and other variations such as [[amputation]]s, [[scar]]s, [[Burn (injury)|burns]] and [[wound]]s.

=== Long-term physiological changes ===
*[[Senescence|Aging]]
*[[Hair loss]]
=== Short-term physiological changes ===
*[[Blushing]], [[crying]], [[fainting]], [[hiccup]], [[yawning]], [[laughing]], [[stuttering]], [[sexual arousal]], [[sweating]], [[shivering]], [[nose bleeding]], [[sun tanning|skin color changes]] due to [[Sunlight|sunshine]] or [[frost]].

=== {{Visible anchor|Clothing, personal effects, and intentional body modifications}} ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Clothing]] --&gt;
*[[clothing]], including [[headgear]] and [[footwear]]; some clothes alter or mold the shape of the body (e.g. [[corset]], support pantyhose, [[bra]]). As for [[footwear]], [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] make a person look taller.
* style and colour of [[haircut]] (see also [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], [[dreadlocks]], [[braid]]s, [[ponytail]], [[Wig (hair)|wig]], [[hairpin (fashion)|hairpin]], [[facial hair]], [[beard]] and [[moustache]])
*[[cosmetics]], stage makeup, [[body painting]]s, [[permanent makeup]]
*[[body modification]]s, such as [[body piercing]]s, [[tattoo]]s, [[scarification]], [[subdermal implants]]
*[[plastic surgery]]
*decorative objects ([[jewelry]]) such as a [[necklace]]s, [[bracelet]]s, [[finger ring|rings]], [[earring]]s
*medical or body shape altering devices (''e.g.'', [[tooth braces]], [[bandage]]s, [[Cast (orthopedic)|casts]], [[hearing aids]], [[cervical collar]], [[crutches]], [[contact lens]]es of different colours, [[glasses]], [[Grill (jewelry)|gold teeth]]). For example, the same person's appearance can be quite different, depending on whether they use any of the aforementioned modifications.
*exercises, for example, [[bodybuilding]]

'''''Interior with a Child Feeding a Parrot''''' (c. 1668-1672) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in a private collection.

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1908, who wrote; "113. THE FAVOURITE PARROT. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] Suppl. 6 ; deG. 50.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the left-hand corner of a room stands a table with an Eastern carpet and a white cloth. Upon it are cheese, fruit, plates, and other objects. A young man with a slouch hat sits behind the table, drinking a glass of wine. Behind him is a chimney-piece ; upon it stands some Chinese porcelain, and above it hangs a picture of a nude woman recumbent. In the right foreground there are bottles and glasses on a little table, and a silver dish on the floor. At a half-opened window to the left stands a young woman, in a red jacket trimmed with ermine, feeding a parrot, which looks out of its cage-door. The woman scratches the parrot's head with her left hand, and with her right soaks a crust in a wine-glass which a girl, standing more to the right behind the table, holds across to her. With her left hand this girl supports a little child who stands on a chair, watching the parrot being fed. A dog jumps up to the chair. By the window is a bird-cage ; behind the parrot there is another picture on the wall. The colouring is cool and clear in tone. Canvas, 31 inches by 27 inches. Mentioned by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]] (Supplement, p. 99) ; by Ch. Blanc, ''Tresor de la Curiosite'', ii. 433-4.; and by Havard. 

Sale. Casimir Perier, Paris, April 18, 1838. In the collection of the [[Charles Ferdinand, Duke of Berry|Duc de Berri]] ; brought to England in 1840 by Hume. Now in the collection of the [[Baron Northbrook|Earl of Northbrook]], in London."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/505/mode/1up entry 113 for The Favorite Parrot] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;

The child is wearing a ''valhoed'', or [[falling cap]], and the same child with falling cap can be seen in Hooch's ''Teaching a Child to Walk'', while the interior itself was used for another scene with the same child pulling impatiently on the skirt of a maidservant:

[[File:Jebel Al-Buhais burial.jpg|thumb|One of many tombs scattered across the Jebel Al-Buhais archaeological site.]]
'''Jebel Buhais''' (also called Jebel Al-Buhais) is a geological feature, an extensive rocky outcrop, as well as an archaeological site located near [[Al Madam|Madam]], in [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. The area contains an extensive necropolis, consisting of burial sites spanning the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] ages of human settlement in the UAE. Burials at Jebel Buhais (''Jebel'' is Arabic for mountain) date back to the 5th Millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/art-destinations/sharjah/archaeological-sites/jebel-al-buhais/|title=Jebel al-Buhais. Art Destination Sharjah|website=universes.art|language=en-EN|access-date=2018-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is located to the side of a limestone outcrop rising to some 340 metres above sea level and which runs almost contiguously from the town of Madam north to the town of [[Mileiha|Mleiha]], itself an important [[Mleiha Archaeological Centre|archaeological site]]. 

Jebel Buhais is the oldest radiometrically dated inland burial site in the UAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesewetter|first=Henrike|date=1999|title=Neolithic jewellery from Jebel al-Buhais 18|jstor=41223703|journal=Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies|volume=30|pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is protected, having been defined as a nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sharjah24.ae/en/sharjah/283849-sharjah-ruler-issues-emiri-decree-establishing-jebel-al-buhais-nature-reserve|title=Sharjah Ruler issues Emiri Decree establishing Jebel Al-Buhais Nature Reserve|work=Sharja24|access-date=2018-04-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first appreciated as being of potential significance by archaeologists from Iraq in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology in the Past, Present and Future|last=|first=|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2010|isbn=978-3447061759|location=Germany|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but extensive excavations did not take place until the late 1980s, with digs undertaken by the French mission to the Emirate of Sharjah and from the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] through to the early 1990s. Following this early work, researchers from the Sharjah government's Directorate of Antiquities discovered a camel entombed in a grave site, BHS 12, which led to a team from the [[University of Tübingen]] carrying out digs from 1995 onwards. The discovery and excavation of BHS 12 led to the discovery of the important BHS 18 site, which saw 10 digs from 1996-2005 uncovering a burial site which was to become 'one of the key neolithic sites in Southern Arabia'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Funeral Monuments and Human Remains from Jebel al-Buhais|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans Peter|publisher=UAE Ministry of Culture and Information|year=2006|isbn=3-935751-06-0|location=UAE|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete remains of some 600 individuals have been found at the site, with many thought yet to be found.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/culture/7-000-year-old-skeletal-remains-give-glimpse-of-the-past-1.91752|title=7,000-year-old skeletal remains give glimpse of the past|last=Reporter|first=Mariam M.

== Stone Age ==
Dated to the late Stone Age, Neolithic finds at BHS 18 have been carbon-dated spanning some 1,000 years from 5,000 to 4,000 BCE, with burials at the site thought to be those of nomadic herders who travelled inland for the winter season.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jebel Buhais is unique as an inland neolithic site in the UAE, all other sites discovered to date have been coastal, and the site has yielded no evidence of burials in the following millennium. This is thought to be consistent with changing patterns of human life as a result of climate change: a spring discovered at Jebel Buhais dried up at this stage, an event contemporaneous with similar discoveries pointing to increased aridity in the interior of Oman. Throughout Southern Arabia, evidence of human inland settlement in the 3rd millennium BCE is scant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates|last=Potts|first=Daniel|publisher=Trident Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1900724883|location=UK|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post Neolithic era ==
Subsequent burials at Jebel Buhais represent the early Bronze Age [[Hafit period]] (3200 - 2600 BCE), with many distinctive 'beehive' Hafit graves discovered. None, however, were found with human remains of that era. The subsequent era of human occupation, [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar]] (2600-2000 BCE) is not represented at Jebel Buhais although there were Umm Al Nar period burials in nearby Mleiha. Iron Age burials, particularly the group of graves defined as BHS 85, are thought to be linked to the nearby Iron Age settlement site of [[Al Thuqeibah]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq]] graves at Jebel Buhais include those found at BHS 8. A number of later burials, including some invasive later burials in older grave sites, are also evident at the site.

'''''Journals of Ayn Rand''''' is a book derived from the private journals of novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]]. Edited by David Harriman with the approval of Rand's estate, it was published in 1997, 15 years after her death. Some reviewers considered it an interesting source of information for readers with an interest in Rand, but several scholars criticized Harriman's editing as being too heavy-handed and insufficiently acknowledged in the published text.

==Background==
When Rand died in 1982, her private papers were left to her student and heir [[Leonard Peikoff]]. Starting in 1983, Peikoff began authorizing the publication of excerpts from her journals and other unpublished writings. From 1983 to 1994, several such excerpts appeared in ''[[The Objectivist Forum]]''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Objectivist Forum'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Journal" (August 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (December 1983)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (April 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Philosophic Notes" (August 1984)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes for The Fountainhead" (December 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Intellectual Activist]]''.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;The excerpts published in ''The Intellectual Activist'' were:&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Notes for Atlas Shrugged" (January 1992)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on Scene in Roark's Apartment" (January 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"Notes on the Thomas Committee" (November 1993)&lt;br /&gt;"'Memory-Storing' Epistemology" (January 1994)&lt;br /&gt;"Ayn Rand's Journals: Selections from The Moral Basis of Individualism" (November 1995)&lt;br /&gt;"From Ayn Rand's Journals: Notes on The Fountainhead" (January and March 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; David Harriman, a physicist and a speaker for the [[Ayn Rand Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |title=David Harriman |publisher=Ayn Rand Institute |accessdate=September 26, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617063729/http://www.aynrand.org/site/PageServer?pagename=media_DavidHarriman |archivedate=June 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited Rand's journals for publication in book form. The hardcover edition of the fully edited ''Journals of Ayn Rand'' was published by [[E. P. Dutton|Dutton]] in 1997. A paperback edition was published by [[Plume (publishing)|Plume]] in 1999.

==Contents==
In a foreword for the book, Peikoff describes Rand's journals, with a few exceptions, as being "written for herself, for her own clarity" and not intended for publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A preface by Harriman describes the material as being about three-quarters of Rand's "''working'' journals", collected from "numerous boxes of papers she left behind at her death". He describes his editing as consisting of "selection, organization, line editing, and insertion of explanatory comments."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that "not a great deal of line editing was required", and that his editorial insertions and "omissions of passages" are marked in the published text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the book consists of Rand's edited journals, divided into five major sections. The first section, titled "Early Projects" includes scenarios for silent movies that Rand developed when she first moved to Hollywood in the 1920s. There are also notes and outlines for her first published novel, ''[[We the Living]]'', and for another early novel that was never completed. Entries in an early "philosophic journal" from April and May 1934, are described by Rand as "the vague beginnings of an amateur philosopher."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rand|1997|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section, titled "''The Fountainhead''", consists of material related to her [[The Fountainhead|novel of that name]]. She took extensive notes from her research on architecture, and created profiles for each character, often based on information about real people. There are several outlines of the plot and notes she made while the novel was being written.

The third section, titled "Transition Between Novels", includes draft material for three unfinished projects. The first was a non-fiction book to be called ''The Moral Basis of Individualism''. The second was a movie about the development of the [[atomic bomb]], tentatively titled ''Top Secret''. The third was an essay called "To All Innocent Fifth Columnists", to be circulated by a proposed organization of conservative intellectuals that never formed. This section also reprints a transcript of Rand's 1949 testimony before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], along with her own notes about the committee's efforts to investigate [[Communism]].

The fourth section, "''Atlas Shrugged''", has her notes and outlines for her [[Atlas Shrugged|final novel]]. In addition to planning for characters and plot points, her notes include research on the railroad and steel industries, and thoughts on various philosophical issues to be addressed in the novel.

The fifth and final section, "Final Years", covers the years 1955 to 1977. It includes notes about "psycho-epistemology" and ideas for two possible books. One was a non-fiction book about Rand's philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. The other was a novel to be titled ''To Lorne Dieterling''.

==Reception==
Objectivist philosopher [[David Kelley]] described the material in Rand's journals as "contain[ing] a number of passages that explain key points in her philosophy more fully and clearly than anything she published." Kelley called the book "a treasure" and said Harriman's editing was "skillful", although he criticized Harriman for not providing more complete notes on cases where Rand had later changed her positions from those documented in the journal entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kelley|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']], [[Walter Olson]] said the book was "a less-than-ideal place to start for those not already closely familiar with the Russian-born author's work."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he said it did "furnish a deep popcorn bowl of sheer fan value" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1998|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brief review in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it a "valuable sourcebook" for those interested in Rand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hardcovers in Brief |work=[[The Washington Post]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} |date=November 9, 1997 |accessdate=July 9, 2014 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-759398.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', conservative writer [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] offered his "harsh assessment" that the insights Rand had about the dangers of collectivism were "made absurd only by the philosophy she piled on top of it." For aspiring writers, he said, "The journals' central lesson is that one should never underestimate the importance of pomposity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brooks|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review produced responses in the form of a short article in ''Liberty'' calling it an "uninformed hatchet job"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raico|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a letter from philosopher [[Allan Gotthelf]] calling it "the usual sneers".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gotthelf|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a bibliography of Rand's works, [[Mimi Reisel Gladstein]] said the book "illustrates Rand’s dedication to her craft and her meticulous preparation for writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Brooks and Gladstein indicated that the term 'journals' was misleading because the material focuses on Rand's works and ideas, instead of more personal thoughts.

Describing Rand as a rigorous but misanthropic thinker, ''[[Booklist]]'' said her journals would "be of vital interest to many".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seaman|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' said it was of interest only for those who were "lovers and loathers" of Rand, describing the book as being "As intriguing yet sometimes numbing as her fiction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Forecasts: Nonfiction: ''The Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=August 4, 1997 |volume=244 |issue=32 |page=56 |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-525-94370-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Choice: Current Reviews for Academic Libraries|Choice]]'' recommended the book for academic libraries, saying it would be welcomed by "Rand aficionados".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Overmyer|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of the book were also published in ''[[Kirkus Reviews]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=''Journals of Ayn Rand'' |work=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |date=July 15, 1997 |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/david-harriman/journals-of-ayn-rand/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kamiya|1998|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Concerns about editing===
In a review of the book in [[Liberty (1987)|''Liberty'']] magazine, [[Stephen D. Cox|Stephen Cox]] questioned the editorial choices made by Harriman. He said that Harriman tried "to steer a middle course" between casual and scholarly readers of Rand's work, but he wondered "where should the line be drawn?" He cited examples given by Harriman as the types of passages omitted, saying some of them were "precisely the kind of note that scholars want to see". Cox also said that Harriman's editing for grammar and "wordiness" was insufficiently explained, which acted "to undermine the objective authority of the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cox|1998|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article in the next issue of ''Liberty'', Rand scholar [[Chris Matthew Sciabarra]] raised additional concerns about how Harriman had edited the material. Sciabarra compared a passage that had been published previously in ''The Intellectual Activist'' with the corresponding passage in the book. He found differences between the two, including the omission of a reference to [[Albert Jay Nock]] in the book version. He quoted Harriman's preface about how changes from the original were supposed to be noted in the text, and said, "When such editorial changes are not made explicit, when not even ellipsis points are provided to indicate missing text, doubt is cast unnecessarily on the volume's authenticity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sciabarra|1998|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing Sciabarra's essay, Gladstein gave the book as an example of publishing efforts by Rand's estate that "have not always exhibited a confidence-inspiring level of academic rigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gladstein|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''[[The Ayn Rand Cult]]'', journalist Jeff Walker suggested the published journals might be "completely unreliable and ... may have been thoroughly twisted in the interests of the present-day cult".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walker|1999|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing a [[Goddess of the Market|biography of Rand]], historian Jennifer Burns worked with the original journals in the Ayn Rand Archives, and compared the material there with published versions. She said Rand's journals had been edited in ways that are "significant and problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns said Harriman's changes "significantly alter Rand's meaning" in a number of cases, transforming the tentative and evolving ideas in Rand's notes into "a slick manufactured world in which all her ideas are definite, well formulated, and clear."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an entry on her blog describing her experiences at the archives, Burns said the staff of the archives "heartily disapproved" of how the book was edited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In the Rand Archives, Part 2: The edited letters and diaries |url=http://www.jenniferburns.org/blog/65-in-the-rand-archives-part-2-the-edited-letters-and-diaries |first=Jennifer |last=Burns |date=September 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable '''[[Chic (style)|chics]]'''.
{{wiktionary|chic}}
{{TOC right}}

==Chics==


===Ashcan chic===
Term used in the United States c. 2005 for a "homeless" style, similar to '''[[boho-chic]]''', that was initially popularised in [[Greenwich Village]]. Its main features were floppy hats, sunglasses and "dust-catcher" skirts. '''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobo]]''' (''i.e.'' ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''-Bohemian) '''chic''' was used in a similar sense.

===Beach chic===
"Beach chic" was the title of an article in 2006 by the ''Times'' fashion editor [[Lisa Armstrong]] about shopping for accessories to accompany a [[bikini]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 22 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These included a "cover-up" (''e.g.'' a [[kaftan]]), flat sandals, a hat, a [[sunless tanning|fake tan]] and - with the comforting footnote, "No, you will not look like a [[WAGs|WAG]] [wife or girlfriend of a footballer]" - denture cleaner to whiten finger-nails. The ''Sunday Times'' referred to the Moroccan resort of [[Essaouira]] as the "[[boho-chic#Morocco|boho]]/'''barefoot-chic''' beach" (the latter possibly a play on the term, "bare-faced cheek").&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"&gt;''Style'', 18 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
''See also [[List of chics#Seaside chic|Seaside chic]]''.

===Boho-chic===
{{main|Boho-chic}}
Trend of fashion in the early 2000s (decade) which drew on earlier [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] and [[hippie]] styles. It was associated in particular with actress [[Sienna Miller]] and model [[Kate Moss]]. [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]] have both become icons for this style.

===Bon chic bon genre===
:''See [[Parisian chic]]''

===Camilla chic===
Emulating the style, of which [[Burberry]] was a feature, of [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], who married Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2005) ''Fanboys and Overdogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casual chic===
"Casual chic" (or "chic casual") is a difficult term to define, but can perhaps best be described as "dressing down" in a stylish way. In 2007, the clothing retailer [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] suggested that some of the elements of "chic casual" were [[slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], "longline, clingy jerseys", "statement" bags and chunky jewellery, slouchy sweaters and hoodies with comfortable flats. Singer [[Victoria Beckham]] was identified as epitomising this style.&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; '''Easy chic''' ("breezy blouses, slouchy knits and sexy [[denim]]"&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"/&gt;) has similar connotations.

===Chav chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Council house chic|council house chic]]''

===Checkout chic===
Referring to fashion ranges promoted by major [[supermarket]]s: "[[Tesco]] has stepped up its '[[Point of sale|checkout]] chic' war with [[Asda]] by launching a design-led range of clothes to tempt female shoppers".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cheap chic''' was used in a similar sense, though more in terms of the comparison between prices at supermarkets and those of leading fashion houses: "You can achieve this season's look just by visiting your local supermarket".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 31 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea chic===
Used by the ''Sunday Times'' ("The Sloane gets a sexy revamp"&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"/&gt;) for fashionable trends among well-heeled "[[Sloane Ranger]]s" (a ''[[portmanteau]]'' term coined in 1975 by [[Peter York]], style editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harpers &amp; Queen]]'', from [[Sloane Square]] and the 1950s TV series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''Oxford Dictionary of New Words'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] area of south west London.

===Council house chic===
"Council house chic"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2004) ''Larpers and Shroomers''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''chav chic''' ("Chav Chic might have sunk the house of Burberry"&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Magazine'', 26 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) referred to the fashions of working class "[[chav]]s" who shared [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], Duchess of Cornwall's taste for Burberry check. ''See also [[List of chics#Camilla chic|Camilla chic]]''.

===Cycle chic===
{{main|Cycle chic}}
To be well dressed and smart in everyday clothes whilst cycling for ordinary journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cycle Chic Manifesto, http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2008/04/cycle-chic-manifesto.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco Chic===
Eco Chic means the use of eco-friendly textiles, such as [[organic cotton]], [[silk]] and [[hemp]], and also [[reconstructed clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetark.org/wen/51195 |title=World Environment News - A model displays an outfit during the EcoChic Shanghai fashion show |publisher=Planet Ark |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geek chic===
{{main|Geek chic}}
"The look of a computer nerd".&lt;ref&gt;Dent (2003) ''The Language Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goth chic===
Title of a "connoisseur's guide" by Gavin Baddeley (2002) to dark or Gothic culture. Among those associated with the "[[Gothic fashion|goth]] look" were the late 1970s [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], American punk cabaret duo [[The Dresden Dolls]], formed in 2000, and [[Megan Burns|Betty Curse]], described by ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006 as the "princess of Goth pop".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 3 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin chic===
{{main|Heroin chic}}
[[Heroin chic]] was a look popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale skin, dark circles underneath the eyes and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models such as [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Claudia Schiffer]]. A 1996 article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' opened that the fashion industry had "a nihilistic vision of beauty" that was reflective of drug addiction, while ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' called the movement a "cynical trend".

===Hick chic===
[[wiktionary:hick|Hick]] chic" was the subject of an article in ''Country Life'' in 2006 by Carla Carlisle, American-born wife of former British Member of Parliament, Sir [[Kenneth Carlisle]]. Lady Carlisle cited a friend's description of the term: "it's [[farmers' market]]s, [[four-wheel drive]] cars, [[Labrador Retriever|labradors]], [[Harris Tweed]], [[Shakers|Shaker]] furniture, [[Emma Bridgewater]] [tableware] ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 23 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "Hick" derives from "Old Hickory", a nickname for [[Andrew Jackson]], US President 1829-37, a [[frontier]]sman who, like [[hickory]] wood, was known for his toughness.

===High Street chic===
Applied to the sort of "everyday" sense of style that might be spotted in any metropolitan or provincial setting; most likely to be associated with prevailing "shop window" fashions. In 2004 the ''Observer'' wrote of the singer [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] that "she drifts on stage dressed in [[High Street|high-street]] chic: faded [[denim]] and a [[tracksuit]] top, which she slips off to reveal a pink [[camisole]] vest".&lt;ref&gt;''Observer", 1 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samantha Cameron]], wife of British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader and future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was described in 2006 as "spurn[ing] the designers ... for high street chic".&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Hippie chic}} Hippie chic===
:Also known as ''Art-school chic'' and ''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''
Broadly similar to [[boho-chic]] (see ''e.g.'' London ''Evening Standard Magazine'', 11 March 2005), the [[Hippie chic]] was associated in the mid-1990s with [[Tom Ford]]’s collections for the Italian house of [[Gucci]] and, indeed, various aspects of hippie fashion re-appeared periodically after the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967 when hippiedom and [[psychedelia]] were at their peak. '''Art-school chic'''&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; had roughly similar connotations. '''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''' was applied by Hedley Freeman in the ''Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian'', 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to the hippie style associated in the late 1960s (and since) with the actress wife (died 1971) of [[Paul Getty|John Paul Getty]]. Talitha Getty is said to have inspired Ford's hippie-style creations.

=== Marzahn chic ===

:Also known as ''[[Lichtenberg]] chic''
Refers to the clothing style seen in some eastern and northern parts of Germany. It is composed of sweatpants or tracksuits, ''[[baseball cap|Basecaps]]'' and running shoes, commonly in bright colors like neon pink or yellow.
The name originates from the locality [[Berlin-Marzahn]] where this style can frequently be seen. It also refers to the clothing style of ''Cindy aus Marzahn'', a fictional character played by German comedian [[Ilka Bessin]].

===Military chic===
:Also known as ''Soldier chic''
Adoption of [[military]] gear such as camouflage patterned clothing, war medals, military insignia, surplus clothing or [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tag necklaces]] (adopted in the [[American Civil War]]) into fashion. The term and the similar '''soldier chic''' were widely applied ''c.''2003-5, although in fact military apparel, such as the flight jackets worn by pilots during the Second World War, had frequently influenced fashion and paradoxically was often in vogue at times of anti-war feeling, such as in the late 1960s when protests against the [[Vietnam War]] were at their height (as, indeed, after the [[Iraq War]] of 2003): "One would have thought, given the unpopularity of armed forces activity in some quarters, that 'military chic' would not be, well, chic".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kessler, ''The Times'', 17 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi chic===
{{main|Nazi chic}}
[[Nazi chic]] is the incorporation of Nazi style clothing and culture, often used for shock value, as a form of rebellion against the status quo, although it is sometimes accompanied by a genuine sympathy for or adherence to the ideology of National Socialism.

===Northern chic===
Occasionally applied retrospectively&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The 60s: the Beatles' Decade'', UKtv 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to aspects of the musical and cultural boom generated by the rock group, [[the Beatles]], and other artists such as [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]] and [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]] in 1962-4 (the "[[Beat music|Mersey Sound]]"). "Northern" is a reference both to Northern England (as also with "[[Northern soul]]") and [[Northern Songs]], which published compositions by the Beatles' [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

===Parisian chic===
:Also known as ''Bon chic bon genre''
Frequently applied to anything stylish connected with the French capital [[Paris]] or to the style of French celebrities (''e.g.'' actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;London ''Evening Standard magazine'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or others living in Paris, such as the English actress [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;). Variants included '''"[[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]'''" or '''"[[Rive Droite|Right Bank]]'''" '''chic''' (or even "Left Bank chic versus Right Bank polish").&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Gainsbourg's mother, the British-born actress [[Jane Birkin]], remarked that she would choose "English eccentricity over Parisian chic every time", adding, "chic you can learn - it's just a form of grooming".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''bon chic bon genre''''' or '''''[[Max Azria|BCBG]]''''' ["good style, good class"] was applied in the early 1980s to the French equivalent of British "[[Chelsea chic|Sloane Rangers]]", their typical "uniform" including a [[mackintosh]], [[ballet shoes]], trousers, a [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater, and accessories such as a "[[Birkin bag]]" and a [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] Tank Française wrist-[[watch]].&lt;ref&gt;Carola Long in ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To a large extent, it refers to upper-class, or upper-middle-class, young men and women who are well-bred, or appear so, with good bones, slim bodies, and a sophisticated, but restrained and elegant, sense of style. In the U.S., the [[Ralph Lauren]] sense of style would be the equivalent.

===Porn chic===
{{main|Porno chic}}
"Porn chic" was first applied to films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[Emmanuelle]]'' (1974) which were commercially successful and thus tended to bring "soft" [[pornography]] into the mainstream. Subsequently it has been used to refer more generally to pornography in popular culture.

===Prairie chic===
Flat caps and floral dresses or aprons over jeans.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Daily Telegraph'', 16 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical chic===
{{main|Radical chic}}
:Also known as ''Terrorist chic''
First coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in 1970, '''radical chic''' has since entered broad usage as a derogatory term for the pretentious adoption of [[Political radicalism|radical]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]].

===Rich-girl chic===
Said to be "oozed" by a New York socialite in Plum Sykes' ''The Debutante Divorcée'' (2006).

===Rock-girl chic===
"Rock-girl chic" has meant different things during differing periods of music and fashion, but was often associated with a hippie image and was similar enough as a phrase to the slightly patronising "rock chick" to convey a sense of being a "[[groupie]]". This and similar terms, such as "[[boho-chic#Boho-rock|boho-rock]]" (2006), were often applied to model [[Kate Moss]], about whom Rebecca Ley from Times Online wrote that "Kate veers effortlessly between rock-girl chic and dripping-in-diamonds elegance".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article687726.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Moss's relationship in 2005–7 with [[Pete Doherty]] of the group [[Babyshambles]] tended to emphasise the tag.

===Rural chic===
Applied by the ''Sunday Times'' to a fashion collection designed and modelled by [[Savannah Miller]], [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]]-based sister of actress and 2000s (decade) "[[boho-chic|boho]]-queen" [[Sienna Miller]], for the [[Hong Kong]] based label, [[Shanghai Tang]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shabby chic===
{{main|Shabby chic}}
The deliberate use of worn and shabby materials in interior design or fashion. The effect of [[Whitewash|limewashing]] timber-framed buildings has been described as "shabby chic".&lt;ref&gt;James Boutwood, letter, ''Country Life'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soldier chic===
:''See [[Military chic]]''

===Talitha Getty===
:''See [[List of chics#Hippie chic|Hippie chic]]''

===Terrorist chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Radical chic|Radical chic]]''

===Tropical Chic===
Tropical and Beach themed home accents that are influenced by island styles and tropical designs. Tropical Chic style includes modern appointments, yet casual island style living.&lt;ref&gt;''Tropical Chic Style, Home Decorating News'', 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waif Chic===
Characterized by crochet-knit tops, over-sized sweaters that hang loosely off a thin frame, flats, and circle-frame glasses that accentuate a doe-eyed appearance.  Waif chic first came to prominence in Cambridge, MA and is a popular look among college students and young professionals in the area.

===Wilderness chic===
{{main|Wilderness chic}}
Fashion trend inspired by clothing typical of [[hikers]], [[climbing|climbers]], and [[mountaineers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27522">A '''literary language''' is the [[Register (sociolinguistics)|form]] of a [[language]] used in the [[writing]] of the language. It is typically a [[dialect]] or [[Standard language|standardised form]] of the language. It can sometimes differ noticeably from the various [[Spoken language|spoken]] forms of the language, but difference between literary and non-literary forms is greater in some languages than in others. Where there is a strong divergence between a written form and the spoken [[vernacular]], the language is said to exhibit [[diglossia]].

A related concept is [[Sacred language|liturgical writing]], which is the language or form of language used in the [[liturgy]] of some religions.

For much of its history, there has been a distinction in the English language between an elevated literary language and a colloquial language.&lt;ref name=Rissanen9&gt;Matti Rissanen, ''History of Englishes: New Methods and Interpretations in Historical Linguistics'', Walter de Gruyter, 1992, p9. {{ISBN|3-11-013216-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Norman conquest of England]], for instance, Latin and French displaced English as the official and literary languages,&lt;ref&gt;Elaine M. Treharne, ''Old and Middle English C.890-c.1400: An Anthology'', Blackwell Publishing, 2004, pxxi. {{ISBN|1-4051-1313-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard literary English did not emerge until the end of the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;Pat Rogers, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of English Literature'', Oxford University Press, 2001, p3. {{ISBN|0-19-285437-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time and into the [[Renaissance]], the practice of [[aureation]] (the introduction of terms from [[classical language]]s, often through poetry) was an important part of the reclamation of status for the English language, and many historically aureate terms are now part of general common usage. Modern English no longer has quite the same distinction between literary and colloquial registers.&lt;ref name=Rissanen9/&gt;

English has been used as a literary language in countries that were formerly part of the [[British Empire]], for instance in [[Indian English literature|India]] up to the present day,&lt;ref&gt;R.R.Mehrotra in Ofelia García, Ricardo Otheguy, ''English Across Cultures, Cultures Across English: A Reader in Cross-cultural Communication'', Walter de Gruyter, 1989, p422. {{ISBN|0-89925-513-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Languages of Malaysia|Malaysia]] in the early 20th century&lt;ref&gt;David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p104. {{ISBN|0-521-53033-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Languages of Nigeria|Nigeria]], where English remains the official language.

==Other languages==
{{See also|Standard language}}

===Arabic===
{{main article|Modern Standard Arabic}}

[[Modern Standard Arabic]] is the contemporary literary and standard register of [[Classical Arabic]] used in writing across all [[The Arab World|Arabic]]-speaking countries and any governing body with Arabic as an official language. Many western scholars distinguish two varieties: the Classical Arabic of the [[Qur'an]] and early Islamic (7th to 9th centuries) [[Arabic literature|literature]]; and Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the [[standard language]] in use today. The modern standard language is closely based on the Classical language, and most Arabs consider the two varieties to be two registers of the same language. Literary Arabic or classical Arabic is the official language of all Arab countries and is the only form of Arabic taught in schools at all stages {{Clarify|date=September 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

The sociolinguistic situation of Arabic in modern times provides a prime example of the linguistic phenomenon of [[diglossia]]—the use of two distinct varieties of the same language, usually in different social contexts. Educated Arabic speakers are usually able to communicate in MSA in formal situations. This diglossic situation facilitates [[code-switching]] in which a speaker switches back and forth between the two varieties of the language, sometimes even within the same sentence. In instances in which highly educated Arabic-speakers of different nationalities engage in conversation but find their dialects mutually unintelligible (e.g. a Moroccan speaking with a Kuwaiti), they are able to code switch into MSA for the sake of communication.

===Aramaic===

The [[Aramaic language]] has been diglossic for much of its history, with many different literary standards serving as the "high" liturgical languages, including [[Syriac language]], [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]], [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]], [[Samaritan Aramaic language]] and [[Mandaic language]], while the vernacular [[Neo-Aramaic languages]] serve as the vernacular language spoken by the common people like [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]], [[Hértevin language]], [[Koy Sanjaq Syriac language]], [[Senaya language]]), [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]], [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] ([[Mlahsô language]], [[Turoyo language]]), [[Neo-Mandaic]], [[Hulaulá language]], [[Lishana Deni]], [[Lishanid Noshan]], [[Lishán Didán]], [[Betanure Jewish Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Barzani Jewish Neo-Aramaic]].

===Armenian===
The [[Armenian language]] was a diglossic language for much of its history, with [[Classical Armenian]] serving as the "high" literary standard and liturgical language, and the [[Western Armenian]] and [[Eastern Armenian]] dialects serving as the vernacular language of the Armenian people. Western Armenian and Eastern Armenian were eventually standardized into their own literary forms.

===Bengali===

Standard [[Bengali language|Bengali]] has two forms:

*'''Chôlitôbhasha''', the vernacular standard based on the elite speech of [[Kolkata]]
*'''Shadhubhasha''', the literary standard, which employs more [[Sanskrit]]ized vocabulary and longer prefixes and suffixes.

Grammatically, the two forms are identical, and differing forms, such as verb conjugations, are easily converted from one form to another. However, the vocabulary is quite different from one form to the other and must be learned separately. Among the works of [[Rabindranath Tagore]] are examples of both shadhubhasha (especially among his earlier works) and chôlitôbhasha (especially among his later works). The [[national anthem of India]] was originally written in the shadhubhasha form of Bengali.

===Chinese===
{{main article|Classical Chinese}}

Literary Chinese, ''Wényánwén'' (文言文), "Literary Writing", is the form of written [[Chinese language|Chinese]] used from the end of the [[Han dynasty]] to the early 20th century when it was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]], or ''Baihua'' (白話) spoken according to [[Standard Mandarin]] pronunciation. Literary Chinese continually diverged from [[Classical Chinese]] as the dialects of China became more disparate and as the Classical written language became less representative of the [[Chinese spoken languages|spoken language]]. At the same time, Literary Chinese was based largely upon the Classical language, and writers frequently borrowed Classical language into their literary writings. Literary Chinese therefore shows a great deal of similarity to Classical Chinese, even though the similarity decreased over the centuries.

Starting from early 20th century, [[written vernacular Chinese]] have become a standard for Chinese writing which is mostly aligned with a standardized form of Mandarin Chinese, which however mean there are divergence between written vernacular Chinese against other Chinese variants like [[Cantonese]], [[Shanghainese]], [[Hokkien]] and [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]. Some of these variants have their own literary form but none of them are being used in formal register.

===Finnish===
The [[Finnish language]] has a literary variant, literary Finnish, and a spoken variant, [[spoken Finnish]]. Both are considered a form of non-dialectal standard language, and are used throughout the country. Literary Finnish is a consciously created fusion of dialects for use as a literary language, which is rarely spoken at all, being confined to writing and official speeches.

===Georgian===
The [[Georgian language]] has a literary liturgical form, the [[Old Georgian language]], while the vernacular spoken varieties are the [[Georgian dialects]] and other related [[Kartvelian languages]] like [[Svan language]], [[Mingrelian language]], and [[Laz language]].

=== German ===
{{main article|Standard German}}

[[German language|German]] differentiates between ''Hochdeutsch''/''Standarddeutsch'' ([[Standard German]]) and ''Umgangssprache'' (colloquial language). Amongst the differences is the regular use of the [[genitive case]] or the simple past tense ''[[preterite|Präteritum]]'' in written language. In colloquial German genitive phrases ("des Tages") are frequently replaced with a construction of "von" + [[dative case|dative]] object ("von dem Tag") - comparable to English "the dog's tail" vs. "the tail of the dog" - likewise the ''Präteritum'' ("ich ging") can be substituted with the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] ("ich bin gegangen") to a certain degree. Nevertheless, the use of neither the ''Präteritum'' nor especially the genitive case is totally unusual in colloquial language, just quite rare, yet also depending on a region's dialect and/or the grade of education of the speaker. People of higher education use the genitive more regularly in colloquial language and the use of perfect instead of ''Präteritum'' is especially common in southern Germany, where the ''Präteritum'' is considered somewhat declamatory. The German ''Konjunktiv I / II'' ("er habe" / "er hätte") is also used more regularly in written form being replaced by the conditional ("er würde geben") in colloquial language, although in some southern German dialects the ''Konjunktiv II'' is used more often. Generally there is a continuum between more dialectical varieties to more standard varieties in German, while colloquial German nonetheless tends to increase [[Analytic language|analytic elements]] at the expense of [[Synthetic language|synthetic elements]].

===Greek===
{{main article|Katharevousa}}

From the early nineteenth century until the mid-20th century, ''[[Katharevousa]]'', a form of [[Greek language|Greek]], was used for literary purposes. In later years, ''Katharevousa'' was used only for official and formal purposes (such as politics, letters, official documents, and newscasting) while ''[[Modern Greek|Dhimotiki]]'', ‘demotic’ or popular Greek, was the daily language. This created a [[diglossia|diglossic situation]] until in 1976 ''Dhimotiki'' was made the official language.

===Hebrew===
During the [[revival of the Hebrew language]], spoken and literary Hebrew were revived separately, causing a dispersion between the two. The dispersion started to narrow sometime after the two movements merged, but substantial differences between the two still exist until nowadays.

===Italian===

When Italy was [[Italian unification|unified]], in 1861, [[Italian language|Italian]] existed mainly as a literary language. Different languages were spoken throughout the Italian Peninsula, many of which were [[Romance language]]s which had developed in every region, due to the political fragmentation of Italy. Now, it is the [[standard language]] of Italy.

===Japanese===
Until the late 1940s, the prominent literary language in Japan was the [[Classical Japanese language]] (文語 "Bungo"), which is based on the language spoken in [[Heian period]] ([[Late Old Japanese]]) and is different from the [[Japanese language|contemporary Japanese language]] in grammar and some vocabulary. It still has relevance for historians, literary scholars, and lawyers (many Japanese laws that survived [[World War II]] are still written in ''bungo'', although there are ongoing efforts to modernize their language). Bungo grammar and vocabulary are occasionally used in modern Japanese for effect, and fixed form poetries like [[Haiku]] and [[Waka (poetry)|Tanka]] are still mainly written in this form.

In the [[Meiji period]], some authors started to use the colloquial form of the language in their literature. Following the government policy after the [[World War II]], the standard form of contemporary Japanese language is used for most literature published since the 1950s. The standard language is based on the colloquial language in [[Tokyo]] area, and its literary stylistics in polite form differs little from its formal speech. Notable characteristics of literary language in contemporary Japanese would include more frequent use of Chinese origin words, less use of expressions against [[prescriptive grammar]] such as "ら抜き言葉", and use of non-polite normal form ("-だ/-である") stylistics that are rarely used in colloquial language.

===Javanese===
In the [[Javanese language]], [[alphabet]] characters derived from the alphabets used to write [[Sanskrit]], no longer in ordinary use, are used in literary words as a mark of respect.

===Kannada===

[[Kannada language|Kannada]] exhibits a strong [[diglossia]], like [[Tamil language|Tamil]], also characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style, and a modern [[colloquial]] form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.

The formal style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of [[Kannada literature]] and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio.

There are also many dialects of Kannada, one major dialect being ''Dharwad Kannada'' of [[North Karnataka]].

=== Latin ===
[[Classical Latin]] was the literary register used in writing from 75 BC to the 3rd century AD, while [[Vulgar Latin]] was the common, spoken variety used across the [[Roman Empire]]. The Latin brought by Roman soldiers to [[Gaul]], [[Hispania|Iberia]], or [[Dacia]] was not identical to the Latin of [[Cicero]], and differed from it in vocabulary, syntax, and grammar.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;[[L.R. Palmer]] The Latin Language (repr. Univ. Oklahoma 1988, {{ISBN|0-8061-2136-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; Some literary works with [[Register (sociolinguistics)|low-register language]] from the Classical Latin period give a glimpse into the world of early Vulgar Latin. The works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], being [[comedy|comedies]] with many characters who were [[Slavery|slave]]s, preserve some early [[basilectal]] Latin features, as does the recorded speech of the freedmen in the ''[[Cena Trimalchionis]]'' by [[Petronius Arbiter]]. At the third [[Council of Tours]] in 813, [[priest]]s were ordered to preach in the vernacular language—either in the ''rustica lingua romanica'' (Vulgar Latin), or in the [[Old High German|Germanic vernaculars]]—since the common people could no longer understand formal Latin.

===Macedonian===
Macedonian (/ˌmæsɪˈdoʊniən/; македонски, tr. makedonski, pronounced [maˈkɛdɔnski ˈjazik] (About this sound listen)) is a South Slavic language spoken as a first language by around two million people, principally in the Republic of Macedonia and the Macedonian diaspora, with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational region of Macedonia. It is the official language of the Republic of Macedonia and a recognized minority language in parts of Albania, Romania and Serbia.

===Malay===
The [[Malay language]] exists in a Classical variety, a modern standard variety and several vernacular dialects.

===Maltese===
[[Maltese language|Maltese]] has a variety of dialects (including the [[Żejtun dialect]], [[Qormi dialect]] and [[Gozitan]] amongst others) that co-exist alongside Standard Maltese. Literary Maltese, unlike Standard Maltese, features a preponderance of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] vocabulary and grammatical patterns; however, this traditional separation between Semitic and [[romance language|Romance]] influences in [[Maltese literature]] (especially Maltese poetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aboutmalta.com/language/poetry.html|title=AccountSupport|author=|date=|website=aboutmalta.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Catholic liturgy]] on the island) is changing.

===Manchu===
Standard [[Manchu language|Manchu]] was based on the language spoken by the [[Jianzhou Jurchens]] during [[Nurhaci|Nurhaci's]] time, while other unwritten Manchu dialects such as that of [[Aigun]] and [[Sanjiazi]] were also spoken in addition to the related [[Xibe language]].

===Mongolian===
The [[Classical Mongolian language]] was the high register used for religious and official purposes, while the various Mongolian dialects served as the low register, like [[Khalkha Mongolian]], [[Chakhar Mongolian]], [[Khorchin Mongolian]], [[Kharchin Mongolian]], [[Baarin Mongolian]], [[Ordos Mongolian]] and the [[Buryat language]]. The [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] was translated into Classical Mongolian. The [[Oirats|Oirat Mongols]] who spoke the [[Oirat language|Oirat Mongol language]] and dialects like [[Kalmyk language]] or [[Torgut Oirat]] used a separate standard written with the [[Clear script]].

The [[Mongolian language]], based on Khalkha Mongolian, now serves as the high register in [[Mongolia]] itself while in [[Inner Mongolia]] a standard Mongolian based on Chakhar Mongolian serves as the high register for all Mongols in China. The Buryat language, which is seen by some as part of the Mongolian language, has been turned into a standard literary form itself in Russia.

===N'Ko===
[[N'Ko language|N'Ko]] is a literary language devised by [[Solomana Kante]] in 1949 as a writing system for the [[Mande languages]] of [[West Africa]]. It blends the principal elements of the mutually unintelligible [[Manding languages]]. The movement promoting N'Ko literacy was instrumental in shaping the [[Maninka]] cultural identity in Guinea, and has also strengthened the Mande identity in other parts of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Oyler, Dianne White (1994) ''Mande identity through literacy, the N'ko writing system as an agent of cultural nationalism''. Toronto : African Studies Association.&lt;/ref&gt; N'Ko publications include a translation of the [[Qur'an]], a variety of textbooks on subjects such as [[physics]] and [[geography]], poetic and philosophical works, descriptions of traditional medicine, a dictionary, and several local newspapers.

===Persian===
[[Persian language|Persian]] or New Persian has been used continually as the literary language of Iran and Afghanistan, as well as India and Central Asia, for over a millennium. The language written today remains essentially the same as that used by [[Ferdowsi]] despite variant colloquial dialects and forms. Until the 20th century, every educated person from the [[Bosphorus]] to the [[Bay of Bengal]] would be expected to know some Persian. It was the second major vehicle after Arabic in transmitting Islamic culture and has a particularly prominent place in Sufism. It remains a in active use in the [[Indian subcontinent]] among traditionally educated Muslim, although its former position has been occupied to a great degree by [[Urdu]]. There are prominent Persian writers from Modern [[Turkey]], such as [[Rumi]] and [[Uzbekistan]], such as [[Jami]]. The corpus of literary writing in Persian from the Indian subcontinent is greater than that of Iran and [[Central Asia]].

===Serbian===
 {{main article|Slavonic-Serbian}}
[[Slavonic-Serbian]] (''slavenosrpski'') was the literary language of [[Serbs]] in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] used from the mid-18th century to 1825. It was a linguistic blend of [[Church Slavonic]] of the Russian recension, [[vernacular]] Serbian ([[Štokavian dialect]]), and [[Russian language|Russian]]. At the beginning of the 19th century, it was severely attacked by [[Vuk Karadžić]] and his followers, whose reformatory efforts formed modern literary Serbian based on the popular language, known as [[Serbo-Croatian]].

===Tagalog===
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] was the basis of the [[Filipino language]]; both share the same vocabulary and grammatical system and are mutually intelligible. However, there is a significant political and social history that underlies the reasons for differentiating between Tagalog and Filipino.

Modern Tagalog is derived from [[Archaic Tagalog]], which was likely spoken during the [[History of the Philippines (900-1521)|Classical period]], it was the language of the [[Ma-i|Mai State]], [[Kingdom of Tondo|Tondo Dynasty]] (according to the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]) and southern [[Luzon]]. It was written using [[Baybayin]], a syllabary which is a member of the [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]] family, before the Spanish Romanised the alphabet beginning in the late 15th century. Tagalog was also the spoken language of the 1896 [[Philippine Revolution]].

The [[1987 Constitution]] maintains that Filipino is the country’s national language and one of two official languages, alongside English. Today, Filipino is considered the proper term for the language of the Philippines, especially by Filipino-speakers who are not of Tagalog origin, with many referring to the Filipino language as “Tagalog-based". The language is taught in schools throughout the country and is the official language of education and business. Native Tagalog-speakers meanwhile comprise one of the largest linguistic and cultural groups of the Philippines, numbering an estimated 14 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/Tagalog/|title=Tagalog - Language Information &amp; Resources|author=|date=|website=www.alsintl.com|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamil===
[[Tamil language|Tamil]] exhibits a strong [[diglossia]], characterised by three styles: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language, a modern literary and formal style and a modern [[colloquial]] form. These styles shade into each other, forming a diglossic continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Schiffman, "[http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/messeas/diglossia/handbuk.html Diglossia as a Sociolinguistic Situation]", in Florian Coulmas (ed.), ''The Handbook of Sociolinguistics''. London: Basil Blackwell, Ltd., 1997 at pp. 205 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern literary style is generally used in formal writing and speech. It is, for example, the language of textbooks, of much of [[Tamil literature]] and of public speaking and debate. Novels, even popular ones, will use the literary style for all description and narration and use the colloquial form only for dialogue, if they use it at all. In recent times, however, the modern colloquial form has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of the modern literary style: for instance most [[film|cinema]], [[theatre]] and popular entertainment on television and radio.

===Tibetan===
[[Classical Tibetan]] was the high register used universally by all Tibetans while the various mutually unintelligible [[Tibetic languages]] serve as the low register vernacular, like [[Central Tibetan language]] in [[Ü-Tsang]] (Tibet proper), [[Khams Tibetan]] in [[Kham]], [[Amdo Tibetan]] in [[Amdo]], [[Ladakhi language]] in [[Ladakh]] and [[Dzongkha]] in [[Bhutan]]. Classical Tibetan was used for official and religious purposes, such as in Tibetan Buddhist religious texts like the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon]] and taught and learned in monasteries and schools in Tibetan Buddhist regions.

Now, [[Standard Tibetan]], based on the Lhasa dialect, serves as the high register in China. In Bhutan, the Tibetan [[Dzongkha]] language has been standardised and replaced Classical Tibetan for official purposes and education, in [[Ladakh]], the standard official language learned are now the unrelated languages [[Hindi-Urdu]] and English, and in [[Baltistan]], the Tibetan [[Balti language]] serves as the low register while the unrelated [[Urdu language]] is the official language.

===Uzbek and Uyghur===
The Turkic [[Chagatai language]] served as the high register literary standard for Central Asian Turkic peoples, while the vernacular low register languages were the [[Uzbek language]] and [[Uyghur language|Eastern Turki (Modern Uyghur)]]. The [[Soviet Union]] abolished Chagatai as the literary standard and had the [[Uzbek language]] standardized as a literary language for, and the [[Taranchi]] dialect of Ili was chosen as the literary standard for Modern Uyghur, while other dialects like the Kashgar and Turpan dialects continue to be spoken.

===Yorùbá===
[[File:Samuel Adjai Crowther 1888.jpg|thumb|right|100px|[[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel Crowther]]'s Yorùbá grammar led to [[Standard Yoruba]] becoming a literary language.]]
{{main article|Standard Yoruba}}
[[Standard Yoruba]] is the literary form of the [[Yoruba language]] of [[West Africa]], the standard variety learnt at school and that spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther|Samuel A. Crowther]], native Yoruba and the first African Anglican Bishop in Nigeria, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the [[Oyo State|Ọyọ]] and [[Ibadan]] dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for example the following remark by Adetugbọ (1967, as cited in Fagborun 1994:25): "While the orthography agreed upon by the missionaries represented to a very large degree the phonemes of the Abẹokuta dialect, the morpho-syntax reflected the Ọyọ-Ibadan dialects".&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it has some features peculiar to itself only, for example the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as [[calque]]s from English which originated in early translations of religious works. The first novel in the Yorùbá language was ''[[Ogboju Ode ninu Igbo Irunmale]]'' (''The Forest of A Thousand Demons''), written in 1938 by Chief [[Daniel O. Fagunwa]] (1903–1963). Other writers in the Yorùbá language include: Senator [[Afolabi Olabimtan]] (1932–1992) and [[Akinwunmi Isola]].

The World's '''Most Phallic Building contest''' was a contest held in 2003 by ''[[Cabinet (magazine)|Cabinet]]'' magazine to find the building which most resembled a [[human penis|human phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lisa |last=Gutierrez |title=Another claim to fame for Liberty Memorial |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=KC&amp;p_theme=kc&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FFE6184248A5271&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=2003-12-29 |accessdate=2008-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music on hold''' ('''MOH''') is the business practice of playing recorded [[music]] to fill the silence that would be heard by [[telephone]] callers who have been placed [[Hold (telephone)|on hold]].  It is especially common in situations involving [[customer service]].

Music on hold is sometimes referred to as phone on hold, message on hold, on hold messaging, or hold music.

==Development==
Music on hold was created by Alfred Levy, an inventor, factory owner, and entrepreneur. In 1962, Levy discovered a problem with the phone lines at his factory. He discovered that a loose wire was touching a metal girder on the building. This made the building a giant receiver so that the audio broadcast signal from a radio station next door would transmit through the loose wire and could be heard when calls were put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://callsonhold.com/recognition.htm|title=Smithsonian recognizes Music on Hold. |publisher=CallsonHold.com |date=2005-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Levy patented his work in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=PZ9lAAAAEBAJ&amp;printsec=abstract&amp;zoom=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Google Patent for Telephone Hold Program System  |publisher=google.com/patents |date=2013-07-06 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other advancements have come to change and enhance the technology, it was this initial patent creation that began the evolution for today's music on hold.

==Equipment and formats==
Most MOH systems are integrated into a telephone system designed for businesses via an [[jack (connector)|audio jack]] on the [[telephone]] equipment labeled "MOH". There are also some units with built-in message on hold capabilities and units designed for small businesses without an extensive phone system.

Today, equipment that supports physical media usually plays [[Compact disk|CDs]]. Some older systems may still use [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tapes]] (sometimes employing endless-loops), or [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape players. In each case, the unit loads the media into a digital memory chip to prevent premature wearing of the mechanical parts.

Equipment that supports virtual media generally plays [[MP3]] files. Several types of units play these files. [[USB Flash Drive]] units allow an MP3 file to be received electronically, downloaded to a flash drive and connected to the player. Ethernet based remote load units connect via the network to a remote IP address. Phone line based remote load systems allow for a connection via an analog telephone line and dialing the number belonging to the unit.  For [[Voice over internet protocol|VoIP]] phone systems, MP3s are loaded without any equipment.

Newer technology allows MP3 files to be downloaded automatically from the internet so that messages (or interesting content in the form of news and weather, amongst many) can be changed daily. The new "online on hold" technology makes the older technology redundant since it requires no additional hardware.  All these systems allow analog-to-digital audio storage and playback.

As of 2011 allow productions to be downloaded via the Internet or played through a USB flash drive. This allows for larger files and higher quality formats. Grace Digital manufactures internet radio devices that play streaming content (see Recent Trends, below).

==Consumer perceptions==
A number of studies have been conducted, which highlight consumer perceptions of music on hold, reinforcing its use by businesses to improve standards of call handling.

A survey of more than 2,000 UK consumers commissioned by audio branding specialist [[PHMG (company)]] revealed 70% of consumers are put on hold for more than 50% of their calls. When put on hold, 73% of callers want to hear something other than beeps or silence.&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.freshbusinessthinking.com/news.php?NID=14476&amp;Title=Seventy+per+cent+of+consumers+put+on+hold+for+longer+than+a+minute |title=Seventy per cent of consumers put on hold for longer than a minute |publisher=freshbusinessthinking.com |date=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusiness.co.uk/channels/sales-and-marketing/news/2110543/customers-perennially-on-hold.thtml |title=Customers perennially on hold |publisher=smallbusiness.co.uk |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A CNN survey found that 70 percent of callers in the United States who hold the line in silence hang up within 60 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://work.chron.com/importance-onhold-messages-4665.html |title=The Importance of On-Hold Messages |author=Anna Assad |publisher=Houston Chronicle |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, research by North American Telecom found callers hearing music on hold will stay on the line 30 seconds longer than callers experiencing silence.

==Source of music==

===Radio===
The musical source may be as simple as playing a local [[radio station]] through the MOH jack.  This is unlawful without the express permission of the music title and mechanical copyright holders.
* Although radio stations may provide the desired [[List of music radio formats|musical format]], there is no control over the specific songs that are played, some of which may be offensive to the callers, or depending on the music played, sound harsh in [[monaural]] sound. This kind of system is also vulnerable to interference.
* Radio stations typically do not [[license]] their music for MOH systems.  In the United States, the radio broadcaster has no legal right to provide such a license as they, themselves, obtain a usage license from the music title owner for the right to broadcast said music for limited and personal use.  As mentioned below, re-broadcasting of a radio program over a phone system may likely cause licensing and [[copyright]] problems for the owner of the MOH system.
* Most radio stations (excluding those that are part of [[non-commercial educational]] radio networks) will play [[advertising|commercials]], which may be offensive or at least annoying to the caller.  Furthermore, it is possible that a [[competition|competitor's]] commercial may be played, which would be counter-productive.

:See ''[[#Legal aspects|Legal aspects]]''.

Owners of radio stations will usually air their broadcast signal as music on hold, using their main program signal, if there are several.  Examples include [[RÚV]] from [[Iceland]] using [[Rás 1]] as the on-hold music.

===Off-the-shelf commercial CDs===
{{main article|Commercial off-the-shelf}}

Commercial CDs eliminate the problems encountered with radio commercials, and they offer control over the selection of music; they do not, however, grant proper license for MOH use unless users first obtain permission from the song title copyright owner (when the song is not in the "public domain") and the mechanical copyright owner. (See "Radio," above, for more details.)

===Stock MOH CDs (with or without voice-overs)===
CDs are available that have been specifically recorded and licensed for MOH systems.  These may contain only music, or may include periodic [[voice-over]]s with messages such as "Your call is important" or "Please stay on the line".  Such off-the-shelf recordings may be generic or may be specific to individual industries, but will not be customized for individual companies.

===Custom-designed MOH===
In general, custom music on hold is advised to:
#Control content
#Control music genre
#Use the on hold time to sell to a captive audience
#Through a reputable on hold company be fully licensed and legal for on hold playback
#Reduce hang-ups and make the business look more professional
#Control length of programming based on average caller holdtime

CDs (or other MOH formats, such as MP3 files) can be custom-created to suit the particular needs of a business.  The announcements can be scripted to emphasize particular attributes of the business such as location, store hours, or special promotions or services. These are typically used for up-selling and cross-selling callers. Companies can either record the messages themselves, or hire a music on hold production company.

===Online on hold===
A program loaded onto an existing computer and connected to the phone system can allow automatic content updates interspersed with company information.

===Streaming MOH===
Streaming MOH refers to a live music on hold stream (URL-based delivery) which can also include custom content. Streams in http .mp3 format include those provided by easyonhold.com. Streaming MOH can also refer to a streaming media server, as with Cisco Unified Call Manager, in which case RTP format is utilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cisco Unified Communications SRND Based on Cisco Unified CallManager 4.x - Music on Hold  [Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CallManager)] - Cisco Systems|url = http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/cucm/srnd/4x/42moh.html#wp1043752|website = www.cisco.com|access-date = 2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free on-hold programs===
Programs available to non-profit organizations at no cost. Very few companies offer absolutely free programs. The programs are available in generic and custom formats, and are delivered at no cost to the requesting organization.

==Styles of music==
The style of music played by MOH systems depends largely on the type of business offering the service.  It is generally best to present music that will not be offensive to the audience, but that would also be of particular interest to the typical caller. A western apparel store may choose to play [[country music]]. A Christian book store may choose to play popular [[Christian music]]. A university may choose to play [[European classical music|classical music]]. An athletic ticket office may choose to play the team or school's [[fight song]]. Light classics, [[smooth jazz]], and [[beautiful music]] are common choices, as is fully [[synthesizer|synthesized]] melodic music.

The most common MOH is "Opus Number One", which is on "65 million Cisco phone sets worldwide as the default hold music," according to a ''This American Life'' podcast (number 516). The composer, Tim Carleton, recorded the song in 1989 on a four-track tape recorder with Darrick Deel. When Deel, who works at Cisco, told Carleton their song could be the default music on hold, Carleton also approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Ira|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/516/stuck-in-the-middle|publisher=This American Life|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent trends==
With the application of newer equipment, music on hold devices can now interact with the caller. No additional programs are required on the platform, as all the logic is done with the MoH device. This can include services such as 'polling on hold', rating your customer service officer anonymously, etc. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The trend toward hosted IP telephony for business phone systems is demanding changes in music on hold message technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=Tom|title=The IP Transition: Starting Now|journal=FCC Blog|date=November 19, 2013|pages=1|url=http://www.fcc.gov/blog/ip-transition-starting-now}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November, 2013, EasyOnHold.com introduced custom messages on hold streams for use with [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] and OnSIP phone systems.

==Legal aspects==

===Copyright law===
In the US, and other countries where [[copyright law]]s are practiced, authors are granted copyright protection on their musical compositions. Such copyright protection has existed since just after the turn of the 20th century and most music written prior to 1900-1910 - from impressionism back to baroque and antiquity are said to be  "in the [[public domain]]." Use of any said music prior to the creation of these copyright laws may be presumed to be free for use by all - although individual titles may have been later copyrighted through a change in the composition or arrangement. The use of copyrighted music is not for free use in the public domain.

All music written after this period, which is copyrighted under multiple acts of congress, are owned by the author(s) or their assignees.  The use of this music is protected and controlled in order that the owner may derive usage income. Specific to telephonic MOH (music-on-hold), the US laws currently protect the copyright owners from unlawful, unpermitted use of their music titles in over-the-phone broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundcommunication.holdcom.com/bid/96828/Everything-You-Need-To-Know-About-Music-Licensing |title=Everything You Need To Know About Music Licensing |author=J. Durante |publisher=Sound Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any person or business wishing to use current, popular, post 1900-1910, copyrighted music for MOH purposes may only lawfully do so by obtaining permission from the owner.  Currently, performance rights societies such as ASCAP, BMI and SESAC will sell blanket permission to use music titles in their catalog for MOH purposes—for an express annual fee - calculated by size and frequency of usage. Failure to obtain this paid permission is a violation of US copyright laws.

This same copyright protection is also true in the rebroadcast of any radio program. As mentioned earlier, the broadcaster has been assigned a narrow and specific usage license to air copyrighted song titles. This does not include permission to any person or business to re-broadcast that program on telephonic MOH. The broadcaster may not promote such unlawful use and is not an owner who has any lawful right to grant MOH usage permission. They do not hold the ownership of the title and have no right to license use in any way. Those who plug radio broadcast into their telephone MOH without first obtaining paid permission through the owner's agents (ASCAP, BMI or SESAC) may be in violation of copyright law and may be prosecuted under existing federal laws.

===Mechanical copyright===
A second copyright exists when it comes to licensing use for telephonic MOH. A piece of music, as mentioned above, is copyrighted and may be licensed for use as a music title and is understood to be a combination of melody, harmony and, where applicable, lyrics.  However, neither radio listeners nor MOH listeners could hear this music unless it was recorded - providing a delivery medium whereby the "music" becomes a "performance."  As mentioned elsewhere, in countries such as the US, where said copyright laws are enforced, nearly every recording of a song title holds its own "mechanical copyright."

For most of the 20th century, music was recorded in studios, produced by record company executives, producers, arrangers and engineers who were hired to deliver the artist's finished recordings for mastering and duplication - for sale on the varied media: 78, 45 and 33 RPM vinyl, reel-to-reel, 8-track tape, cassette and [[compact disc]].  To protect their investment, the record companies obtain a mechanical copyright in order to protect and control the recording with which they derive usage and sales income.  (For those still uncertain of the difference between "song title" and "mechanical" copyrights,  consider the Capitol Records lawsuit for copyright infringement against Nike some 20 years ago.  Nike legally obtained permission to use the Beatles song title "Revolution" from the title's owner, Michael Jackson. They used the Capitol Records owned recording of the Beatles' performance, but failed to obtain and pay for permission and use.  Capitol Records sued and prevailed because Nike ONLY had a license to use the title and did not have a license to use the mechanical recording.)

Therefore, persons or businesses wishing to play music that falls "in the public domain" are still legally required to obtain permission to use the mechanical recording of this music, from the mechanical copyright holder.'''  '''And where the use is of copyrighted music, the same applies.  In all cases, before a song title may be broadcast on a telephone MOH, said use must be approved and licensed from BOTH the "song title" copyright owner (if it is NOT in public domain) and the "mechanical" copyright owner. '''

===Enforcement===
It is generally known within the on-hold industry that some performance rights societies, with regional offices and staff, both monitor and prosecute persons and businesses that infringe on the copyright of title holders in their libraries. [[ASCAP]] and [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] are both aggressive about this, from time to time. It is not known whether any record companies are currently or actively monitoring and prosecuting violators of their mechanical license.

[[File:Nadir Afonso and his art.jpg|thumb|Nadir Afonso in his studio, standing next to ''Seville'' (first decade of 21st century [2007], ''Cities'' series), canvas still unmounted.]]

All data was sourced from websites (linked to) and from the books and catalogues listed in the main [[Nadir Afonso]] article.

==Paintings==

Titles are shown in their original language as conceived by the artist, and translated if needed, except the titles made of place names, which are shown in the English form. Multiple-source inconsistencies are shown in the Notes column. The artist's method usually involves one or more studies before the final artwork, which sometimes is revealed only years later; the artist also sometimes returns to work on artworks after they are publicly exhibited. This explains some of the multiple or alternative dates.

}}
'''Philippine American Women Writers and Artists''' also known as '''PAWWA''' was founded in 1991 by a group of seven [[Filipino people|Filipina]] writers in Southern California.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Yuson|first= Alfred|title= Fil-Am: The Filipino American Experience|page=149|place= Makati City|publisher=Publico|year= 1999|isbn= 9719211008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first such support group for Filipina women writers. Aside from supporting one another, the group wanted to help other Filipina writers and artists, as well as to provide community service. PAWWA encouraged the creation of PAWWA-North, headed by Ceres Alabado in the [[Bay Area]], California.

PAWWA's founding members are: Valorie Slaughter Bejarano, [[Cecilia Manguerra Brainard]], Mariquita Athena Davison, Fe Panalingan Koons, Susan N. Montepio, Cecile Caguingin Ochoa, and Nentuzka C. Villamar. 

For six years, PAWWA received the highly competitive Multicultural Entry Grant from the [[California Arts Council]] (CAC). PAWWA used that funding to help publish a newsletter and books: ''Seven Stories from Seven Sisters: A Collection of Philippine Folktales'' (1992); ''The Beginning and Other Asian Folktales'' (1995);''A Directory of Philippine American Women Writers and Artists''; and ''Journey of 100 Years: Reflections on the Centennial of Philippine Independence'' (1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Brainard|first= Cecilia|title= Journey of 100 Years: Reflections on the Centennial of Philippine Independence|page=ii|place= Santa Monica|publisher=PAWWA |year= 1999|isbn= 0963228102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 1998, PAWWA and the Asian Pacific Student Services of Loyola Marymount University held a one-day conference entitled "Journey of 100 Years."  Presenters were : [[Cecilia Manguerra Brainard]], Maria Luisa Carino (or Maria Luisa Igloria), Rosita Galang, Paulino Lim, Jr., Edmundo Litton, Herminia Menez, Susan Montepio, and Nadine Sarreal.  An offshoot of that conference was the book, ''Journey of 100 Years''. 

When PAWWA's CAC funding ran out in June 1998, the remaining members of PAWWA decided to move on, and PAWWA was dissolved.

[[File:Domesday zinco Somerset Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A page from the photozincographic edition of Domesday Book for ''[[Somerset|Somersetshire]]'' (published in 1862), showing entries for some of the landholdings of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]
In the 1860s the first [[facsimile]] of [[Domesday Book]] was created by the process of [[photozincography]] (later termed ''zinco''), and was executed under the directorship of [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] at the [[Southampton]] offices of the [[Ordnance Survey]].

==Initial stages==
Having developed the photozincographic process, in a meeting arranged between James and [[William Ewart Gladstone]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], Sir Henry expressed his ability to produce photozincographic copies of ancient documents at "a very trifling cost".&lt;ref&gt;H. James, ''Domesday Book, or The Great Survey of England of William the Conqueror...Fac-Simile of the Part Relating to Cornwall'', (Southampton: by H.M. Command, 1860), pp. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; James outlined for his superiors the cost of a complete reproduction of Domesday Book (an estimate of £1575 for 500 copies or £3.3s per copy) using his process. In addition to this James further outlined the cost of a single county to demonstrate the affordability of the process, using Cornwall as an example of one of the shorter entries in the volumes (eleven folio pages) and estimated the cost of 500 copies to be £11. 2s. 4d. In doing so he selected the first extract of Domesday Book that he would photozincograph.

On 24 January 1861, Sir Henry was granted permission to photozincograph the [[Cornwall]] fragment of Domesday as a Treasury funded experiment to determine the success of the process. [[Joseph Burtt]], one of the Assistant Keepers of the Records was directed to assist the Record Office binder, Hood, to unbind the relevant pages from Domesday  and on Monday 4 February 1861 Burtt transported Domesday to Southampton by train.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domesday Book in Southampton==
[[File:OS Map of Southampton new.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1865 map showing the photography building and the Ordnance Survey offices]]
On arrival at the Ordnance Survey offices in Southampton, Burtt expressed his satisfaction with the buildings' "fireproof principles, and…military guard", and was given use of the best room in the building in which Domesday was placed in a fireproof safe, and the key entrusted to Burtt. Burtt’s description of the preparations extends to the actual photozincographic process, including James’s insistence that all plates should be developed and printed before the folios were returned. Nevertheless, the photozincography of Cornwall was completed in 11 days and Burtt returned to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;PRO 1/25 16 Feb. 1861&lt;/ref&gt; The process was carried out in the Ordnance Survey photography building nicknamed the glasshouse.

==Permissions and difficulties==
Having completed Cornwall, James requested permission to photozincograph the rest of Domesday. Despite his claim that the public sale of the bound and engraved copies could cover the entire cost of the photozincography of the counties, the Lords of the Treasury wished to consult the [[Master of the Rolls]] regarding the comparison of James’s photozincographic reproductions with a rival process employed by [[Lambert Larking|Rev. Lambert Larking]] of Kent.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hallam, ''Domesday Book: Through Nine Centuries'', (London: Guild Publishing, 1986), p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; Larking (a local antiquarian) had employed an artist to assist the reproduction of the county of Kent using the lithographic process - a much more expensive means of reproduction than photozincography. However, in order to secure this permission over Larking's process James had to provide the Treasury with evidence of public interest and a guarantee of low-cost production. [[Thomas Letts]] of Letts Son &amp; Co. Limited, London distributed a circular nationally  bearing a foreword from James encouraging subscription, and by late October more than fifty subscribers to each county had been amassed. On 28 November 1861 Burtt returned to Southampton once more with Domesday for the aforementioned counties’ photozincographing, and by December James had secured permission from the Treasury to copy the remainder of Great Domesday – but he was explicitly forbidden from reproducing Kent, in defence of Larking’s lithograph. By 1864 the facsimile of the entirety of Great Domesday had been completed, and had been published in 32 county volumes including Kent following Larking's death, who granted James permission to complete the reproduction of the county due to his infirmity in the final stages of his life.&lt;ref&gt;T. Owen &amp; E. Pilbeam, ''Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791'', (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; 

The volumes were published in two colours (red and black), replicating the colours used in the original manuscript.

==Today==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The books which were printed by James's method are still sought after even if they are not up to the standard of later facsimiles. His edition of ''Domesday Book'' is still the only facsimile of it available and can be found reasonably cheaply, whereas the letterpress is extremely rare and very expensive."
&lt;/blockquote&gt; G. Wakeman, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography'', (Wymondham: Brewhouse Press, 1970), p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ricard Prize''' (or '''Prix Ricard S.A.''') was founded in 1999 and in 2006 its name changed to '''Prix Fondation d’Entreprise Ricard'''. The prize is awarded each year during the Parisian art fair FIAC by a committee of French collectors (friends of the [[Centre Pompidou]], Jeu de Paume, [[Palais de Tokyo]], and FRAC Nord-Pas-de-Calais) to an artist under forty featured in an annual group show curated by a different curator each year. The Prize consists of buying an artwork for 10,000 euros minimum from the prize winner, which is then donated to the Musée National d'Art Moderne ([[Centre Pompidou]]) to be part of their permanent collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42143">The '''Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce''' ({{lang-de|Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg}} or ''ERR'') was a [[Nazi Party]] organization dedicated to appropriating cultural property during the [[Second World War]]. It was led by the chief ideologue of the Nazi Party, [[Alfred Rosenberg]], from within the [[NSDAP Office of Foreign Affairs]] (''Außenpolitischen Amt der NSDAP'' or ''APA''). Between 1940 and 1945, the ERR operated in [[France]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Poland]], the [[Baltic States]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]] and on the territory of the Soviet Union in the ''[[Reichskommissariat Ostland]]'' and ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]''. Much of the looted material was recovered by the Allies after the war, and returned to rightful owners, but there remains a substantial part that has been lost or remains with the Allied powers.

==Formation==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-067-10, Alfred Rosenberg.jpg|thumb|200px|Alfred Rosenberg in 1939]]

The ERR was initially a project of ''[[Advanced School of the NSDAP|Hohe Schule der NSDAP]]'', a Nazi-oriented elite university, which was subordinate to [[Alfred Rosenberg]]. Rosenberg wanted it to be a research institute filled with cultural material on the opponents of the Nazi ideology. These included Jewish, [[freemasons|Masonic]], Communist and democratic organizations from throughout Germany and from the occupied countries. Plans to build monumental buildings for the University on the shores of [[Lake Chiemsee]] failed to materialize after the outbreak of [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Piper: ''Alfred Rosenberg – der Prophet des Seelenkrieges. Der gläubige Nazi in der Führungselite des nationalsozialistischen Staates.'' In: Michael Ley / Julius H. Schoeps (eds): ''Der Nationalsozialismus als politische Religion''. Bodenheim bei Mainz 1997, p. 122, {{ISBN|3-8257-0032-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the occupation of France the staff of the ERR joined the [[SS]] in the search for books, archival material, and huge stocks of artifacts that were in the possession of people of Jewish descent. Soon after the German Embassy in Paris and [[SS]]-''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' also began to steal the most valuable paintings from prominent national museums, galleries, and non-Jewish private collections. Rosenberg and his organization wanted to be involved in these art raids. He was able to get full authority from [[Adolf Hitler]] to be the only official art procurement organization acting in the occupied countries. For this reason, in a [[Führer Directive]] of 5 July 1940, Hitler authorized the ERR to confiscate:

* precious manuscripts and books from national libraries and archives;
* important artifacts of ecclesiastical authorities and Masonic lodges;
* all valuable cultural property belonging to Jews.

The "Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg" was officially established in "Office West" in [[Paris]] and was divided into different functional departments. The ERR central administration was transferred to Berlin on 1 March 1941 where it became formal subdivision of the German Foreign Office.

The Nazis were so eager to acquire valuable [[masterpiece]]s that art theft became the most important field of work of the ERR. In addition to art, many libraries were looted for the Institute for the Study of the Jewish Question in [[Frankfurt]], but especially for the library of the ''Hohe Schule''. The operations staff had eight main regional task forces and five technical task forces (music, visual arts, history, libraries, churches). Raids connected with the ERR also plundered the belongings of people deported to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Between April 1941 to July 1944, 29 convoys transported goods seized from Paris to [[Neuschwanstein Castle]] in Germany, the ERR's principal place of storage. Until 17 October 1944, as estimated by the ERR itself, 1,418,000 railway wagons containing books and works of art (as well as 427,000 tonnes by ship) were transitioned to Germany.

==ERR Operations==

===Belarus===
"More than two hundred libraries of Belarus, especially the state (now national) library, suffered irreparable damage during the occupation. An associate of the national library, T. Roshchina, calculated that 83 percent of the library’s collection was plundered and destroyed. After the war, some six hundred thousand volumes from the library were found in Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia, and were subsequently returned. About one million books, however, including rare and old printed volumes, have still not been located."&lt;ref&gt;Adam Maldis. "The Tragic Fate of Belarusan Museum and Library Collections During the Second World War." p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Day by day for 26 months, the Hitlerites systematically destroyed one of the most ancient Russian cities, [[Smolensk]]. The Soviet Prosecution has presented to the Tribunal a document as Document Number USSR-56, containing the report of the [[Extraordinary State Commission of the Soviet Union]]. I shall not quote this document; but I shall only refer to it and endeavor, in my own words, to emphasize the fundamental points of this document, dealing with the reported theme now. In Smolensk, the German fascist invaders plundered and destroyed the most valuable collections in the museums. They desecrated and burned down ancient monuments; they destroyed schools and institutes, libraries, and sanatoriums. The report also mentions the fact that in April 1943, the Germans needed rubble to pave the roads. For this purpose, they blew up the intermediate school. The Germans burned down all the libraries of the city and 22 schools; 646,000 volumes perished in the library fires."&lt;ref&gt;Nuremberg Trial Proceedings. Volume 8, 64th Day, Thursday, February 21, 1946. Morning Session. See the website, accessed on August 27, 2012: http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/02-21-46.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===
By the middle of 1941, most of the ERR work in Belgium concentrated on small collections in Jewish homes. Larger operations involved the Jesuit convent in Enghien involved removing 200 crates of books and archives, and looting the École des Hautes Études in [[Ghent]], which involved transporting 56 crates of books. "Both institutions were considered outposts of French culture on Flemish soil and unfriendly to Nazism." The Jesuit collection was considered a treasure trove of information on the politics of Catholicism in Belgium, and of Catholic procedures to thwart the Germans. The Jesuit College in [[Leuven]] and the regional office in Brussels, for example, acted as a refuge for library materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted|Grimsted, P.K.]] ''Returned from Russia''. pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Libraries and archives sees as enemy and international were confiscated outright by the ERR, as indicated by the following three examples. The contents of the communist bookshop OBLA, Brussels, were sent to [[Racibórz]], Poland. The records of the International Federation for Housing and Town Planning were confiscated and brought to Germany. A similar fate overtook the archives and library of the international Jesuit college at [[Enghien]], which was called a "Zentrale der anti-Deutschland speziell anti-National-Sozialistischen Information" ("Center for anti-German and anti-National Socialist Information").&lt;ref&gt;Lust, Jacques. 1997. "The Spoils of War Removed from Belgium During World War II." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czechoslovakia===
"The 700,000 volumes of the [[Charles University]] Library in Prague were stolen as a unit."&lt;ref&gt;Stubbings. ''Blitzkrieg and Books''. p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt;

A library was created in the [[Theresienstadt]] ghetto, about forty miles from [[Prague]]. Books were brought in by many of the people deported to this camp as part of their personal possessions, but also books from the collections of the Rabbinical Seminary Libraries of Berlin and [[Breslau]], and the Jewish communities of [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]] were also shipped there. Part of the German effort included having the prisoners translate and catalog many Hebrew books, to be added to the ERR "Museum of the Extinct Race" envisioned by Alfred Rosenberg. Almost 30,000 Hebrew and Judaica volumes had catalog cards created by the ghetto inmates.&lt;ref&gt;Intrator, Miriam. 2007. "People Were Literally Starving for any Kind of Reading." ''Library Trends''. Volume 55 (3) Winter 2007. pp. 516–17, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, there were 17,148 public, school and university libraries in Czechoslovakia, having a book stock of 8,528,744 volumes. Many of these items were confiscated by the Germans, especially any Czech books dealing with geography, biography or history. Works by any Czech writers were taken away, many burned, most others taken directly to the paper pulp mills. Special libraries were devastated, and suffered a loss of about 2,000,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;Zivny, Ladislav. 1946. "Czechoslovak Libraries During the War and After." ''Library Journal''. June 15, 1946. p. 877.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Hermann Goering - Nuremberg2.jpg|thumb|upright|Göring at the Nuremberg Trials]]
[[Georg Ebert]], who was a member of Rosenberg’s ''Aussenpolitisches Amt'' ([[NSDAP]] Bureau for Foreign Affairs, also referred to as the APA), discovered that a Masonic grand lodge, the [[Grand Orient de France]], had been abandoned in [[Paris]]. This was one of the most important Masonic grand lodge in Europe. Ebert personally guarded the building, with its library collection, museum and archives, until he could turn it over to the army. This was one point in the origin of the ERR, which eventually developed into a central headquarters in Berlin, with subsidiary offices (''Hauptarbeitsgruppen'' (Main Work Groups) in Paris, [[Amsterdam]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgrade]], [[Riga]] and other cities.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In January 1940, Hitler gave Rosenberg his task: to loot Jewish and Masonic cultural treasures, including synagogues, libraries, and archives in western Europe. By fall 1940, Hitler ordered Rosenberg to confiscate all Jewish art collections since these materials were now deemed "ownerless" by Nazi decree. Jews in France, as in most of Europe, were now labeled "stateless" and no longer had property rights. With France part of the German-occupied territories, the ERR and Rosenberg now fell under [[Hermann Göring]]'s authority and control, with the Gestapo seeking out Jewish houses, apartments, and shops in the hopes of finding valuable pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Rothfeld, Anne, 2002, "Nazi Looted Art: The Holocaust Records Preservation Project." ''Prologue'', Volume 34 (3), Fall 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Alfred Rosenberg]] reported to Hitler that his Einsatzstab had commenced confiscations in Paris by October 1940, with the assistance of the [[Service de Sûreté]] (S.D.) and the "[[Police Secrète Militaire]] ([[Geheime Feldpolizei]])."&lt;ref&gt;Cassou, Jean. 1947. ''Le Pillage par les Allemands des Œuvres d’Art et des Bibliothèques Appartenant à des Juifs en France''. Pages 108–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Sonderstab Bildende Kunst]]" (Special Arts Staff), a section of the ERR, confiscated numerous Jewish art collections, often of international renown (for instance, the Rothschild collection). In the Netherlands, this Sonderstab did not seize much more than about a thousand works of art. The [[Sonderstab Musik, Kirchen, Osten, Bibliothekenaufbau der Hohen Schule und Rassenpolititische Fragen]] (Special Staffs for Music, Churches, the East, the High School Library and Race-political Questions) each fought for its own corner. By 1942, no fewer than 3,500 collections, libraries and archives had been ‘secured’ by the [[Hauptarbeitsgruppe Frankreich]] (Main Working Group, France) of the ERR- France having been divided into five districts.&lt;ref&gt;Aalders, Gerard. ''Nazi Looting''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

The libraries of the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] (AIU) and the French Rabbinical Seminary (SIF) were high on the list of German locations to loot. The AIU had built a new library in 1937, including an eight story high tower and reading room, and boasting of 50,000 books. By March 1940, 647 crates of books had been removed from the AIU, and 243 crates of books from the SIF. A list by the ERR dated March 1941 indicated that 81 libraries had been looted in Paris alone, and a later supplemental list included another 30 libraries of Jewish, Masonic, socialist and émigré collections had been seized.&lt;ref&gt;Grimsted. ''Returned from Russia''. pp. 137–139.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:JohannesVermeer-TheAstronomer(1668).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vermeer]]'s ''The Astronomer'', donated to charity by the [[Rothschild]] family in 1982.]]
"These albums were created by the staff of the Third Reich’s Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg (ERR). This special unit was organized in the summer of 1940 under Reich Leader [[Alfred Rosenberg]], initially to collect political material in occupied countries for exploitation in the "struggle against Jewry and [[Freemason]]ry." The ERR established its base of operations in Paris in July 1940 and on November 5, [[Hermann Göring]] assigned the ERR the responsibility for the confiscation of "ownerless" Jewish art collections. On November 18 of that year, Adolf Hitler ordered that all confiscated works of art be brought to Germany and placed at his personal disposal.

Before the war, Paris was the world's largest and most important art market. This was where well-off French, European and American collectors bought and sold their best pieces. From the beginning of the century, Jewish ''marchands d'art'' had established themselves as the best art dealers and experts, resultantly shaping and influencing global taste. Dealers included: the Wildensteins, where [[Georges Wildenstein]] dealt in Old Masters; the [[Bernheim-Jeune]]s who specialized in Impressionists and post-Impressionists painters, and in 1901 had opened the first [[Van Gogh]] show; and [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]], the contracted dealer of [[Picasso]] and [[Braque]].&lt;ref name=BJParis&gt;http://www.bonjourparis.com/story/the-lost-museum/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next several years, the ERR would be engaged in an extensive and elaborate art looting operation in France that was part of Hitler’s much larger premeditated plan to steal art treasures from conquered nations. Soon after the German occupation of France in 1940, the German military, and subsequently the ERR, focused their art confiscations on the world-renowned Jewish-owned art collections from families such as the [[Rothschilds]], and the [[Veil-Picards]], [[Alphonse Kann]], and Jewish dealers such as the [[Germain Seligman|Seligman]]ns. According to the German ERR documents from 1944, the art seizures in France totaled 21,903 objects from 203 collections. There were 5,009 items confiscated from the Rothschild family collections, 2,687 items from the [[David-Weill]] collection, and 1,202 from Alphonse Kann’s collection. French officials, at the end of the war, estimated that one third of all art in French private hands had been confiscated.&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

All looted and confiscated art works were initially shipped by truck to the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume]], where Nazi art historians, experts, photographers, maintenance and administrative personnel appraised, filed, photographed and packed the now decreed "ownerless cultural goods" for transport to Germany.&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt; The first shipment art works sent to Germany from Paris required 30 rail cars and consisted primarily of Rothschild paintings intended for the [[Führermuseum|Führermuseum/European Museum of Art (EMoA)]] in [[Linz]], Austria. Among the first fifty-three paintings shipped to Hitler was [[Vermeer]]’s Astronomer from the [[Édouard de Rothschild]] collection, today in the [[Musée du Louvre]] in Paris. As the ERR staff looted and catalogued the French collections, they created photograph albums specifically intended for the [[Reich Chancellery]] and Hitler in an effort to keep them apprised of their work in France, and more importantly, to provide a catalogue of items from which Hitler and his curators could choose art treasures for EMoA. A group of these photograph albums were presented to Hitler on the occasion of his birthday on 20 April 1943, by Alfred Rosenberg to "send a ray of beauty and joy into [his] revered life." ERR staff stated that nearly 100 such volumes were created during the years of their art looting operation."&lt;ref&gt;National Archives and Records Administration Public Affairs Staff. "National Archives Announces Discovery of Hitler Albums Documenting Looted Art."  Announcement made on November 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The latest advice from authentic neutral sources said that the [[Gestapo]] had seized the libraries of all the Masonic organizations in France. The [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] (the French National Library) there upon put in a claim for these books, but the latest word was that the Germans declined to hand over them over, saying the material would be sent to Germany for purposes of study. The library of the [[Alliance Israelite]] in Paris, worth several million francs, also was said to have been seized and sent to Germany. From the Bibliothèque Nationale - one of the world’s leading libraries - the Germans were reported to have received an inventory of manuscripts, rare books and similar material that had been stored elsewhere in France for security during the war. German officials, according to the information received here, have been exercising close supervision over the French publishing industry. They have also taken over the [[Maison du Livre de Français]], the most important French book exporting agency."&lt;ref&gt;"Nazi Police Purge Libraries in Paris." 1941. ''New York Times''. Jan 7, 1941; p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

So called ''degenerate art'' was legally banned by the Nazis from entering Germany, and so once designated was held in what was called the Martyr's Room at the Jeu de Paume. Much of Paul Rosenberg's professional dealership and personal collection were so subsequently designated by the Nazis. Following [[Joseph Goebels]] earlier private decree to sell these degenerate works for foreign currency to fund the building of the Führermuseum and the wider war effort, [[Hermann Göring]] personally appointed a series of ERR approved dealers to liquidate these assets and then pass the funds to swell his personal art collection, including [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. With the looted degenerate art sold onwards via [[Switzerland]], Rosenberg's collection was scattered across Europe. Today, some 70 of his paintings are missing, including: the large Picasso watercolor ''Naked Woman on the Beach'', painted in Provence in 1923; seven works by Matisse; and the ''Portrait of Gabrielle Diot'' by [[Degas]].&lt;ref name=BJParis/&gt;

After the war, many of the books hidden by the Germans were collected by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] section of the American military government, and collected at the [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach Depot]]. There, many of the larger collections were identified and eventually returned to their owners. By the end of 1948, " ... the French regained the archives of the Paris bank of [[Rothschild Freres]], the [[Libschutz Librairie de Paris]], the library of the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle de Paris]], the library of the [[Ecole Rabbinique de Paris]], and the [[Biliothèque de Chinon]]."&lt;ref name="Poste"&gt;Posté, Leslie. 1948. "Books Go Home". ''Library Journal''. December 1, 1948, p. 1704.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
Greece was also visited by the ERR after the country’s fall in April 1941. A special unit headed by Dr. [[Johannes Pohl]], chief of the Hebraica collection at the [[Frankfurt Institute]]’s library, appeared in [[Salonica]], where he had Rosenberg agents seal the [[yeshiva]] collections, in which the city abounded. However, members of the community were able to hide or disguise many of the collections from the Germans. A later visit in September 1942 by a scholar named Maertsch, likewise resulted in no new additions to the Frankfurt library. However, a 1943 report does show that 10,000 volumes had been received from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the war, Greece was rich in libraries. The National Library, which included the Public and University libraries in Athens, contained more than 400,000 volumes. "Reports reaching American authorities in Cairo have told of the pillaging of libraries, laboratories and workshops of the Universities of Athens and Salonika ... A large part of the [[University of Athens]] library is reported to be lost. The libraries of three American colleges were reported to have been used as fuel in the central heating system used by the Germans."&lt;ref&gt;"Library Pillaging by Nazis Surveyed." 1945. ''New York Times''. Apr 4, 1945, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|280px|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing in front of [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome in 1944 with a picture taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]]]]
"The ERR were also active in the west. After the German occupations of [[Rome]] in 1943, ERR officers inspected the contents of the [[Roman Synagogue]]’s two great libraries, the [[Biblioteca della Comunità Israelitica]] and [[Collegio Rabbinico Italiano]], which contained extraordinary collections gathered over the 2,000 year history of Jewish life in Rome. They demanded the libraries’ catalogs; just days before the first deportation of Roman Jews to Auschwitz, two specially ordered railcars destined for Alfred Rosenberg’s institute in Frankfurt were loaded with ten thousand books from these libraries."&lt;ref&gt;Battles, Matthew. 2003. ''Library: An Unquiet History''. p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Two archaeological libraries, the [[Hertziana Library of History and Art]], and the [[German Archaeological Institute]]’s library of the history, topography, art and customs of ancient Rome, were removed from Rome and taken to Germany by the Nazis. At the end of the war, the two library collections were discovered in two Austrian salt mines packed away in 1,985 wooden cases. The German Library’s collection was unharmed, but some of the Hertziana collection and the card catalog were damaged by water when part of the mine flooded. They were returned to Rome, where they became part of the [[Galleria Comunale d'Arte Moderna, Rome|Gallery of Modern Art]], where both collections will be in the care of the new [[International Union for the study of Archaeology, Art and History in Rome]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Two Roman Libraries Regained from the Nazis." 1946. ''New York Times''. February 3, 1946. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, many of the major collections looted from Italy were identified by the [[Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives]] service of the American military government and returned to their owners. The [[Collegio Rabbinico Italiano]], the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]], and the [[Deutsche Historische Bibliothek Rom]] were all returned, although not all were intact, to their owners in Italy. "These last two collections were seized by Hitler with the idea of re-establishing them in Germany."&lt;ref name="Poste"/&gt;

===Lithuania===
In [[Vilna]] (Vilnius, Vilno, Wilno, etc.) the ERR set up a collecting point for Lithuania. Dr. Gotthard of the Berlin headquarters arrived in August 1941, and began looting the [[Mattityahu Strashun#Library|Strashun]] library. He conscripted the labor of two [[Gestapo]] prisoners, including [[A.Y. Goldschmidt]], librarian of the [[Hispanic-Ethnographic Society]]. Eventually, he committed suicide rather than assist the looting of the libraries. Dr. [[Johannes Pohl]] appeared in January 1942, and ordered that the city be made a collecting point for the region, and concentrated at the ''[[YIVO|Yidisher Visenshaftlikker Institut]]'' (Institute for Jewish Research). Materials were brought in from the private collections from [[Kaunas]], [[Šiauliai]], [[Mariampolė]], [[Volozhin]] and other towns, and included books from over 300 synagogues and personal libraries. Some of the Jewish workers were able to smuggle out and hide some of the most valuable books in the ghetto, which was stopped when the ghetto was liquidated in July 1943. The accumulated collection of over 100,000 volumes were separated into piles by century of publication, and about 20,000 were selected for shipment to Germany. The remaining materials were pulped to avoid storage and transportation costs, and to make a small profit. One incident involved an assistant of Dr. Pohl dumping out five cases of rare books in order to make room for an illegal shipment of hogs.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Donald E. and Herbert P. Rothfeder, 1984, "The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg and the Looting of Jewish and Masonic Libraries During World War II." ''Journal of Library History'', volume 18 (1), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
"The Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg (ERR), established by Rosenberg in 1939, was represented in the Netherlands by an Amsterdam office. In 1940, the ERR confiscated all property belonging to the [[Freemason]]s, among which was the famous [[Biblioteca Klossiana]]. This library had been bought by Prince Hendrik (1876–1934) ([[Duke Henry of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]), husband of Queen Wilhemina ([[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]]), and had been presented by him to the order of Freemasons. It contained important [[incunabula]] and books on the [[occult]], which were not available anywhere else in the Netherlands. Other parts of the library and the order’s archive were of importance as well. The library of the [[International Institute for Social History]] in Amsterdam was closed, and the ERR took over the building for its offices. In July 1940 the institute’s very important collection of newspapers and the library of approximately 160,000 volumes were confiscated. German arguments over their final destination kept the materials in Amsterdam until the winter of 1944, when they were transported to Germany in eleven ships. The [[International Archives of the Women’s Movement]], established in Amsterdam in 1935, lost its whole collection after the institute was closed by the [[Sicherheitspolizei]] (Security Police) in June 1940. In August 1942, 499 crates containing books and archives taken from, among others, Jewish antiquarian book dealers and theosophical societies were transported to Berlin."&lt;ref&gt;Leistra, Josephine. 1997. "A Short History of Art Loss and Art Recovery in the Netherlands." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the looted Jewish property, especially books, was sent to Rosenberg’s ''[[Institut zur Erforschung der Judenfrage]]'' in Frankfurt. Established in March 1941, the Institute served as the core research library for the planned Hohe Schule. Some of the other ERR research institutes that received looted books included the ''[[Institut für Biologie und Rassenlehre]]'' in Stuttgart, the ''[[Institut für Religionswissenschaft]]'', and the ''[[Institut für Deutsche Volkskunde]]''. In the Netherlands, where Seeligmann’s library was looted, the ERR enjoyed a monopoly on cultural property confiscation between 1940 and 1944. A particularly large number of books were seized, with an estimated value of thirty to forty million Reichsmarks. However, not all of those books were sent to the ERR’s research institutes. Certain collections, including Seeligmann’s, were sent to other Nazi agencies, such as the Reich Main Security Office (''[[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]''; RSHA) in Berlin.

The RSHA was interested specifically in information about those they perceived to be the prime enemies of the state. Accordingly, the RSHA in Berlin received looted library and archival materials relating to "enemies" such as the Jews. The RSHA Office Seven (Amt VII), which specialized in ideological research, established a center for the evaluation of looted documents. By August 1943, it contained more than 500,000 catalogued volumes. Most of the Jewish materials collected by Amt VII related to Zionist groups, rescue agencies, communities, and cultural organizations. Materials pertaining to Jewish political, economic, cultural, and intellectual leaders were also collected. Seeligmann, who founded the [[Genootschap voor Joodsche Wetenschap in Nederland]] (Society for the Science of Judaism in the Netherlands) and served as president of the [[Dutch Zionist Organization]], was of interest to the RSHA. By August 1943, his library became part of the Amt VII library and archive center.&lt;ref&gt;Yavnai, Elisabeth M. 2003. "Jewish Cultural Property and Its Postwar Recovery." In: "Confiscation of Jewish Property in Europe, 1933–1945." USHMM. pp. 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
In Norway, there were 150 school libraries and 50 public libraries that were destroyed by the Germans. Most of these libraries were in the province of [[Finnmark]], where there was widespread destruction during the evacuation of the German Army forces. The Norwegians did not burn the German propaganda works that had filled their shelves when the original Norwegian books were removed. They will be kept for the study by future generations who will want to study the period of the German occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, Jessie Ash. 1947. "From Scandinavia: Task of Rebuilding 200 of Norway’s Libraries Now Under Way." ''Christian Science Monitor''. July 12, 1947, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[Image:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' was looted by the Germans from the [[Czartoryski Museum]] in 1939. ]]
" ... From the very beginning of the establishment of the [[Staatsbibliothek Krakau]], special importance was given to materials related to the natural sciences, mathematics, geography and medicine. In the fiscal year 1940–1941, the amount of money spent on book purchases was surprisingly high." The Germans recognized the value of the scientific collection, and from 1941 through 1944, 35,599 books were borrowed by 2,621 patrons, mostly German civil servants and military personnel. Polish civilians were not allowed access to the library during the occupation. [[Gustav Abb]], the German overseer of libraries, decided to send much of the reference collection to Germany in 1944. "Abb decided to send the major part of the reference collection, as well as most of the books bought by the Staatsbibliothek to Germany (altogether about 25,000 volumes). [Polish] Librarians, charged with the task of filling boxes with books, tried to sabotage Abb’s orders. They hid a large number of books and stuffed boxes with old newspapers. Despite those heroic efforts to save the collection, the Germans were still able to send a great number of books to Adelsdorf (Adelin) in [[Silesia]]. Fortunately, after the war the library was able to recover most of the books that Abb had evacuated form the library." Later in the war, the main reading room was used as sleeping quarters for German soldiers, and other parts of the library were used as a hospital for Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Sroka, Marek, 1999, "The University of Cracow Library under Nazi Occupation: 1939–1945." ''Libraries &amp; Culture'' v. 34 no 1 (Winter 1999) pp. 5, 6 and 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[Frankfurter Zeitung]], Wochen-Ausgabe, 28 March 1941: "For us it is a matter of special pride to destroy the [[Yeshiva|Talmudic Academy]] which has been known as the greatest in Poland ... We threw out of the building the great Talmudic Library and carted it to market. There we set fire to the books. The fire lasted for twenty hours. The Jews of [[Lublin]] were assembled around and cried bitterly. The cries almost silenced us. Then we summoned a military band, and the joyful shouts of the soldiers silenced the sounds of Jewish cries."&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Kenneth R. 1946. "The Conquest of Books." ''Library Journal''. Volume 71 (2), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
Rosenberg commanded the "Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete" or "ERR," that was responsible for collecting art, books and cultural objects from invaded countries, also returned their captured library collection back to Berlin during the retreat from Soviet Union. The ERR stands for "Einsatzstab Reichleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzten Gebiete" which means the "Reich Leader Rosenberg Task Force for Occupied Territories." "ERR dispatches note they had to abandon their offices before the removal of the materials on hand could be completed ‘due to lack of loading spaces’ and the fact that German artillery, located in the center of the city [Kiev], was firing continually over their heads. Still, they managed to send on both their paintings 9,279) and prehistoric materials, which had come from [[Kharkov]], their own library and office furniture, and the materials collected by the [[Department of Seizures]], amounting to some ten thousand books and nearly a hundred cases of [[Bolshevist]] paintings, documents and archives ... "&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas, Lynn H. ''The Rape of Europa''. pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the note of Vaycheslav M. Molotov [sic: [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]], People’s Commissar for Foreign Affairs, dated 27 April 1942, presented before the [[International Military Tribunal]], it was recorded that the Germans burned the library of 40,000 volumes belonging to one of the oldest agricultural libraries in the [[U.S.S.R.]], the [[Shatilov]] selection station in the [[Oryol|Orel]] district. Also submitted to the International Military Tribunal was the statement following: "There was no limit to the desecration of the Hitlerite vandals of the monuments and homes representing Ukrainian history, culture and art. Suffice to mention, as an example of the constant attempts to humiliate the national dignity of the Ukrainian people, that after plundering the [[Korolenko Library]] in [[Kharkov]], the occupiers used the books as paving stones for the muddy street in order to facilitate the passage of motor vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;Posté, Leslie I. "The Development of US Protection of Libraries and Archives in Europe During World War II." pp. 240–241.&lt;/ref&gt;

1941–1944 Soviet Union: As a result of the German invasion, heavy damage was done to Russian libraries. It has been estimated that more than 100 million books have been destroyed, mainly from public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Hoeven, Hans van der; Van Albada, Joan, 1996, "Memory of the World: Lost Memory: Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the 20th Century." pp. 7–15. They comment from: ''Bibliothekswesen und Bibliographie in der USSR. Uebersetzungen aus der Grossen Sowjetenzyklopädie''. Berlin [c. 1958], 38; ELI vol. 26, 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

"At [[Pskov]], 1,026 church books were removed from the kremlin (fortress), including sixteenth- to eighteenth- century manuscripts and seventeenth century printed books. Nearly 35,000 volumes were removed from the Pskov pedagogical institute, including 25,000 works of Russian scholars. At Novgorod, the library of the historical museum which was "displaced", contained rare periodicals such as Russkaia rech’ of 1880 and Bibliograf of 1860. Books removed included editions of [[Voltaire]] of 1785 and [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] of 1796. All in all, 35,000 volumes were removed. Unique editions of [[archaeology]], including 51 books on the history of ancient Russia, were removed from the [[Novgorod]] library for the German professor Engel. Publications on ethnology were removed for Professor Thiele ... The above-mentioned [[Sonderkommando Künsberg]] was active in removing the [[czar]]s’ libraries from the suburbs of [[Leningrad]] and the contents of museums and libraries from [[Rostov]] and [[Taganrog]]. In addition to the ERR, Künsberg’s clients were: the main branch of the Reich Security Agency; RSHA ([[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]); the geographic service of the ministry of Foreign Affairs; the State Library; the Slavic Studies seminar; and the [[Hermann Göring]] economic library."&lt;ref&gt;Shvidkoi, Mikkhail. 1997. "Russian Cultural Losses During World War II." In: Simpson, Elizabeth, ed. "Spoils of War." pp. 69, 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Heinrich Himmler]] sent a secret message to the [[SS]] and ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) units in order to ensure their cooperation with the main troops in the total destruction and devastation of the parts of the Ukraine to be evacuated: "The aim to be achieved is that when the areas in the [[Ukraine]] are evacuated, not a human being, not a single head of cattle, not a hundredweight of cereals, and not a railway line remains behind; that not a house remains standing, not a mine exists that is not ruined for years to come, that there is no well left unpoisoned. The enemy must really find a land completely burnt and destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;Crankshaw, Edward. 1956. ''Gestapo: Instrument of Tyranny''. pp. 156–157.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial recovery after the war==
It is estimated that Nazi Germany looted three million books during the course of the war. Of these, more than one million were discovered by American forces at [[Hungen]], [[Hesse]], in May 1945. The books had been moved there from Frankfurt in early 1944 when Allied bombing of the city became threat to the collection and were subsequently moved back to the former Rothschild Library for cataloguing.&lt;ref name="Govitaly" &gt;{{cite report |author= |author-link= |authors= |date= |title=Activity Report on the activities of the commission for the recovery of the bibliographic patrimony of the Jewish community in Rome stolen in 1943 |url=http://presidenza.governo.it/USRI/confessioni/doc/rapporto_finale_eng.pdf |publisher=[[Government of Italy]] - [[Presidency of the Council of Ministers (Italy)|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]]|page= |docket= |access-date=3 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mystery" &gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Frank|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/194543/missing-jewish-books-of-rome |title=The Mystery of the Missing Jewish Books of Rome |date= |publisher=[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]|website= |access-date=3 October 2018 |language= |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=E.

==Responsibilities==

===Administration===
The Owner (or [[proprietor]]) is the person responsible for the business in general.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The General Manager or Operations Manager (may also be called the Managing Partner if he owns a stake in the business) is the person who operates the restaurant for the owner. The Executive Chef or the Chef Du Cuisine are also usually responsible for restaurant operations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crunchtime.com/restaurant-leadership-staff-roles&lt;/ref&gt;

The Assistant Manager or Administrative Assistant manages the office and business aspect of the restaurant, is responsible for [[Human resource management|Human Resources]] (including [[payroll]]), financial and taxation documentation, and all [[Records management|record management]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Front-of-the-House Management===

The [[Maître d'hôtel]] (or Manager) is entirely responsible for all front-of-the-house operations, manages staff who give services to customers and allocate the duties of opening and closing the restaurant. He or she is responsible for making sure his or her staff is following the service standards and health and safety regulations. He or she is the most important person in the front-of-the-house environment, since it is up to him or her to motivate the staff and give them job satisfaction. He or she looks after and guides the personal well-being of the staff, since it makes the work force stronger and more profitable, and works with other executive management officers such as the [[Executive Chef]] and the Owner.{{cn|date=June 2018}}
 
The Beverage Manager (or Bar Manager, [[Bartender]]) is responsible for all the beverage, beverage service and bar operations of the restaurant. He or she reports directly to the Maître d'hôtel (Manager). Beverage managers order bar inventory, maintain and track inventory, issue bar stock, and schedule bar service personnel.  Often a bar manager will have prior experience as a bartender. Often, a beverage manager will have extensive knowledge of beverages that include wine, beer, and spirits.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

===Back-of-the-House Management===

The [[Executive Chef]] usually operates in corporate restaurant companies. He or she is entirely responsible for all back-of-the-house operations, and works with other executive management officers such as the Maitre d'Hôtel and the Owner  .{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The [[Chef de Cuisine]] (or Executive Sous Chef) manages the kitchen staff working in the kitchen and creates the menus in absence of the Executive Chef.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Porth Hellick Down - geograph.org.uk - 1036.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance grave at Porth Hellick Down]]
The [[entrance grave]]s of [[Cornwall]] and the [[Isles of Scilly]], and south east [[Ireland]] are megalithic [[chamber tomb]]s of the [[Neolithic]] and early [[Bronze Age]] in the [[British Isles]]. Comparable sites are also known in [[Brittany]] and the [[Channel Islands]]. They are generally known as the '''Scillonian''' group as the greatest concentration of the tombs is found on the [[Isles of Scilly]].

Examples include [[Bant's Carn]] and the [[Innisidgen]] and [[Porth Hellick Down]] tombs, all on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]].

They consist of a narrow entrance which leads into a rectangular burial chamber covered by a small round stone [[cairn]] usually revetted with a [[Megalithic architectural elements#Kerb or peristalith|kerb]]. In some examples a [[sill stone]] blocks the entrance. The walls of the chamber themselves are of either [[orthostat]] slabs or stone courses, covered with several large capstones. Both the cairn and the chamber often exploit natural stone outcrops or boulders in their construction.

Entrance orientations in Scillonian graves follow no discernible pattern and they appear to have been used for deposition of multiple [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials with up to 60 individuals found at [[Knackyboy Cairn]] on the island of [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]]. [[Occupation debris]] has also been found in the graves which implies that they were actively used sites possibly for wider ritual purposes and/or as territorial markers.

The small size and simplicity of these monuments compared with the more complex tombs being built elsewhere in Britain imply that the areas where they are found preserved older methods of burial. The earliest known finds from Scillonian entrance graves include fragments of middle Neolithic [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] type ware and have led some archaeologists such as [[Paul Ashbee]] to argue that they are in fact of early Neolithic or even [[Mesolithic]] date. Much of the Bronze Age material excavated from entrance graves is considered to be related to later re-use.

"'''The Elf Mound'''" ({{lang-da|Elverhøi}}) is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish [[poet]] and [[author]] [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805&amp;ndash;1875). The tale is about a feast held in an [[elf]] mound for the [[Goblin]] Chief of Norway and his two sons, both of whom are expected to select elf brides. The tale was published in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]] by C.A. Reitzel in April 1845.

== Plot summary ==
Two lizards scramble about the entrance to the Elf Mound, commenting on the hustle and bustle within. They have heard the elf maidens are practicing new dances and both wonder the reason why. An old maid elf hurries out and summons a raven to deliver invitations to an important event. The elf maidens begin their misty dances. The dishes for the night's festivities include skewered frogs, fungus salad made of mushroom seed, and hemlock. The king polishes his crown and tells his inquisitive youngest daughter that he has arranged marriages between two of his daughters and two of the sons of the Goblin Chief of Norway, who all arrive at that moment with pomp. The feast is held and the two sons prove rowdy and boisterous. The elf maidens are paraded as potential brides, declaiming their most notable talents. The Goblin Chief is so delighted he chooses one for his wife. Dawn approaches, and the old maid elf wants to close the shutters. The two sons of the Goblin King hurry outside to continue their tomfoolery and horseplay, leaving without selecting brides.

== Publication history==

The tale was first published by C.A. Reitzel in Copenhagen, Denmark on 7&amp;nbsp;April 1845 in ''New Fairy Tales. First Volume. Third Collection. 1845.''. "The Elf Mound" was the first tale in the collection that included (in contents order) "[[The Red Shoes (fairy tale)|The Red Shoes]]", "The Jumpers", "[[The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep]]", and "Holger the Dane". The tale was republished 18&amp;ndash;December 1849 as a part of ''Fairy Tales. 1850.'' and again 30&amp;nbsp;March 1863 as a part of ''Fairy Tales and Stories. 1863.'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=71 Hans Christian Andersen Center: Hans Christian Andersen: The Elf Mound]&lt;/ref&gt; The tale has since been published in various languages around the world.

==Cultural impact==
The most notable reference to the story is the Norwegian stage play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'' in which the Mountain King (''Dovregubben''), is clearly modeled on the Norwegian troll king in Andersen's tale. [[Henrik Ibsen]] was allegedly inspired by Andersen at the time. The Dutch composer [[Johan Wagenaar]] has composed an Elverhoi-ouverture Op. 48.

==Early criticism==
''The Kennedys'' was the subject of negative responses from historians based on early scripts, including charges of historical inaccuracy and presenting an unflattering depiction of the titular family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/greg-kinnear-will-play-john-f-kennedy-in-history-channel-miniseries/ |title=Greg Kinnear Will Play John F. Kennedy in History Channel Miniseries |last=Itzroff |first=Dave |work=The New York Times |date=April 28, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 16, 2010 the website [http://www.stopkennedysmears.com stopkennedysmears.com] was registered by filmmaker [[Robert Greenwald]] as part of the critical response to ''The Kennedys''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whois.domaintools.com/stopkennedysmears.com |title=Whois Record For StopKennedySmears.com |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/arts/television/17kennedy.html?_r=1 |title=Even Before Filming, Kennedy Series Stirs Anger |last=Itzroff |first=Dave |work=The New York Times |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 24, 2010 Dave Itzkoff of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that historian [[David Talbot]], whose recent book had been used as source material for the miniseries, had joined those preemptively criticizing ''The Kennedys''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/another-historian-criticizes-the-kennedys/| title=Another Historian Criticizes 'The Kennedys' |last=Itzroff |first=Dave |work=The New York Times |date=February 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ted Sorensen]] (1928-2010), former presidential aide and speech writer for 35th President [[John F. Kennedy]] (1917-1963, served 1961-1963), described the script as a "character assassination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wilshireandwashington.com/2010/02/historians-challenge-joel-surnows-kennedys.html |title=Historians Challenge Joel Surnow's "Kennedys" |work=wilshireandwashington.com |last=Johnson |first=Ted |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of all of this criticism, the miniseries had not yet even been cast.&lt;ref name="HP-20100216"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/16/kennedy-tv-series-causing_n_464656.html |title=Kennedy Series For 'History Channel' Called Inaccurate, Vindictive|first=Sam |last=Stein |work=Huffington Post |date=February 16, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview published in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' on June 17, 2010, [[Joel Surnow]] addressed the complaints, saying, "they looked at early drafts of script that don't even resemble the final draft. It was way too early for them to comment on it."&lt;ref name="LAT-20100617"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/17/business/la-fi-ct-facetime-20100617/2 |title='Kennedys' miniseries producer Joe Surnow breaking rules again |last=Chmielewski |first=Dawn C. |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as the British newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' put it: "With Greg Kinnear as Mr. Kennedy, Katie Holmes as his First Lady and a budget of $30 million dollars, expectations had been high. Now, it is widely considered a disaster on the eve of its airing on the ReelzChannel beginning on Sunday. The History Channel decided to drop the series from its schedule in January 2011, stating that it was "not a fit" for the network.

===United States===
On January 7, 2011, the cable channel [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] announced that it would not show ''The Kennedys'' in the United States, stating "this dramatic interpretation is not a fit for the History brand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/history-channel-pulls-kennedys-last-69529 |title=EXCLUSIVE: History Channel Pulls 'The Kennedys'; Says Controversial Miniseries 'Not a Fit' |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 7, 2010 |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Prupas, president of Muse Entertainment and executive producer of the miniseries, issued a statement on January 10, in which he addressed the claims of inaccuracies: "The decision of the History Channel not to broadcast the show was made long after the executives of the Channel as well as the Channel's resident historian (who is a Kennedy expert) had read and approved all of the scripts and viewed and approved all of the final cuts of all of the episodes. Furthermore, our Errors and Omissions Insurer's attorneys reviewed all the scripts and edited episodes – and they have cleared all of the episodes for broadcast."&lt;ref name="prupasdefense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedys-miniseries.com/muses-statement-regarding-the-kennedys/|title=Muses's Statement Regarding the Kennedys |last=Prupas |first=Michael |publisher=[[Muse Entertainment]] |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Director Jon Cassar said at the January 2011 [[Television Critics Association]] gathering in Los Angeles that he believed the reason the miniseries would not be shown by History and other US broadcasters was because powerful people within the United States connected to the Kennedy family took exception to it and used their political and other influence to prevent the showing.&lt;ref name="TorStar20110113"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/article/920427--kennedys-director-says-they-always-made-requested-changes |title=Kennedys director stunned by decision not to air series |last=Brioux |first=Brian |work=Toronto Star |date=January 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joel Surnow, the series' executive producer, attributed the cancellation to pressure exerted by the Kennedys on the board of History's owners, [[A&amp;E Television Networks]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Surnow stated: "It happened at the board level. I don't want to mention anyone by name. It's very simple to say that certain board members are friends with the Kennedys."&lt;ref name="THR20110322"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/producer-joel-surnow-says-kennedys-170135%20 |title=Producer Joel Surnow Says 'Kennedys' Was Nearly Killed Because of His Political Views (Exclusive) |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=March 22, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reports pinpointed Kennedy family members [[Maria Shriver]] and [[Caroline Kennedy]] as the leaders of the campaign to stop the show, targeting Disney executive [[Anne Sweeney]].&lt;ref name="THR20110322"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDT20110331"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://my.telegraph.co.uk/expat/sebastian1111/10142503/how-%E2%80%98the-kennedys%E2%80%99-avoided-assassination/ |title=How 'The Kennedys' avoided assassination |last=Doggart |first=Sebastian |work=The Daily Telegraph  |date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, [[History (UK TV channel)|History UK]] was scheduled to screen the miniseries beginning on April 7, 2011. Tom Davidson, managing director of AETN-UK stated on the History website: "Securing the UK premiere of ''The Kennedys'' is a major coup for the History channel. Bringing to life the story of America's most iconic family, the drama is a bold and epic account of the Kennedy dynasty and we are delighted that viewers in the UK will get to see it on History first."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.sky.com/history-announces-kennedys-uk-premiere-date |title=History Releases Kennedys UK Premiere Date |publisher=[[BSkyB]] |date=March 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', TV director [[Sebastian Doggart]] commented:

{{quote|This is an amazing example of double standards. How can AETN call the series "not a fit" for the US History Channel, but describe this "bold and epic account" as "a major coup" for the UK's History channel? AETN has suggested that the reason is that the US History Channel is especially concerned about its historically truthful brand. So what is the channel broadcasting this Sunday night, in the same time-slot as ''The Kennedys'' over on Reelz? The answer: ''[[Ax Men]]'', a reality show about loggers; and ''[[Swamp People]]'', another reality show about alligator hunters.&lt;ref name="TDT20110331"/&gt;}}

Also in the UK, the [[BBC]] presented the series, beginning Friday, June 17, 2011, in both standard definition and [[High-definition television|HD]].

==Critical reception==

===Canada===
[[John Doyle (critic)|John Doyle]] of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' wrote, "it is awful – truly, mind-bogglingly tedious television." "The series (made in Canada with Muse Entertainment as the production company) looks cheap and sticks to the TV dramatics level of an afternoon soap opera." Doyle makes note of the predominantly Canadian cast and hopes they get a career boost but that the miniseries was "boosted by a fake controversy" and believes that "the American History Channel dropped it because it's bad TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/television/john-doyle/the-kennedys-if-politics-were-this-boring-no-one-would-do-it/article1970426/ |title=The Kennedys miniseries: If politics were this boring, no one would do it |author=[[John Doyle (critic)|Doyle, John]] |work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada  |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The miniseries met with a mixed reception from US critics. Based on 24 reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 50/100 at [[Metacritic]], indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-kennedys|title=The Kennedys|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark A. Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' noted that there is no mention of Joseph and Rose Kennedy's other children, including the future Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] and [[Kathleen Cavendish, Marchioness of Hartington]], and that it feels as though you are watching "through the prism of the ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' universe". Perigard found it to be "an absorbing, addictive drama, with some authentic performances" but not history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/television/reviews/view/2011_0401american___history_kennedys_rather_liberal_with_facts/ |title='Kennedys' rather liberal with 'facts' |last=Perigard |first=Mark A. |work=[[Boston Herald]] |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alessandra Stanley]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote a joint review of ''The Kennedys'' and of ''[[The Borgias (2011 TV series)|The Borgias]]'', which premiered the same day. In addressing the circumstances of the premiere she wrote, "There is something wonderfully Kennedyesque about a backroom campaign to discredit a series that claims the Kennedy White House had more than its share of backroom shenanigans." Stanley found the miniseries to be well made though at times cheesy, but that its strongest point is Tom Wilkinson as Joseph Kennedy, whom she describes, in tandem with [[Pope Alexander VI|Rodrigo Borgia]], as "A ruthless, tyrannical striver (who) grasps for power, promoting his sons to establish his rule and cement his legacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/arts/television/borgias-on-showtime-and-kennedys-on-reelzchannel-review.html?ref=alessandrastanley |title=The Power Brokers: Fathers, Sons, Dynasties |author=[[Alessandra Stanley|Stanley, Alessandra]] |work=The New York Times |date=April 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hank Stuever]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' found the miniseries "all ends up being as harmless as a game of Kennedy paper dolls" and the assassinations to be portrayed quite gently considering how violent Joel Surnow's show ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' is. Stuever describes the screenplay as clumsy and find the miniseries "sketches its characters with the precision of a fat Sharpie marker" and cautions those who recall the time that they may be troubled watching the story "through Surnow and company's mean-spirited gaze". In moving on to review ''[[Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]'', which premiered three days before ''The Kennedys'', Stuever wrote, "If you check your calendar, we're nearing the 50th anniversary of JFK's death, which makes him, his family and Cabinet members as fair game as [[King Arthur]], [[Guinevere]], [[Merlin]] and the gang, who've had their stories updated, revised and pillaged for centuries now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/tv-review-about-the-kennedys-like-the-kennedys-but-never-fully-the-kennedys/2011/03/30/AFHzXQCC_story.html |title=TV review: About the Kennedys, like the Kennedys, but never fully 'The Kennedys' |author=[[Hank Stuever|Stuever, Hank]] |work=The Washington Post |date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Thousand Buddha Caves''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|西|千|佛|洞}}|p=Xī Qiānfó Dòng}}) is a Buddhist cave temple site in [[Dunhuang]], [[Gansu Province]], China.

A manuscript from the [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Library Cave]], dating to the [[Five Dynasties]] and now at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]] in Paris, documents the early history of the site ([[Paul Pelliot|P]] 5034): according to the ''Domain Record of Shazhou Dudu Prefecture – Shouchang County'', "60 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of the county is a very old inscription that says '[[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han Dynasty]]… made a small Buddha niche; the common people gradually built more'".&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://idp.bl.uk/pages/collections_fr.a4d |title=French Collections |publisher=[[International Dunhuang Project]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b8307389s |title=Pelliot Manuscript 5034 |publisher=[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] |accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shouchang County, modern Nanhu&lt;!--Not easy to disambiguate, it seems to be adandoned http://dsr.nii.ac.jp/photograph/dunhuang/0195.html.en --&gt; Village, is the location of the [[Yangguan|Yangguan Pass]] along the [[Hexi Corridor]], it is understood that this is a reference to the origins of the Western Thousand Buddha Caves.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt;

The decorated caves are in three main sections: Caves 1–19 at the west end of the cliff, approximately one kilometre from the modern reservoir; Cave 20 in the middle of the site, near the second [[floodgate]]; and Caves 21 and 22 at the eastern end of the cliff.&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Most of the sculptures were restored in a different style during the [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The caves at the western end of the site have had aluminium doors and glass partitions installed more recently with the intention of mitigating the [[Preventive conservation#Definition|environmental causes of deterioration]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; Some of the paintings at the far east end of the site, distant from the custodians' lodgings, have been [[Detachment of wall paintings|detached and remounted]] in a cave at [[Mogao Caves|Mogao]].&lt;ref name="pamphlet"/&gt; The ruined state of the main Buddha image in [[Northern Wei]] Cave 7 enables the construction techniques to be seen: layers of earthen [[Plaster|render]] over an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] of branches and reeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dha.ac.cn/0403/section.htm |script-title=zh:西千佛洞第7窟 |trans-title=Western Thousand Buddha Caves – Cave 7 |language=Chinese |publisher=[[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of upper paint layers also reveals the linear grid used to set out the design of the Thousand Buddhas on the cave walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qwdo8vWeQr8C&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Performing the Visual: The Practice of Buddhist Wall Painting in China and Central Asia |author=Fraser, Sarah Elizabeth |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=9780804745338 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''White House at Night''''' is an oil on canvas painting created on 16 June 1890 in the small town of [[Auvers-sur-Oise]] by [[Vincent van Gogh]], six weeks before his death. It is displayed at the [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg.

According to the Hermitage Museum, the painting "expresses the great psychological tension under which Van Gogh found himself"; two of the windows, considered the "eyes" of a home, are rendered with "alarming" red splashes, while the star, a sign of fate, is seen as symbolic of van Gogh's anguish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthermitage.org/Vincent-van-Gogh/White-House-at-Night.html|title=White House at Night|publisher=Arthermitage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that van Gogh painted ''White House at Night'' around 8:00 PM due to the position of the "star" in the painting. Astronomers Donald Olson and Russell Doescher from the [[Texas State University-San Marcos]] calculated that the star in the painting must be Venus which was bright in the evening sky in June 1890.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1209614.stm|title= Venus pinpoints Van Gogh painting|date=8 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is the same one depicted in ''[[:File:Van Gogh - Blühende Kastanienbäume1.jpeg|Blossoming Chestnut Tree]]''.&lt;ref name="Heugten2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sjraar|first=|title=Vincent Van Gogh: Drawings : Van Gogh Museum|year=2007|publisher=Van Gogh Museum|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has a turbulent history. It was exhibited in Switzerland several times during the 1920s, but in the late 1920s disappeared into the private collection of German industrialist [[Otto Krebs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10877/4034/fulltext.pdf|work=Sky and Telescope|author=Olson, Donald &amp; Doescher, Russell|title=Identifying the "star" in a long-lost van Gogh|date=April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his acquisitions were of a style which was soon to be labelled "[[degenerate art]]" by the Nazis, which contributed towards the already publicity-shy Krebs keeping his collection secret.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/30/arts/hermitage-in-its-manner-displays-its-looted-art.html?pagewanted=all|title=Hermitage, in Its Manner, Displays Its Looted Art|work=New York Times|date=30 March 1995|first=Steven|last=Erlanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thought to have been lost after [[World War II]], the painting languished in the Hermitage archives for fifty years before resurfacing in 1995 as part of an exhibition displaying artworks looted by the [[Soviets]] at the end of the war.&lt;ref name="BBC1" /&gt; Three other van Gogh's from Kreb's collection were also shown: ''[[:File:Gogh,_Vincent_van_-_Landscape_with_House_and_Ploughman.jpg|Landscape with House and Ploughman]]'', ''[[:File:Vincent van Gogh - Morning, going out to Work.jpg|Morning: Going out to Work (After Millet)]]'', and the ''[[:File:Vincent van Gogh - Portrait de Madame Trabuc.jpg|Portrait of Madame Trabuc]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-antiques-design.com/art-theft/542-otto-krebs-collection|title=Otto Krebs Collection: Spoils of War or Plunder in Peace?| date= 20 September 2015|publisher=AAD}}&lt;/ref&gt;
