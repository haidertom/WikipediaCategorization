'''/r/science''', formally dubbed the '''New Reddit Journal of Science''', is an [[Internet forum]] on [[Reddit]] where the community of participants discuss science topics.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owens|first1=Simon|title=The World’s Largest 2-Way Dialogue between Scientists and the Public|journal=[[Scientific American]]|date=7 October 2014|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-world-s-largest-2-way-dialogue-between-scientists-and-the-public/|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular feature of the forum is "Ask me Anything" (AMA) public discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; As of 2014, /r/science attracted 30,000-100,000 visitors per day, making it the largest community-managed science forum and an attractive place to host discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:American Chemical Society - What Chemists Do - Nathan Allen.webm||thumbtime=15|thumb|right|Nathan Allen speaks about /r/science to the [[American Chemical Society]]]]
===Nathan Allen===
Nathan Allen is an American chemist. While working as a chemist at [[Dow Chemical Company]], Allen began to imagine that scientists could use [[Reddit]]'s "ask me anything" (AMA) interview format to create discussions between scientists and the public.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; Allen became a forum moderator there and has since been prominent in guiding the culture of the community there and as a spokesperson for the forum.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

===Establishment of AMA series===

As of 2014, /r/science attracted 30,000–100,000 visitors per day, making it the largest community-managed science forum and an attractive place to host discussions.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; In January 2014 Allen began the /r/science AMA series with the goal of raising the visibility of scientists who are producing groundbreaking work in their fields but who are not well known outside of their fields.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Nathan|title=Announcing the /r/science AMA Series|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1vqimu/announcing_the_rscience_ama_series/|website=Reddit.com|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outgoing links posted in the forum must go to peer-reviewed science articles published within the last six months.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Owens|first1=Simons|title=Should Reddit’s powerful mods be reined in?|url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/reddit-moderator-crisis/|website=[[The Daily Dot]]|accessdate=9 May 2016|date=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion series was instantly a success, and established the world's largest two-way discussion between scientists and the public.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt; Allen does most of the organization for the talks, including soliciting scientists to participate and training them to communicate in reddit's discussion format.&lt;ref name="Owens 2014"/&gt;

==Featured content==
/r/science has an ongoing content partnership with [[PLOS]].&lt;ref name="Costello April 2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costello|first1=Victoria|title=Ask our authors anything: new PLOS ‘AMA’ series debuts on redditscience|url=http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2015/04/plos/|website=PLOS|accessdate=11 May 2016|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic journal, PLOS invites authors who are publishing scientific papers to publicly present their work in /r/science and to participate in community "ask me anything" discussions in the forum at scheduled times.&lt;ref name="Costello April 2015"/&gt;

==Editorial decisions==
Editorial decisions in /r/science are made by the moderators who themselves follow rules that they present for the forum.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt; If new rules are introduced then those are discussed with the community of readers.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt; Rules for /r/science include guidance that contributors keep discussion on-topic and thoughtful.&lt;ref name="Owens April 2015"/&gt;

Allen led the decision to ban discussion in /r/science which gives credibility to [[climate change denial]] as a scientific concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Allen|first1=Nathan|title=Reddit’s science forum banned climate deniers.

==Mechanisms of adaptation to acidic environments==

Most acidophile organisms have evolved extremely efficient mechanisms to pump protons out of the [[intracellular]] space in order to keep the [[cytoplasm]] at or near neutral pH. Therefore, intracellular proteins do not need to develop acid stability through evolution. However, other acidophiles, such as ''[[Acetobacter]] aceti'', have an acidified cytoplasm which forces nearly all proteins in the genome to evolve acid stability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Menzel, U.
|author2=Gottschalk, G.
|date=1985
|volume=143
|title=The internal pH of ''Acetobacterium wieringae'' and ''Acetobacter aceti'' during growth and production of acetic acid
|issue=1
|journal=Arch Microbiol
|pages=47–51
|doi=10.1007/BF00414767
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, ''Acetobacter aceti'' has become a valuable resource for understanding the mechanisms by which proteins can attain acid stability.

Studies of proteins adapted to low pH have revealed a few general mechanisms by which proteins can achieve acid stability.  In most acid stable proteins (such as pepsin and the [[soxF]] [[protein]] from ''Sulfolobus acidocaldarius''), there is an overabundance of acidic residues which minimizes low pH destabilization induced by a buildup of positive charge. Other mechanisms include minimization of solvent accessibility of acidic residues or binding of metal cofactors. In a specialized case of acid stability, the NAPase protein from ''Nocardiopsis alba'' was shown to have relocated acid-sensitive [[salt bridge (protein)|salt bridges]] away from regions that play an important role in the unfolding process. In this case of kinetic acid stability, protein longevity is accomplished across a wide range of pH, both acidic and basic.

'''Attachment in children''' is "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders, London: JKP, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowlby |first1=J. |year=1960 |title=Separation Anxiety |journal=Int J Psychoanal |volume=41 |pages=89–113 |pmid=13803480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tronick et al."&gt;Tronick, Morelli, &amp; Ivey, 1992, p.568. "Until recently, scientific accounts ... of the infant's early social experiences converged on the view that the infant progresses from a primary relationship with one individual... to relationships with a growing number of people... This is an epigenetic, hierarchical view of social development. We have labeled this dominant view the continuous care and contact model (CCC...). The CCC model developed from the writings of [[René Spitz|Spitz]]..., [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]]..., and Provence and Lipton... on institutionalized children and is represented in the psychological views of Bowlby...[and others]. Common to the different conceptual frameworks is the belief that parenting practices and the infant's capacity for social engagement are biologically based and conform to a prototypical form. Supporters of the CCC model generally recognize that the infant and caregiver are able to adjust to a range of conditions, but they consider the adjustments observed to reflect biological variation. However, more extreme views (e.g., maternal bonding) consider certain variants as nonadaptive and as compromising the child's psychological development. Bowlby's concept of monotropism is an exemplar of the CCC perspective..." (Tronick, Morelli, &amp; Ivey, 1992, p. 568).&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment also describes the function of availability, which is the degree to which the authoritative figure is responsive to the child's needs and shares communication with them. Childhood attachment can define characteristics that will shape the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others.&lt;ref&gt;Kayastha, P. (2010). Security of attachment in children and adolescents. Bangalore: Elsevier B.V.&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is found in all mammals to some degree, especially nonhuman primates.

Attachment theory has led to a new understanding of child development. Children develop different patterns of attachment based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: [[secure attachment]], [[anxious-ambivalent attachment]], [[anxious-avoidant attachment]], and [[disorganized attachment]]. Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.

== Attachment theory and children ==
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory ([[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] 1969, 1973, 1980) is rooted in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically programmed to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected.&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1969"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. I: Attachment. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1973"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Attachment and loss: Vol. II: Separation: Anxiety and anger.  New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1980"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1980). Attachment and loss: Vol. III: Loss. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Through repeated attempts to seek physical and emotional closeness with a caregiver and the responses the child gets, the child develops an internal working model (IWM) that reflects the response of the caregiver to the child. According to Bowlby, attachment provides a secure base from which the child can explore the environment, a haven of safety to which the child can return when he or she is afraid or fearful. Bowlby's colleague [[Mary Ainsworth]] identified that an important factor which determines whether a child will have a secure or insecure attachment is the degree of sensitivity shown by their caregiver:

The sensitive caregiver responds socially to attempts to initiate social interaction, playfully to his attempts to initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down when he wants to explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1969) Ainsworth maternal scales. Available at http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/measures/content/ainsworth_scales.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be recognized that "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either out of synch, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (12 months – 20 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]] as a result of her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Uganda(see below).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S. (1978).  Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation Protocol is a research, not a diagnostic, tool and the resulting attachment classifications are not 'clinical diagnoses.' While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the clinically diagnosed '[[Reactive Attachment Disorder]] (RAD).' The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and [[attachment disorder]] are not synonymous.

The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infant patterns of attachment to their caregiver. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher observes/records the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the child experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar stranger.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher:

*Episode 1: Mother (or other familiar caregiver), Baby, Experimenter (30 seconds)
*Episode 2: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 3: Mother, Baby, Stranger (3 mins or less)
*Episode 4: Stranger, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 5: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 6: Baby Alone (3 mins or less)
*Episode 7: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 8: Mother, Baby (3 mins)

Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviours (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so much a part of the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cassidy &amp; P. Shaver, (1999) Handbook of Attachment, NY:Guilford&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern the child develops after age five demonstrates the specific parenting styles used during the developmental stages within the child. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioural patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=R. |last2=Shapiro |first2=S. |last3=Treleaven |first3=D. |year=2012 |title=Attachment Theory and Mindfulness |journal=Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=709–717 |doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachment patterns ==

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secure attachment ===
{{Main article|Secure attachment}}
A toddler who is securely attached to its parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status, however. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviours led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced,' and B4's as 'secure-reactive.' In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.&lt;ref name="Aronoff, J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronoff |first1=J |year=2012 |title=Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=315–347 |doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anxious-resistant insecure attachment ===
{{Main article|Anxious-ambivalent attachment}}
Anxious-resistant insecure attachment is also called '''ambivalent attachment'''.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |year=1978 |title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale NJ |isbn=0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a child with an anxious-resistant attachment style will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the caregiver is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when they return.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; The Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = J. | last2 = George | first2 = C. | last3 = De Jong | first3 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 447–447 | doi=10.1017/s0954579400006623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The C1 subtype is coded when:

''"...resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes..."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

The C2 subtype is coded when:

''"Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release...In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

=== Anxious-avoidant insecure attachment ===
{{Main article|Anxious-avoidant attachment}}
A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver – showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ainsworth |first1=MD |last2=Bell |first2=SM |year=1970 |title=Attachment, exploration, and separation: Illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation |journal=Child Dev |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=49–67 |pmid=5490680 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sroufe |first1=A. |last2=Waters |first2=E. |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an Organizational Construct |journal=Child Dev |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184–1199 |jstor=1128475 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1977.tb03922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant insecure when there is:

''"...conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away...If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile...Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in 'abortive' fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing...If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as 'a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection' by de-emphasising attachment needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Main | first1 = M | year = 1979 | title = The "ultimate" causation of some infant attachment phenomena | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 640–643 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver – avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.33-78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disorganized/disoriented attachment ===
{{Main article|Disorganized attachment}}
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed 'tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through'.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, &amp; Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behaviour was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behaviour, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (1983) 'Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment' Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B, and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mary |last1=Main |first2=Judith |last2=Solomon |year=1990 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–60 |editor1-first=Mark T. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Dante |editor2-last=Cicchetti |editor3-first=E. Mark |editor3-last=Cummings |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganised' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be wider 'recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K |last1=Lyons-Ruth |first2=JF |last2=Bureau |first3=MA |last3=Easterbrooks |first4=I |last4=Obsuth |first5=K |last5=Hennighausen |first6=L |last6=Vulliez-Coady |year=2013 |title=Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=15 |issue=5–6 |pages=562–582 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2013.841051 |pmid=24299135 |pmc=3861901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is 'rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment' from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kochanska |first1=G |last2=Kim |first2=S |title=Early Attachment Organization With Both Parents and Future Behavior Problems: From Infancy to Middle Childhood |journal=Child Dev |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=283–296 |year=2013 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01852.x |pmid=23005703 |pmc=3530645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticised by some for being too encompassing.&lt;ref&gt;Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow &amp; P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp. 100-114), London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as 'open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished', as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might treat too many different forms of behaviour as if they were the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti &amp; E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, J. &amp; George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganisation in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon &amp; Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganisation (pp3-32), p.27, NY: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that 'even disorganised attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent'.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. &amp; Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'the presumption that many indices of "disorganisation" are aspects of organised patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganisation, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response'.&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 'Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person'.&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. &amp; Landini, A (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W.

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===

Studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behaviour in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organised, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organised according to parenting authority.&lt;ref name="Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J." /&gt;

[[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (2008) Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that 'given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adult the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1980) Loss, London: Penguin, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden She proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strathearn |first1=L |last2=Fonagy |first2=P |last3=Amico |first3=J |last4=Montague |first4=PR |year=2009 |title=Adult attachment predicts mother's brain and peripheral oxytocin response to infant cues |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=34 |issue=13 |pages=2655–2666 |doi=10.1038/npp.2009.103 |pmid=19710635 |pmc=3041266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this 'affective information'. In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.

2.	Causal or other sequentially-ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landa |first1=S. |last2=Duschinsky |first2=R. |year=2013 |title=Letters from ainsworth: contesting the 'organization' of attachment (comment on "Crittenden's dynamic–maturational model of attachment and adaptation") |journal=J Can Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=172–177 |pmid=23667365 |pmc=3647635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond'&lt;ref&gt;p.435 in {{cite journal |last1=Crittenden |first1=P |last2=Newman |first2=L |year=2010 |title=Comparing models of borderline personality disorder: Mothers' experience, self-protective strategies, and dispositional representations |journal=Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=433–451 |doi=10.1177/1359104510368209 |pmid=20603429 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crittenden |first1=PM |year=1992 |title=Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments |journal=Child Abuse Negl |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=329–343 |pmid=1617468 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90043-q}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.

=== Significance of patterns ===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that 'for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons-Ruth |first1=K |last2=Bureau |first2=JF |last3=Easterbrooks |first3=MA |last4=Obsuth |first4=I |last5=Hennighausen |first5=K |last6=Vulliez-Coady |first6=L |year=2013 |title=Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=15 |issue=5–6 |pages=562–582 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2013.841051 |pmid=24299135 |pmc=3861901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure children have more positive and fewer negative peer reactions and establish more and better friendships. Insecure-ambivalent children have a tendency to anxiously but unsuccessfully seek positive peer interaction whereas insecure-avoidant children appear aggressive and hostile and may actively repudiate positive peer interaction. On only a few measures is there any strong direct association between early experience and a comprehensive measure of social functioning in early adulthood but early experience significantly predicts early childhood representations of relationships, which in turn predicts later self and relationship representations and social behaviour.

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haltigan |first1=JD |last2=Ekas |first2=NV |last3=Seifer |first3=R |last4=Messinger |first4=DS |title=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2011 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=962–967 |doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1107-7 |pmid=20859669 |pmc=4486071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.&lt;ref name=bercasapp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K |title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |editors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=333–47 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Strange Situation Protocol==

[[Michael Rutter]] describes the procedure in the following terms:&lt;ref name="Rutter, M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rutter |first1=M |year=1995 |title=Clinical implications of attachment concepts: retrospect and prospect |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=549–571 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x |pmid=7650083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Father with child.jpg|thumb|190px|Father and child|left]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov &amp; Estes, 1984).&lt;ref name="Lamb et al.,"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamb |first1=M. |last2=Thompson |first2=R. A. |last3=Gardener |first3=W. P. |last4=Charnov |first4=E. L. |last5=Estes |first5=D. |year=1984 |title=Security of infantile attachment as assessed in the "strange situation": Its study and biological interpretation |journal=Behav Brain Sci |volume=7 |pages=127–147 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00026522}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, it is very dependent on brief
separations and reunions having the same meaning for all children. This may be a major constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name="Miyake et al.,"&gt;Miyake, Chen, &amp; Campos (1985). Infant temperament and mother's mode of interaction and attachment in Japan; an interim report; In I. Bretherton &amp; E Waters (Eds), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50, Serial No 209, 276-297.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation have been developed for older preschool children (see Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990) but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood.&lt;ref name="Belsky et al.,"&gt;Belsky, J. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1994). Attachment Theory and Evidence. In M. Rutter &amp; D. Hay (Eds) Development Through Life; A Handbook For Clinicians (pp. 373-402). Oxford; Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al., 1990."&gt;Greenberg, M. T., Cicchetti, D. &amp; Cummings, M. (Eds), (1990). Attachment in the preschool years; theory research and intervention. Chicago; University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn &amp; Waters, 1990).&lt;ref name="Vaughn et al.,"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=BE |last2=Waters |first2=E |year=1990 |title=Attachment behaviour at home and in the laboratory |journal=Child Dev |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1965–1973 |doi=10.2307/1130850 |pmid=2083508}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also it is not at all obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ecological validity and universality of Strange Situation attachment classification distributions ===
With respect to the ecological validity of the Strange Situation, a meta-analysis of 2,000 infant-parent dyads, including several from studies with non-Western language and/or cultural bases found the global distribution of attachment categorizations to be A (21%), B (65%), and C (14%).&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M. H. &amp; Kroonenberg, P.M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van IJzendoorn |first1=M.H. |last2=Kroonenberg |first2=P.M. |year=1988 |title=Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: A meta-analysis of the strange-situation |journal=Child Dev |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=147–156 |doi=10.2307/1130396 |jstor=1130396}}&lt;/ref&gt; This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions.

However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions. In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above. One study was conducted in North Germany in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in Sapporo, Japan, where more resistant (C) infants were found.&lt;ref name="Grossmann K.E., et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossmann |first1=K. |last2=Grossmann |first2=K.E. |last3=Huber |first3=F. |last4=Wartner |first4=U. |year=1981 |title=German children's behavior toward their mothers at 12 months and their fathers at 18 months in Ainsworth's strange situation |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=157–184 |doi=10.1177/016502548100400202 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takahashi, K."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Takahashi |first1=K. |year=1986 |title=Examining the Strange-Situation procedure with Japanese mothers and 12-month-old infants |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=265–270 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.2.265 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behaviour as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978).

In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens et al. (2007) found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Main |first1=M. |last2=Cassidy |first2=J. |year=1988 |title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=415–426 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behrens, K. Y., Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrens |first1=K. Y. |last2=Main |first2=M. |last3=Hesse |first3=E. |year=2007 |title=Mothers' Attachment Status as Determined by the Adult Attachment Interview Predicts Their 6-Year-Olds' Reunion Responses: A Study Conducted in Japan |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1553–1567 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 |pmid=18020832}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of [[amae]] and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure-resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of [[amae]].

A separate study was conducted in Korea, to help determine if mother-infant attachment relationships are universal or culture-specific.  The results of the study of infant-mother attachment were compared to a national sample and showed that the four attachment patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized, exist in Korea as well as other varying cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin |first1=MK |last2=Jacobvitz |first2=D |last3=Hazen |first3=N |last4=Jung |first4=SH |year=2012 |title=Maternal sensitivity and infant attachment security in Korea: Cross-cultural validation of the Strange Situation |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2012.636656 |pmid=22191605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marinus van IJzendoorn|Van IJzendoorn]] and Kroonenberg conducted a meta-analysis of various countries, including Japan, Israel, Germany, China, the UK and the USA using the Strange Situation. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the four  basic patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm. Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies.&lt;ref name=ijzsag&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors=van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A |year=2008 |title=Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |editors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=880–905 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken.&lt;ref name=ijzsag /&gt;

=== Discrete or continuous attachment measurement ===
Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, it should be noted that continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports.&lt;ref name="Richters, J. E., Waters, E., &amp; Vaughn, B. E."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richters |first1=J. E. |last2=Waters |first2=E. |last3=Vaughn |first3=B. E. |year=1988 |title=Empirical classification of infant-mother relationships from interactive behavior and crying during reunion |journal=Child Dev |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=512–522 |doi=10.2307/1130329 |pmid=3359869 |jstor=1130329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van IJzendoorn |first1=M. H. |last2=Kroonenberg |first2=P.

(1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M." /&gt; Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters &amp; T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.&lt;ref name="Fraley, C. R. &amp; Spieker, S. J."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraley |first1=C. R. |last2=Spieker |first2=S.

'''Bamboo bicycles''' are [[Bicycle pedal|pedal-and-chain-driven]], [[Human-powered transport|human-powered]], [[single-track vehicle]]s that have two wheels attached to a bamboo frame. Because of its light weight, vibration damping, and sustainability, bamboo is slowly starting to be used in bicycle frame production, though the industry is still dominated by aluminium frames.

== History ==
Bamboo bikes were first patented in England by the Bamboo Cycle Company and introduced to the general public on 26 April 1894.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Cycle Company|url = http://www.bikebamboo.com/bamboo_cycle_co.php|website = BikeBamboo.com|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A US patent was applied for in 1895, by August Oberg and Andrew Gustafson, and granted in 1896. However, with the development of tougher industrial metals, such as steel and aluminium, large-scale usage of bamboo to build bicycles never happened.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-042715-212811/unrestricted/MG_Bamboo_Bike_Final_4.28.pdf|title = Management of the Design and Construction of the WPI Bamboo Bicycle|last = Aleles|first = Nicholas|date = 27 April 2015|journal = Worcester Polytechnic Institute Major Qualifying Project|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015|last2 = Collins|first2 = Hayden|publisher = Worcester Polytechnic Institute|others = John Downey, Brodie Green, Amaia Gritsko, Angela Langford, Mitchell Lewis, Samuel Longwell, Lena Pafumi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Railway News ...|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GwY1AQAAIAAJ|date = 1895-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though bicycles are a staple of human transportation, in both rural and urbanised areas, bamboo bicycles are not widely used. However, with the advent of the [[Green politics|Green movement]], bamboo is being used again, primarily for high-end racing and [[Track bicycle|touring bicycles]]. Bamboo bikes are entering the market as low cost alternatives to relatively expensive and unsustainable aluminium and metal bikes.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo Bikes Initiative in Ghana - UN and Climate Change|url = https://www.un.org/climatechange/blog/2014/08/bamboo-bikes-initiative-ghana/|website = UN and Climate Change|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical aspects ==
Several aspects of bamboo are extremely valuable to both cyclists and bicycle manufacturers: high strength-to-weight ratio, vibration control, and sustainable growth. Because of bamboo's tendency to grow straight, it does not exhibit "knots" and "turns" in its wood, unlike other types of wood. As a result, bamboo has a higher specific tensile strength than steel, as well as a higher specific compressive strength than concrete.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Bamboo Solution {{!}} DiscoverMagazine.com|url = http://discovermagazine.com/1996/jun/thebamboosolutio784|work= Discover Magazine|accessdate = 2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://bambus.rwth-aachen.de/eng/PDF-Files/Mechanical%20properties%20of%20bamboo.pdf|title = Mechanical properties of bamboo|last = Rottke|first = Evelin|date = 27 October 2002|journal = RWTH Aachen University Publications|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tendency also allows for excellent vibration control, which, in turn, provides for a smoother ride and increased stability on rough terrain.

The bamboo poles can be joined in a number of different ways. The earliest models used metal joints which were then tightened around the bamboo. Another approach is to wrap the joints with resin saturated fibers to make composite lugs around the bamboo frame members. For modernised track bicycles, carbon fibre is used for the remainder of the parts that are not made of bamboo due to its light weight - for example, the fork, because it is difficult to find a perfect piece of bamboo that fits into the fork socket of the frame.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Projects ==
Bamboo could be used as an alternative to traditional steel and aluminium bikes in many rural areas because of its potential sustainability. 

A "Bamboo Bike Project", started by engineers at [[Columbia University]], created a small number of bamboo bikes from 2007 to 2011. This was done with the intention of providing low cost bikes for Africans in rural areas, and stimulating local bike building industries, without major assistance from outside sources.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bamboobike.org/Home.html|title = Bamboo Bike Project|date = 2011|accessdate = 4 November 2015|website = Bamboo Bike Project|publisher = The Earth Institute at Columbia University|last = Mutter|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations and the United States have invested in the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative, which was created by Bernice Dapaah. This business markets itself as addressing climate change, poverty, youth unemployment, rural-urban migration and by creating jobs for women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As of 2015 over 1000 of these bikes had been sold in Ghana, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ghana’s bicycle which is creating jobs while it saves the soil|url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/05/ghana-environment-bamboo-bicycles-seed-award|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-09|first = Corinne|last = Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 few bicycles have also been made in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://youth.newagebd.net/2187/made-in-bangladesh-3/|title=Made in Bangladesh - New Age Youth|date=2016-02-28|work=New Age Youth|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cost ==
The most expensive bamboo bikes cost thousands of dollars. Conversely, the bikes sold in Ghana for the Ghana Bamboo Bike Initiative have been said to cost about $120, which is significantly more expensive than conventional bicycles.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bamboo bikes have benefits|url = http://www.sfgate.com/homeandgarden/article/Bamboo-bikes-have-benefits-3278264.php|website = SFGate|accessdate = 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cheapest for adults retail at $350 as of 2018, thus the bikes are retailed specifically for the export market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title =Products – Ghana Bamboo Bikes |url=http://ghanabamboobikes.org/shop/ |accessdate=30 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

This variation in cost has two main reasons: the relative wealth of the consumers to whom the bikes are marketed, and the difference in production quality. In the United States, all parts incorporated into the bike are high-end, similar to the parts used in expensive carbon fibre bikes. Modern machines are used to laminate, waterproof, and join the individual bamboo pieces. The Ghanaian bikes, on the other hand, source most parts (e.g. bamboo, chains, bolts, etc.) from low-cost sources.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The '''Banff Classification''' is a schema for nomenclature and classification of kidney transplant [[pathology]], established in 1991 by [[Kim Solez]] and Lorraine C. Racusen in [[Banff, Alberta|Banff, Canada]]. The initiative was "inspired by the then recent development of a consensus grading system for diagnosis of rejection in cardiac [[allografts]] led by Dr [[Margaret Billingham]], a key participant at the first Banff transplant pathology meeting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2009/07/margaret-billingham-pioneer-in-heart-transplant-pathology-dies-at-78.html|title=Margaret Billingham, Pioneer in Heart Transplant Pathology Dies at 78|author=Stephanie Pappas|work=Stanford Medicine News Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior the Banff Classification there was no standardized, international classification for renal allograft [[Biopsy|biopsies]], which resulted in considerable heterogeneity among pathologists in characterization of renal allograft biopsies. The first Banff schema was published in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Solez | first = K. | last2 = Axelsen| first2 = RA| title = International standardization of criteria for the histologic diagnosis of renal allograft rejection: the Banff working classification of kidney transplant pathology| journal = Kidney International|display-authors=etal| pmid=8377384| volume=44| year=1993| pages=411–22| doi=10.1038/ki.1993.259}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since undergone updates at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last= Bhowmik| first = D.M.| last2 = Dinda| first2 = A.K.| title = The evolution of the Banff classification schema for diagnosing renal allograft rejection and its implications for clinicians| journal = Indian Journal of Nephrology | doi =  10.4103/0971-4065.62086|display-authors=etal| pmid=20535263| pmc=2878403| volume=20| year=2010| pages=2–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is expanded and updated every two years in meetings organized by the [[Banff Foundation for Allograft Pathology]]. An evaluation of the Banff Classification in March 2000 confirmed significant association between the revised Banff '97 classification and graft outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Impact of the Banff '97 classification for histological diagnosis of rejection on clinical outcome and renal function parameters after kidney transplantation|vauthors=Mueller A, etal |pmid=10762217|volume=69|year=2000|pages=1123–7|journal=Transplantation|doi=10.1097/00007890-200003270-00017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification is unusual in that there is no competing standard. It has been used worldwide for 27+ years and shows how useful consensus meetings in a medical subspecialty area can be. In 2018 a user guide for the classification was published in the journal Transplantation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">The '''Belgian Historical Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-nl|Belgisch Historisch Instituut te Rome}}, {{lang-fr|Institut historique belge de Rome}}, {{lang-it|Istituto storico belga di Roma}}), founded 1902, is a scholarly research institute focused on the study of Roman, and more broadly Italian, history and antiquities. It is currently located in the [[Academia Belgica]] and is one of a number of [[Roman Historical Institutes]].

==Foundation==
The idea for the foundation of a Belgian historical institute in Rome for the identification and publishing of Italian sources relating to Belgian history came from the ecclesiastical historian [[Alfred Cauchie]], professor at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kadoc.kuleuven.be/bhir-ihbr/en/2_org_hist_sub1.php&lt;/ref&gt; He published a pamphlet to this effect in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Cauchie, ''De la création d'une école Belge à Rome'' (Tournai, 1896).&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute was founded in 1902, in the [[Palazzo Rusticucci-Accoramboni]], with [[Ursmer Berlière]] as its first director.

==Publications==
The institute has a strong focus on the publication of historical sources, primarily in the series ''Analecta Vaticano-Belgica''.

The institute's ''Bulletin'' ceased publication in 2010 and has been replaced by a digital journal, ''Forum Romanum Belgicum''.

==Directors==

The '''Bimaran casket''' or '''Bimaran reliquary''' is a small gold [[reliquary]] for Buddhist relics that was found inside the [[stupa]] no.2 at [[Bimaran]], near [[Jalalabad]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Stupa 2 Bimaran Charles Masson.jpg|thumb|left|The Stupa Nb.2 at [[Bimaran]], where the reliquary was excavated. Drawing by [[Charles Masson]].]]
When it was found by the archaeologist [[Charles Masson]] during his work in [[Afghanistan]] between 1833 and 1838, the casket contained coins of the [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Azes II]], though recent research by Senior indicates Azes II never existed&lt;ref&gt;Senior (2008), pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and finds attributed to his reign probably should be reassigned to [[Azes I]]. The most recent research however (2015) attributes the coins to Indo-Scythian king [[Kharahostes]] or his son [[Mujatria]], who minted posthumous issues in the name of Azes.&lt;ref name="Joe Cribb"/&gt;

The Bimaran reliquary is sometimes dated, based on coinage analysis, to 0-15 CE ([[Fussman]]), more generally to 50-60 CE ([[British Museum]]), and sometimes much later (2nd century CE), based on artistic assumptions only. It is currently in the collections of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/b/bimaran_reliquary.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The datation of this unique piece of art has a strong bearing on the chronology of [[Buddhist art]] and the creation of the [[Buddha]] image, as its advanced iconography implies that earlier forms had probably been existing for quite some time before.

==Description==
[[Image:BuddhaDetail2.JPG|thumb|200px|Detail of the Buddha, where the rare posture and light dress are visible.]]
The casket is a small container reminiscent of the [[Pyxis (vessel)|Pyxis]] of the [[Classical world]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"&gt;"The crossroads of Asia", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and [[Joe Cribb]], The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, {{ISBN|0951839918}}, p.189-190&lt;/ref&gt; It was found without its lid.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; There is a lotus decorating the bottom.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

The casket features [[hellenistic]] representations of the Buddha ([[contrapposto]] pose, Greek [[himation]], bundled hairstyle, wearing a [[moustache]], realistic execution),&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; surrounded by the Indian deities [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]] and [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], inside arched niches (called "homme arcade", or ''caitya'') of [[Greco-Roman]] architecture. There are altogether eight figures in high-relief (two identical groups of Brahman-Buddha-Indra, and two devotees or [[Bodhisattvas]] in-between) and two rows of [[rubies]] from [[Badakhshan]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

Owing to their necklace, bracelets, and armbands, and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the two devotees are most probably representations of [[Bodhisattvas]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; They hold their hands together in a prayerful gesture of reverence, ''[[Añjali Mudrā]]''.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

The casket is made in gold-[[repoussé]] and is very small, with a height of {{convert|7|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}. It is considered as a masterpiece of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].

===The Buddha: a rare iconography===
The Buddha seems to walk sideways. His right forearm goes across his chest to form the Abhaya mudra. His left fist is clenched on his hip. The gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that of the other known representations of the standing Buddha (see [[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)]]), tending to follow the outline of the body, in a rather light way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the ''[[antaravasaka]]'' and the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', without the heavier overcoat, the ''[[sangati]]'', which would only go as low as the knees and be more markedly folded. Also, his gown is folded over the right and left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as in the classical Buddha image), suggesting some kind of scarf-like ''[[uttariya]]''. He has an abundant topknot covering the [[ushnisha]], and a simple [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] surrounds his head. This combination of details of the iconography (posture and clothing) is rare and only otherwise known in the coins of [[Kanishka]] (c. 150 CE), where they bear the inscription "[[Shakyamuni Buddha]]", in apparent contrast to his coins of the "Buddha" where he wears the heavy topcoat. The posture itself is well known in the art of Gandhara in sculptures of the Buddha as a Bodhisattva, but in these cases, he wears the Indian princely [[dhoti]] and the royal turban.

==Steatite container==
[[Image:SteatiteContainer.JPG|thumb|left|The steatite box that contained the Bimaran casket.]]
[[File:Bimaran vase inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the steatite box.]]
The Bimaran casket was kept in a [[steatite]] box, with inscriptions stating that it contained some relics of the Buddha. When opened in the 19th century, the box did not contain identifiable relics, but instead some burnt pearls, bead of precious and semi-precious stones, and the four coins of [[Azes II]].

The inscriptions written on the box are {{ref|box}}:

:Main body of the container:
:''"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe niyadide bhagavata sharirehi sarvabudhana puyae"''
:"Sacred gift of ''Shivaraksita'', son of ''Munjavamda''; presented for Lord's relics, in honour of all Buddhas" (Translation by Fussman)

:Lid of the container:
:''"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe bhagavata sharirehi"''
:"Gift of ''Shivaraksita'', son of ''Munjavamda''; presented for Lord's relics"

==Date of the coins==

===Azes II===
[[Image:Coins of Azes I inside the Bimaran casket.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|The coins of [[Azes II]] found inside the Bimaran reliquary.]]
[[File:Charles Masson coin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|One of the coins of the Bimaran casket, illustrated by [[Charles Masson]].&lt;ref&gt;A memoir on the buildings called topes. In Ariana Antiqua: A descriptive account of the antiquities and coins of Afghanistan, [[Charles Masson]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=0LgWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=71]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Obv.''' [[Azes]] riding,  with corrupted Greek legend (WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN IOCAAC) for ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΑΖΟΥ "King of Kings [[Azes]]", and Buddhist [[Triratna]] symbol behind the head of the king.&lt;br&gt;'''Rev.''' City goddess [[Tyche]] standing left holding cornucopia and raised right hand. [[Kharoshthi]] legend ''Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king follower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]".&lt;/small&gt;]]
The archeological find of the [[Azes II]] coins inside the casket would suggest a date between 30 BCE to 10 BCE. Azes II would have employed some [[Indo-Greek]] artists in the territories recently conquered, and made the dedication to a stupa. The coins are not very worn, and would therefore have been dedicated soon after their minting. Indo-Scythians are indeed known for their association with Buddhism, as in the [[Mathura lion capital]]. Such date would make the casket the earliest known representation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]:

:''"In the art of Gandhara, the first known image of the standing Buddha and approximatively dated, is that of the Bimaran reliquary, which specialists attribute to the Indo-Scythian period, more particularly to the rule of [[Azes II]]"'' (Christine Sachs, "De l'Indus à l'Oxus").

However, several features of the coins are unknown for coins of Azes: the [[Tyche]] on the reverse, the fact that the king is given the title of ''Dhramika'' in the [[Kharoshthi]] inscription on the reverse, and the fact that the Kharoshthi monograms and symbols used are those of the later Scythian king [[Kharahostes]].&lt;ref name="Errington16"/&gt;

===Kharahostes===
[[File:Kharahostes Northern Satrap with Azes and Tyche Nandipada behind king.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Coin of [[Kharahostes]], in the name of [[Azes]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Obv.''' [[Azes]] riding,  with corrupted Greek legend (WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN IOCAAC) for ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΑΖΟΥ "King of Kings [[Azes]]", and Buddhist [[Triratna]] symbol behind the head of the king.&lt;br&gt;'''Rev.''' City goddess [[Tyche]] standing left holding cornucopia and raised right hand. [[Kharoshthi]] legend ''Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king followower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]"&lt;/small&gt;]]
The latest studies, made in 2015 by [[Joe Cribb]], consider that the coins are issues of [[Kharahostes]], or his son [[Mujatria]].&lt;ref name="Joe Cribb"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15209723/DATING_AND_LOCATING_MUJATRIA_AND_THE_TWO_KHARAHOSTES DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES] by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27 et sig&lt;/ref&gt; Many characteristics of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary are consistent with the coinage of [[Kharahostes]] (10 BCE&amp;ndash;10 CE), a successor to Azes II, who minted many coins in the name of Azes II.&lt;ref name="Errington16"/&gt;

The four coins in the Bimaran casket are of the same type: [[tetradrachm]]s of debased silver in the name of Azes, in near-new condition.&lt;ref name="Errington188"&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; On the obverse they show a king on a horse to the right with right hand extended, with a three-pellet dynastic mark and a circular legend in Greek.&lt;ref name="Errington188"/&gt; The legend reads in corrupted Greek WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN [[Azes II|IOCAAC]] (that is, ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ [[Azes II|ΑΖΟΥ]]) "King of Kings [[Azes]]". On the reverse appears a figure of [[Tyche]] standing and holding a [[cornucopia]], with a [[Kharoshthi]] legend.&lt;ref name="Errington188"/&gt; The legend reads 'Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king followower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]".

Close-up photographs by the [[British Museum]][http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=273118001&amp;objectid=182959] show that the coins do bear the name of Azes, but that they also have the "Three pellets" symbol, which is characteristic of the coinage of Kharahostes, who also often uses the name of Azes on his coinage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grifterrec.rasmir.com/indoscythian/indoscythian_2.html Grifterrec on Indo-Scythians]&lt;/ref&gt; The coin type of the Bimaran coins is also identical to the main coins of Kharahostes (horseman with Tyche).

The name of Kharahostes has also been recently discovered on a silver Buddhist reliquary, found in Shinkot in [[Bajaur]] ([[Pakistan]]). This suggests that Kharahostes was keen on making Buddhist dedications similar to those of the Bimaran reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Salomon, "An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 116, No. 3 (July - September 1996), pp. 418-452&lt;/ref&gt;

Without adding any redeposition theory, the Bimaran reliquary may therefore have been dedicated during the reign of Kharahostes (10 BCE – 10 CE), and probably at the beginning of his reign since the coins are not worn and where therefore basically new when they were introduced in the casket. This would put the Bimaran casket at 10 BCE, or around the beginning of our era.

===Kujula Kadphises===
[[File:Kujula Kadphises. Laureate Julio-Claudian style.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The rare coins of [[Kujula Kadphises]] with a tripartite mark resembling the three-pellet mark of [[Kharahostes]] (here on the reverse), have coin types ("Laureate head and king seated") which are totally different from those of the Bimaran reliquary. And this is the only issue of Kujula where this symbol appears&lt;ref name="Grifterrec"&gt;[http://grifterrec.rasmir.com/kushan/kushan.html Grifterrec Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kudjula Kadphises]] does use something similar to the three-pellets mark of Kharahostes in just one of his coin types (the "Laureate head and king seated" type), which has led to suggestions that the coins of the Bimaran casket may be from his reign, and can be dated to approximately 60 CE.&lt;ref name="Errington16"&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; This coin type however has nothing to do with that of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary (which are all "Horseman with Tyche"). Kudjula Kadphises is also not known to have issued Scythian-type coins in the name of Azes.

The three-pellet symbol mark is not know from any other ruler either (apart from the son of Kharahostes [[Mujatria]]),&lt;ref name="Grifterrec"/&gt; so that the only remaining possibility seems to be [[Kharahostes]] or his son, as determined by Joe Cribb in his 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15209723/DATING_AND_LOCATING_MUJATRIA_AND_THE_TWO_KHARAHOSTES DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES] by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27-35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of the Bimaran reliquary==
Various disputes have been arising regarding the early date suggested for this first Buddha image.

[[Gérard Fussman|Fussman]] thinks that the Bimaran reliquary was manufactured in 1-15 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fussman, 1986, p.71, quoted in The Crossroads of Asia, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; In any case manufacture necessarily took place before 60 CE, which is the latest date considered for the coins.&lt;ref&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The Bimaran casket is on display at the [[British Museum]] (Joseph E. Hotung Gallery), which dates the casket to 60 CE.

Some also date the casket as late as the 2nd century CE based on stylistic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;(S. L. Huntington, ''Art Journal'', Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408)&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Huntington sums up the issue:

:''"The well-known gold and ruby reliquary found at Bimaran in Afghanistan is generally assigned a date of about the second century AD in spite of the virtually incontrovertible scientific evidence surrounding it that suggests that it was made about the first century BC. The resistance to the early dating of the reliquary is based solely on the assumption that Buddha images were not introduced into the Buddhist artistic repertoire until the early centuries of the Christian era, and therefore that any work that bears an image of the Buddha must be of a comparably late date."'' (S. L. Huntington, ''Art Journal'', Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408)

These disputes stem from the fact that the first representations of the Buddha are generally assumed to be around the 1st century CE or later, about fifty to a hundred years later than the reign of Azes II, under the rule of the [[Kushans]]. Since the Bimaran casket, with its already advanced Buddhist iconography, was manufactured at the beginning of our era, give or take a few decades,  it is highly probably that much earlier images of the Buddha had already been in existence before its creation, going back to the 1st century BCE.

==Implications==
[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early Buddhist imagery includes coins of [[Indo-Greek]] kings such as [[Menander II]] (left, circa 90–85 BCE), in which [[Zeus]], through [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], hands a [[wreath]] of victory to a [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]], or the [[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]] (right, 1st c.BCE-1st c.CE).]]
Since the casket already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and Indra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha had been current by the time of the deposition of the Bimaran casket (10 BCE -10 CE), going back to the rule of the [[Indo-Greeks]] in the 1st century BCE. The last Indo-Greek kings [[Strato II]] and [[Strato III]] ruled until around 20 CE. This view, that Greco-Buddhist art already was flourishing in the 1st century BCE under the sponsorship of Indo-Greek kings, was originally advocated by [[Alfred A. Foucher]] and others, although with much less archaeological evidence.

Stylistically, the casket (gold inlaid with precious stone) is also highly consistent with the art of the Scythians, as known for example from the [[Tillya tepe]] archaeological site in northern Afghanistan. The Tillya tepe treasure is also dated to the 1st century BCE, and also has what could be early representations of the Buddha, such as the [[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]].

The Bimaran casket also has some similarities with the [[Kanishka casket]], which however is of much coarser execution, and securely dated to around 127 CE.

'''Bureaucratic inertia''' is the inevitable tendency of [[bureaucratic]] organizations to perpetuate the established procedures and modes, even if they are counterproductive and/or diametrically opposed to established organizational goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neville |first=Sarah |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/51a83fde-704d-11e2-ab31-00144feab49a.html#axzz2LHLkdp2Q |title=NHS inquiry finds failings ‘at every level’ |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-02-06 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unchecked growth may continue independently of the organization's success or failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/27/green-deal-benefits-tory-friends |title=The green deal is just for fatcats, not consumers &amp;#124; John Vidal &amp;#124; Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through bureaucratic inertia, organizations tend to take on a life of their own beyond their formal objectives.

===Business===
The [[Boston Consulting Group]] has advised firms to cut down on bureaucratic inertia and advised firms to eliminate cruft, bloat, and redundancy in the aspects of the business which are not front-line for the consumer (i.e. the "face" of the company who the customer deals with and who the customer thinks is the value-provider of the company).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/24/symantec-overhaul-idUSL1N0ASHCM20130124 |title=UPDATE 2-Symantec CEO plans layoffs, no asset sales |publisher=Reuters |date=2013-01-23 |accessdate=2013-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/editorschoice/indonesia-a-key-part-of-australias-asian-policy/570775 |title=Indonesia a Key Part of Australia’s Asian Policy |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date=2013-02-11 |accessdate=2013-07-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416030645/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/editorschoice/indonesia-a-key-part-of-australias-asian-policy/570775# |archive-date=2013-04-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18007">'''Concrete art''' was an art movement with a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. The term was first formulated by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and was then used by him in 1930 to define the difference between his vision of art and that of other abstract artists of the time. After his death in 1931, the term was further defined and popularized by [[Max Bill]], who organized the first international exhibition in 1944 and went on to help promote the style in [[Latin America]]. The term was taken up widely after World War 2 and promoted through a number of international exhibitions and art movements.

==Origination==
[[File:Art Concret vol 01 no 01 front cover 01.jpg|thumb|''Revue Art Concret'', May 1930.]]
After the formal break up of [[De stijl]], following the last issue of its magazine in 1928, van Doesburg began considering the creation of a new collective centered on a similar approach to abstraction. In 1929 he discussed his plans with Uruguayan painter [[Joaquín Torres-García]], with candidates for membership of this group including [[Georges Vantongerloo]], [[Constantin Brancusi]], [[František Kupka]], [[Piet Mondrian]], [[Friedrich Vordemberge-Gildewart]] and [[Antoine Pevsner]], among others. However, van Doesburg divided the candidates between artists whose work was still not completely abstract and those free of referentiality. As this classification entailed the possibility of a disqualification of the first group, the discussions between the two soon broke down, prompting Torres-García to team up instead with Belgian critic [[Michel Seuphor]] and form the group [[Cercle et Carré]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintgens Hötte, Doris (2009) "Van Doesburg tackles the continent: passion, drive &amp; calculation", in: Gladys Fabre &amp; Doris Wintgens Hötte (red.): ''Van Doesburg &amp; the International Avant-Garde: Constructing a New World'', London, Tate Publishing, 2010, pp. 10-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, van Doesburg proceeded to propose a rival group, ''[[Art Concret]]'', championing a geometrical [[abstract art]] closely related to the aesthetics of [[Neo-plasticism]]. In his opinion, the term ‘abstract’ as applied to art had negative connotations; in its place he preferred the more positive term ‘concrete’.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939", Skira, Geneva 1980, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Doesburg was eventually joined by [[Otto Gustaf Carlsund|Otto G. Carlsund]], [[Léon Arthur Tutundjian]], [[Jean Hélion]] and his fellow lodger, the typographer [[Marcel Wantz]] (1911-79), who soon left to take up a political career.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Hélion, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ROXpBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT202&amp;dq=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;pg=PT202#v=onepage&amp;q=Marcel%20Wantz&amp;f=false "Art Concret 1930: Four Painters and a Magazine”], in ''Double Rhythm: Writings About Painting'', Skyhorse Publishing 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1930 they published a single issue of their own French-language magazine, ''Revue Art Concret'', which featured a joint [[manifesto]], positioning them as the more radical group of abstractionists.

"'''BASIS OF CONCRETE PAINTING'''&lt;br&gt;
We say:
# Art is universal.
# A work of art must be entirely conceived and shaped by the mind before its execution. It shall not receive anything of nature’s or sensuality’s or sentimentality’s formal data. We want to exclude lyricism, drama, symbolism, and so on.
# The painting must be entirely built up with purely plastic elements, namely surfaces and colors. A pictorial element does not have any meaning beyond “itself”; as a consequence, a painting does not have any meaning other than “itself”.
# The construction of a painting, as well as that of its elements, must be simple and visually controllable.
# The painting technique must be mechanic, i.e., exact, anti-impressionistic.
# An effort toward absolute clarity is mandatory."&lt;ref&gt; [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-4614-7052-6%2F1.pdf Springer p.413-4]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The group was short lived and only exhibited together on three occasions in 1930 as part of larger group exhibitions, the first being at the ''Salon des Surindépendents'' in June, followed by ''Production Paris 1930'' in [[Zürich]], and in August the exhibition ''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'' (International exhibition of post-cubist art) in [[Stockholm]], curated by Carlsund. In the catalog to the latter, Carlsund states that the group's "programme is clear: absolute Purism. [[Neo-Plasticism]], [[Purism (arts)|Purism]] and [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] combined".&lt;ref&gt;''AC: Internationell utställning av postkubistisk konst'', Stockholm, 1930, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before van Doesburg's death in 1931, the members of the Art Concret group still active in Paris united with the larger association [[Abstraction-Création]].

==Theoretical background==
{{further|Mathematics and art }}
In 1930, [[Michel Seuphor]] had defined the role of the abstract artist in the first issue of ''Cercle et Carré''. It was “to establish, on the foundations of a structure that is simple, severe and unadorned in every part, and within a basis of unconcealed narrow unity with this structure, an architecture which, using the technical means available to its period, expresses in a clear language that which is truly immanent and immutable.”&lt;ref&gt;Jean Luc Daval, "Avant Garde Art 1914-1939, Skira, Geneva 1980", p.171&lt;/ref&gt; The art historian Werner Haftmann traces the development of the pure abstraction proposed by Seuphor to the synthesis of Russian [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] and Dutch [[Neo-Plasticism]] in the [[Bauhaus]], where painting abandoned the artificiality of representation for technological authenticity.  “In close connection with architecture and engineering, art should endeavour to give form to life itself … [The former] provided new sources of inspiration as well as new materials – steel, aluminium, glass, synthetic materials.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.285&lt;/ref&gt; 

As van Doesburg had pointed out in his manifesto, in order to be universal, art must abandon subjectivity and find impersonal inspiration purely in the elements of which it is constructed: line, plane and color. Some later artists associated with this tendency, such as [[Victor Vasarély]], [[Jean Dewasne]], [[Mario Negro]] and [[Richard Mortensen]], only came to painting after first studying science.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.340&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, all theoretical advances seek justification in past practice, and in this case the mathematical proportions expressed in abstract form are to be identified in various art forms over millennia. Thus, argued Hartmann, “the elimination of representational images and the overt use of pure geometry do not imply a radical and definitive rejection of the great art of the past, but rather a reassertion of its eternal values stripped of their historical and social disguises.”&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann p.341&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:FFM Sculpture Kontinuitaet 2012 Max Bill 1986 6.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Max Bill]], ''Continuity (Colossus of Frankfurt),'' 1986, collection: [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Frankfurt am Main]]. Max Bill "was keen on creating works based on mathematical and geometric foundations—material manifestations of intellectual processes that resisted symbolism." &lt;ref&gt;[http://db-artmag.de/en/66/news/max-bills-continuity-in-a-new-location/  Monolith on the Water—Max Bill’s "Continuity" in a New Location; Deutsche Bank Art works]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While Abstraction-Création was a grouping of all modernistic tendencies, there were those within it who carried the idea of mathematically inspired art and the term ‘concrete art’ to other countries when they moved elsewhere. A key figure among them was Joaquin Torres García, who returned to South America in 1934 and mentored artists there. Some of those went on to found the group [[Madí|''Arte Concreto Invención'']] in Buenos Aires in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the designer [[Max Bill]], who had studied at the [[Bauhaus]] in 1927-9. After returning to Switzerland, he helped organize the [[Allianz (arts)|Allianz]] group to champion the ideals of Concrete Art. In 1944 he organized the first international exhibition in Basle and at the same time founded ''abstract-konkret'', the monthly bulletin of the Gallerie des Eaux Vives in Zurich.&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt; By 1960 Bill was organizing a large retrospective exhibition of Concrete Art in Zürich illustrating 50 years of its development.

Abstraction, which had been quietly gathering momentum in Italy between the world wars, emerged officially in the [http://www.kettererkunst.com/dict/movimento-arte-concreta.shtml ''Movimento d'arte concreta''] (MAC) in 1948, whose foremost exponent, [[Alberto Magnelli]], was another past member of Abstraction-Création and had been living in France for many years. However, some seventy native painters were represented in the ''Arte astratta e concreta in Italia'' exhibition held three years later at the National Gallery in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, p.340&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris recognition of this approach resulted in several exhibitions of which the first was titled ''Art Concret'' and held at the Gallerie René Drouin during the summer of 1945. Described as "the first major post-World War 2 exhibition of abstract art”,&lt;ref&gt;Ann Lee Morgan, ''Historical Dictionary of Contemporary Art'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2016&lt;/ref&gt; the artists exhibited there included the older generation of abstractionists: [[Jean Arp]], [[Sophie Taeuber-Arp]], [[Sonia Delaunay]], [[César Domela]], [[Otto Freundlich]], [[Jean Gorin]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], Alberto Magnelli, Piet Mondrian, Antoine Pevsner and van Doesburg. In the following year a series of annual exhibitions began in the [[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]], which included some of these artists and were devoted, according to its articles of association, to “works of art commonly called: concrete art, non-figurative or abstract art".&lt;ref&gt;Georges Folmer, "Le Salon des Réalités Nouvelles : pour et contre l’art concret", [http://www.folmer.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/salondesrealitesnouvelles.pdf p.2]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951 [http://www.kunstzolder.be/en/movement/groupe-espace Groupe Espace] was founded in France to harmonize painting, sculpture and architecture as a single discipline. This grouped sculptors and architects with old established artists such as Sonia Delaunay and Jean Gorin and the newly emergent Jean Dewasne and Victor Vasarély. Its manifesto was published in ''L’Architecture d’Aujourd’hui'' that year and placarded on the streets of Paris, championing its aim of the harmonious development of all human activities. It extended beside into practical politics, having elected as its honorary president the Minister for Reconstruction and Urban Development, [[Eugène Claudius-Petit]].&lt;ref&gt;Eve Roy, [http://musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/fleger/sites/musees-nationaux-alpesmaritimes.fr/files/eve_roy_la_pre_sence_fondamentale_de_la_plastique_19_avril_2013.pdf  “La présence fondamentale de la plastique, L’exposition du Groupe Espace à Biot en 1954: un essai de synthèse des arts”], 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

As time progressed, a distinction began to be made between ‘cold abstraction’, which was identified with geometric Concrete Art, and ‘warm abstraction’, which, as it moved towards the various kinds of [[Lyrical abstraction]], reintroduced personality into art.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Moszynska, Abstract Art, Thames &amp; Hudson, London 1990, p.120&lt;/ref&gt; The former eventually fed into international movements building on technological aspects championed by the pioneers of Concrete Art, emerging as [[optical art]], [[kinetic art]] and programmatic art.&lt;ref name=DelPuppo2013&gt;Alessandro Del Puppo, ''L'arte contemporanea: Il secondo novecento'', Einaudi, 2013, table 3 page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The term Concrete also began to be extended to other disciplines than painting, including sculpture, photography and poetry. Justification for this was theorized in South America in the 1959 [[Neo-Concrete Movement|Neo-Concrete Manifesto]], written by a group of artists in Rio de Janeiro who included [[Lygia Clark]], [[Hélio Oiticica]] and [[Lygia Pape]].&lt;ref&gt;Stiles&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation agriculture''' (CA) can be defined by a statement given by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] as “a concept for resource-saving agricultural crop production that strives to achieve acceptable profits together with high and sustained production levels while concurrently conserving the environment” (FAO 2007).

Agriculture according to the New Standard Encyclopedia is “one of the most important sectors in the economies of most nations” (New Standard 1992). At the same time conservation is the use of resources in a manner that safely maintains a resource that can be used by humans. Conservation has become critical because the global population has increased over the years and more food needs to be produced every year (New Standard 1992). Sometimes referred to as "agricultural environmental management", conservation agriculture may be sanctioned and funded through conservation programs promulgated through agricultural legislation, such as the [[U.S. Farm Bill]].

== Key principles ==
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has determined that CA has three key principles that producers (farmers) can proceed through in the process of CA. These three principles outline what conservationists and producers believe can be done to conserve what we use for a longer period of time.

The first key principle in CA (Conservation Agriculture) is practicing minimum soil disturbance which is essential to maintaining minerals within the soil, stopping erosion, and preventing water loss from occurring within the soil. In the past agriculture has looked at soil tillage as a main process in the introduction of new crops to an area. It was believed that tilling the soil would increase fertility within the soil through mineralization that takes place in the soil. Also tilling of soil can cause severe erosion and crusting which leads to a decrease in soil fertility. Today tillage is seen as destroying organic matter that can be found within the soil cover. [[No-till farming]] has caught on as a process that can save soil organic levels for a longer period and still allow the soil to be productive for longer periods (FAO 2007). Additionally, the process of tilling can increase time and labor for producing that crop. Minimum soil disturbance also reduce destruction of soil micro and macro-organism habitats that is common in conventional ploughing practices.  

When no-till practices are followed, the producer sees a reduction in production cost for a certain crop. Tillage of the ground requires more money in order to fuel tractors or to provide feed for the animals pulling the plough. The producer sees a reduction in labor because he or she does not have to be in the fields as long as a conventional farmer.

The second key principle in CA is much like the first in dealing with protecting the soil. The principle of managing the top soil to create a permanent organic soil cover can allow for growth of organisms within the soil structure. This growth will break down the mulch that is left on the soil surface. The breaking down of this mulch will produce a high organic matter level which will act as a fertilizer for the soil surface. If CA practices were used done for many years and enough organic matter was being built up at the surface, then a layer of mulch would start to form. This layer helps prevent soil erosion from taking place and ruining the soil's profile or layout. The presence of mulching also reduce the velocity of runoff and the impact of rain drops thus reducing soil erosion and runoff.

According to the article “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture”, the layer of mulch that is built up over time will become like a buffer zone between soil and mulch and this will help reduce wind and water erosion. With this comes the protection of the soil's surface when rain falls on the ground. Land that is not protected by a layer of mulch is left open to the elements (Hobbs et al. 2007). This type of ground cover also helps keep the temperature and moisture levels of the soil at a higher level rather than if it was tilled every year (FAO 2007).

The third principle is the practicing diverse crop rotations or crop interactions. According to an article published in the ''Physiological Transactions of the Royal Society'' called “The role of conservation agriculture and sustainable agriculture,” crop rotation can be used best as a disease control against other preferred crops (Hobbs et al. 2007). This process will not allow pests such as insects and weeds to be set into a rotation with specific crops. Rotational crops will act as a natural insecticide and herbicide against specific crops. Not allowing insects or weeds to establish a pattern will help to eliminate problems with yield reduction and infestations within fields (FAO 2007). Crop rotation can also help build up soil infrastructure. Establishing crops in a rotation allows for an extensive buildup of rooting zones which will allow for better water infiltration (Hobbs et al. 2007).

Organic molecules in the soil break down into phosphates, nitrates and other beneficial elements which are thus better absorbed by plants. Plowing increases the amount of oxygen in the soil and increases the aerobic processes, hastening the breakdown of organic material. Thus more nutrients are available for the next crop but, at the same time, the soil is depleted more quickly of its nutrient reserves.

== Examples ==
In conservation agriculture there are many examples that can be looked towards as a way of farming and at the same time conserving. These practices are well known by most producers. The process of no-till is one that follows the first principle of CA, causing minimal mechanical soil disturbance. No-till also brings other benefits to the producer . According to the FAO, tillage is one of the most “energy consuming” processes that can be used: It requires a lot of labor, time, and fuel to till. Producers can save 30% to 40% of time and labor by practicing the no-till process. (FAO 3020)

Besides conserving the soil, there are other examples of how CA is used. According to an article in ''Science'' called “Farming and the Fate of Wild Nature” there are two more kinds of CA . The practice of wildlife-friendly farming and land sparing are ideas for producers who are looking to practice better conservation towards biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005).

=== Wildlife-friendly farming ===
Wildlife-friendly farming is a practice of setting aside land that will not be developed by the producer (farmer). This land will be set aside so that biodiversity has a chance to establish itself in areas with agricultural fields. At the same time, the producer is attempting to lower the amount of fertilizer and pesticides used on the fields so that organisms and microbial activity have a chance to establish themselves in the soil and habitat (Green, et al. 2005). But as in all systems, not all can be perfect. To create a habitat suitable for biodiversity something has to be reduced, and as in this case for agriculture farmers, yields can be reduced. This is where the second idea of land sparing can be looked on as an alternative manner.

=== Land sparing ===
Land sparing is another way that producer and conservationist can be on the same page. Land sparing advocates for the land that is being used for agricultural purposes to continue to produce crops at increased yield. With an increase in yield on all land that is in use, other land can be set aside for conservation and production for biodiversity. Agricultural land stays in production but would have to increase its yield potential to keep up with demand. Land that is not being put into agriculture would be used for conserving biodiversity (Green, et al. 2005). In fact, data from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] shows that between 1961 and 2012, the amount of arable land needed to produce the same amount of food declined by 68 percent worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Ausubel|first1=Jesse H.|author-link1=Jesse H.

== Benefits ==
In the field of CA there are many benefits that both the producer and conservationist can obtain.

On the side of the conservationist, CA can be seen as beneficial because there is an effort to conserve what people use every day. Since agriculture is one of the most destructive forces against biodiversity, CA can change the way humans produce food and energy. With conservation come environmental benefits of CA. These benefits include less erosion possibilities, better water conservation, improvement in air quality due to lower emissions being produced, and a chance for larger biodiversity in a given area.

On the side of the producer and/or farmer, CA can eventually do all that is done in conventional agriculture, and it can conserve better than conventional agriculture. CA according to Theodor Friedrich, who is a specialist in CA, believes “Farmers like it because it gives them a means of conserving, improving, and making more efficient use of their natural resources" (FAO 2006). Producers will find that the benefits of CA will come later rather than sooner. Since CA takes time to build up enough organic matter and have soils become their own fertilizer, the process does not start to work overnight. But if producers make it through the first few years of production, results will start to become more satisfactory.

CA is shown to have even higher yields and higher outputs than conventional agriculture once it has been established over long periods. Also, a producer has the benefit of knowing that the soil in which his crops are grown is a renewable resource. According to New Standard Encyclopedia, soils are a renewable resource, which means that whatever is taken out of the soil can be put back over time (New Standard 1992). As long as good soil upkeep is maintained, the soil will continue to renew itself. This could be very beneficial to a producer who is practicing CA and is looking to keep soils at a productive level for an extended time.

The farmer and/or producer can use this same land in another way when crops have been harvested. The introduction of grazing livestock to a field that once held crops can be beneficial for the producer and also the field itself. Livestock manure can be used as a natural fertilizer for a producer’s field which will then be beneficial for the producer the next year when crops are planted once again. The practice of grazing livestock using CA helps the farmer who raises crops on that field and the farmer who raises the livestock that graze off that field. Livestock produce compost or manure which are a great help in generating soil fertility (Pawley W.H. 1963). The practices of CA and grazing livestock on a field for many years can allow for better yields in the following years as long as these practices continue to be followed.
     
The FAO believes that there are three major benefits from CA: 
* Within fields that are controlled by CA the producer will see an increase in organic matter. 
* Increase in water conservation due to the layer of organic matter and ground cover to help eliminate transportation and access runoff. 
* Improvement of soil structure and rooting zone.

== Future development ==
As in any other business, producers and conservationists are always looking towards the future. In this case CA is a very important process to be looked at for future generation. There are many organizations that have been created to help educate and inform producers and conservationists in the world of CA. These organizations can help to inform, conduct research, and buy land in order to preserve animals and plants (New Standard 1992).

Another way in which CA is looking to the future is through prevention. According to the ''European Journal of Agronomy'' producers are looking for ways to reduce leaching problems within their fields. These producers are using the same principles within CA, in that they are leaving cover over their fields in order to save fields from erosion and leaching of chemicals (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Processes and studies like this are allowing for a better understanding of how to conserve what we are using and finding ways to put back something that may have been lost before.

In the same journal article is presented another way in which producers and conservationists are looking towards the future. Circulation of plant nutrients can be a vital part for conserving the future. An example of this would be the use of animal manure. This process has been used for quite some time now, but the future is looking towards ways to handle and conserve nutrients within manure for a longer time. But besides animal waste, food and urban waste are also being looked towards as a way to use growth within CA (Kirchmann &amp; Thorvaldsson 2000). Turning these products from waste to being used to grow crops and improve yields is something that would be beneficial for conservationists and producers.

'''Agri-environment schemes'''

In 1992, ‘agri-environment schemes’ became compulsory for all European Union Member States. In the following years the main purpose of these schemes changed slightly. 
Initially, they sought to protect threatened habitats, but gradually shifted their focus to the prevention of the loss of wildlife from agricultural landscapes. Most recently, the schemes are placing more emphasis on improving the services that the land can provide to humans (e.g. pollination). Overall, farmers involved in the scheme aim to practice environmentally friendlier farming techniques such as: reducing the use of pesticides, managing or altering their land to increase more wildlife friendly habitats (e.g. increasing areas of trees and bushes), reducing irrigation, conserving soil, and organic farming. 
As the changes in practices that ensure the protection of the environment are costly to farmers, the EU developed agri-environment schemes to financially compensate individual farmers for applying these changes and therefore increased the implementation of conservation agriculture. 
The schemes are voluntary for farmers. Once joined, they commit to a minimum of five years during which they have to adopt various sustainable farming techniques.
According to the Euro-stat website, in 2009 the agricultural area enrolled in agri-environment schemes covered 38.5 million hectares (20.9% of agricultural land in the 27 member states of the EU at the time) (Agri-environmental indicator 2015). The European Commission spent a total of €3.23 billion on agri-environment schemes in 2012, significantly exceeding the cost of managing special sites of conservation (Natura 2000) that year, which came to a total of €39.6 million (Batáry et al. 2015). 
There are two main types of agri-environment schemes which have shown different outcomes. Out-of-production schemes tend to be used in [[extensive farming]] practices (where the farming land is widespread and less [[intensive farming]] is practiced), and focus on improving or setting land aside that will not be used for the production of food, for example, the addition of wildflower strips.
In-production schemes (used for a smaller scale, but more intensively farmed land) focus on the sustainable management of arable crops or grassland, for example reduction of pesticides, reduction of grassland mowing, and most commonly, organic farming. In a 2015 review of studies examining the effects of the two schemes, it was found that out-of-production schemes had a higher success rate at enhancing the number of thriving species around the land. 
The reason behind this is thought to be the scheme’s focus on enhancing specific species by providing them with more unaltered habitats, which results in more food resources for the specific species.
On the other hand, in-production schemes attempt to enhance the quality of the land in general, and are thus less species specific. 
Based on the findings, the reviewers suggest that schemes which more specifically target the declining groups of species, may be more effective. The findings and the targets will be implemented between 2015 and 2020, so that by 2025, the effectiveness of these schemes can be re-assessed and will have increased significantly (Batáry et al. 2015).

== Problems ==
As much as conservation agriculture can benefit the world, there are some problems that come with it. There are many reasons why conservation agriculture cannot always be a win-win situation.
 
There are not enough people who can financially turn from conventional farming to conservation. The process of CA takes time; when a producer first becomes a conservationist, the results can be a financial loss to them(in most cases, the investment and policy generally exist). CA is based upon establishing an organic layer and producing its own fertilizer and this may take time. It can be many years before a producer will start to see better yields than he/she has had previously. Another financial undertaking is purchasing of new equipment. When starting to use CA, a producer may have to buy new planters or drills in order to produce effectively. These financial tasks are ones that may impact whether or not a producer decides to switch to CA or not.

With the struggle to adapt comes the struggle to make CA grow across the globe. CA has not spread as quickly as most conservationists would like. The reason for this is because there is not enough pressure for producers in places such as North America to change their way of living to a more conservationist outlook. But in the tropics there is more pressure to change to conservation areas because of the limited resources that are available. Places like Europe have also started to catch onto the ideas and principles of CA, but still nothing much is being done to change due to there being a minimal amount of pressure for people to change their ways of living (FAO 2006).

With CA comes the idea of producing enough food. With cutting back in fertilizer, not tilling the ground, and other processes comes the responsibility to feed the world. According to the Population Reference Bureau, there were around 6.08 billion people on Earth in the year 2000. By 2050 there will be an estimated 9.1 billion people. With this increase comes the responsibility for producers to increase food supply using the same or less land than we use today. Problems arise in the fact that if CA farms do not produce as much as conventional farms, this leaves the world with less food for more people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="163365">The [[writ]] of '''''coram nobis''''' (also known as ''writ of error coram nobis'', ''writ of coram vobis'', or ''writ of error coram vobis'') is a legal order allowing a court to correct its original judgment upon discovery of a [[fundamental error]] that did not appear in the records of the original judgment's proceedings and would have prevented the judgment from being pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Mixon'', 983 S.W.2d 661, 672 (Tenn. 1999)]&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "coram nobis" is Latin for "before us" and the meaning of its full form, ''quae coram nobis resident'', is "which [things] remain in our presence".  The writ of coram nobis originated in the [[England and Wales|English]] court of [[common law]] in the [[English legal system]] during the [[16th century|sixteenth century]].

The writ of coram nobis still exists today in a few courts in the United States. In 1907, the writ became obsolete in England and replaced by other means of correcting errors; however, the writ survives in the United States in various forms in the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], in sixteen [[State court (United States)|state courts]], and the [[Superior Court of the District of Columbia|District of Columbia courts]]. For those courts with the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis, the rules and guidelines differ – sometimes significantly.  Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  In other words, the criteria required to issue the writ in one state (or federal) court system are different from the criteria required to issue the writ in a different court system.  A writ can be granted only by the court where the original judgment was entered, so those seeking to correct a judgment must understand the criteria required for that specific court.

==History==

===England===
The ''writ of error coram nobis'' originated in England over 500 years ago. The name of the writ combines three terms: writ, writ of error, and coram nobis. '''Writ''' is an official written command. '''Writ of error''' provides a superior court the means to correct errors of a lower court. Writ of error '''''coram nobis''''' is a variation of the writ of error and provides a court the means to correct its own errors.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Edward N. [https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1559&amp;context=dlj ''The Writs of Error Coram Nobis and Coram Vobis''.] Duke Bar Journal 2.1 (1951): 29-39. p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Edward the Confessor sealed writ.jpg|thumb|A sealed writ of [[Edward the Confessor]], a king of England who died in 1066 – the same year as the Norman Conquest]]

==== Writ ====
Sometime before the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|tenth century]], officials in England began utilizing writs to convey orders.&lt;ref&gt;Harper-Bill, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=FaI5tE6z07gC ''Anglo-Norman Studies, XXVII: Proceedings of the Battle Conference, 1994.''] Boydell Press (1995). 114-116.&lt;/ref&gt; A "[[writ]]" was simply a short written command issued by a person in authority. It was customary for the sender to [[Great Seal of the Realm|seal]] this written command as proof of its authenticity. In the days when writing was a rare art, a writ was revered because the person receiving the command was unlikely to deny or question its legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, Edward. [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2956&amp;context=ylj ''The Prerogative Writs in English Law''.] The Yale Law Journal 32.6 (1923): 523-534.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066 led to the establishment of a strong, centralized monarchy. The first [[Normans|Norman]] [[King of England]], [[William the Conqueror]], modified writs to become mainly framed in Latin, increased the number of writs to cover additional royal commands, and established the ''[[Curia Regis]] '' in England.&lt;ref&gt;D. Douglas, ''William the Conqueror'' (London 1966) p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Curia Regis'', a Latin term meaning "royal council", consisted of the King of England and his loyal advisors. The ''Curia Regis'' accompanied the King as he travelled. This council administered all of the King's governmental activities, including judicial matters.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law.]'' Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 32-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important members of the ''Curia Regis'' was the [[Lord Chancellor]]. The Lord Chancellor led the chancery. [[Chancery (medieval office)|Chancery]] is a general term for a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] writing office that was responsible for the production of official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Corèdon, Christopher, and Ann Williams. [https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Dictionary_of_Medieval_Terms_and_Phras.html?id=RxJlQgAACAAJ ''A Dictionary of Medieval Terms and Phrases'']. Cambridge, England: D.S. Brewer, 2004. p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lord Chancellor wrote writs on behalf of the King, maintained all official documents, and acted as the keeper of the [[Great Seal of the Realm|royal seal]]. This position, in effect, placed the Lord Chancellor as the head of the English legal system. The King, however, was the ultimate leader of the kingdom; therefore, the Lord Chancellor issued writs under the guidance of what he believed to be the best interests of the King.  Between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the Lord Chancellor had a large control over issuance of all original writs. An original writ began a legal proceeding, while a judicial writ was issued during a legal proceeding.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. p 396.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error ====
One such "original" writ was the writ of error. In medieval England, the word "[[appeal]]" was not the term used to describe a request to review the legality of a lower court's decision. Instead, a "petition of error" requested higher courts to review the legality of an order or sentence.  Petitioners brought a petition of error before the Lord Chancellor. Due to his position and close relationship with the law, the Lord Chancellor could naturally determine if the petition provided sufficient evidence of an error and, if so, the type of writ most appropriate to correct the error. If a lower court committed an error of law, the Lord Chancellor would issue a writ of error. A writ of error required the lower court to deliver the "records"&lt;ref&gt;The record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict. The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury. See Holdsworth, William Searle. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ ''A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt; of the case to a [[superior court]] where the court reviewed the case for legal errors. Because a writ of error was only available for a higher court to determine if a lower court committed an [[Question of law|error of law]], courts needed another type of writ to correct its own decision upon an [[Question of law|error of fact]]. To rectify this issue, the Lord Chancellor created a new writ - the writ of error coram nobis. Thus, the original writ of coram nobis provided the means to correct errors that the writ of error could not correct. Unlike the writ of error, the writ of coram nobis:

#allowed the same court that presided over the original case to correct its own error, and

No. 57603-57612. EB Gould, 1827 p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Writ of error coram nobis ====
“Coram nobis” is Latin for “before us”. Initially, when the Lord Chancellor issued orders on behalf of the King and the royal court, the word “us” simply referred to the King, the Lord Chancellor, and other judges of this court. The royal court originated within the ''Curia Regis'', which began during the [[England in the High Middle Ages|twelfth and thirteenth centuries]], under the realm of [[Henry II of England|Henry the Second]] (Henry II). Henry II made writs available for purchase by private individuals seeking justice, thus initiating a vast expansion of writs within the [[common law]].&lt;ref&gt;G. O. Sayles, ''The Medieval Foundations of England'' (London 1966) p. 305 and p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand of judicial maters before the ''Curia Regis'' in the twelfth century led to the establishment of two central courts: the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|Court of King's Bench]] and the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. These courts became the superior courts to all other courts in England, including local and tribunal courts such as the [[Hundred (county division)|Hundred Courts]] and [[Court of Piepowders]].

*'''The Court of King's Bench''' heard all complaints and pleas addressed to the King. This court was also known as the Court of Queen's Bench during the reign of a female monarch. Members of this court included the King and his closest advisors. This court always travelled with the King as he travelled throughout England and into other countries.&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Frederick Bernays. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/abaj59&amp;div=161&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Tracing the Origins of the Court of King's Bench''] ABAJ 59 (1973): 753-754.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of King's Bench, the original full name of the writ was '''''quae coram nobis resident''''' or "Let the record remain before us". The words "let the record remain" indicate the court record of the original case remained with the court of King's Bench, unlike a writ of error, where the record moved to a different court. The words "coram nobis" ("before us") referred to the role of the King who served on the King's Bench. The King's place on the court of King's Bench became increasingly irregular; and by 1421, the King's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King. Although the King's presence was theoretical, the Lord Chancellor and his office continued to issue writs as if the King continued to as part of this court.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, J. H. ''An Introduction to English Legal History''. (2002). Butterworths LexisNexis. p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Court of Common Pleas''' was authorized by [[Magna Carta]] to sit in a central, fixed location.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Common Pleas, Court of|volume=6|page=779}}&lt;/ref&gt; This court heard complaints and pleas that did not require the King's presence.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. (1977). [https://jstor.org/stable/844792 ''The Origins of Common Pleas and King's Bench'']. The American Journal of Legal History, 21(3), 245.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Lord Chancellor issued the writ to the court of Common Pleas, the original full name was '''''quae coram vobis resident''''', or "Let the record remain before you". These words indicate that the records of the original case remained with the judges of the Court of Common Pleas so that it may review a case it previously decided to determine if an error of fact occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Prickett, Morgan. [https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1744&amp;context=lawreview ''The Writ of Error Coram Nobis in California'']. (1990). Santa Clara L. Rev. 30: 1-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the authority to issue writs shifted from the Lord Chancellor to the courts.  Although the King was no longer part of the court issuing the writ, the name "coram nobis" continued because courts associated the name with its function rather than its original Latin meaning. Thus, in English law, the definition of "coram nobis" evolved and is now redefined as a remedy for a court to correct its own error.&lt;ref&gt;Piar, Daniel F. [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nkenlr30&amp;div=28&amp;id=&amp;page= ''Using Corum Nobis to Attack Wrongful Convictions: A New Look at an Ancient Writ'']. N. Ky. L. Rev. 30 (2003): p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Abolition in English courts====
The first case involving the writ of coram nobis is unknown due to incomplete historical records prior to the sixteenth century; however, the first recorded case involving the writ of coram nobis occurred in 1561 in the case of ''Sir Gilbert Debenham and Another v. Bateman''.&lt;ref&gt;2 Dyer 195(b), See also Green, W. [https://books.google.com/books?id=I0QwAAAAIAAJ The English Reports. ''Debenham v. Bateman''] v4; v. 73. (1907) p. 430.&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1705, the writ of error was originally a matter entirely up to the discretion of either the monarch or those with the authority to make decisions on behalf of the monarch; but in 1705, the court held that the writ was a matter of right instead of a matter of discretion.  Despite making writs of error a matter of right, courts rarely used these writs because of their cumbersome and impractical procedure.  A writ of error moved the record from the original court to a higher court; however, the record only contained information on the arraignment, the plea, the issue, and the verdict.  The record did not include the most material parts of a trial, including the evidence and the judge's direction to the jury.&lt;ref&gt;Holdsworth, William Searle. ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=gTJLAAAAYAAJ A History of English Law]''. Vol. 1. Methuen, 1922. pp. 215-218.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, England abolished all writs of error, including the writs of coram nobis and coram vobis, and replaced them with appellate procedures encompassing all rights previously available through these writs.  Thus, the abolition of the writ of coram nobis in England was due mostly to administration difficulties with the writ of error, and not because of administration difficulties with the writ of coram nobis itself.  The law abolishing the writ in civil cases was the Common Law Procedure Act 1852.&lt;ref&gt;Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, 15 &amp; 16 Vict., ch. 76, s. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;  The laws abolishing the writ in criminal cases was the Criminal Appeal Act of 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Appeal Act 1907, 7 Edw., ch. 23, s. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
After arriving in North America in the [[17th century|seventeenth century]], [[British colonization of the Americas|English settlers]] established [[Thirteen Colonies|English colonies]]. Within these colonies, the settlers created colonial courts that adhered to the [[English Law|English legal system]] and issued writs in the same manner as English courts. After the United States obtained [[American Revolution|independence from England]], state governments, as well as the federal government, [[Reception statute|provided courts the authority to continue to rely]] upon writs as a source of law unless issuing the writ violated the state or federal constitution or if either the state or federal government subsequently enacted a statute restricting the writ.&lt;ref&gt;Chemerinsky, E. (1986).[https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1667&amp;context=faculty_scholarship ''Thinking About Habeas Corpus'']. Case W. Res. L. Rev., 37, 748, 751.&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of allowing courts to issue writs was to fill a void whenever the state constitution, state statutes, the U.S. Constitution or federal statutes did not address an issue to be decided before the court.  Writs were especially important when the federal government, as well as each state, first established its judicial system.  During those times, there were very few (if any) statutes or case laws for courts to rely upon as guidance. In those circumstances, the English writs provided fledgling federal and state courts an important source of law.
Over time, writs became significantly less important as Congress and state legislatures enacted more statutes and further defined rules for its judiciary.  Writs also evolved independently in the federal judicial system and each state's judicial system so that a writ within one judicial systems may have a vastly different purpose and procedures from the same writ in other judicial systems.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkes, Donald E., ''Federal and State Postconviction Remedies and Relief''. Harrison Company, 2001. p. 55-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Different characteristics of a writ from one judicial system to another is the result of the [[Federalism|federal]] system of government prescribed within the United States Constitution.  [[Federalism in the United States]] is a mixed system of government that combines a [[Federal government of the United States|national federal government]] and [[State governments of the United States|state governments]].  While federal courts are superior to state courts in federal matters, the Constitution limits the reach of federal courts; thereby, providing state courts general sovereignty and law-making authority over a wider range of topics. This sovereignty allows each judicial system to decide whether to adopt writs and the function and purpose of each writ it adopts. Thus, the use and application of writs, including the writ of coram nobis, can vary within each of these judicial systems.

Legislation authorizes a judicial system to issue the writ of coram under one of two conditions:
#Where legislation permits courts to issue writs, but the legislation does not specifically mention the writ of coram nobis. Courts throughout the United States generally have the authority to issue writs whenever the constitution or statutes encompassing a court's jurisdiction do not address an issue before the court and issuance of the writ is necessary to achieve justice.  This authority was especially important for earlier courts when there were few statutes or case law to rely upon.  Over time, legislatures enacted statutes encompassing almost all issues that could arise before a court.  As a result, courts today rarely need to rely on writs as a source of law to address an issue not covered by statute. One example of a rare issue where courts have the occasion to issue the writ of coram nobis is the issue of former federal prisoners who have new information and this new information would have resulted in a different verdict if the information were available at the time of trial. Whenever this specific issue comes before a federal court, there is no federal statute that specifically guides or regulates how the court must proceed; however, federal courts have determined that the writ of coram nobis is the proper vehicle to achieve justice under this specific issue.
#Where legislation specifically permits courts to issue, by name,  the writ of coram nobis. The use of writs in the United States is more common when legislation has authorized a writ by name and regulated its use by courts.  For earlier courts, the practice of issuing writs was an integral part of the judicial system's proceedings. Therefore, when legislatures enacted laws to regulate issues associated with writs, some legislatures adopted the exact name of the writ within its rules while other legislatures chose to abolish the names of the writ but provided an alternative remedy under a different name.  Tennessee is an example of a state where its legislature enacted a statute expressly authorizing courts to issue, by name, the “Writ of Error Coram Nobis” and regulated how this writ should be issued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/ Tenn.Code Ann. § 27-7 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, other states replaced the writ of coram nobis with other post-conviction remedies. For example, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a law on January 25, 1966 that expressly abolished the name “writ of coram nobis” and encated the state's Post Conviction Relief Act, which is now the sole means for obtaining post-conviction relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4875028688006369069&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Commonwealth v. Descardes'', 136 A.3d 493, 497-502 (Pa. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coram nobis in United States federal courts==
[[File: Coram nobis Timeline in US federal courts.png |thumb|500px|right|Historical dates for the writ of coram nobis in federal courts and post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners.]]
In 1789, Congress passed the Judiciary Act to establish the judicial courts in the United States. This Act also allows courts to issue writs, including the writ of coram nobis. Originally, federal courts applied the writ of coram nobis only to correct technical errors, such as those made by a clerk of the court in the records of the proceedings.  The 1914 Supreme Court case ''United States v. Mayer'', expanded the scope of the writ of coram nobis to include [[fundamental error]]s, but the Court declined in this case to decide whether federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506 ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 35, 69 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts are permitted to issue the writ of coram nobis to correct fundamental errors, such as those where discovery of new information is sufficient to prove a convicted felon is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2220 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the ''Morgan'' case, federal courts traditionally issue a writ of coram nobis whenever a former federal prisoner petitions the original sentencing court to set aside the conviction based upon new information that was not available when the petitioner was in-custody and where this new information demonstrates that the conviction was a result of a fundamental error.

===History of the writ of coram nobis in federal courts from 1789 to 1954===
====The Judiciary Act of 1789====
The history of the writ of coram nobis in United States federal courts began in 1789 when Congress enacted the [[Judiciary Act of 1789|Judiciary Act]]. Under Section 14 of the Judiciary Act, federal courts have the authority to issue a [[writ]] whenever the court deems it necessary to achieve justice and whenever no congressional law covers the issues before the court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;fileName=001/llsl001.db&amp;recNum=204  1st Congress, 1st Session, 1 Stat. 81-82.]&lt;/ref&gt; This section was known as the “All-Writs Provision” of the Judiciary Act until 1948 when it became more commonly known as the “All-Writs Act” after Congress modified the Judicial Code and consolidated this provision into {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9932283031886059336 ''Pa. Bureau of Correction v. U.S. Marshals Service'', 474 U.S. 34, 40-41 (1985)] Since 1789, there have been only a few subtle amendments to the act, but none of the amendments have significantly changed the substance of the act from its original form.  In 1911, Congress adopted the [[Judicial Code of 1911|Judicial Code]] which organized all laws, or statutes, into the ''Code of Laws of the United States of America'' (commonly known as [[United States Code]] and abbreviated U.S.C.).  In 1948, Congress modified the code for the All Writs Act under 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a) where it remains today.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the All Writs Act, federal district courts have the “power to issue writs of [[scire facias]], [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]], and all other writs not specifically provided for by [[statute]].” Congress had not specifically provided by statute the authority for federal courts to issue a writ of coram nobis; therefore, the All Writs Act provides federal courts this authority.&lt;ref&gt;The All-Writs Act only provides federal district courts the ''authority'' to issue writs; but, it does not provide federal district courts the ''jurisdiction'' to hear and issue writs. District courts have the jurisdiction to entertain writs, including a petition for the writ of coram nobis, under {{UnitedStatesCode|18|3231}} which confers on the district court original jurisdiction over "all offenses against the laws of the United States." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6762057459713035389&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Wilkozek'', 822 F. 3d 364, 368 (7th Cir. 2016)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The first case in a federal court to address the writ of coram nobis was ''Strode v. The Stafford Justices'' in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;23 F. Cas. 236 (C.C.D. Va. 1810) (No. 13,537). [https://books.google.com/books?id=ljhFAAAAYAAJ ''Reports of Cases Decided in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Fourth Circuit: (1792-1883)'']. Volume 1. (1837) p. 162-165.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Supreme Court Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the opinion in this Circuit Court case and held that the writ of coram nobis is distinguishable from the writ of error and therefore not subject to the writ of error's statute of limitations. The first Supreme Court case mentioning the writ of coram nobis (using the term coram vobis) is the 1833 case, ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=134783638943220731&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Pickett's Heirs v. Legerwood'', 32 U.S. 144, 147-148 (1833)]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the Court determined that the writ was available to correct its own errors, but the same remedy was also available using the preferred method of submitting a motion to the court.  Eighty years later, in 1914, the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion in ''United States v. Mayer''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3748662799506034506&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Mayer'', 235 U.S. 55, 67 (1914)]&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, while federal courts confirmed the writ of coram nobis was available to federal courts, this remedy was rarely necessary or appropriate in federal courts throughout the nineteenth century for the following two reasons:
#Courts generally considered the writ of coram nobis to be restricted to correct only technical errors, such as discovery of a defendant being under age, evidence that a defendant died before the verdict, or errors made by the court clerk in the recording of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799 ''United States v. Denedo'', at  2220.]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Petitioners could raise a “motion to amend” to correct most of errors also corrected by the writ of coram nobis. Although courts recognized that the writ of coram nobis could also reverse the judgement on such defects, the preferred practice was to present the court with a motion to amend.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Plumer'', 3 Cliff. 28 (Circuit Court of Massachusetts, 1859) published by {{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yl1GAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA538&amp;lpg=PA538#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Federal Decisions: Cases Argued and Determined in the Supreme Court and District Courts of the United States, Volume 1|date=1884|page=541|last=Myer|first=William G.|publisher=The Gilbert Book Company |website=books.google.com |access-date= July 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1946 amendments to the Rules of Civil Procedure ====
In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enactment of these amendments, Congress reviewed all relief previously provided for civil cases through the writ of coram nobis and adopted those avenues of relief into the rules; therefore, eliminating the need for the writ in federal civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.uscourts.gov/rules-policies/archives/committee-reports/advisory-committee-rules-civil-procedure-june-1946|title= Advisory Committee on Rules of Civil Procedure - June 1946|date= June 1, 1946|website= uscourts.gov|access-date= July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the amendment, Congress expressly abolished the writ of coram nobis in Rule 60(b). Later, in 2007, Congress restructured the format of Rule 60, and moved the language expressly abolishing the writ of coram nobis in civil proceedings from Rule 60(b) to Rule 60(e) in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60] The Advisory Committee on Rules for Civil Procedure proposed the amendments in June 1946. Congress passed the proposed amendments in December 1946, and the amendments became effective March 19, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of post-conviction remedies available to former federal prisoners from 1789 to 1954===
====Post-conviction remedies for former federal prisoners prior to 1867====
In 1790, one year after Congress passed the Judiciary Act establishing federal courts, Congress enacted the [[Crimes Act of 1790|Crimes Act]] which created the first comprehensive list of federal offenses. From 1790 until 1867, there are few, if any, records of individuals challenging a federal criminal conviction after completion of the prison sentence.  Two primary reasons explains the absence of any challenges to a conviction by former federal prisoners:
#The Crimes List provided only twenty-three federal crimes.  Seven of these crimes, including treason and murder, were punishable by death. (In comparison, today there are approximately 3,600 to 4,500 federal statutes that impose criminal punishments.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reynolds|first=Glenn Harlan|date=2015-03-29|title=When lawmakers don't even know how many laws exist, how can citizens be expected to follow them?|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/03/29/crime-law-criminal-unfair-column/70630978/|newspaper=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Company |access-date=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 500,000 former federal prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bonczar|first=Thomas P.|date=August 2003|title=Prevalence of Imprisonment in the U.S. Population, 1974-2001|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/pdf/prisontime.pdf|newspaper=CBS News|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|access-date=2018-07-21}} See also {{cite web |url=https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_releases.jsp|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons Release Numbers|date=June 2018|website=bop.gov|access-date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this large population, recent cases where a former federal prisoner is able to find new information sufficient to reverse the conviction is exceedingly rare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the chances of this type of case arising prior to 1867, when the federal prisoner popular was significantly smaller, are even more remote.&lt;ref&gt;The government first reported a census of prisoners in 1880. In 1880, the federal prison population was 2,162. See {{cite web |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/hcsus5084.pdf|title=''Historical Corrections Statistics in the United States, 1850- 1984''|page=29|date=December 1986|website=bjs.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Statistics|access-date=July 23, 2018}}. In comparison, the federal prison population in 2013 was 219,298.

#There were few [[Collateral consequences of criminal conviction|collateral consequences]] stemming from a conviction at this time. Generally, the reason former convicted felons seek a writ of coram nobis is to eliminate collateral consequences ensuing the challenged conviction.  Collateral consequences are indirect consequences of a conviction.  While direct consequences of a conviction are usually issued by a judge in the [[Criminal sentencing in the United States|sentencing]] phase of a case (such as a prison sentence, probation, fines and restitution); indirect consequences of a conviction are not contained within a court sentence. Collateral consequences may include loss of voting privileges, loss of professional licenses, inability to qualify for some employment and housing opportunities, and damage to the person's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://individual.utoronto.ca/dinovitzer/Publications/Hagan_Dinovitzer_1999.pdf Hagan, J., &amp; Dinovitzer, R. (1999). ''Collateral consequences of imprisonment for children, communities, and prisoners'', Crime and Justice 26 (1999): pp. 121-162.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867====
The [[American Civil War]] is historically significant upon the rights of former federal prisoners in two ways.  First, Congress enacted the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 to prevent abuses following the civil war. This Act expanded the writ of habeas corpus to any person, including former prisoners. Second, states began imposing more collateral consequences upon those convicted of crimes; thus, providing more reasons why a person would want to have a wrongful conviction overturned. The loss of voting privileges was one of the most significant collateral consequence of a felony conviction. In 1800, no state prohibited convicted felons from voting; but by end of the U.S. Civil War, nearly eighty percent of state legislatures had passed laws barring felons the right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ir.stthomas.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=ustjlpp Clegg, R., Conway III, G. T., &amp; Lee, K. K. (2008). ''The case against felon voting.'' U. St. Thomas JL &amp; Pub. Pol'y, 2, 3 n.17.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slavery was legal in the United States until the 1860s.  In the 1860 [[United States presidential election, 1860|U.S. presidential election]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], led by [[Abraham Lincoln]], supported the elimination of slavery. This controversial issue was the catalyst for the [[American Civil War]] that began in 1861 following the election of Lincoln and concluded in 1865. On March 3, 1865, President Lincoln signed a joint resolution declaring wives and children of persons in the armed forces to be free; and on December 18, 1865 the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] became effective. This Amendment abolished [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[involuntary servitude]] in the United States. The purpose of the Habeas Act was to provide "what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wife and children of soldiers of the United States, and also to enforce the liberty of all persons."&lt;ref&gt;Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 4151 (1866).

The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 expanded the jurisdiction of the writ of habeas corpus to any person.  As a result, this act eliminated the writ of coram nobis in criminal cases because any person challenging a conviction, regardless of whether the person is in prison or not, could have raised the claim through the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;The writ of coram nobis has many similarities in origin and purpose with the [[writ]] of [[Habeas corpus in the United States|habeas corpus]]. ''Habeas corpus'' is a Latin phrase meaning "you have the body", where the English courts ordered officials to produce the body or deliver the prisoner to the court. See Robertson, J. (2008).

====Act of June 25, 1948====
In 1946, Congress abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases; and the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 provided a remedy for jurisdictional and constitutional errors at the trial at any time, regardless of whether the person was in prison or had completed their sentence. For all practical purposes, the writ of coram nobis had no purpose in federal courts.  In fact, the Supreme Court commented on the writ of coram nobis in a 1947 case and determined "it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where this writ would be necessary or appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Smith''], 331 U.S. 469, 475 n.4 (1947). This statement was quoted by the Supreme Court in [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Carlisle v. United States''], 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996) regarding whether coram nobis petitions are ever appropriate from those who are in custody from the sentence begin challenged. In these cases, [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure]] are controlling.&lt;/ref&gt; But, on June 25, 1948, Congress passed legislation that would lead to the resurrection of the writ. The Act of June 25, 1948 combined two pieces of legislation:
#Congress passed the Act to organize all laws of the United States into a single source of reference, known as the [[United States Code]] (abbreviated U.S.C.). Any law (or statute) ever passed by Congress can be found in the United States Code.  The U.S.C. is divided into 50 titles. Within each title is a chapter, and within each chapter is a section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/topn/safe_doses_act|title= How the US Code is Built.|website= law.cornell.edu|access-date= July 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the titles created in the Act was Title 28 – Judiciary and Judicial Procedure. Chapter 153 of this title is the chapter on Habeas Corpus. Section 2255 of this title is the section providing how prisoners can challenge a conviction. In legal documents, this section is commonly abbreviated 28 U.S.C. §2255.
#Congress passed the Act to solve a problem with habeas corpus petitions. The Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 instructed prisoners to file a writ of habeas corpus with the district court whose territory included the prison.  For example, those imprisoned at [[Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary|Alcatraz Island]], California were required to file a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, even if the prisoner's conviction and sentence originated from a federal court in another district or state.  This rule led to administrative difficulties, especially for the district courts whose territorial jurisdiction included major federal prisons. The Act of June 25, 1948 codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and judicial habeas practice at 28 U.S.C. §2255 and changed the jurisdiction from the district of confinement to the district of sentence; however, the jurisdictional change was the only change Congress intended.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952)], ("the sole purpose [of §2255 ] was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum.")&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite legislative intentions for §2255 to only change the jurisdiction of the district courts, the language of the statute restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. Consequently, former prisoners had no statutory avenue to challenge a conviction.  As a result, this act indirectly resurrected the writ of coram nobis to former prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''United States v. Morgan'' (1954) provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners===
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In 1954, the United States Supreme Court held in ''United States v. Morgan'' that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]
The Act of June 25, 1948 reworded the habeas corpus sections of the United States Code to provide only those individuals in-custody (as a result of a criminal conviction in federal court) access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt; For those who had been convicted of a federal crime but were no longer in-custody, the question was whether the 1948 Act abolished all post-conviction review of a former prisoner's conviction.

In 1952 Robert Morgan, a former federal prisoner who had completed his sentence, petitioned to have his conviction overturned based on information he claimed to be unavailable at the time of his conviction. Although the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 would have allowed Morgan to challenge his conviction using the writ of habeas corpus, the Act of June 25, 1948 restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. The district court denied his petition because Morgan was no longer in custody for the conviction he sought to overturn. Morgan appealed that decision. In 1953, the appellate court disagreed with the district court and determined that the writ of coram nobis was available to Morgan.  The government appealed the appellate court's decision to the US Supreme Court.

The first question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether Congress intended to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners when it restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners only. If the Supreme Court decided that Congress did not intend to abolish any post-conviction remedies to former prisoners, then the second question in ''United States v. Morgan'' was whether the writ of coram nobis was available to challenge a conviction after completion of the petitioner's sentence. On January 4, 1954, the Supreme Court announced its decision. The Court first determined that Congress did not intend within the 1948 Act to eliminate all reviews of criminal convictions for petitioners who had completed their sentence.  Although the 1948 Act restricted former prisoners from challenging a conviction with a writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined by reviewing the legislative notes that Congress did not intend to abolish post-conviction challenges to a sentence from former prisoners.  Justice [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], who authored the [[majority opinion]] for the Court, wrote;
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he purpose of § 2255 was "to meet practical difficulties" in the administration of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction. [] Nowhere in the history of Section 2255 do we find any purpose to impinge upon prisoners' rights of collateral attack upon their convictions. We know of nothing in the legislative history that indicates a different conclusion. We do not think that the enactment of § 2255 is a bar to this motion, and we hold that the District Court has power to grant [the writ of coram nobis].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', at 510-511 (citations removed)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although Congress did exclude former prisoners from challenging a conviction through the writ of habeas corpus, the Court determined that the All Writs Act provides federal courts the authority to issue a writ of coram nobis to former prisoners whenever new evidence proves the underlying conviction was a result of a fundamental error. Thus, ''Morgan'' officially revived the writ of coram nobis as the sole means for post-incarceration judicial review of federal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1277.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Source of rules and procedures governing coram nobis proceedings===
''United States v. Morgan'' provides broad, general guidance to courts on the rules and procedures in coram nobis proceedings, but since the ''Morgan'' case in 1954, the Supreme Court and Congress seldom provide lower courts additional guidance. Thus, Appellate courts generally fill in the gaps and provide guidance for rules and procedures unclarified by Congress and the Supreme Court; however, the interpretations of rules and procedures of coram nobis may differ in each appellate court. Thus, for a former federal prisoner who is attempting to decide whether to file a petition for the writ of coram nobis, it is necessary to understand the source of the rules and procedures.

The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States. [[Article One of the United States Constitution|Article One of the Constitution]] creates the legislature and provides Congress the means to create and enact laws.  [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article Three of the Constitution]] creates the judiciary and provides courts the means to interpret laws. Other than the writ of habeas corpus, the Constitution has no language permitting or restricting courts from issuing specific writs, including the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 9: Limits on Congress|Section 9 of Article One]] states that “the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.”&lt;/ref&gt;

====Congressional enactments====
The [[United States Congress]] enacts laws or [[Statutory law|statutes]], and codifies these statutes in the [[United States Code]].  In contrast to the writ of habeas corpus, Congress has seldom enacted statutes regulating the writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;Congress authorized and regulated the writ of habeas corpus in four important acts:
*The [[Habeas Corpus Act 1867|Habeas Corpus Act of February 5, 1867]] expanded federal courts' habeas jurisdiction by extending federal habeas corpus relief to "any person," including state prisoners, detained "in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States.
*The Act of June 25, 1948 where Congress established 28 U.S.C. sections 2241 to 2255 which restricted the writ of habeas corpus to prisoners and changed the court where a habeas petition is directed from the district court where the prisoner was held to the district court where the prisoner was sentenced. See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17192799817576536682&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hayman'', 342 U.S. 205, 220-221 (1952).]
*In the Act of Nov. 2, 1966, Congress amended habeas statutes to provide “a greater degree of finality of judgments in habeas corpus proceedings.” See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13596761522993185173&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''McCleskey v. Zant'', 499 U.S. 467 (1991).]
*The [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] was incorporated to "curb the abuse of the statutory writ of habeas corpus, and to address the acute problems of unnecessary delay and abuse in [[Capital punishment|capital cases]]." See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3514851794987003120&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Souter v. Jones'', 395 F. 3d 577, 599 (2005).]&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes enacted by Congress regulating the writ of coram nobis are:
*In 1789, Congress enacted the Judicial Act.  The [[All Writs Act]] section of the Judiciary Act provides federal courts the authority to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to the usages and principles of law.” The All Writs Act gives courts the ability to decide which specific writs utilized in English courts are available and appropriate in U.S. federal courts. While Congress provides federal courts the authority to issue writs, it does not provide courts the authority to issue specific writs by name, such as writs of mandamus or writs of coram nobis. The code for the All Writs Act is {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1651}}.
*In 1946, Congress amended the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] to abolish the writ of coram nobis in federal [[Civil procedure in the United States|civil cases]]. Prior to enacting this statute, Congress reviewed all issues previously addressed by federal courts in writ of coram nobis proceedings, and incorporated remedies for those issues within the procedures. Rule 60(e) of this Procedure originated from this statute and states, “The following are abolished: bills of review, bills in the nature of bills of review, and writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, and audita querela.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60]&lt;/ref&gt;
*In  2002, Congress enacted Rule 4(a)(1)(C) of the [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure]] to resolve a conflict among the federal appellate courts regarding the time limitations to file an appeal from an order granting or denying an application for a writ of error coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frap/rule_4 Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure Rule 4(a)(1)(C)].&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this amendment, the federal appellate courts were divided on whether coram nobis appeals have a 10-day time limit or a 60-day time limit.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)] The United States Court of Appeals for the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts determined that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals.  Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;/ref&gt; Rule 4(a)(1)(C) resolved the conflict and established a 60-day time limit to file the notice of appeal from a district court’s judgement in a coram nobis proceeding.

====United States Supreme Court decisions====
Following the Constitution and Congressional statutes, the next highest source for direction and guidance of rules and procedures is the United States Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court is the highest federal court. Lower courts, such as federal appellate courts and federal district courts, must follow the decisions of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has discretionary appellate jurisdiction, meaning the Court chooses to hear cases for reasons it deems “compelling reasons” (such as resolving a conflict in the interpretation of a federal law or resolving an important matter of law).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://litigation.findlaw.com/legal-system/how-does-the-u-s-supreme-court-decide-whether-to-hear-a-case.html |title= How Does the U.S. Supreme Court Decide Whether to Hear a Case?|website=litigation.findlaw.com|access-date= July 8, 2018}} See also [[Supreme Court of the United States#Case Selection|U.S. Supreme Court Case Selection]]. See also [[certiorari#United States law|certiorari]].&lt;/ref&gt; Federal courts, including the Supreme Court, cannot override any law enacted by Congress unless the law violates the Constitution. Federal courts also cannot repeal a statute unless Congress clearly intended to repeal the statute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5251920236993815863 ''Branch v. Smith'', 538 U.S. 254, 273 (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, ''United States v. Morgan'' provides writ of coram nobis to former federal prisoners.  The Court determined coram nobis relief “should be allowed . . . only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502, 505-506 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the circumstances must include all three of these conditions:
*to remedy errors ‘of the most fundamental character’
*when “no other remedy [is] then available”
*“sound reasons [exist] for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers Wolitz, D. (2009). ''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name'', The BYU L. Rev., 1286.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1954, the Supreme Court granted review of only one other coram nobis case.  In 2009, the Court clarified that [[Federal tribunals in the United States|Article I military courts]] have jurisdiction to entertain coram nobis petitions to consider allegations that an earlier judgment of conviction was flawed in a fundamental respect.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9872030110034150799&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Denedo'', 129 S. Ct. 2213, 2224 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other than providing military courts the authority to issue the writ, the Supreme Court has declined to provide federal courts additional guidance in coram nobis proceedings. Appellate courts have occasionally criticized the Supreme Court for failing to provide this additional guidance.  The Seventh Circuit called the writ of coram nobis, “a phantom in the Supreme Court's cases”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2409262715757082555&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Bush'', 888 F. 2d 1145, 1146 (7th Cir. 1989)]&lt;/ref&gt; and contends “[t]wo ambiguous decisions on the subject in the history of the Supreme Court are inadequate.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2409262715757082555&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bush'', at 1149.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Sixth Circuit took a similar stance saying, “[t]he Supreme Court has decided only one coram nobis case in the last forty-two years, ''Morgan'', and that opinion is ambiguous concerning whether proof of an ongoing civil disability is required.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7014365937918134888&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Blanton'', 94 F. 3d 227, 232 (6th Cir. 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; The First Circuit wrote that its decision of time limitations “derives from the Morgan Court's cryptic characterization of coram nobis as a ‘step in the criminal case.’”&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12743813748652182589&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trenkler v.

[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|400px|right|Map of the geographic boundaries of the various United States Courts of Appeals and United States District Courts]]

====Federal courts of appeals decisions====
While the United States Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States federal court system, the United States courts of appeals, or circuit courts, are the intermediate appellate courts.  There are thirteen U.S. courts of appeals. Eleven courts of appeals are numbered First through Eleventh and have geographical boundaries of various sizes.  For example, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of all federal courts in only three states: Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, while the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals consists of nine western states and two U.S. territories.  There is also a Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and a Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Other tribunals also have "Court of Appeals" in their titles, such as the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which hears appeals in court-martial cases.

Congressional statutes and Supreme Court decisions are controlling over courts of appeals.  Absent statutory rules or Supreme Court case law, a court of appeals decision establishes a binding precedent for the courts in its circuit; however, a court of appeals decision is not binding for courts in other circuits. Generally, when a court of appeals hears an issue raised for the first time in that court, it arrives at the same conclusion as other courts of appeals on identical issues raised before those courts.  However, whenever the courts of appeals arrive at different conclusions on the same issue, it creates a “circuit split”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.law.fsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1166&amp;context=articles|title=Constitutional Cacophony: Federal Circuit Splits and the Fourth Amendment|date=2012|page=1139|last=Logan|first=Wayne A.|publisher=Vanderbilt Law Review|website=ir.law.fsu.edu|access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court receives thousands of petitions each year, but only agrees to hear less than 100 of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgemasonlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/16-2_Wachtell.pdf|title=An Empirical Analysis of Supreme Court Certiorari Petition Procedures: The Call for Response and the Call for the Views of the Solicitor General|date=2008|page=241|last= Thompson|first=David C.|last2=Wachtell|first2=Melanie F.|publisher=George Mason Law Review|website=georgemasonlawreview.org |access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most compelling reasons for the Supreme Court to accept a case is to resolve a circuit split. Currently, a circuit split exists in coram nobis cases involves the definition of “adverse consequences”  The Supreme Court determined in ''United States v. Morgan'' that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must demonstrate that adverse consequences exist from the criminal conviction. Some courts of appeals determined adverse consequences occur with any collateral consequence of a conviction while other courts of appeals have limited “adverse consequences” to only a few collateral consequence of a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2880&amp;context=flr |title=Post-McNally Review of Invalid Convictions Through the Writ of Coram Nobis|date=1990|page=986|last=Duszak|first=M. Diane|publisher=Fordham Law Review|website=lawnet.fordham.edu|access-date= July 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal district court decisions====
District courts must abide by congressional statutes, Supreme Court decisions, and decisions of the court of appeals in the federal judicial circuit in which the district court is located. Whenever a district court hears an issue that is not specifically addressed by statute or by case law of a higher court, district courts often “develop the record”. In case of an appeal, the higher courts have the district court's reasoned decision as guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1309191511695911726 ''White v. White'', 886 F. 2d 721, 731 (4th Cir. 1989) (Murnaghan, C.J., dissenting)]&lt;/ref&gt; A developed record not only greatly facilitates the process of appellate review but also ensures that the district court has carefully considered the issues and applied the applicable law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1377706004517212105 ''Jones v. Morris'', 777 F. 2d 1277, 1281 (7th Cir. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria for the writ===
====Rules for petitioners====
Writs of coram nobis are rare in U.S. federal courts due to the stringent criteria for issuance of the writ. ''Morgan'' established the following criteria required in a coram nobis [[petition]] in order for a federal court to issue the writ:&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4612318188218035306&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Morgan'', 346 U.S. 502 (1954)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis is a collateral attack on a [[Judgment (law)|judgement]] in a federal criminal case.''' A “collateral attack” is defined as an attack on a judgement in a proceeding other than a [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Appellate review|direct appeal]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13423175293489651929&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Wall v. Kholi'', 131 S. Ct. 1278, 1284 (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis in a federal court must seek to vacate a federal criminal conviction.''' A writ of coram nobis is not available in federal courts to challenge a conviction in a state court. The federal government operates its own coram nobis procedures independent from state courts. Those seeking to attack a state judgment must follow the post-conviction remedies offered by that state. A writ of coram nobis is also not available for civil cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.''' A person who is on probation is considered "in custody".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4710853263548376302&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Brown'', 117 F.3d 471, 475 (11th Cir. 1997)]&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone filing a coram nobis petition while in custody will have their petition either denied for lack of jurisdiction or categorized as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (or successive 28 U.S.C. § 2255 if the petitioner has previously filed a § 2255 petition).
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must be addressed to the sentencing court.''' To challenge a conviction, the petitioner must send a request for a writ of coram nobis to the court clerk of the district court where the petitioner's conviction originated. In other words, a petitioner must request for the writ in the sentencing court, rather than any convenient federal court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3493090275204032030&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Rawlins v. Kansas'', 714 F. 3d 1189 (10th Cir.2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide valid reasons for not attacking the conviction earlier.''' Petitioners need to show "reasonable diligence", where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels (such as a §&amp;nbsp;2255 petition while in custody). A delay may be considered reasonable when the applicable law was recently changed and made retroactive, when new evidence was discovered that the petitioner could not reasonably have located earlier, or when the petitioner was improperly advised by counsel not to pursue habeas relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14233123309617983670&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Riedl'', 496 F. 3d 1003, 1007 (9th Cir. 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*''' A petition for a writ of coram nobis must raise new issues of law or fact that could not have been raised while the petitioner was in custody.''' In ''Morgan'', the Court announced the writ was available where no other remedy is available. However, petitioners occasionally misinterpret this statement as an opportunity to re-raise arguments from previous post-conviction petitions. Appellate courts have consistently determined that the writ of coram nobis cannot be used as a "second chance" to challenge a conviction using the same grounds raised in a previous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1102942438273961168&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Keane'', 852 F. 2d 199, 203 (7th Cir. 1988)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion and it was denied while in custody must obtain authorization from the district court in order to file a coram nobis petition.''' Currently, this rule only applies to those in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.  In 2018, the Eighth Circuit became the first appellate court to decide whether a petition for writ of coram nobis is governed by the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") restrictions on successive relief as defined in § 2255(h)(1) and (2). The Eighth Circuit held that coram nobis petitioners who filed a § 2255 motion, while in custody and the motion was denied while the petitioner remained in custody, is restricted by AEDPA from filing a coram nobis petition without first obtaining authorization from the ''district court'' to file the coram nobis petition. This requirement is different from those in custody who are required to obtain authorization from the ''appellate court'' in order to file a successive § 2255 motion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=970640436455318595&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Baranski v. United States'', 880 F. 3d 951, 956 (8th Cir. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal appellate courts have yet to issue an opinion on this question.
*'''A petition for a writ of coram nobis must provide adverse consequences which exist from the conviction.''' A “circuit-split” exists on this requirement. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts administer a "civil disabilities test" which requires a coram nobis petitioner to prove that his conviction produced ongoing collateral consequences; however, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit|Fourth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|Eleventh]] Circuits have held that the petitioner need not show that he is suffering from an ongoing "civil disability" because "collateral consequences flow from any criminal conviction".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9698546469454281177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. George'', 676 F. 3d 249, 254 (1st Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]] circuit has granted coram nobis relief without mentioning this requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7014365937918134888&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Blanton v. United States'', 94 F. 3d 227, 233 (6th Cir. 1996)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy to correct errors of the most fundamental character.''' The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete [[miscarriage of justice]]. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6561912920734236978&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Bereano v. United States'', 706 F. 3d 568, 576-577 (4th Cir. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the same errors that are deemed grounds for Section 2255 habeas relief also justify coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;Wolitz, D. (2009).

Rev., 1277 p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For those claiming actual innocence, a fundamental miscarriage of justice occurs where a constitutional violation has resulted in the conviction of one who is [[Actual innocence|actually innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16402025009521187784&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Murray v.

====Procedural rules in federal district courts====
*'''District court clerks should file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original case number''' In ''Morgan'', the Supreme Court provided that the writ of coram nobis is a step in the criminal case and not the beginning of a separate civil proceeding. As a result, district courts, such as those in the Ninth Circuit, file petitions for writs of coram nobis under the original criminal case number.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12030576678750000031&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Telink, Inc. v. United States'', 24 F.3d 42, 46 (9th Cir. 1994)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''District courts should construe incorrectly titled petitions with the appropriate title.''' Whenever a [[United States district court|federal district court]] receives an incorrectly labeled or incorrectly titled petition, the court should construe the petition correctly.  District courts should construe a coram nobis petition from a federal prisoner as a petition for writ of habeas corpus. Similarly, district courts should construe a habeas corpus petition from a former federal prisoner as a petition for writ of coram nobis. Federal courts have determined that a person on probation is still a federal prisoner; therefore, petitioners in this category must file a petition for writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8072550880880865091&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Scruggs'', 691 F.3d 660, 662 n.1 (5th Cir. 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; A federal prisoner convicted of more than one federal crime may file a petition for writ of coram nobis to challenge any conviction where the sentence is complete; but the prisoner must file a writ of habeas corpus to challenge any conviction where the sentence is not complete.

====Procedural rules in federal appellate courts====
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders are subject to a 60-day filing period''' Until 2002, two provisions in ''Morgan'' divided the [[United States courts of appeals|federal appellate courts]] interpretation on the time limits to file an appeal from a [[United States district court|district court's]] decision on a coram nobis petition. First, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is a step in the criminal case". Second, ''Morgan'' held that "the writ of ''coram nobis'' is of the same general character as the writ of ''habeas corpus''". This created a conflict in the courts of appeals regarding the time limits that applied to appeals from coram nobis orders. In 2002, Congress added language to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure that clarified an application for a writ of error coram nobis is subject to a 60-day filing period.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12743813748652182589&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Trenkler'', 536 F. 3d 85, 95 (1st Cir. 2008)]. Prior to the 2002 enactment of Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(C), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts have held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal. However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts relied upon the statement in ''Morgan'' that a writ of coram nobis is a "step in a criminal case" and reasoned that it should therefore be governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals. Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal. [https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Johnson'', 237 F. 3d 751, 754 (6th Cir. 2001)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Appeals from coram nobis orders do not require a certificate of appealability ''' In 1996, Congress enacted the [[Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996]] ("AEDPA") which included language that limits the power of federal judges to grant motions for habeas relief, including motions for relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. AEDPA requires a [[Certificate of Appealability]] in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a habeas corpus petition. Unlike the writ of habeas corpus, a Certificate of Appealability is not required in order to appeal a district court's ruling on a coram nobis petition. Neither the [[All Writs Act|28 U.S.C. § 1651(a)]] statute making the writ of coram nobis available in federal courts in criminal matters nor any [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure]] requires a certificate of appealability before an appeal may be taken, nor does such a requirement appear in the case law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=404840111229367794&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Baptiste'', 223 F.3d 188, 189 n. 1 (3d Cir.2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; Some prisoners have attempted to file coram nobis petitions if AEDPA prevents the petitioner from filing under § 2255. However, federal courts have consistently held that prisoners may not resort to the writ of coram nobis in order to bypass AEDPA's gatekeeping requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6470098108909325880&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Barreto-Barreto v. United States'', 551 F. 3d 95, 103 (1st Cir. 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The [[standard of review]] from a district court's denial of a coram nobis petition is similar to the standard of review from a district court's denial of a habeas corpus petition.''' Generally, the standard of review is that any district court's determinations on questions of law are reviewed [[Standard of review#De novo|de novo]], but that district court's determinations on questions of fact are reviewed for clear error (or clearly erroneous error).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15607438945352724251&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Orocio'', 645 F. 3d 630, 635 (3rd Cir. 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Under de novo review of federal coram nobis cases, the appellate court acts as if it were considering the question of law for the first time, affording no deference to the decision of the district court. Under Clear Error review of federal coram nobis cases, the appellate court must have a "definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed" by the district court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1246627282965570135 ''Concrete Pipe &amp; Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal.'', 508 U.S. 602, 622 (1993)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. state courts==

Only sixteen state courts and District of Columbia courts recognize the availability of writs of coram nobis or coram vobis. Each state is free to operate its own coram nobis procedures independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system. The writ of coram nobis is not available in a majority of states because those states have enacted uniform [[Post conviction|post-conviction]] acts that provide a streamlined, single remedy for obtaining relief from a judgment of conviction, and that remedy is available to petitioners who are no longer in custody.  States that have replaced writs of coram nobis with remedies within their post-conviction proceedings are also independent of other state courts as well as the federal court system.  These proceedings enacted by state legislatures may either be more or less stringent than the writs it replaced or the post-conviction proceedings of other states.

===Alabama===
Alabama state courts strictly follow the common law definition of the writ of ''coram nobis'' where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]].  The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The writ has only been applied to juveniles.  The [[Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines for ''coram nobis'' petitions for state courts in Alabama (citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11531273481429194505&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''W.B.S. v. State'', (2017) ___ Ala. ___ No. CR-15-0956 (decided April 28, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Rule 32, Ala. R. Crim. P. is applicable only to a "Defendant convicted of a criminal offense". Under Alabama law, a juvenile is not convicted of a criminal offense so as to be able to take advantage of the provisions of Rule 32. The writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy known more for its denial than its approval. Even so, Alabama Courts allow the writ of error coram nobis to attack judgments in certain restricted instances.
When no rule or statute controls, "[t]he common law of England, so far as it is not inconsistent with the Constitution, laws and institutions of this state, shall, together with such institutions and laws, be the rule of decisions, and shall continue in force, except as from time to time it may be altered or repealed by the Legislature." § 1-3-1, Ala. Code 1975.
The writ of error coram nobis was one of the oldest remedies of the common law. It lay to correct a judgment rendered by the court upon errors of fact not appearing on the record and so important that if the court had known of them at the trial it would not have rendered the judgment. The ordinary writ of error lay to an appellate court to review an error of law apparent on the record. The writ of error coram nobis lay to the court, and preferably to the judge that rendered the contested judgment. Its purpose was to allow the correction of an error not appearing in the record and of a judgment which presumably would not have been entered had the error been known to the court at the trial. Further, a judgment for the plaintiff in error on an ordinary writ of error may reverse and render the judgment complained of, while a judgment for the petitioner on a writ of error coram nobis necessarily recalls and vacates the judgment complained of and restores the case to the docket for new trial.
An evidentiary hearing must be held on a coram nobis petition which is meritorious on its face. An evidentiary hearing on a coram nobis petition are required upon meritorious allegations:
*that counsel was denied.
*that the State used perjured testimony.
*that petitioner was not advised of right to appeal or right to transcript.
*of an ineffective assistance of counsel, specifically, failing to present alibi witnesses and failing to subpoena witnesses.
*of the denial of effective assistance of counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8703479901951317264&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Ex parte Boatwright'', 471 So. 2d 1257 (Ala. 1985)]&lt;/ref&gt;
A writ of error coram nobis is also the proper procedural mechanism by which a juvenile who has been adjudicated delinquent may collaterally challenge that adjudication.}}

===Arkansas===
Arkansas state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis for only four types of claims: [[Insanity defense|insanity]] at the time of trial, a coerced guilty plea, material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or a third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal. The [[Arkansas Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Arkansas]] provides the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Arkansas (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson v. State'', 531 S.W.3d 393 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=An Arkansas trial court can entertain a petition for writ of error coram nobis after a judgment has been affirmed on appeal only after the Arkansas Supreme Court grants permission to recall the case's [[Mandate (criminal law)|mandate]]. A writ of error coram nobis is an extraordinarily rare remedy. Coram nobis proceedings are administered with a strong presumption that the judgment of conviction is valid.  The function of the writ is to secure relief from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact that would have prevented its rendition if it had been known to the trial court and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not brought forward before rendition of the judgment. The petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error of fact extrinsic to the record. The court is not required to accept at face value the allegations of the petition.

Due diligence is required in making application for relief, and, in the absence of a valid excuse for delay, the petition will be denied. The mere naked allegation that a constitutional right has been invaded will not suffice. The application should make a full disclosure of specific facts relied upon and not merely state conclusions as to the nature of such facts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6174293652468987304&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Larimore'', 341 Ark. 397, 17 S.W.3d 87 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The essence of the writ of coram nobis is that it is addressed to the very court that renders the judgment where injustice is alleged to have been done, rather than to an appellate or other court. The writ is allowed only under compelling circumstances to achieve justice and to address errors of the most fundamental nature.  A writ of coram nobis is available to address certain errors of the most fundamental nature that are found in one of four categories:
# Insanity at the time of trial, 
# A coerced guilty plea, 
# Material evidence withheld by the prosecutor, or 
# A third-party confession to the crime during the time between conviction and appeal.

To warrant coram nobis relief, the petitioner has the burden of demonstrating a fundamental error extrinsic to the record that would have prevented rendition of the judgment had it been known and, through no fault of the petitioner, was not brought forward before rendition of judgment. Moreover, the fact that a petitioner merely alleges a ''Brady'' violation is not sufficient to provide a basis for coram nobis relief.  To establish a [[Brady disclosure|''Brady'']] violation, three elements are required: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it is impeaching; (2) that evidence must have been suppressed by the State, either willfully or inadvertently; (3) prejudice must have ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13777911819159056273&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Thompson'' at 396]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===California===
California state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Supreme Court of California]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in California (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Kim'', (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1078, 1091-96]&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a non-statutory, common law remedy whose origins trace back to an era in England in which appeals and new trial motions were unknown. Far from being of constitutional origin, the proceeding designated "coram nobis" was contrived by the courts at an early epoch in the growth of common law procedure to provide a corrective remedy because of the absence at that time of the right to move for a new trial and the right of appeal from the judgment. The grounds on which a litigant may obtain relief via a writ of coram nobis are narrower than on habeas corpus.  The writ's purpose is to secure relief, where no other remedy exists, from a judgment rendered while there existed some fact which would have prevented its rendition if the trial court had known it and which, through no negligence or fault of the defendant, was not then known to the court.

The principal office of the writ of coram nobis was to enable the same court which had rendered the judgment to reconsider it in a case in which the record still remained before that court. The most comprehensive statement of the office and function of this writ which has come to our notice is the following: The office of the writ of coram nobis is to bring the attention of the court to, and obtain relief from, errors of fact, such as the death of either party pending the suit and before judgment therein; or infancy, where the party was not properly represented by guardian, or coverture, where the common-law disability still exists, or insanity, it seems, at the time of the trial; or a valid defense existing in the facts of the case, but which, without negligence on the part of the defendant, was not made, either through duress or fraud or excusable mistake; these facts not appearing on the face of the record, and being such as, if known in season, would have prevented the rendition and entry of the judgment questioned.

The writ of coram nobis does not lie to correct any error in the judgment of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. If this could be, there would be no end of litigation. The writ of coram nobis is not intended to authorize any court to review and revise its opinions; but only to enable it to recall some adjudication made while some fact existed which, if before the court, would have prevented the rendition of the judgment; and which without fault or negligence of the party, was not presented to the court. It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.

With the advent of statutory new trial motions, the availability of direct appeal, and the expansion of the scope of the writ of habeas corpus, writs of coram nobis had, by the 1930's, become a remedy practically obsolete except in the most rare of instances and applicable to only a very limited class of cases. The statutory motion for new trial has, for most purposes, superseded the common law remedy; and, until recent years, coram nobis was virtually obsolete in California.

The seminal case setting forth the modern requirements for obtaining a writ of coram nobis is ''People v. Shipman''&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9828531622292540314&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v. Shipman'' (1965) 62 Cal.2d 226]&lt;/ref&gt; which stated the writ of coram nobis may be granted only when three requirements are met:
# The petitioner must show that some fact exists which, without any fault or negligence on his part, was not presented to the court at the trial on the merits, and which if presented would have prevented the rendition of the judgment.
# The petitioner must show that the newly discovered evidence does not go to the merits of issues tried; issues of fact, once adjudicated, even though incorrectly, cannot be reopened except on motion for new trial.  This second requirement applies even though the evidence in question is not discovered until after the time for moving for a new trial has elapsed or the motion has been denied.
# The petitioner must show that the facts upon which he relies were not known to him and could not in the exercise of due diligence have been discovered by him at any time substantially earlier than the time of his motion for the writ.
Several aspects of the test set forth in ''Shipman'' illustrate the narrowness of the remedy. Because the writ of coram nobis applies where a fact unknown to the parties and the court existed at the time of judgment that, if known, would have prevented rendition of the judgment, the remedy does not lie to enable the court to correct errors of law.  Moreover, the allegedly new fact must have been unknown and must have been in existence at the time of the judgment.

For a newly discovered fact to qualify as the basis for the writ of coram nobis, courts look to the fact itself and not its legal effect. It has often been held that the motion or writ is not available where a defendant voluntarily and with knowledge of the facts pleaded guilty or admitted alleged prior convictions because of ignorance or mistake as to the legal effect of those facts.

Finally, the writ of coram nobis is unavailable when a litigant has some other remedy at law. A writ of coram nobis is not available where the defendant had a remedy by (a) appeal or (b) motion for a new trial and failed to avail himself of such remedies. The writ of coram nobis is not a catch-all by which those convicted may litigate and relitigate the propriety of their convictions ad infinitum. In the vast majority of cases a trial followed by a motion for a new trial and an appeal affords adequate protection to those accused of crime. The writ of coram nobis serves a limited and useful purpose. It will be used to correct errors of fact which could not be corrected in any other manner. But it is well-settled law in this and in other states that where other and adequate remedies exist the writ is not available.

The writ was issued by state courts in California in these types of situations:
*Where the defendant was insane at the time of trial and this fact was unknown to court and counsel.
*Where defendant was an infant and appeared by attorney without the appointment of a guardian or guardian ad litem.
*Where the defendant was a feme covert and her husband was not joined.
*Where the defendant was a slave and was tried and sentenced as a free man.
*Where the defendant was dead at the time judgment was rendered.
*Where default was entered against a defendant who had not been served with summons and who had no notice of the proceeding.
*Where counsel inadvertently entered an unauthorized appearance in behalf of a defendant who had not been served with process.
*Where a plea of guilty was procured by extrinsic fraud.
*Where a plea of guilty was extorted through fear of mob violence.
*Where defendants and their counsel were induced by false representations to remain away from the trial under circumstances amounting to extrinsic fraud.

By contrast, the writ of coram nobis was found unavailable by state courts in California in the following situations:
*Where trial counsel improperly induced the defendant to plead guilty to render him eligible for diversion and the trial court eventually denied diversion.
*Where the defendant pleaded guilty to having a prior felony conviction when he was eligible to have the prior reduced to a misdemeanor.
*Where the defendant discovered new facts that would have bolstered the defense already presented at trial. The court concluded that although the new facts would have been material and possibly beneficial to the defendant at trial, they would not have precluded entry of the judgment.
*Where the defendant mistakenly believed his plea to second degree murder meant he would serve no more than 15 years in prison.
*Where the defendant claimed neither his attorney nor the court had advised him before he pleaded that his convictions would render him eligible for civil commitment under the Sexually Violent Predators Act (SVPA).
*Where the defendant challenged the legality of his arrest, the identity of the informant, and the failure of the court to make findings on the prior convictions. Coram nobis denied on the ground that "all of these matters could have been raised on appeal".&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4523633501752438352&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v.

===Connecticut===
Connecticut state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[Connecticut Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Connecticut]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Connecticut (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Henderson'', 259 Conn. 1, 3, 787 A.2d 514 (2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A writ of coram nobis is an ancient common-law remedy which is authorized only by the trial judge.  The same judge who presided over the trial of the defendant is the only judge with the authority to entertain a writ of coram nobis unless the judge who presided over the case was not available, such as retirement or reassignment. If the original presiding judge is not available, then a judge of the same court must entertain the writ.

The writ must be filed within three years of conviction. This limitation is jurisdictional, so trial courts must dismiss petitions filed after the three-year limitations for lack of jurisdiction. This limitations period for coram nobis petitions has been the law in Connecticut since the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;''Jeffery v. Fitch'', 46 Conn. 601, 604 (1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

The facts must be unknown at the time of the trial without fault of the party seeking relief. The writ must present facts, not appearing in the record, which, if true, would show that such judgment was void or voidable.

A writ of coram nobis lies only in the unusual situation in which no adequate remedy is provided by law. Moreover, when habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not lie. Prisoners who are in custody may only attack their conviction or sentence through habeas corpus and they are not eligible to file writs of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10252557976990208200&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Henderson'' at 3]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===District of Columbia===
District of Columbia courts were established in 1970.  The court's authority is derived from the United States Congress rather than from the inherent sovereignty of the states. District of Columbia courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]].  The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for District of Columbia courts (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''United States v. Hamid'', 531 A.2d 628, 634 (D.C.1987)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis in the District of Columbia is similar to the US Federal Court's interpretation of the writ where the writ of coram nobis is an extraordinary remedy that can be used to correct a legal or factual error.

The primary function of the writ of coram nobis at common law was to correct errors of fact on the part of the trial court, not attributable to the negligence of the defendant, when the errors alleged were of the most fundamental character; that is, such as rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.  The writ of provides a petitioner the opportunity to correct errors of fact not apparent on the face of the record and unknown to the trial court. In reviewing a petition for such a writ, there is a presumption that the proceeding in question was without error, and the petitioner bears the burden of showing otherwise.

The writ of coram nobis is available under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651(a) (2006), and the petitioner must show:
# The trial court was unaware of the facts giving rise to the petition; 
# The omitted information is such that it would have prevented the sentence or judgment; 
# The petitioner is able to justify the failure to provide the information;
# The error is extrinsic to the record; and 
# The error is of the most fundamental character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17954759657369994288&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hamid'' at 634]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Maryland===
Maryland state courts may issue the writ of coram nobis to correct either [[Question of fact|errors of fact]] or [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[Maryland Court of Appeals]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Maryland (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok v. State'', 361 Md. 52, 760 A.2d 647 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=A convicted petitioner is entitled to relief through the common law writ of coram nobis if and only if:
# The petitioner challenges a conviction based on constitutional, jurisdictional, or fundamental grounds, whether factual or legal;
# The petitioner rebuts the presumption of regularity that attaches to the criminal case;
# The petitioner faces significant collateral consequences from the conviction;
# The issue as to the alleged error has not been waived or "finally litigated in a prior proceeding, [absent] intervening changes in the applicable law"; 
# The petitioner is not entitled to another statutory or common law remedy (for example, the petitioner cannot be incarcerated in a State prison or on parole or probation, as the petitioner likely could then petition for post-conviction relief).&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5814012533990339974&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Skok'' at 661-62 (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015, the Maryland Code (2014 Supp.), § 8-401 of the Criminal Procedure Article ("CP § 8-401") clarified that the failure to seek an appeal in a criminal case may not be construed as a waiver of the right to file a petition for writ of coram nobis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v. Smith'', 443 Md. 572, 576, 117 A.3d 1093, 1097 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A writ denied in a lower state court may be appealed. A writ of coram nobis remains a civil action in Maryland, independent of the underlying action from which it arose.  As a coram nobis case is an independent civil action, an appeal from a final judgment in such an action is authorized by the broad language of the general appeals statute, Code § 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.  An appeal under the general appeals statutes would lie from a final trial court judgment in a coram nobis proceeding.  Although the Post Conviction Procedure Act precludes appeals in coram nobis cases brought by an incarcerated person "challenging the validity of incarceration under sentence of imprisonment", neither the Post Conviction Procedure Act nor any other statute which has been called to our attention restricts the right of appeal for a convicted person who is not incarcerated and not on parole or probation, who is suddenly faced with a significant collateral consequence of his or her conviction, and who can legitimately challenge the conviction on constitutional or fundamental grounds. Such person should be able to file a motion for coram nobis relief regardless of whether the alleged infirmity in the conviction is considered an error of fact or an error of law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18438526815994401263&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Smith'' at 1097]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Nebraska===

The purpose of the writ of error coram nobis is to bring before the court rendering judgment matters of fact which, if known at the time the judgment was rendered, would have prevented its rendition. The writ reaches only matters of fact unknown to the applicant at the time of judgment, not discoverable through reasonable diligence, and which are of a nature that, if known by the court, would have prevented entry of judgment. The writ is not available to correct errors of law.

The burden of proof in a proceeding to obtain a writ of coram nobis is upon the applicant claiming the error, and the alleged error of fact must be such as would have prevented a conviction. It is not enough to show that it might have caused a different result.

===Nevada===
Nevada state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].

State'', 310 P.3d 594, 597 (Nev. 2013)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=Nevada Revised Statute 1.030, recognizes the applicability of the common law, and the all-writs language in Article 6, Section 6 of the Nevada Constitution. This statute provides that the common law of England, so far as it is not repugnant to or in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States, or the Constitution and laws of Nevada, shall be the rule of decision in all the courts of Nevada. The post-conviction remedy authorized by Nevada statute, NRS 34.724(2)(b), provides that the petitioner must be in actual custody or have suffered a criminal conviction and not completed the sentence imposed pursuant to the judgment of conviction. Therefore, this statute is not available for those who are no longer in custody. Therefore, the common-law writ of coram nobis is available for a person who is not in custody on the conviction being challenged.

The writ of coram nobis may be used to address errors of fact outside the record that affect the validity and regularity of the decision itself and would have precluded the judgment from being rendered. The writ is limited to errors involving facts that were not known to the court, were not withheld by the defendant, and would have prevented entry of the judgment. A factual error does not include claims of newly discovered evidence because these types of claims would not have precluded the judgment from being entered in the first place. A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel also involves legal error and is therefore not available.

Any error that was reasonably available to be raised while the petitioner was in custody is waived, and it is the petitioner's burden on the face of his petition to demonstrate that he could not have reasonably raised his claims during the time he was in custody.

In filing the petition in the trial court is a step in the criminal process; however, the writ of coram nobis should be treated as a civil writ for appeal purposes. The writ is a discretionary writ and so a lower court's ruling on a petition for the writ is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard in the appellate court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7404177734099015049&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Trujillo'' at 597]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New Hampshire===
New Hampshire courts may issue a writ of coram nobis to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. It is currently undetermined whether the writ may be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New Hampshire (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''State v. Santamaria'', 169 N.H. 722, 157 A.3d 409 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is an ancient writ that developed in sixteenth century England. The writ addresses errors discovered when the petitioner is no longer in custody and therefore cannot avail himself of the writ of habeas corpus. Granting such an extraordinary writ is reserved for the rarest of cases.

Because the writ of coram nobis existed within the body of English common law prior to adoption of our constitution, it continues to exist as a matter of New Hampshire common law so long as it is not "repugnant to the rights and liberties contained in [our] constitution". N.H. CONST. pt. II, art. 90. The common law writ of coram nobis is available in New Hampshire courts, because it was in force at the time of the New Hampshire constitution and there is no conflict between the writ of coram nobis and the constitution. The standard of appellate review of the denial of coram nobis is the same as the standard of review for a habeas corpus petition.

Coram nobis is available to correct a constitutional violation. A requirement to bringing a petition for a writ of coram nobis is that sound reasons exist for failing to seek appropriate earlier relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courts.state.nh.us/supreme/opinions/2017/2017017santamaria.pdf ''Santamaria'', at 411-412]&lt;/ref&gt;

New Hampshire courts rely upon habeas corpus procedures to guide its approach to coram nobis proceedings, given the similarities between these avenues for relief. Similarly to habeas petitions, a trial court may deny a petition for a writ of coram nobis without holding an evidentiary hearing if the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant is not entitled to coram nobis relief.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3522506785478977461&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

===New York===
New York state courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. The [[New York Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals of the State of New York]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in New York (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''People v Syville'', 15 N.Y.3d 391, 400 (2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In New York courts, the writ of coram nobis is available but its application is considerably different than the writ's application in other courts. In 1971, most of the common-law, coram nobis types of relief were abrogated when the New York Criminal Procedure Law § 440.10 (CPL 440.10) was enacted to embrace the deprivation of constitutional rights outside the record; however, the specific category of "ineffective assistance of appellate counsel" was not specified by the Legislature at the time of its enactment.

The U.S. Constitution provides that a criminal defendant must be provided a right to appeal an unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel.  Consistent with the demands of due process, a criminal defendant must be allowed to assert that a right to appeal was extinguished due solely to the unconstitutionally deficient performance of counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal.

CPL 460.30 contains a significant restriction as it imposes a one-year limit for the filing of a motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal.  Consistent with the due process mandate, CPL 460.30 should not categorically bar an appellate court from considering that a defendant's application to pursue an untimely appeal whenever:
# An attorney has failed to comply with a timely request for the filing of a notice of appeal and 
# The defendant alleges that the omission could not reasonably have been discovered within the one-year period, the time limit imposed in CPL 460.30.

Whenever these two criteria are met, the proper procedure is a coram nobis application to the Appellate Division. After CPL 440.10 was enacted, common-law coram nobis proceeding brought in the proper appellate court became the only available and appropriate procedure and forum to review a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=17787332307960618177&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Syville'' at 400]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Oregon===
In November 2018, the [[Oregon Court of Appeals]] determined that the writ of coram nobis is available in rare cases where newly discovered evidence provides clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence.  The Oregon Court of Appeals provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Oregon (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v. Nooth'', 294 Or. App. 711 (2018)] Note: this is a recent case and is subject to review by the Oregon Supreme Court.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|1= The process that now governs Oregon post-conviction relief claims, the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), was enacted in 1959. Before its enactment, Oregon had a complex and confusing array of post-conviction remedies, including writs of habeas corpus (as provided both in the Oregon Constitution and in statutes), writs of coram nobis, motions to correct the record, and motions to vacate the judgment. The PCHA was intended to provide a detailed, unitary procedure to persons seeking postconviction relief.

From the time that it was enacted, there were questions as to whether the PCHA addressed claims of factual mistake based on newly discovered evidence—and the extent to which the PCHA altered the remedies available under preexisting law to a convicted person seeking to establish innocence through evidence discovered after the person's criminal trial. Two lawyers who participated in drafting the bill that became the PCHA, Jack Collins and Carl Neil, authored a law review article shortly after the act was adopted. In it, they suggested that innocence claims predicated on newly discovered evidence of innocence were not covered by the act (unless the evidence had been withheld from the petitioner by the prosecutor in a manner that violated the Fourteenth Amendment.) Collins and Neil observed that one of the remedies abolished by the PCHA, coram nobis, "might have been available" in the case of newly discovered evidence establishing innocence. Coram nobis was a procedural tool to correct errors of fact in judicial proceedings, and it functioned as a delayed motion for a new trial. However, Collins and Neil noted that the PCHA forecloses this possibility by abolishing coram nobis in criminal cases. Collins and Neil suggested that the problem of newly discovered evidence should be the subject of additional legislation. More than a half century has passed, and the legislature has not enacted such additional legislation or amended the text of ORS 138.530. Thus, the statutory bases for relief under the PCHA remain essentially as they were in 1959—with no more clarity as to whether the PCHA provides a mechanism for advancing a claim of innocence based on newly discovered evidence.

To the extent the constitution may protect the right of a convicted person to collaterally challenge a conviction based on new evidence of actual innocence, that remedy likely would take the form of coram nobis, a remedy that, historically, demanded proof of an extraordinary circumstance of innocence based on newly discovered evidence. Thus, in Oregon state courts
*The writ of coram nobis, or "motion in the nature of coram nobis," is an elastic but extraordinary remedy to correct mistakes of fact that occurred at trial. 
*The writ of coram nobis or motion in the nature of coram nobis allows courts to avoid manifest injustice or fraud on the court.
*Coram nobis is available only if it appears from the petition that the facts tendered as a basis for a new trial would have prevented the judgment entered.
*The standard for any cognizable actual-innocence claim under Oregon law, whether based on underlying constitutional or common-law principles, would necessarily reflect the same hesitance toward reopening a criminal proceeding based on anything less than reliable and compelling evidence calling into question, as a factual matter, the convicted person's guilt.
*The principles governing claims of actual innocence in federal court, to the extent those principles foreshadow the parameters of a federal constitutional claim of actual innocence, likewise indicate that a federal claim would be governed by similar exacting standards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3987948060500791131&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Reeves v.

===South Dakota===
South Dakota state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].

{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis has traditionally been used to present facts extrinsic to the record in circumstances where no other remedy was available. An elementary restriction to the writ is that it will not permit a new examination of questions previously determined. Nor may it be employed as an alternative for direct appeal or habeas corpus.

In South Dakota, the jurisdiction of a court to grant relief under coram nobis is of limited scope. Any proceeding which is challenged by the writ is presumed to be correct and the burden rests on its petitioner to show otherwise. Relief will be granted only when circumstances compel such action to achieve justice. With one significant exception, coram nobis deals only with errors of fact. The exception is that the writ can reach certain constitutionally significant errors like jurisdictional defects.

The writ permits review of new evidence only if it was discovered after entry of the judgment and could not have been discovered and produced during the period when a statutory remedy was available. Any factual errors which have been, could have been, or should have been reviewed with another available remedy cannot be examined in coram nobis. On the other hand, facts incapable of being brought out earlier due to fraud or coercion may form the basis for coram nobis relief.

Those seeking coram nobis relief must carefully study the procedural history of the case, because past events control over which issues may or may not be raised and trial records have to be examined in order to ascertain whether a claim is barred.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18353172842810443075&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Gregory'' at 878]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Tennessee===
Tennessee courts may issue a writ of coram nobis only for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment had it been presented at the trial. The [[Tennessee Supreme Court|Supreme Court of Tennessee]] provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Tennessee (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7728047675978746326&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Nunley v. State'', ___ S.W.3d ___ (Tenn. 2018)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Tennessee, the writ of coram nobis was recognized at common law but was not available in criminal cases. In 1858, the Tennessee General Assembly codified the procedure for petitioning for a writ of error coram nobis. This early codification of the writ was very limited in scope and could not be used to challenge judgments in criminal cases. In 1955, Tennessee's General Assembly extended the writ of error coram nobis to apply specifically to criminal proceedings. However, the new statutory writ could not be used to collaterally challenge a conviction based on newly discovered evidence. Finally, in 1978, the legislature broadened the scope of the writ to permit it to be used to challenge a judgment in a criminal case based on newly discovered evidence. Though the writ of coram nobis in civil cases was superseded when Rule 60 of the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure became effective in 1971, the adoption of Rule 60 did not supersede the statute which extended the writ as an available remedy in criminal proceedings. Currently the Tennessee statute on the writ of coram nobis provides:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|Upon a showing by the defendant that the defendant was without fault in failing to present certain evidence at the proper time, a writ of coram nobis will lie for subsequently or newly discovered evidence relating to matters which were litigated at the trial if the judge determines that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment, had it been presented at the trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/codes/tennessee/2017/title-27/chapter-7/section-27-7-102/ TN Code § 27-7-102 (2017)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The decision whether to grant or deny a petition for writ of coram nobis lies within the discretionary authority of the trial court. The writ of coram nobis is not available for attacking a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13756889861943887747&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Frazier v. State'', 495 SW 3d 246 (Tenn. 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Before granting a writ of coram nobis, the trial court must be satisfied with the reliability of the newly discovered evidence and determine that the defendant is without fault in timely discovering such evidence. The trial court must then review the evidence presented at trial and at the coram nobis proceeding and determine whether a reasonable basis exists for concluding that had the new evidence been presented at trial, the result of the proceedings might have been different. Coram nobis claims are not easily resolved on the face of the petition and often require a hearing; however, an evidentiary hearing is not statutorily required in every case. Coram nobis petitions with inadequate allegations are susceptible to summary dismissal on the face of the petition, without discovery or an evidentiary hearing.

The writ of error coram nobis cannot be used to advance claims under ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9550433126269674519 ''Brady v. Maryland'', 373 U.S. 83 (1963)]&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''Brady'' claim is a claim that a defendant’s right to a fair trial was violated because the State withheld exculpatory evidence that it is constitutionally required to provide to defendants. ''Brady'' claims must instead be litigated through the Tennessee Post-Conviction Procedure Act.  Timeliness under the statute of limitations is also an essential element of a coram nobis claim.  Unless time is [[Tolling (law)|tolled]] by a court, a writ of error coram nobis must be filed within one year of the date of a defendant’s conviction.

Since a petition for writ of error coram nobis is untimely unless filed within one year of the time a judgment becomes final in the trial court, a timely petition for writ of error coram nobis will almost always be filed while the defendant’s [[Appellate procedure in the United States#Direct Appeal|direct appeal]] is pending.  Therefore, when a convicted defendant files a petition for writ of coram nobis in the trial court while the direct appeal is pending, he or she must simultaneously file a motion in the appellate court to stay the appeal as of right until conclusion of the coram nobis proceeding in the trial court. On the same day that a petition for writ of coram nobis is filed in the trial court, the petitioner should also file in the appellate court a motion requesting that the appellate proceedings be stayed pending the trial court's decision on the writ of coram nobis. A copy of the petition should be attached to the motion. Under most circumstances, the motion to stay should be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2020995530047118426&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

An appellate court will find an abuse of discretion only when the trial court applied incorrect legal standards, reached an illogical conclusion, based its decision on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence, or employed reasoning that causes an injustice to the complaining party.}}

Vermont state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]].

Sinclair'', 191 Vt. 489, 492, 49 A.3d 152, 154 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ was designed to fill this gap somewhat to correct errors of fact affecting the validity and regularity of the judgment. It was commonly used in civil cases, but seldom in criminal cases. Vermont decisions have long recognized the general availability of coram nobis. In 1830, the Vermont Supreme Court explained that a writ of coram nobis will lie for error in fact, but it does not lie for error in law. The function of the writ is to call to the attention of the trial court facts and circumstances outside the record which would have precluded the entry of judgment had such facts been known and established at the time of the conviction.

In 1971, the writ was explicitly abolished in civil cases following adoption of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. When the PCR statute was enacted, it provided a means for those "in custody under sentence" to vacate, set aside or correct an invalid sentence, but the statute does not mention the writ of coram nobis. Similarly, the criminal rules set out various forms of post-judgment relief do not address coram nobis explicitly. Because the Vermont PCR statute and the criminal rules are silent on the issue, the common law remedy of coram nobis is a viable means for challenging criminal convictions. It may be used when no other remedy is available, but may not be used to supplant relief through direct appeal, post-judgment motion or PCR petition.

The Vermont Supreme Court has provided that a petition for a writ of coram nobis must be brought in the court that rendered judgment; however, the court has not reached the question as to the scope of the writ of coram nobis in state courts.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10849612183104217504&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Sinclair'' at 154]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Virginia===
Virginia state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram vobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]].

Commonwealth'', 274 Va. 503, 508, 650 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=In Virginia, state courts use the term "coram vobis" instead of "coram nobis", although both writs are identical in nature. Virginia state courts are the last remaining courts known to incorporate the five-hundred year-old term, "writ of coram vobis".

The term "coram vobis" is Latin for "before you".  The full name is quae coram vobis resident ("Let the record remain before you"). It was called coram vobis (before you — the king's justices) in Common Pleas, where the king was not supposed to reside. It was called coram nobis (before us) in King's Bench because the king was supposed to preside in person in that court. The difference related only to the form appropriate to each court and the distinction disappeared in the United States when the need for the distinction ended.

In 1776, Virginia incorporated all of English common law by an ordinance of the Virginia convention. With the incorporation of English common law, Virginia recognized two ways in which a litigant could approach a trial court to challenge a final judgment. This could be done by 1) motion or 2) writ of coram nobis. The first Virginia case to recognize that a motion could be used to achieve the result of the writ of coram nobis was the 1795 decision in ''Gordon v. Frazier''.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon v. Frazier'', 2 Va. 130 (1795)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Gordon'', the use of a motion to have a trial court revisit a final judgment was the general practice at that time, even though the writ of coram nobis was available for the same purpose. It appears that the reason litigants used a motion to challenge a judgment, instead of the writ, was because filing a motion was less expensive than instituting a new proceeding by filing a petition for a writ. The court in Gordon summarized this matter as follows:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|This case tho' depending upon a practice not common in this country is by no means a difficult one. I have no doubt but that the error complained of might have been corrected by the same court upon motion, at a subsequent term; but I should not for that reason reverse the judgment, since the party having preferred a writ of error coram vobis had a right to proceed in that way, tho' a shorter, and much less expensive mode might have been pursued.&lt;ref&gt;''Gordon'' at 130&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1957, the writ was substantially limited by the General Assembly through Code § 8.01-677, which provides that {{nowrap|"[f]or}} any clerical error or error in fact for which a judgment may be reversed or corrected on writ of error coram vobis, the same may be reversed or corrected on motion, after reasonable notice, by the court."  In other words, the Code restricted a writ of error coram vobis only to clerical errors and certain errors in fact.

The principal function of the writ in Virginia is to afford to the court in which an action was tried an opportunity to correct its own record with reference to a vital fact not known when the judgment was rendered, and which could not have been presented by a motion for a new trial, appeal or other existing statutory proceeding.  In order to qualify for a writ of coram vobis:
* The petitioner must attack his conviction for an error of fact not apparent on the record.
* The discovery of factual errors must not be attributable to the applicant's negligence.
* The facts, if known by the court at the time of trial, would have prevented rendition of the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2076285305325782298&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Neighbors v.

{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is only granted as a remedy of last resort where an error is of the most fundamental character and there exists no other available remedy. The writ is narrowly limited to extraordinary cases presenting circumstances compelling its use to achieve justice.

In West Virginia, the common law writ of coram nobis was abolished in civil cases in 1960 pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure. No provision equivalent to the relief mechanism of Rule 60(b) exists in the West Virginia Rules of Criminal Procedure.

West Virginia courts are authorized to issue the writ in criminal proceeding using criteria similar to the criteria established by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]]. The criteria established a four-part test. A petitioner seeking this relief must show that:
# A more usual remedy is not available. In other words, a petition for a writ of coram nobis may only be filed after a sentence has been served and the petitioner is no longer in custody.  
# Valid reasons exist for not attacking the conviction earlier. Petitioners need to show reasonable diligence, where legitimate justifications exist for not raising challenges to their convictions sooner or through more usual channels.
# Adverse consequences exist from the conviction; however, West Virginia courts have not yet established what constitutes "adverse consequences"'
# The error is of the most fundamental character. The error to be corrected must be an error which resulted in a complete miscarriage of justice. In other words, the error is one that has rendered the proceeding itself irregular and invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14674575394383273578&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hutton'' at 639]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Wisconsin===
Wisconsin state courts strictly follow the common-law definition of the writ of coram nobis where the writ may only be issued to correct [[Question of fact|errors of fact]]. The writ may not be issued to correct [[Question of law|errors of law]]. The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin provided the following background and guidelines of coram nobis petitions for state courts in Wisconsin (Citations and quotes removed):&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen v. State'', 95 Wis. 2d 207, 212, 213-14, 290 N.W.2d 685, 687, 688 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1=The writ of coram nobis is a common law remedy which empowers the trial court to correct its own record. The writ of coram nobis was given statutory recognition by the enactment of the 1949 Revision of the Wisconsin Code of Criminal Procedure. That section 958.07 of this statute provided:
{{quote|style=font-size:inherit;quotes:none|The writ of coram nobis may be issued by the trial court at any time upon the verified petition of the defendant showing sufficient grounds therefor, which may be supported by one or more affidavits. The petition and writ shall be served on the district attorney, who may move to quash the writ or make return thereto, or both. The court may hear and determine the writ either upon the affidavits submitted by the parties or upon testimony or both, in its discretion. The party aggrieved may have the determination of the trial court reviewed by the supreme court upon appeal or writ of error.}}

The Advisory Committee's comment to section 958.07 expressly acknowledged the fact that sec. 958.07 merely gave "statutory recognition to the common-law writ of coram nobis". This statute prescribed the procedure to be followed in granting the writ of coram nobis but did not state the grounds for issuing the writ, leaving that aspect to be determined from the cases.

The courts have established that the writ of coram nobis is of very limited scope. It is a discretionary writ which is addressed to the trial court.  The purpose of the writ is to give the trial court an opportunity to correct its own record of an error of fact not appearing on the record and which error would not have been committed by the court if the matter had been brought to the attention of the trial court.

In order to constitute grounds for the issuance of a writ of coram nobis there must be shown the existence of an error of fact which was unknown at the time of trial and which is of such a nature that knowledge of its existence at the time of trial would have prevented the entry of judgment. The writ does not lie to correct errors of law and of fact appearing on the record since such errors are traditionally corrected by appeals and writs of error.  Where the writ of habeas corpus affords a proper and complete remedy the writ of coram nobis will not be granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2396685506548555162&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Jessen'' at 213-14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The petitioner must establish that no other remedy is available. In other words, the petitioner must no longer be in custody. The petitioner must also establish the factual error that the petitioner wishes to correct must be crucial to the ultimate judgment and the factual finding to which the alleged factual error is directed must not have been previously visited or passed on by the trial court.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13451560097554862497&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''State v.

==Notable cases==

===Gordon Hirabayashi, Minoru Yasui, and Fred Korematsu===
[[File: Korematsu Yasui Hirabayashi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|(L-R) [[Fred Korematsu]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Gordon Hirabayashi]]]][[Gordon Hirabayashi]], [[Minoru Yasui]], and [[Fred Korematsu]] are best known for their principled resistance to the [[internment of Japanese Americans]] during [[World War II]]. All three had their convictions overturned through writs of coram nobis, and they were each awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].

After the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|bombing of Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration concluded that [[Japanese Americans]] living in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] were a security threat and thus authorized the military to secure areas from which "any or all persons may be excluded". As a result, Japanese Americans were subject to curfew and other restrictions before being forced into internment camps. Hirabayashi, Yasui, and Korematsu, who were not acquainted with each other at the time, each defied the internment and were convicted for their resistance. Their convictions would be affirmed by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] between 1943 and 1944. Four decades after the Court's rulings, lawyers, including civil rights attorney, [[Peter Irons]], re-opened their wartime convictions on the basis of newly discovered evidence of governmental misconduct. The new evidence indicated the government intentionally withheld ''The Ringle Report'', a report drafted by the Office of Naval Intelligence, which would have undermined the administration's position of the military actions, as it finally concluded that most Japanese Americans in the West Coast were not a national security threat at the time of Pearl Harbor.

'''Gordon Hirabayashi''' was born in April 1918 in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. He was a senior student at the [[University of Washington]] at the time when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to internment camps. Although he first considered accepting internment, he ultimately defied it. In May 1942, Hirabayashi turned himself in to the FBI. After being convicted in October 1942 for the [[curfew]] violation, he was sentenced to 90 days in prison. He also served a one-year sentence at [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island Penitentiary]] for [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] violations when he refused to answer questions which singled out Japanese Americans on the basis of race alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://artsci.washington.edu/news/2000-03/45-years-later-apology-us-government ''45 Years Later, an Apology from the U.S. Government'']. Newsletter of the University of Washington College of Arts and Sciences, Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; He appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in ''Hirabayashi v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5939600273001810074&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hirabayashi v. United States'', 320 U.S. 81 (1943)]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] granted a writ of coram nobis which effectively overturned his criminal conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18257773315166643768&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Hirabayashi v.

Hirabayashi''], program for a symposium of the same name that took place at Kane Hall, University of Washington, February 22, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Minoru Yasui''' was born in 1916 in [[Hood River, Oregon]]. He attended law school at the [[University of Oregon]] and became the first Japanese American lawyer in Oregon in 1939. Upon the declaration of war, Yasui attempted to report for military duty, but his services were refused nine times. After hearing the news of internment, Yasui planned his legal challenge to the government's policies. In March 1942, he deliberately disobeyed the military implemented curfew in Portland, Oregon by walking around the downtown area and then presenting himself at a police station after 11:00 pm in order to test the curfew's constitutionality.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/minoru-yasui-1916-1986/#.WENeto-cG3A Biographies: Minoru Yasui]", ''The Oregon History Project''.&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted in November 1942. Yasui appealed to the Supreme Court where, in 1943, his conviction was upheld in ''Yasui v. United States''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18295645142744551903&amp;q=coram+nobis&amp;hl=en&amp;as ''Yasui v.

United States'', No. 83-151 (D. Or. Jan. 26, 1984)&lt;/ref&gt; Yasui died in 1986, and he posthumously received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hirono.senate.gov/press-releases/hirono-honda-praise-awarding-of-presidential-medal-of-freedom-to-civil-rights-leader-minoru-yasui ''Hirono, Honda Praise Awarding Of Presidential Medal Of Freedom To Civil Rights Leader Minoru Yasui'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Korematsu''' was born in 1919 in [[Oakland, California]]. He attempted to enlist with the [[United States Navy]] when called for military duty under the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940]], but he was rejected due to stomach ulcers. In March 1942, when Japanese Americans were ordered to report to assembly centers, he refused and went into hiding in the Oakland area. He was arrested in May 1942, and held at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]] military detention center until his conviction in September 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier, Eric Paul (Director). (2000).

===George Stinney===
[[File: George Stinney mugshot.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[George Stinney]]]]
In December 2014, a writ of ''coram nobis'' was granted by a federal court to posthumously vacate the conviction of [[George Stinney]], a 14-year-old black boy who was convicted of murder and executed in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Campbell|title=South Carolina Judge Vacates Conviction of George Stinney in 1944 Execution|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/us/judge-vacates-conviction-in-1944-execution.html|accessdate=18 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stinney was convicted in 1944 in a one-day trial of the first-degree murder of two white girls: 11-year-old Betty June Binnicker and 8-year-old Mary Emma Thames. After being arrested, Stinney was said to have confessed to the crime; however, there was no written record of his confession apart from notes provided by an investigating deputy, and no transcript of the brief trial. On June 16, 1944, Stinney was executed as a result of the conviction. On December 17, 2014, Stinney's conviction was posthumously [[Vacated judgment|vacated]] 70 years after his execution, because the federal court judge ruled that he had not been given a fair trial; he had no effective defense and therefore his [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights had been violated.&lt;ref name=wis&gt;{{cite web |last=Turnage |first=Jeremy |date=December 17, 2014 |url=http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |title=George Stinney, 14-year-old convicted of '44 murder, exonerated|publisher=[[WIS]] |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303223031/http://www.wistv.com/story/27651255/george-stinney-14-year-old-convicted-of-44-murder-exonerated |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
The common law writ of error ''contra nobis'' and its equitable equivalent, the supplemental bill of review,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |archivedate=2014-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; do not appear to have survived the reforms to English law made in the last quarter of the nineteenth century.

Writs of error as a separate proceeding were abolished by  section 148 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict., c.76), which instead provided that "the Proceeding to Error Shall be a Step in the Cause". Error was finally abolished 23 years later in 1875, when Schedule I, Order 58, rule 1 of the [[Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873]] was brought into force and the Court of Appeal was created.

===Fresh evidence===
The modern practice at English law where a litigant seeks to rely upon evidence not known at trial is to bring an appeal.

In civil proceedings, CPR 52.11(1)(b) contains a presumption that civil appeals shall be limited to a review of a decision of the lower court, and CPR 52.11(2)(b) contains a presumption that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence. The Court of Appeal will exercise its discretion to hear fresh evidence according to the over-riding objective in civil cases to deal with cases justly: however, three key criteria laid down by the Court of Appeal in ''Ladd v Marshall''&lt;ref&gt;''Ladd v Marshall'', [1954] 1 WLR 1489&lt;/ref&gt; continue to be of relevance:

*the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;
*the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;
*the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed; it must be apparently credible, though it need not be incontrovertible.&lt;ref&gt;''Terluk v Berezovsky'' [2011] EWCA Civ 1534&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, where it is "necessary to do so in order to avoid real injustice", in "exceptional" circumstances, and where "there is no alternative effective remedy", CPR 52.17(1) permits both the High Court and the Court of Appeal to re-open a final determination of an appeal.

In criminal proceedings, the Court of Appeal also has a discretion to admit fresh evidence on appeal.  If it does so, the Court must ask itself whether, in light of the fresh evidence, the conviction is unsafe.&lt;ref&gt;See, generally, s.2(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1968; ''R. v. Pendleton'' [2002] 1 WLR 72&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special case of fraud===
Soon after the passage of the [[Judicature Acts]], it was thought that, when a judgment had been obtained by wilful fraud of the victorious party, the aggrieved party's proper recourse was to bring a new action for fraud, because to try the alleged fraud required original jurisdiction, which the Court of Appeal did not have.&lt;ref&gt;''Flower v. Lloyd'' (1877) 6 Ch D 297, ''per'' Jessell MR at 300, and approved by the House of Lords in ''Jonesco v Beard'' [1930] AC 298&lt;/ref&gt;

In so ruling, Jessell MR made specific references to the supplemental bill of review, the equitable equivalent of the writ of error ''contra nobis.'' However, the Court drew an analogy with the old law, rather than preserving it: in agreeing with Jessell MR, James LJ observed, "if it is true that there was a fraud practised upon the Court, by which the Court was induced to make a wrong decree, the way to obtain relief will be to bring a ''fresh action'' to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud" [emphasis added].

Since the coming into force of the Civil Procedure Rules, the law has evolved further.  In ''Noble v Owens'',&lt;ref&gt;''Noble v Owens'' [2010] 1 WLR 2491&lt;/ref&gt; the Court of Appeal held that the modern position is that it is now not necessary to commence a fresh action to cure a judgment fraudulently obtained. Instead, the powers of the Court of Appeal under CPR 52.10 are sufficiently broad to permit the Court of Appeal to refer the determination of the issue of fraud to a Judge of the High Court as part of the appeal proceedings, with a consequent saving of costs.&lt;ref&gt;''per'' Smith LJ, para. [29]&lt;/ref&gt;

In criminal cases, the Court of Appeal has allowed appeals and quashed convictions on the basis of misconduct by Crown witnesses analogous to fraud, e.g., where prosecution witnesses had subsequently been convicted for giving perjured evidence during the original trial;&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Cummins and Perks'' (1987) 84 Cr App R 71&lt;/ref&gt; or where police officers who took confessions from the appellants had subsequently been discredited in later proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''R. v. Williams and Smith'' [1995] 1 Cr App R 74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent attempts to resurrect the procedure===
In ''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2008/9.html |website=[[Bailii]] |title=''Cinpres Gas Injection Ltd v Melea Ltd'' [2008] EWCA Civ 9 |at=Paras. 78{{ndash}}104 |accessdate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an unsuccessful attempt was made to resurrect the supplemental bill of review. Jacob LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal, held that an attempt to invoke the old bill of review could not succeed because, for generations, applications for rehearing on the basis of fresh evidence had been made to the Court of Appeal and, if the bill of review procedure had survived the Judicature Acts, it had long since lapsed. The judge observed that "it would make for better justice in principle for a prior decision to be impugnable on the grounds for which a bill of review once lay, namely that there was fresh evidence not discoverable by reasonable diligence, which 'entirely changes the aspect of the case{{'"}} (para. [100]). However, he also observed that the Court of Appeal had not been asked to consider its powers under CPR 52.17 to re-open a final appeal in "exceptional circumstances" and therefore could not say whether such an application would have succeeded.

Moreover, in a Northern Ireland case, ''Walsh's Application'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm ''Walsh's Application'' &amp;#91;2012&amp;#93; NIQB 82] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208045043/https://www.courtsni.gov.uk/en-GB/Judicial%20Decisions/PublishedByYear/Documents/2012/%5B2012%5D%20NIQB%2082/j_j_WEA8630Final.htm |date=December 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which an application was made for a writ of error ''coram nobis'' following an unsuccessful judicial review, Weatherup J followed the Court of Appeal in ''Cinpres'' by observing, "While the Writ developed at Common Law, I doubt if the procedure survived the appeals process introduced by the Judicature (Ireland) Act 1875", before referring to the provision of that Act dealing with the abolition of proceedings in error. The court concluded that it did not have the jurisdiction to alter the decision made on judicial review.

The above cases indicate that the Judicature Acts and the Civil Procedure Rules provide for a comprehensive system of appeals which effectively ousts the function served by the former bill of review and writ of error ''coram nobis'', which may now be extinct in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.

{{italic title}}
'''''A Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures''''', generally known as '''''Cruden's Concordance''''', is a [[Bible concordance|concordance]] of the [[King James Bible]] (KJV) that was singlehandedly created by [[Alexander Cruden]] (1699–1770). The ''Concordance'' was first published in 1737 and has not been [[out of print]] since then.
Two editions of the ''Concordance'' appeared during his lifetime, 1761 and 1769.
(Reference 1955 edition)
Cruden's concordance was first published in 1737, one of the first copies being personally presented to [[Caroline of Ansbach|Queen Caroline]] on November 3, 1737. Cruden began work on his concordance in 1735 whilst a bookseller in London. Cruden worked alone from 7am to 1am every day and completed the bulk of the work in less than a year. The proofreading and layout took a little longer. His brain was occupied with nothing else, so much so that he failed to notice the diminishing stock in his bookshop and the consequent lack of custom. "Was there ever, before or since the year 1737", writes his biographer [[Edith Olivier]], "another enthusiast for whom it was no drudgery, but a sustained passion of delight, to creep conscientiously word by word through every chapter of the Bible, and that not once only, but again and again?".&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, Edith. ''Alexander the Corrector: the eccentric life of Alexander Cruden''. Viking Press, 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a remarkable feat, the concordance was not entirely without error. [[The Times]] recorded that Cruden left out [[Children of Eber|Buz]] (brother of Huz) and Sneeze (put under Neeze).&lt;ref&gt;J.A.Gere and John Sparrow (ed.), ''Geoffrey Madan's Notebooks'', Oxford University Press, 1981, at page 16&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the name "Chloe" was missing until a revised edition was published in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;1 Corinthians 1:11&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Culcheth Laboratories''' was a British metallurgical and [[Nuclear physics|nuclear research]] institute that researched the structural design of [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[reactor pressure vessel]]s in [[Culcheth]], [[Cheshire]], then in south [[Lancashire]] and now in the borough of [[Warrington]].

==History==
The Reactor Materials Laboratory was established at Culcheth in 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iop.org/activity/groups/subject/nig/newsletter/file_68900.pdf Institute of Physics, Nuclear Industry Group September 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; The UKAEA's Safety and Reliability Directorate (SRD)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mXUAr-44IZIC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112 ''New Scientist'', 10 April 1980, page 112]&lt;/ref&gt; stayed at Culcheth until 1995.

==Function==
It carried out work on reactors for the British civil and military (submarine fleet) nuclear energy programmes, investigating [[metallurgy]]. In the first ten years, it carried out research on materials for [[Breeder reactor|fast breeder reactors]]; it was the first time that [[niobium]] had been part of a fast breeder reactor.&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', 11 May 1957, page 6&lt;/ref&gt; The site investigated [[fracture mechanics]], [[nuclear reactor physics]] and [[hydraulics]].

Work on irradiation of metals was also carried out with the [[School of Materials, University of Manchester]] and the [[Department of Materials Science and Metallurgy, University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;''Effects of Radiation on Structural Metals'', 1967, [[ASTM International]], page 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Culcheth is just over one mile north of junction 11 of the [[M62 motorway]] on the [[A574 road|A574]]. 

It was administrated by the Research and Development Branch of the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA).

The '''Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act''' ('''CISPA''' {{USBill|112|HR|3523}} (112th Congress), {{USBill|113|HR|624}} (113th Congress), {{USBill|114|HR|234}} (114th Congress)) was a proposed law in the United States which would allow for the sharing of Internet traffic information between the U.S. government and technology and manufacturing companies. The stated aim of the bill is to help the U.S. government investigate cyber threats and ensure the security of networks against cyberattacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=HR 3523 as reported to the House Rules Committee | url=http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228035632/http://www.rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_2/LegislativeText/CPRT-112-HPRT-RU00-HR3523.pdf | archivedate=February 28, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation was introduced on November 30, 2011, by Representative [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Michael Rogers]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[List of United States Representatives from Michigan|MI]]) and 111 co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=H.R. 3523 | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3523: | publisher=Library of Congress | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Current Status of CISPA | url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3523 | publisher=GovTrack | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was passed in the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012, but was not passed by the [[U.S. Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 192 | url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll192.xml | accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]]'s advisers have argued that the bill lacks confidentiality and civil liberties safeguards, and the White House said he would [[veto]] it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=Cyber-security bill Cispa passes US House | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-17864539 | newspaper=[[BBC News]] | date=April 26, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In February 2013, the House reintroduced the bill&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/security/cybercrime/cispa-cybersecurity-bill-reborn-6-key-fa/240148600 "CISPA Cybersecurity Bill, Reborn: 6 Key Facts"], Mathew J.

Retrieved April 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but stalled and was not voted upon by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=Senate Won't Vote On CISPA, Deals Blow To Controversial Cyber Bill | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/cispa-cyber-bill_n_3158221.html | newspaper=[[Huffington Post]] | date=April 25, 2013 | accessdate=April 26, 2013 | first=Gerry | last=Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 10, 2014 a similar bill, the [[Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act]] (CISA), was introduced in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Forbes-9July2014&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregorymcneal/2014/07/09/controversial-cybersecurity-bill-known-as-cisa-advances-out-of-senate-committee/ "Controversial Cybersecurity Bill Known As CISA Advances Out Of Senate Committee"], Gregory S. McNeal, ''Forbes'', July 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, the House reintroduced the bill again.&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced-2015&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-new-cispa-bill-is-literally-exactly-the-same-as-the-1679496808|title=The New CISPA Bill Is Literally Exactly the Same as the Last One|first=Kate|last=Knibbs|publisher=[[Gizmodo]]|date=January 14, 2015|accessdate=January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill has been referred to the Committee on Intelligence, and as of February 2, 2015 to the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations and Subcommittee on Constitution and Civil Justice to see if it will come to the House for a vote.
In December 2015 a version of CISPA was hidden in the total federal budget.

CISPA had garnered favor from corporations and lobbying groups such as [[Microsoft]], [[Facebook]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[IBM]], and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], which look on it as a simple and effective means of sharing important cyber threat information with the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA: Who’s for it, who’s against it and how it could affect you | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/cispa-whos-for-it-whos-against-it-and-how-it-could-affect-you/2012/04/27/gIQA5ur0lT_story.html | author=Hayley Tsukayama | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=April 27, 2012 | accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has however been criticized by advocates of [[Internet privacy]] and [[civil liberties]], such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]], [[Fight for the Future]], and [[Avaaz.org]], as well as various [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] groups including the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]], TechFreedom, [[FreedomWorks]], [[Americans for Limited Government]], [[Liberty Coalition]], and the [[American Conservative Union]]. Those groups argue CISPA contains too few limits on how and when the government may monitor a private individual’s Internet browsing information. Additionally, they fear that such new powers could be used to spy on the general public rather than to pursue malicious hackers.&lt;ref name="techdirt1"&gt;{{cite web | last=Masnick  | first=Mike  | url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120402/04425118325/forget-sopa-you-should-be-worried-about-this-cybersecurity-bill.shtml  | title=Forget SOPA, You Should Be Worried About This Cybersecurity Bill  | publisher=Techdirt  | date=April 2, 2012  | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://techland.time.com/2012/04/19/5-reasons-the-cispa-cybersecurity-bill-should-be-tossed/ 5 Reasons the CISPA Cybersecurity Bill Should Be Tossed] Time Techland, By Matt Peckham&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some critics saw wording included in CISPA as a second attempt to protect intellectual property after the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] was taken off the table by Congress after it met opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=CISPA legislation seen by many as SOPA 2.0 | author=Morgan Little | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/apr/09/news/la-pn-cispa-legislation-seen-by-many-as-sopa-20-20120409 | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 9, 2012 | accessdate=April 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intellectual property]] theft was initially listed in the bill as a possible cause for sharing Web traffic information with the government, though it was removed in subsequent drafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=House Cybersecurity Bill Backs Off On IP Theft Provisions | url=http://www.law360.com/articles/330398/house-cybersecurity-bill-backs-off-on-ip-theft-provisions | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
CISPA is an amendment to the [[National Security Act of 1947]], which does not currently contain provisions pertaining to cybercrime. It adds provisions to the Act describing cyber threat intelligence as "information in the possession of an element of the intelligence community directly pertaining to a vulnerability of, or threat to, a system or network of a government or private entity, including information pertaining to the protection of a system or network from either "efforts to degrade, disrupt, or destroy such system or network".&lt;ref&gt;[http://intelligence.house.gov/sites/intelligence.house.gov/files/documents/CyberBillDiscussion113011.pdf H.R. 3523 Discussion Draft] - U.S. House of Representatives - November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, CISPA requires the Director of National Intelligence to establish procedures to allow [[United States Intelligence Community|intelligence community]] elements to share cyber threat intelligence with private-sector entities and encourage the sharing of such intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CRS report on CISPA | url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03523:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; | publisher=Congressional Research Service | accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kominsky|first=Mitchell|date=February 2014|title=The Current Landscape of Cybersecurity Policy: Legislative Issues in the 113th Congress|url=http://harvardnsj.org/2014/02/the-current-landscape-of-cybersecurity-policy-legislative-issues-in-the-113th-congress/|journal=Harvard Law School National Security Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 16, 2012, press release, the [[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence|House of Representatives Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] announced the approval of several amendments to CISPA, including the addition of a new provision "to permit federal lawsuits against the government for any violation of restrictions placed on the government’s use of voluntarily shared information, including the important privacy and civil liberties protections contained in the bill," the inclusion of an anti-tasking provision to "explicitly prohibit the government from conditioning its sharing of cyber threat intelligence on the sharing of private sector information with the government", and the prevention of the government from using the information for "any other lawful purpose unless the government already has a significant cybersecurity or national security purpose in using the information". Relevant provisions were also clarified to "focus on the fact that the bill is designed to protect against unauthorized access to networks or systems, including unauthorized access aimed at stealing private or government information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Discussion Draft HR 3523 | url=http://intelligence.house.gov/press-release/bill-status-update-hr-3523 | publisher=[[United States House Select Committee on Intelligence]] | accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, already collected cyberthreat data can also be used to investigate "the imminent threat of bodily harm to an individual" or "the exploitation of a minor," bringing the bill into line with existing law codified by the [[Patriot Act]] and the PROTECT Our Children Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/s1738|title=PROTECT Our Children Act of 2008 (2008; 110th Congress S. 1738) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which these two conditions already allow for protected entities to share data voluntarily with the United States government, law enforcement agencies, and the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].

==Recent developments==
Bill sponsors [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]] and [[Dutch Ruppersberger]], the chairman and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, respectively, said on April 25, 2012, that the Obama administration's opposition is mostly based on the lack of critical infrastructure regulation, something outside of the jurisdiction of the Intelligence committee; they have also since introduced a package of amendments to the legislation that, "address nearly every single one of the criticisms leveled by the Administration, particularly those regarding privacy and civil liberties of Americans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Albanesius | first=Chloe | title=White House Threatens to Veto CISPA | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2403549,00.asp | publisher=PC Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the opposition the bill has experienced, the co-sponsors are planning to amend the bill to address many of the concerns of its opponents—including limiting its scope to a narrower definition of cyber-threats, and stating that the "theft of intellectual property" refers to the theft of [[research and development]]. In addition, there will now be penalties if private companies or the government uses data from CISPA for purposes "unrelated to cyberthreats".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/new-cispa-amendments-expected-but-the-fight-will-go-on/ New CISPA amendments expected - but the fight will go on] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaltrends.com/web/cispa-and-sopa-like-apples-and-oranges-say-chief-co-sponsors/ CISPA and SOPA like 'apples and oranges,' say chief co-sponsors] - Digitaltrends.com - April 10, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Sharan Bradford Franklin, of the [[Constitution Project]] states, "Although we appreciate the Intelligence Committee's efforts to improve the bill and willingness to engage in a dialogue with privacy advocates, the changes in its most current draft do not come close to addressing the civil liberties threats posed by the bill, and some of the proposals would actually make CISPA worse. Therefore, Congress should not pass CISPA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-lacks-protections-for-individual-rights | title=CISPA Lacks Protections for Individual Rights | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainey Reitman, of the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] states, "To date, the authors of the bill have been unresponsive to these criticisms, offering amendments that are largely cosmetic. Dismissing the grave concerns about how this bill could undermine the core privacy rights of everyday Internet users, Rep. Mike Rogers characterized the growing protests against CISPA as 'turbulence' and vowed to push for a floor vote without radical changes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-is-dangerously-vague | title=CISPA Is Dangerously Vague | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kendall Burman of the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] states, "The authors of CISPA have made some positive changes recently. Unfortunately, none of the changes gets to the heart of the privacy concerns that Internet users and advocacy groups have expressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-congress-pass-cispa/cispa-not-the-right-way-to-achieve-cybersecurity | title=CISPA Not the Right Way to Achieve Cybersecurity | publisher=USNews  | accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, the [[Office of Management and Budget]] of the Executive Office of the President of the United States released a statement strongly opposing the current bill and recommending to veto it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saphr3523r_20120425.pdf Statement of Administration Policy - H.R. 3523 - Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act] - Office of Management and Budget, April 25, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2012, the House of Representatives passed CISPA.

On February 13, 2013, United States Representative Mike Rogers reintroduced the CISPA bill in the 113th Congress as H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=CISPA-reintroduced/&gt;

On April 18, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 624.&lt;ref name=Final-Vote-Results/&gt; The Senate has reportedly refused to vote on the measure and is drafting competing legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith | first=Gerry | title=Senate Won't Vote On CISPA, Deals Blow To Controversial Cyber Bill | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/25/cispa-cyber-bill_n_3158221.html | accessdate=April 29, 2013 | newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 10, 2014 a similar bill, the [[Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act]] (CISA), was introduced in the Senate.&lt;ref name=Forbes-9July2014/&gt;

*The [[Constitution Project]] (TCP) "believes cybersecurity legislation currently pending before Congress possess major risks to civil liberties that must be addressed before any bill is enacted into law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs092/1101561619973/archive/1109744955764.html | title=ISSUE ALERT: Cybersecurity Bills Pending in U.S. House Threaten Privacy Rights and Civil Liberties | publisher=TCP  | accessdate=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) has also issued a statement opposing the bill stating, "The Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act would create a cybersecurity exception to all privacy laws and allow companies to share the private and personal data they hold on their American customers with the government for cybersecurity purposes." As the statement continues, "Beyond the potential for massive data collection authorization, the bill would provide no meaningful oversight of, or accountability for, the use of these new information-sharing authorities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-opposition-hr-3523-cyber-intelligence-sharing-and-protection-act-2011 | title=ACLU Opposition to H.R. 3523, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 | publisher=ACLU  | accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Sunlight Foundation]] states, "The new cybersecurity bill, CISPA, or HR 3523, is terrible on transparency. The bill proposes broad new information collection and sharing powers (which many other organizations are covering at length). Even as the bill proposes those powers, it proposes to limit public oversight of this work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/04/13/cispa-is-terrible-for-transparency/ | title=CISPA is Terrible for Transparency | publisher=Sunlight Foundation  | accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] lists 6 problems within the bill itself and how to fix those problems.&lt;ref name="https"/&gt;
*[[Reporters Without Borders]] states, "Reporters Without Borders is deeply concerned with the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act of 2011 (CISPA), the [[cyber security]] bill now before the US Congress. In the name of the war on cyber crime, it would allow the government and private companies to deploy draconian measures to monitor, even censor, the Web. It might even be used to close down sites that publish classified files or information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.rsf.org/etats-unis-draconian-cyber-security-bill-06-04-2012,42283.html | title=Draconian cyber security bill could lead to Internet surveillance and censorship | publisher=RWB  | accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[testPAC]] opposes CISPA stating "CISPA would effectively take the door off the hinge of every household in America, but lacks the tools necessary to distinguish whether there is a criminal hiding in the attic.

*[[Mozilla]], the makers of the [[Firefox]] Web-Browser, opposes CISPA stating, "While we wholeheartedly support a more secure Internet, CISPA has a broad and alarming reach that goes far beyond Internet security."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/225041-mozilla-breaks-ranks-with-silicon-valley-comes-out-against-cispa | title=Mozilla breaks ranks with Silicon Valley, comes out against CISPA | publisher=The Hill  | accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Association for Computing Machinery]] believes that "More effective information sharing in support of cybersecurity is a laudable goal, but CISPA is seriously flawed in its approach to PII. Better approaches to information sharing are certainly possible if privacy goals are also considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://usacm.acm.org/images/documents/USACMCISPAStatement.pdf | title=Letter in regards to CISPA | publisher=ACM  | accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[IGDA]], the [[International Game Developers Association]] is against this bill, urging Congress and the President to reject it saying, in part, "The version of CISPA which just emerged from the House Intelligence Committee does not address the privacy failings in the previous version, which the White House wisely rejected. The bill still retains its dangerously over-broad language, still lacks civilian control, still lacks judicial oversight, and still lacks clear limits on government monitoring of our Internet browsing information. The House should vote against it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.igda.org/node/1043370 | title=Letter in regards to CISPA  | accessdate=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design and technology''' ('''D&amp;T''') is a school subject offered at all levels of primary and secondary school in England. It is used so children develop a range of designing skills and technology skills for example, using media to design their project and a saw to cut items. It first appeared as a titled subject in the first [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum of England, Wales and Northern Ireland]] in 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/758394547|title=Debates in design and technology education|others=Owen-Jackson, Gwyneth, 1956-|isbn=9780415689045|location=London|oclc=758394547}}&lt;/ref&gt;. D&amp;T, or a similar form, has been taught in many countries around the world such as [[India]], United States, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, Malta, China, South Africa, France and Finland &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470685647|title=International handbook of research and development in technology education|date=2009|publisher=Sense Publishers|others=Jones, Alister., Vries, Marc J. de, 1958-, Buntting, Cathy M.|isbn=9789087908775|location=Rotterdam|oclc=470685647}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many international schools teach design and technology. As a school subject it involves students in designing in a practical context using a range or materials and media. It is also a university course in many countries, including Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, South Africa, Netherlands and New Zealand, both for the preparation of teachers and for general education in areas such as [[industrial design]]. Some of the UK universities which deliver courses include: [[University of Brighton|Brighton]], [[Sheffield Hallam University|Sheffield Hallam]], [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths' College]] and [[Greenwich University|Greenwich]].

== Design and Technology qualifications ==

=== GCSE ===
With the first National Curriculum new [[General Certificate of Secondary Education|GCSE qualifications]] were introduced for D&amp;T in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Unlike the National Curriculum the previous subject titles were retained (e.g. [[craft, design and technology]] (CDT) and [[home economics]]) and others added (e.g. electronics, food technology, textiles technology and systems and control). These GCSE specifications had two assessed components:

* 40% of the final mark for  coursework
* 60% for an examination of general subject knowledge (materials, processes, techniques and sustainability etc.).

GCSE D&amp;T titles available included:

*GCSE Design and Technology: Electronic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Food Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Graphic Products
*GCSE Design and Technology: Resistant Materials
*GCSE Design and Technology: [[Systems and Control]]
*GCSE Design and Technology: Textiles Technology
*GCSE Design and Technology: Product Design

=== GCSE D&amp;T (2017 onwards) ===
Since September 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-design-and-technology|title=GCSE design and technology|last=|first=|date=4 November 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new GCSE has been taught in England that incorporates all material areas (with the exception of food which is now a separate GCSE&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-food-preparation-and-nutrition|title=GCSE Food preparation and nutrition|last=|first=|date=20 February 2015|website=Gov.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Similar to the previous GCSE, the new [[GCSE Specifications|specifications]] have two assessed components - an exam and a non-examined assessment (NEA) but with a 50:50 split of the marks. 

=== A level ===
[[Advanced Level (UK)|A and AS level]] examinations prepare students for individualised learning and problem solving, which is essential in business and industry. Time management is a key factor to candidates' success within the coursework elements of the qualification. The examinations are as rigorous as any other subject. Indeed, due to the complexity and variety of tasks and organisation skills required this examination and course is very demanding. The subject covers activities from [[Control engineering|control]] technology to aesthetic product design. Students have to use all types of computer software including [[computer-aided design]] and [[Computer-aided manufacturing|manufacture]], [[spreadsheet]]s and computer presentations.  Outputs from such work are often sent to [[CNC]] machines for manufacture.

== International Baccalaureate ==
IB Design Technology (DT) is an elective subject offered in many [[International Baccalaureate]] schools globally. Design is also offered in the [[IB Middle Years Programme]] as a compulsory subject for grades 6–10, and at the [[IB Diploma Programme|Diploma Programme]] level (grades 11-12). IB Design Technology is very similar in content to ''Design Technology'', which is widely offered in the national curricula of [[Education in England|England]], [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], [[Education in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and many African nations. It is one of the [[IB Group 4 subjects|Group 4 sciences]].

The primary focus of MYP Design is to give students an understanding of the [[design cycle]], through a practical programme. The student will complete projects based on solving a real and authentic problem. Students document their progress as they follow the design cycle to come to a feasible solution. They create the solution and then evaluate it following thorough testing.

The Diploma Programme of Design Technology is a two-year introduction to designing, a range of fundamentals of technology, and global technological issues. It provides students with the knowledge to be able to design and make in school workshops, and also to develop an informed literacy about technology in general. Because it is an international curriculum it has a particular focus on global environmental issues. It covers core topics in human factors and ergonomics, resource management and sustainable production, modeling, raw materials to final production,  innovation and design, classic design. It covers advanced higher level topics in user centered design, sustainability, innovation and markets, and commercial production. The diploma is accepted for university entrance in many countries, and is a good preparation for careers in areas such as engineering, architecture, product design, interior design, design and education.

== Scotland ==

A '''direct acoustic cochlear implant''' - also '''DACI''' - is an [[Acoustics|acoustic]] [[Cochlear implant|implant]] which converts [[sound]] in [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] vibrations that stimulate directly the [[perilymph]] inside the [[cochlea]]. The hearing function of the external and middle [[ear]] is being taken over by a little [[actuator|motor]] of a [[cochlear implant]], directly stimulating the cochlea. With a DACI, people with no or almost no residual hearing but with a still functioning inner ear, can again perceive speech, sounds and music.
DACI is an official product category, as indicated by the nomenclature of [[GMDN]].&lt;ref name="GMDN"&gt;http://www.gmdnagency.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

A DACI tries to provide an answer for people with hearing problems for which no solution exists today. People with some problems at the level of the cochlea can be helped with a [[hearing aid]]. A hearing aid will absorb the incoming sound from a microphone, and offer enhanced through the natural way. For larger reinforcements, this may cause problems with [[feedback]] and [[distortion]]. A hearing aid also simply provides more loudness, no more resolution. Users will view this often as, "all sounds louder, but I understand nothing more than before."
Once a hearing aid offers no solution anymore, one can switch to a [[cochlear implant]]. A Cochlear implant captures the sound and sends it electrically, through the cochlea, to the auditory nerve. In this way, completely deaf patients can perceive sounds again.
However, As soon as there are problems not only at the level of the cochlea, but also in the middle ear (the so-called [[conductive]] losses), then there are more efficient ways to get sound to the partially functioning cochlea.
The most obvious solution is a [[bone anchored hearing aid|BAHA]], which brings the sound to the cochlea via bone conduction.
However, patients who have both problems with the cochlea, as with the middle ear (i.e. patients with mixed losses), none of the above solutions is ideal.
To this end, the direct acoustic cochlear implant was developed. A DACI brings the sound directly to the cochlea, and provides the most natural way of sound amplification.

== History ==
The first DACI was implanted in Hannover. In Belgium, the first DACI was implanted at the Catholic University Hospital of Leuven.&lt;ref name="Codacs in Leuven"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nieuws.kuleuven.be/node/10986|title=Oorchirurgen UZ Leuven plaatsen nieuw type hoorimplantaat bij ernstig slechthorende patiënten|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Netherlands, the Radboud clinic in Nijmegen was the first while in Poland it was first implanted at the Institute of Physiology and Pathology of Hearing in Warsaw.&lt;ref name="Codacs in Warsaw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.ifps.org.pl/en/2012/06/a-new-chance-for-the-impaired-people/|title=First in Poland CODACS implantation surgery|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Executive education''' (ExEd or Exec. Ed) refers to academic programs at graduate-level [[business school]]s worldwide for executives, business leaders and functional managers. These programs are generally non-credit and non-degree-granting, but sometimes lead to [[Academic certificate|certificate]]s and some offer [[Continuing education unit|continuing education units]] accepted by professional bodies and institutes. Estimates by ''[[Business Week]]'' magazine suggest that executive education in the United States is approximately an $800 million annual business&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914060629/http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/content/oct2001/bs20011015_3309.htm |archive-date=2011-09-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with approximately 80 percent provided by university-based business schools. Key players in university-based executive education span elite{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} universities, as well as many regional and mid-sized universities and business schools around the world.

Customized programs, which are tailored for and offered to executives of a single company, represent the fastest growing segment of the market.&lt;ref&gt;Leadership by Design, Albert A. Vicere, Robert M. Fulmer, (1998) {{ISBN|0875848311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customized programs help organizations increase management capability by combining the science of business and performance management into specialized programs that enable executives to develop new knowledge, skills and attitudes. Knowledge translates into the capability an organization applies to the products and services it brings to the marketplace. Research shows that a firm with a clearly articulated and understood business and capability strategy will have a higher market-to-book value than a firm that does not.&lt;ref&gt;Maritan C. and Schnatterly K. (2004) [http://www.csom.umn.edu/assets/42582.pdf Intangible Assets as Drivers of Value: Technology, Capabilities and Management Systems].&lt;/ref&gt;

Open enrollment programs also are available as part of university-based executive education offerings, which occur throughout the year on selected dates, and are available to participants from different companies and organizations.

Shorter executive education programs tend to focus on specific roles or industries, or on improving specific [[leadership skills]], such as persuasion, negotiation, [[teambuilding]] or communication.

Some executive education providers offer more comprehensive management training options, such as the modular "Advanced Management Program" (AMP) offered independently by several business schools.

University-based executive education programs, and customized programs in particular, include serious engagement among executives, senior business faculty and researchers who are on the leading edge of business thought and management theory development. It has been noted that “executive education is the toughest classroom there is”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acu.edu.au/staff/our_university/publications/acu_update/2012/issue_1/new_directorate_at_acu|title=New Directorate at ACU|first=|last=Unknown|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides other academic fields such as the hard sciences or engineering) because time-pressed and demanding executives challenge each other in the classroom as much or more as their professors. The programs are credited{{By whom|date=March 2012}} with offering unique networking and personal career development opportunities for participants, as well as opportunities for universities to build stronger [[alumni network]]s that also benefit younger, traditional MBA program graduates through networking, internships and job opportunities.

Not all observers of university-based executive education are positive. There is some debate about the nature of business school education as a form of professional development. Some believe that university-based executive education has caused some business schools to "lose track of their professional mission." This argument is made by [[Rakesh Khurana]] among others.&lt;ref name=r2&gt;Khurana, R. (2007) [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8463.html From higher aims to hired hands: The social transformation of American business schools and the unfulfilled promise of management as a profession]. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The genesis of executive education can be traced to [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and his 1911 treatise [[Principles of Scientific Management]]. This book described how the application of the scientific method to the management of workers could improve productivity. Taylor's ideas, also known as "Taylorism"&lt;ref name=t&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/AnS/Anthro/Anth101/taylorism_and_fordism.htm Taylorism and Fordism]. Vanderbilt.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; would become the standard for businesses worldwide.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt;

On the heels of Taylorism came The [[Alfred P. Sloan]] School of Management, which in 1914 began offering Course XV, Engineering Administration, at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. At that time, the concept of providing business training in the academic environment was gaining popularity, thus MIT created a program “specially designed to train men to be competent managers of businesses that have much to do with engineering problems.” Harvard also began offering short five-week selections of standard MBA material in the late 1920s.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

In 1930 Course XV at [http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php MIT] became an independent department and was named the Department of Business and Engineering Administration. In 1931 an innovative program for executive development was initiated with the backing of several industrialists. This one-year program — offering graduate study in the fundamentals of management and decision-making — was aimed at young managers who were nominated by their employers and was highly competitive. In 1938 the program received full funding by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and was formally named the MIT Sloan Fellowship Program for Executive Development at MIT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/history.php History of MIT Sloan – MIT Sloan Newsroom]. Mitsloan.mit.edu. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive Education in the United States developed critical mass after World War II. The Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 — commonly known as the [[GI Bill of Rights]] — allowed veterans to take advantage of education benefits.  Many studied business in college, a privilege previously only enjoyed by the wealthy.&lt;ref name=gibill&gt;[http://www.gibill.va.gov/gi_bill_info/history.htm GI Bill History – U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs]. Gibill.va.gov. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent executive education programs, including the 13-week Advanced Management Program at Harvard University and the four-week Institute for Management at Northwestern University’s School of Commerce (now the Kellogg School of Management), developed in response to the need to rapidly train line executives for general management in the post World War II era.

By the late 1970s nearly 20 business schools in the United States were offering some form of executive education. The science of business also was developing at a rapid pace as faculty, such as [[Michael Porter]] (Harvard ) and [[C. K. Prahalad]] (University of Michigan), published academic papers that changed the way people thought and acted within companies.

Prahalad&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/authors/prahalad C.K. Prahalad – Harvard Business Review]. Hbr.org. Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; is most notably remembered for developing the concepts of “core competencies” and “strategic intent”. These and other respected academic business thinkers — Don Hambrick, Ram Charan, David Ulrich, Michael Hammer, Gary Hamel and many others — are the true pioneers of executive education and the ongoing effort to facilitate wealth creation and other new concepts aimed at making stronger businesses while improving the welfare of the world.

Throughout the 1970s university-based executive education continued to evolve as an industry. Several on-campus residential facilities were constructed at several universities, demonstrating the value of a standalone facility dedicated to executive education programs. This spurred the development of such facilities at schools nationwide and the subsequent expansion of short open enrollment programs. The industry’s exclusive professional association, The International University Consortium for Executive Education,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uniconexed.org|title=Global Consortium for University-Based Executive Education - Unicon|website=UNICON}}&lt;/ref&gt; also came into existence during this period. UNICON began sponsoring a tradeshow in the 1970s for companies interested in learning about university-based executive education and an annual conference for members. UNICON has since grown into a consortium of nearly 100 universities with executive education programs around the globe. It sponsors three annual conferences that allow members to share best practices, conducts research into topics of concern and provides benchmarking data for members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniconexed.org Welcome to UNICON, the International University Consortium for Executive Education]. Uniconexed.org (2007-01-31). Retrieved on 2011-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Executive education further developed in the 1980s and 1990s as the increasing pace and scope of global business demanded higher levels of education among employees. The [[dot-com bubble|dot-com]] boom further changed the scope of the business landscape by favoring employees and organizations that were quick to adapt to change. As longstanding business concepts became obsolete, continual training was necessary – but earning a degree was not.

In a 1999 survey of 63 programs, the [[University of Michigan Business School]] topped the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/929014|title=University of Michigan Business School|website=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the next survey in 2001, the number of programs had doubled to 121, with a doubling of revenues to $800M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-10-14/a-mid-career-boost|title=A Mid-Career Boost|date=15 October 2001|publisher=|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the survey, Executive education growth was dramatically impacted by travel restrictions and economic impact of the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Current situation==

The participation of many of the most prestigious universities around the world has enhanced the value of university-based executive education. Ongoing business challenges and opportunities – a dynamic economy, developing technologies, new business models and [[globalization]] – has made the emphasis on learning new concepts throughout ones career a necessity.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Despite the growing popularity of university-based executive education around the world, the global economic recession has slowed the industry’s growth during the past few years. According to a 2011 study conducted by the [[Manchester Business School]] in partnership with [[Dubai International Academic City]] and [[Dubai Knowledge Village]], the global economic downturn has had a negative impact on learning and development spending within the Middle East. More than half the respondents noted that spending on executive education had been “significantly” affected, while other organizations agreed that spending had been “somewhat” affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20110228112046?q=TECOM%20Research Significant Number of GCC Companies Yet to Engage in Executive Education, Reveals Manchester Business School-TECOM Research], 28 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A return to higher participation appears to be coming as the economy shows more signs of improvement.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} A substantial portion of the organizations surveyed by Manchester Business School said they anticipate executive education spending to moderately increase during the next three years.

The situation is similar in other parts of the world according to a late 2010 state of the industry survey conducted by UNICON,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411000713/http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html |archive-date=2011-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that many prestigious universities with executive education programs around the world expect notably higher enrollment during 2011. Sixty-five percent of UNICON survey participants predicted increased participation in their open enrollment programs this year. Additionally, 78 percent of schools projected an increase in customized executive education programs during 2011. Nearly half of the schools surveyed indicated an increase in their number of programming days, now offering up to 39 weeks in open enrollment programs and an average of 49 weeks in custom programs. Slightly more than half also reported increasing the number of days that educational programs for executives are offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uniconexed.org/in-the-news/c-change-strategies-03-05-2011.html Executive Education in the News – March 4, 2011 – Executive Education Momentum Sign of Economic Recovery, Cindy Bielke, C-change Strategies].

''Film à clef'' is the film equivalent of the literary ''[[roman à clef]]'', and the two share the same techniques.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

Many ''films à clef'' are [[biopic]]s of Hollywood personalities.&lt;ref name="id.l_Film"/&gt;

'''The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants''' (or simply the '''''Glass Flowers''''') is a collection of highly realistic [[glass]] [[botany|botanical]] models at the [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].

Created by [[Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka]] from 1887 through 1936 at their studio in [[Hosterwitz]], near [[Dresden, Germany]], the collection was commissioned by [[George Lincoln Goodale]], the first director of Harvard's [[Botanical Museum]], and was financed by [[Mary Lee Ware]] and her mother [[Elizabeth Cabot (Lee) Ware|Elizabeth C. Ware]].&lt;ref&gt;Blaschka Plants Blend Science and Artistry (NYT) - https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/08/archives/new-jersey-pages-blaschka-plants-blend-science-and-artistry.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; It includes 847 life-size models (representing 780 species and varieties of plants in 164 families) and some 3,000 detail models such as of plant parts and anatomical sections. The collection comprises approximately 4,400 individual glass models representing over 830 plant species.

==Background==
{{main|Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka}}
[[File:Rudolf, Leopold and Caroline Blaschka in garden cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Rudolf (standing) and Leopold Blaschka]]
Starting in 1863 the Blaschkas had a thriving business making glass models of [[marine invertebrate]]s, selling them to museums and private collectors in a global enterprise (see {{crossreference|[[Glass sea creatures]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2016/10/exhibition-talk-film-explore-sea-glass&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1886, the Blaschkas were approached by Professor Goodale who, after seeing their work, had gone Dresden to ask them to make a series of glass botanical models for Harvard; the reason for the request being that only used method at time was showcasing pressed and carefully labeled specimens—a methodology that offered a twofold problem: being pressed, the specimens were two-dimensional and tended to lose their color, two drawbacks which glass models did not have.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"&gt;http://hmnh.harvard.edu/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/goodale-george.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold was hesitant but eventually agreed to make some sample models which, though badly damaged in customs,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmog.org/article/glass-flowers&lt;/ref&gt; convinced Goodale of their value in botanical teaching.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

To fund the project Goodale approached his former student Mary Lee Ware and her mother, Elizabeth [[Cabot family|C.]] Ware, who were already liberal benefactors of Harvard's botanical department.&lt;ref&gt;Flowers that never fade / Franklin Baldwin Wiley. Boston Bradlee Whidden, Publisher 1897&lt;/ref&gt; The original arrangement (in 1887) provided that the Blaschkas would work half time on the project, but in 1890 a new arrangement called for them to work full-time.&lt;ref name="Schultes, Richard Evans 1982"&gt;Schultes, Richard Evans., William A. Davis, and Hillel Burger. The Glass Flowers at Harvard. New York: Dutton, 1982. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Archives of Rudolph and Leopold Blaschka and the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants - http://botlib.huh.harvard.edu/libraries/glass.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The work continued until 1936, at which point Leopold and Elizabeth had both died.&lt;ref name="nasonline.org"/&gt;

The collection is formally dedicated to [[Charles Eliot Ware|Dr. Charles Eliot Ware]], the deceased father and husband of Mary and Elizabeth Ware, respectively.&lt;ref name="hmnh.harvard.edu"/&gt;

==The models==
[[File:Ware Dedication plaque.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1|"In memory of physician Charles Eliot Ware (1814{{ndash}}1887), a graduate of this university. These models were presented by his wife and daughter who survived him. He sincerely cherished and deeply loved native plants as friends."]]
The models are glass with wire supports (internal or external), glue, a variety of organic media,{{Explain|date=March 2017}} and paint or enamel coloring.&lt;ref&gt;NcNally, Rika Smith and Nancy Buschini (1993). [http://aic.stanford.edu/jaic/articles/jaic32-03-002_1.html Journal of the American Institute for Conservation], Volume 32, Number 3, Article 2 (pp. 231 to 240)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Boston Globe'' has called them "anatomically perfect and, given all the glass-workers who've tried and failed, unreproducible."&lt;ref&gt;Putting the Glass Flowers in new light - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/05/putting-the-glass-flowers-in-new-light/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harvard's glass flowers return - https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/theater-art/2016/05/24/harvard-glass-flowers-return/SwICUX1ZgpsP3CPPeMbpuO/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often said that the Blaschkas employed secret techniques now lost; in fact their techniques were common at the time, but their skill, enthusiasm, and meticulous study and observation of their subjects in life were extraordinary, which Leopold ascribed to familial tradition, in a letter to Mary Lee Ware: "Many people think that we have some secret apparatus by which we can squeeze glass suddenly into these forms{{nbsp}} ... &lt;!--, but it is not so. We have tact. My son Rudolf has more than I have, because he is my son, and tact increases in every generation.--&gt; The only way to become a glass modeler of skill, I have often said to people, is to get a good great-grandfather who loved glass."

The Blaschkas' primary technique was [[lampworking]], in which glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Dictionary|url=http://www.cmog.org/research/glass-dictionary/l|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their old-fashioned Bohemian lamp-working table is part of the museum exhibit.
Over the years Rudolf brought more and more of the entire production process under his personal control, eventually even manufacturing his own glass and colorants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Zone Books| isbn = 978-1-890951-43-6| last = Daston| first = Lorraine| title = Things that talk : object lessons from art and science| chapter = The Glass Flowers| location = New York| date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Donald Schnell has called the models "enchanting", and relates his surprise at finding that the models faithfully depict an unpublished detail of a bee's behavior while pollinating a particular plant{{emdash}}a detail which he had privately hypothesized.&lt;ref&gt;Schnell, Donald (2002). Carnivorous Plants of the United States and Canada. Timber Press. {{ISBN|0-88192-540-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Whitehouse and Small wrote that "the superiority in design and construction of the Blaschka models surpasses all modern model making to date and the skill and art of the Blaschkas rests in peace for eternity."{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The Glass Flowers is one of the most noted tourist attractions of the Boston area. More than 210,000 visitors view the collection annually. In 1936, when Harvard invited the public to tour the campus in honor of its tercentenary, a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter taking the tour commented "Tercentenary or no, the chief focus of interest remains the famous glass flowers, the first of which was put on exhibition in 1893, and which with additions at intervals since, have never failed to draw exclamations of wonder or disbelief from visitors."&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many visitors initially believe the Glass Flowers to be real, organic, plants and soon after entering or leaving exhibition inquire "where are the glass flowers?"&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey N.

At least two poems feature the flowers:

{{poemquote|He's built a perfection out of hunger,
fused layer upon layer, swirled until
what can't be tasted, won't yield,
almost satisfies, an art
mouthed to the shape of how soft things are,
how good, before they disappear.}}

[[Marianne Moore]] wrote in a poem, "Silence",

{{poemquote|My father used to say,
"Superior people never make long visits,
have to be shown Longfellow's grave,
or the glass flowers at Harvard."}}

The '''gonadosomatic index''', abbreviated as '''GSI''', is the calculation of the [[gonad]] mass as a proportion of the total [[body mass]].  It is represented by the formula:&lt;ref name=FD&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Richard O.|last2=Gutreuter|first2=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Nielsen|editor1-first=Larry A.|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=David Lawrence|title=Fisheries techniques|date=1983|publisher=American Fisheries Society|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=9780913235003|pages=283-300|chapter=Chapter 15. Length, weight and assoiated structural indices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heart of Europe International Debating Tournament (HOE DT)''' is an annual [[debating]] [[tournament]] for [[secondary education|high school]]-level teams which is held in English.

==History==

The Heart of Europe Debating Tournament is a WSDC ([[World Schools Debating Championships]]) based international debate tournament founded by John L. Wickham and the students of Olomouc - Hejcin High School. Originally a competition for high school students of European countries that had previously participated in the KPDP (Karl Popper Debate Program) established by OSI ([[Open Society Institute]]), after some time it became a truly global competition for high school debaters. The first Heart of Europe Debating Tournament was held in Olomouc, Czech Republic in 2001. The event attracted participants from Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. In 2002, the tournament didn't take place because the organizers were not able to obtain the necessary funding. Nonetheless, a year later, in 2003, the second year of the tournament was held. It has been hosted in Olomouc, Czech Republic every time since then, being organised by Debate Club Olomouc throughout the years 2004–2009. Heart of Europe has lately become an annual event and has been organised by the Association of Debate Clubs of Olomouc Region since 2010.

The year 2010 was a real step-up for the tournament, having had 17 countries participate, including such exotic ones as [[South Africa]] and [[China]] that engaged in the Grand Final of this year.

In year 2011 there was really significant step in improvement of quality of the tournament. Organising Committee established cooperation withPalacky University Olomouc. All the dabetes took place in magnificent building of Faculty of Science. The tournament also received new visual style in this year and a lot of work on promotion was done, such as new social networks, photo and video documentation. New participating countries were Moldova, Montenegro, Russia, Singapore and Sweden.

Year 2012 was the greatest cornerstone in the history of the tournament. It was held by a new organization, Czech Debate Society, o. s.. For the first time, the tournament was also available online to participants all around the world because of the project "Heart of Europe accessible to everyone". What more, one additional new project was connected with the promotion of the tournament, The Czech Debate TV, with purpose to monitor debate and educational events and present educational videos. The tournament enjoyed fruitful partnerships with projects Debating Europe and The Office of the Government of the Czech Republic - European Affairs Information Department. In that year we have yet again welcomed several new nations, namely Chile, Nigeria, Macedonia, as well as it was the 5th anniversary of Jakub Kadlec' involvement with the tournament.

2013 was the 10th anniversary of Heart of Europe and the tournament got its mascot Herr Heart. The biggest innovation of Heart of Europe 2013 was a test run of the British Parliamentary track before the high school competition, which proved to be a success and will be repeated in the future. As for the staff, the Chief Adjudicator panel was changed – extended to include judges from all over the planet in order to increase its diversity. There were also new participating countries (such as Croatia or Ukraine) and new partnerships made, mainly the one with Debate Club Pandora in Kiev, which later resulted in CDS helping with organization at their tournament called Under Chestnut Trees. Other new partners and sponsors included ARGO, ČEZ or Deleo. In terms of cultural program, Heart of Europe newly included a talent show, where everyone was invited to showcase any skill other than debating. Several debaters and judges performed singing, playing an instrument, dancing as well as some acting and stand up comedy. The next addition was a thematic tour of the city, which was special that year because of historical costumes and props used to demonstrate the legends of Olomouc. Additionally, registration to the tournament was tied to a blood donorship initiative.

Year 2014 was most notable by the outstanding quality of the teams, even by the already quite high standard of the tournament - perhaps a result of multiple delegations spending several years prior to 2014 honing their skills at our tournament every year. The teams were also extraordinarily balanced. In the first break round, the last team to make the break from the 16th place defeated the first team, two members of which were still the best two speakers of the whole tournament. The team with the best two speakers was from South Africa, just like the team that ultimately won the whole tournament, only from an entirely different institution, thus also continuing the regular cycle of different continent winning each year. This was also the first year after the definitive retirement of the founder of the tournament, John L. Wickham, from the position of Chief Judge, making it a bit of an experiment in new organizational procedures. The new paradigm for the future of the tournament was decided to be a rotating position of a chief judge, open to new ascending debate stars, as well as experienced debate masters. New participating countries were Bermuda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bermuda took on all comers at the Heart of Europe youth debates|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20140726/NEWS/140729780&amp;source=RSS|website=www.royalgazette.com|accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; China and Denmark. Czech Debate Society, o. s. has changed name to Czech Debate Society, z. s. in accordance with new civil code.

Heart of Europe 2016 had again grown in size in 2016 to 40 teams, including some new additions to participating states like Argentina, Bosnia and Herzegovina, India, Peru, Qatar, and Spain. One of the ongoing trends that became especially apparent this time was the increase in the skill and experience level of the participating debaters. In part, this was happening because larger portion of the debaters were returning ones who have previously participated at Heart of Europe. At the same time, more high level international debaters were attracted to the tournament by its rising significance in the world debating circuit over the last couple of years. The motions debated in qualification rounds covered a range of topics from education, through women’s rights, to global economics. The grand final debate dealt with the issue of residual European colonialism, and it happened between the teams from Canada and Denmark, with the Canadians taking the prize.


Heart of Europe International DT has become very popular during past years. There have been participants from countries such as Argentina, Belarus, Bermuda, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, England, Estonia, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, Palestine, Peru, Qatar, Romania, Russia, Scotland, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine and United States of America.

All debates in the tournament are in English. This is for practical reasons, but it means that many countries debate in what is for them a foreign language. This has not stopped a number of these teams being very successful. Special awards have been introduced for the highest-ranked teams made-up of English-as-a-second-language (ESL) and English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) speakers.

==Symbols==

From December 2012, Heart of Europe Debating Tournament has an official mascot – Herr Heart! Then Chief Adjudicator of the tournament, John Wickham, commented on it:

“''Introducing this mascot and promoting blood giving all around the world is another significant milestone for the Czech Debate Society and the tournament itself. It is in line with the tournament’s mission to develop cooperation among the youth and to foster cultural and social understanding and exchange. Herr Heart represents the sharpness, love for freedom and effort to help and to improve the neighbourhood, which is essential for debaters, as well as the hospitality and openness of organisers and the tournament itself.''”

John Wickham also explained the concept behind the logo for the HOEDT, saying that the heart in the middle of the Europe silhouette represents the central position of the place, from where the HOEDT helps spread freedom of speech, the centre of Europe which really is a crossroad of cultures. The logo also indicates the communication that will bring the students from various cultures closer to each other.

The colors chosen for the logo represent national colors of the country, as well as vitality and democracy. Herr Heart also brings a new motto, not just for our blood donor initiative, but for the tournament as a whole – Debate Is Life. Just like the blood is necessary to oxygenate the body, debating nurtures the mind, while it is literally saving lives even further through promoting peace and helping people of all ages and cultures live to the fullest. We at the HOEDT certainly live for the debate and that is why the debate lives here too.

==Format==

Heart of Europe Debating Tournament debates use a special format known as '[[World Schools Style Debating]]'. This is a combination of the [[debate#Parliamentary debate|British Parliamentary]] and [[Australia-Asia debate|Australia-Asian]] [[debate|debating]], designed to meet the needs of the tournament. Each debate comprises eight- minute speeches delivered by two three-member teams (the Proposition and the Opposition). Each speaker delivers an eight-minute speech; then both teams deliver a "reply speech" lasting four minutes, with the last word being reserved for the Proposition. Between the end of the first and the beginning of the last minute of an eight-minute speech, the opposing party may offer "points of information". The speaker may refuse these, but should take at least one or two points during his or her speech.

Originally the plan was to use KPDP style of debate at Heart of Europe Debating Tournament. However, '[[World Schools Style Debating]]' was used in many more countries for their national competitions, including Australia, Argentina, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Slovenia, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka and Wales, so the Organizing Committee has decided to use it.

The HOE DT normally takes place over the course of seven days. Each national team competes in eight preliminary debates: four '''prepared debates''' and four '''impromptu debates''' (for which teams have one hour to prepare). Once the eight preliminary rounds have been completed, the 16 best teams compete in knock-out debates (known as the Octofinals) culminating in a Grand Final. For each debate, three [[judge]]s (or more in later rounds) mark each debater on his or her style, content and strategy.

==British Parliamentary Track==
The British Parliamentary Track of the Heart of Europe international debating tournament was first introduced in 2013, the 10th anniversary of the event. It took place between 29 July and 1 August 2013 and it was an international debating competition for university students in the most common format for this type of contest – the British Parliamentary debating, involving 4 teams of two university students in a single debate, representing two governments (affirming the motion) and two oppositions (negating the motion). The Chief Judge was Martin Rezny from the Czech Republic and the winning team was from Sweden.

In 2014, BP track was led by one of the winners of last year's BP track, Alexander Mäkela from Sweden, who introduced a special kind of motion for the last preliminary round – a hypothetical fictional scenario. Given the positive reception of the motion (in this case dealing with alien invasion), the experiment will likely turn into a tradition in the future years. There were 12 teams participating and the winning team was once again from Sweden.

The BP Track in 2015 has almost doubled in size since previous year including two new nations (Thailand and Great Britain), and the Chief Judge was once again Martin Rezny from the Czech Republic. The fictional scenario motion was about zombie apocalypse this time around, and even the real world motions shifted towards more unusual topics, such as astrology or robotics. The positive reception of this focus will therefore likely also become a trend at this event. The winning team was from Great Britain, the best speaker being Duncan Crowe, who just weeks after this event became a finalist of the EUDC 2015 in Vienna as well.

==Chief Adjudication Team==
The Chief Adjudication Team (CAT) of HOEDT is selected by the Chief Judge with the help of the Chief Organizer. The number of members may vary, though an odd number is more practical in terms of the CAT assembling a functional judging panel. While the principles behind the selection of the CAT members may vary as well, the CAT should consist of experienced judges of international tournaments in appropriate debate formats. In 2013, a new convention was established by extending the CAT to 5 members, each ideally representing a different region of the world.

==Organising Committee==

The Heart of Europe Debating Tournament is governed by the '''Organising Committee''', which is nominated by Executive Board of Czech Debate Society (CDS) and is made up of representatives and members of CDS and volunteers. Decisions are made by democratic votes of the Organising Committee members. The Organising Committee decides which town in [[Czech Republic]] will host the tournament, monitors and revises the HOE DT rules, handles matters such as adjudication, [[language]] issues, [[education]] and [[finance]]. Since 2010 till 2012 the procedure was run by Association of Debate Clubs Olomouc Region.

There is a Code of Ethics of HOE DT which contains the Aims of the tournament and three basic principles. he principles ensure that there is no censorship of motions for debate, and that all teams take part on an equal basis. All participants and all hosts must agree to abide by the Code of Ethics before taking part.

==The Goals==
The Goals of Heart of Europe Debating Tournament are:&lt;ref name="birtem"&gt;http://www.heart-of-europe.org/web/about/ About Heart of Europe Debating Tournament  – Heart-of-europe.org&lt;/ref&gt;
*to promote free speech;
*to nurture the skills of public speech and rhetorics;
*to develop cooperation among the youth;
*to advocate debate;
*to foster cultural and social understanding and exchange;
*to promote the Czech Republic and Olomouc Region;
*to contribute to education.

In order to further these aims, all participating countries agree that: 
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate any issue.
*The team of any participating country may be required to debate against the team of any other participating country.
*The team of any participating country is entitled to take part in the tournament on the same basis as any other participating country's team.

==EFL awards==

At Heart of Europe Debating Tournament special awards are presented each year to the best-performing English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) teams. These awards are open to teams from nations where English is not an official national language. To be eligible for the EFL award, a team must be predominantly made-up of students who do not come from English-speaking homes and who do not attend schools where English is used as a medium of instruction. 
The EFL award was instituted in 2010. Prior to that, there was just one award for teams from non-English-speaking countries. Before 2010, the HOE DT rules stipulated that teams who reached the semi-finals or Grand Final of the championship were not eligible to receive the ESL award. When the EFL award was introduced, the rules were changed to allow teams who reach the semi-finals (but not the Grand Final) to be able to receive the ESL or EFL award.

'''Hyperseal''' is the brand name for a series of specialized paints developed by noted inventor Col. [[Ronald Savin]].  The paints are divided into three categories: glass-infused paints, ''Hyperglass'', zinc-infused paints, ''Hyperzinc'', and rubber infused paints, ''Hyperflex''. The paints were developed to significantly cool surfaces in the desert, seal out water and galvanize rust. 

Part of a wave of environmentally friendly, “green products,” the paints are intended to significantly decrease energy expenditure, prevent toxic run-off from asphalt driveways, and ensure that water born vessels, marinas and bridges need only be repainted every 20 years to prevent rust; instead of once a year. 

'''Hyperglass''' is the first paint formulated with hollow [[glass “microspheres”]] suspended in a specialized white Teflon paint.  The paint has the remarkable ability to keep a surface in direct sunlight only 10 – 12 &amp;#176;F above ambient air temperature. The paint is used to coat roofs, patios and boat decks.  Before this, a typical asphalt roof would be 50 – 75 &amp;#176;F higher than the ambient air.  In [[Southern California]], homes with Hyperglass painted roofs, have seen a reduction of 50% of their air conditioning bills, thus significantly reducing their [[carbon footprint]]. Hyperseal has also developed a multipurpose caulk, called [[Hyperflex Caulk]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24348">'''Jewish Painters of Montreal''' refers to a group of artists who depicted the [[social realism]] of Montreal during the 1930s and 1940s. First used by the media to describe participants of the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition, the term was popularized in the 1980s by art historian and curator Esther Trepannier.&lt;ref name=Trep2&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then these artists have been exhibited collectively in public galleries across Canada. In 2009 the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] mounted a touring exhibition ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: a Witness to their time 1930-1948''&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;McCord Museum of Canadian History.

This collective included two generations of painters — established artists: Jack Beder (1910-1987), Alexandre Bercovitch (1891-1951), [[Eric Goldberg (artist)|Eric Goldberg]] (1890-1959), [[Louis Muhlstock]] (1904-2001); those in mid-career: [[Sam Borenstein]] (1908-1969), [[Herman Heimlich]] (1904-1986), [[Harry Mayerovitch]] (1910-2004), Bernard Mayman (1885-1966), Ernst Neumann (1907-1956), Fanny Wiselberg (1906-1986); and those just beginning: [[Sylvia Ary]] (1923-2011), [[Rita Briansky]] (1925), [[Ghitta Caiserman-Roth]] (1923-2005), [[Alfred Pinsky]] (1921-1999), and Moses "Moe" Reinblatt (1917-1979).&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p28.&lt;/ref&gt; As a group during the 30s and 40s, they were united in their choice of subjects — the human figure, Montreal and its people, and the war.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; As individual artists, their style varied from [[socialist realism]] to stylized [[expressionism]] with some the subject of recent museum exhibitions in Montreal, Ottawa or New York.

== History ==
These artists were either new arrivals from Eastern Europe or children of immigrants from that region. All were trained artists with a deep appreciation of impressionism and post-impressionism.&lt;ref name=ELAN&gt;Callaghan, Lori. ''Visual Arts from Painting to Performance Collectives'', [http://www.quebec-elan.org/histories/oneView/10 "The seeds of a community"] English Language Arts Network (ELAN). Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Most lived east of [[Mount Royal]] in Montreal's Jewish neighbourhood where, by 1926, Bercovitch, Mulstock and Reinblatt met informally at Bernard Mayman’s sign store on St Lawrence Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p219.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the opening of the new YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association) on Mount Royal Avenue in 1929, the group became associated with its annual art exhibition. As the Depression of the 1930s deepened, many of these artists found themselves in reduced circumstances. Louis Mulstock used discarded sugar sacks as canvas, while in 1936 Bercovitch took a teaching position at the YWHA (Young Women's Hebrew Association). There he instructed a new generation of artists including daughter Sylvia Ary, Ghitta Caisserman and Rita Briansky,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p221&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom included in the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition. Although there were discussions on creating a formal organization of Jewish Artists, as Bercovitch, Goldberg, Muhlstock, Mayervitch and Reinblatt were members of the 1938 [[Eastern Group of Painters]] and/or the 1939 Contemporary Arts Society, they were prohibited from other affiliations.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these artists had socialistic leanings which was reflected in their art. Bercovitch had married Russian revolutionary Bryna Avrutick  1915&lt;ref name=Inter/&gt; and was hired to teach art in Turkestan by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], then the Soviet Commisaire for Art and Theatre, in 1922.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"/&gt; Muhlstock identified with the working class and referred to his imagery as "proletarian art",&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;Anreus, Alejandro, Linden, Diana L. and Weinberg, Jonathan. ''The Social and the Real: Political Art of the 1930s in the Western Hemisphere'' Penn State Press (Philadelphia). 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02691-6}} [http://www.psupress.org/books/SampleChapters/0-271-02691-Xsc.html Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his choice of subject matter as "something I had known and experienced and seen, and so it was the thing I wanted to express".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles. "Interview with Louis Muhlstock (Artist) 15/09/1973". National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO914-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Mayerovitch wrote on social issues such as Montreal housing in the leftist ''[[Canadian Forum]]'' (Toronto): "Nothing has been done to alleviate the overcrowding of low wage earners; nothing to render slum property a less profitable investment; nothing to provide new housing for that shockingly large proportion of our population which lives in sub-standard dwellings ...".&lt;ref&gt;Mayerovitch, Harry. ''The Canadian Forum''. May 1940. National Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey= "Is Housing to Be Forgotten?"] Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the younger generation, Caiserman (after 1964 Caiserman-Roth) was the daughter of Hananiah Meir Caiserman, a union organizer and Po’alei Zion (Labor Zionism) activist&lt;ref name=Caisserman&gt;Jewish Women;s Archive [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/caiserman-roth-ghitta "Ghitta Caiserman-Roth".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; while Alfred Pinsky was the son of an American communist leader.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p263.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 30s and early 40s, Caisserman, Pinsky and Briansky attended the [[Art Students League of New York]] where they studied under muralist [[Harry Sternberg]] of the [[Federal Art Project]]. In New York they were exposed to the work of Mexican artists [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] and the social purpose of art was debated in both America and Canada. In 1941, Reinblatt viewed Orozco's 1932 mural in New York on his honeymoon while in 1948 both Caiserman and Pinsky, then married, traveled to Mexico to study mural art.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p264.&lt;/ref&gt;

These artists also responded to the degradation of human rights in Nazi-Germany and Quebec's restrictive 1937 [[Padlock Law]] against socialist and communists.&lt;ref name=cjournal&gt;Herland, Karen. [http://cjournal.concordia.ca/archives/20080403/reminiscing_about_jewish_montreal.php "Reminiscing about Jewish Montreal".] ''Concordia Journal.'' Concordia University. Web&lt;/ref&gt; During the 30s, Muhlstock who was a member of the Canadian League Against War and Fascism later commented: "Perhaps if the war wasn’t on I might not have gone in that direction, you see." As Canada's military commitment deepened, World War 2 became a topic for paintings, cartoons and political posters. Mayerovitch, appointed art director for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1940, produced many soviet-style posters,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p245.&lt;/ref&gt; while Reinblatt enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Airforce]] in 1942 and was an official Canadian War Artist by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;ARTSask, [http://www.artsask.ca/en/artists/moereinblatt Moe Reinblatt]. Web&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Pinsky as union representative with the Royal Canadian Navy&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p207. {{ISBN|978-2761925310}}&lt;/ref&gt; also choose war as a subject matter, but like Mulstock and Reinblatt depicted the workers behind the war effort rather than combat. Muhlstock’s ''Female Worker, Rear View'' (1943), of a female worker dressed in coveralls depicted the gender equality of workers during the war years.&lt;ref name=Shalom/&gt;

During the 30s and 40s, these artists exhibited in prominent venues of the day. All, with the exception of Sylvia Ary, exhibited at The Art Association of Montreal (now the [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] annual exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275/&gt; In the mid 30s Mulstock exhibited with the [[Canadian Group of Painters]] in Toronto  and along with Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Goldberg, Mayman, and Wiselberg with the Contemporary Arts Society of Montreal.&lt;ref name=Trep2-276&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p276.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1948 the more senior artists of the group: Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Heimlich, Mayervitch, Muhlstock, Neumann, and Reinblatt had all exhibited with the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name=Trep2-276/&gt; Members of this group were also represented in the 40s by Montreal gallerist Rose Millman first at Dominion Gallery and after 1948 at West End Gallery. After the YM-YWHA moved from the downtown core in 1950, West End Gallery increasingly served as a meeting place.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 1948"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
'''1930-1949''' In the early 1930s Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Borenstein were recognized artists. In 1933 Bercovitch held his first solo exhibition at Sydney Carter Gallery&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=438 "Alexandre Bercovitch".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; which was reviewed favourably by Henri Girard.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles C. [http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO92-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf "Interview with Sylvia Ary (Artist and daughter of artist Alexandre Bercovitch)"] National Gallery of Canada. Web&lt;/ref&gt; Mulhstock, considered one of the  finest draughtsmen in the country. was singled out for hi sensitive depictions of individuals by Montreal art critic Robert Ayre of ''The Gazette''. IBy the mid-30s 1935 they were reviewed collectively in the [[Canadian Forum]] (Toronto): "The subject matter of [Louis Muhlstock, Alexander Bercovitch, and Sam Borenstein] is similar: they paint the Montreal ghetto, tramp steamers in the harbour, street scenes, typical workers and members of the lumpen proletariat.... Muhlstock and Borenstein link their preoccupations closely with political awareness, though neither has as yet participated in the revolutionary movement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Art Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=14805 "A Cartoonist of the Left"]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, many were mentioned in the reviews of the Art Society of Montreal, while the Annual YM-YWHA art exhibition drew favorable reviews in the English press.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Respected as innovators in subject matter or form, by 1948 artists Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Heimlich, Mayervitch, Muhlstock, Neumann, and Reinblatt had all exhibited at the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Art]] exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275/&gt;

'''1950-1999''' In 1959 these artists were featured at the Montreal Museum of Fine Art's exhibition ''Works by Canadian Jewish Artists''.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue. ''Exhibition of Works by Canadian Jewish Artists October 29 to November 15''. Montreal Museum of Fine Art, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the art of the 30s and 40s was renewed in the mid-70s with the publication of Barry Lord's ''Canadian Art: Towards A Peoples History'' and with the [[National Gallery of Canada]]'s traveling exhibition ''Canadian Painting in the Thirties''. While both featured work by Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Goldberg, only Lord included the younger Jewish Painters of Montreal. However, in 1987 Montreal art historian and curator Esther Trepanier mounted an exhibition of their collective work at the Saidye Bronfman Centre (Montreal) which toured Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta and published ''Jewish Artists and Modernity''.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This renewed attention led to the acquisition of over 150 of their works by public institutions including the National Gallery of Canada, The Canadian War Museum, The National Archives and the Musée de Québec.&lt;ref&gt;John Donovan Biography [http://www.biferalifineart.com/artists/donovan/donovan.html Biferali Fine Art] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2000-''' In 2009 Trepannier, as executive director of the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] mounted the touring exhibition ''Jewish Painters of Montreal. Witnesses of Their Time 1930-1948''. When exhibited in Montreal in 2010 at the McCord Museum of Canadian History and the Leonard and Bina Ellen Gallery, Concordia University, the exhibition drew favorable reviews.&lt;ref name=cal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstaay, Marilynn.[http://www.westmountexaminer.com/Community/2010-04-15/article-1011394/Jewish-life-in-the-%26rsquo30s-and-%26rsquo40s-celebrated-at-the-McCord-/1 Jewish life in the ’30s and ’40s celebrated at the McCord] ''Westmount Examiner'' 15 Apr 2010.Web.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also exhibited frequently at West End Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderstaay, Marilynn.[http://www.westmountexaminer.com/Arts/Cultural-activities/2009-11-18/article-672247/West-End-showcases-Jewish-artists/1 West End showcases Jewish artists] ''Westmount Examiner'' 18 Nov 2009.

== Contribution ==
As social realists, the Jewish Painters of Montreal combined streetscapes and figurative art with leftist ideals of social justice and worker solidarity.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; In 1936 Toronto critic Graham McInnis of ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]'' wrote: "Mr. Muhlstock... is one of the leaders of that small group of Montreal painters who have found that it is possible to paint one's immediate environment – to see forms and relationships from one's back window – and at the same time to paint well, and in a manner as fine and as native in this country as the most gnarled and twisted pine of the most jagged rock in the North Country."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p184.&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian Esther Trepannier these artists of the 30s and 40s "unequivocally produced works that, both in their formal exploration and in their more contemporary, urban subjects, contributed towards the definition of the particular form of modernity that emerged between the major nationalist movements and abstraction"&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p205.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Les Automatistes]] painters [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]. For her these Jewish artists offered a decidedly more 'international' way of looking at the Canadian scene'."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p204.&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike their American and Mexican contemporaries, they adopted to distance themselves from the perceived nationalism of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. In terms of contribution, Trepannier has concluded that: "The artists of the Jewish community not only helped to define cultural modernity in Quebec and the rest of Canada during the interwar period, but have continued to enrich and enhance the originality of its development ever since."&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"/&gt;

Many were also respected educators. Berkovitch is considered "the father of modern Jewish painting in Montreal",&lt;ref name=Inter&gt;"Interactive Museum of Jewish Montreal [http://imjm.ca/location/1278 Alexandre Bercovitch - Residence]. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; and his assistant, Reinblatt, continued to teach throughout his career. Pinsky established the fine art department at Sir George Williams (now Concordia) University where both he and Caisserman taught.&lt;ref name=cjournal/&gt; Briansky taught the Visual Art Centre and the Saidye Bronfman School of Fine Art in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;AskArt [http://www.askart.com/askart/b/rita_prezament_briansky/rita_prezament_briansky.aspx "Rita Prezament Briansky".] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Di Pasquale''' is an Italian [[architect]].

==Biographical notes==
Graduated magna cum laude in Architecture at [[Politecnico di Milano]] in 1991. He has been contract professor at Faculty od Architecture and Society at Politecnico di Milano from 2009 to 2015. He started his professional practice in 1992. In 2001 he studied Film Directing in [[New York Film Academy]].
His professional practice JDP Architects&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amprogetti.it/indexamp.php?zone=9&amp;idlanguage=2 ''JDP Architects''] Staff&lt;/ref&gt; operates in Europe and China. He is PhD candidate at Politecnico di Milano in Hybrid Modular Architecture Tecnologies since 2016.

==Career==
He claims the lack of identity in contemporary globalized architecture and he considered himself an architectural storyteller, a seeker of new interpretations for the contemporary city. In the book "dense city" identifies a structural relationship between [[urban density]] and cultural identity in the urban fabric and architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ares.mi.it/riviste-600-91.html ''Edizioni Ares''] Faccia e Facciata, Studi Cattolici n 600 feb 2011, ed Ares Milano&lt;/ref&gt;
He said that "the contemporary city is no longer able to generate significant urban space because the modern architecture has abandoned the idea of "facade", which means the idea to orient the buildings, therefore the city no longer looks toward its space, but it's made by architectures that are meant to be looked upon as single sculptures or objects". Since 2008, he produces an intense cultural dissemination activity with lectures and conferences in Italy, China, Russia and United States. He has been an observer of the historical meeting between the Chinese tradition and the western contemporary society in the early 21st century. In 2013, he declares to the [[Il Sole 24 Ore]] that contemporary Chinese society and architecture are "seeking the contemporary transposition of its millenary tradition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsole24ore.com/art/impresa-e-territori/2013-03-07/arredo-italia-insegue-germania-093526.shtml?uuid=AbLXphbH ''Il Sole 24 Ore''] Arredo, l'Italia insegue la Germania sul mercato cinese&lt;/ref&gt;". Moreover, he's the author of many articles of "L'Arca International" magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadata.com/ ''Arca International''] L'Arca&lt;/ref&gt; In his academic research he defines and
investigates the hybrid modular systems concepts in terms of process innovation linked with the ongoing deep changes of life styles and housing habits in our contemporaneity.

==Competitions and projects==
[[File:Guangzhou_Circle_3.jpg|thumb|[[Guangzhou Circle]] ]]
He won several national and international competitions of architecture, among which the Tianjin Eco Town and the [[Guangzhou Circle]], opened in 2013, that [[CNN]] listed in the 10 most interesting buildings that will appear in 2014 worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2014/01/30/world/gallery/10-eye-popping-new-buildings-that-youll-see-in-2014/ ''CNN''] 10 eye-popping new buildings that you'll see in 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Other relevant projects are Gewiss production plant, Intercos, [[Polini]], Valsir, Aerea headquarter, amusement park of Minitalia Leolandia in Turate (Italy), and the masterplan Choruslife Bergamo in 2016.

{{Anthropology of kinship|terms}}
{{Anthropology}}

'''Kinship terminology''' is the system used in [[language]]s to refer to the persons to whom an individual is related through [[kinship]]. Different societies classify kinship relations differently and therefore use different systems of kinship terminology; for example, some languages distinguish between [[consanguine]] and [[Affinal kin|affinal]] uncles (i.e. the brothers of one's parents and the husbands of the sisters of one's parents, respectively), whereas others have only one word to refer to both a father and his brothers. Kinship terminologies include the terms of address used in different languages or communities for different relatives and the terms of reference used to identify the relationship of these relatives to ego or to each other.

==Historical view==
[[Anthropologist]] [[Lewis H. Morgan|Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881) performed the first survey of kinship terminologies in use around the world. Though much of his work is now considered dated, he argued that [[kinship]] terminologies reflect different sets of distinctions. For example, most kinship terminologies distinguish between sexes (the difference between a brother and a sister) and between generations (the difference between a child and a parent). Moreover, he argued, kinship terminologies distinguish between relatives by blood and [[marriage]] (although recently some anthropologists have argued that many societies define kinship in terms other than blood).

However, Morgan also observed that different languages (and, by extension, societies) organize these distinctions differently. He proposed to describe kinship terms and terminologies as either descriptive or [[Classificatory kinship|classificatory]]. When a descriptive term is used, it can only represent one type of relationship between two people, while a classificatory term represents one of many different types of relationships. For example, the word ''[[brother]]'' in English-speaking societies indicates a son of the same parent; thus, English-speaking societies use the word ''brother'' as a descriptive term.  A person's male first cousin could be the mother's brother's son, mother's sister's son, father's brother's son, father's sister's son, and so on; English-speaking societies therefore use the word ''cousin'' as a classificatory term.

Morgan discovered that a descriptive term in one society can become a classificatory term in another society.  For example, in some societies, one would refer to many different people as "mother" (the woman who gave birth to oneself, as well as her sister and husband's sister, and also one's father's sister). Moreover, some societies do not group together relatives which the English-speaking societies classify together. For example, some languages have no one-word equivalent to ''cousin'', because different terms refer to one's mother's sister's children and to one's father's sister's children.

Armed with these different terms, Morgan identified six basic patterns of kinship terminologies:

*[[Hawaiian kinship]]: the most classificatory; only distinguishes between sex and generation.  Thus, siblings and cousins are not distinguished (the same terms are used for both types of relatives).
*[[Sudanese kinship]]: the most descriptive; no two types of relatives share the same term.  Siblings are distinguished from cousins, and different terms are used for each type of cousin (i.e. father's brother's children, father's sister's children, mother's sister's children and mother's brother's children).
*[[Eskimo kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between lineal relatives (those related directly by a line of descent) and collateral relatives (those related by blood, but not directly in the line of descent). Lineal relatives have highly descriptive terms; collateral relatives have highly classificatory terms.  Thus, siblings are distinguished from cousins, while all types of cousins are grouped together.  The system of English-language kinship terms falls into the Eskimo type.
*[[Iroquois kinship]]: has both classificatory and descriptive terms; in addition to sex and generation, it also distinguishes between siblings of opposite sexes in the parental generation. A genealogical relationship traced through a pair of siblings of the same sex is classed as a blood relationship, but one traced though a pair of siblings of the opposite sex can be considered an in-law relationship. In other words, siblings are grouped together with [[parallel cousin]]s, while separate terms are used for [[cross-cousin]]s.  Also, one calls one's mother's sister "mother" and one's father's brother "father".  However, one refers to one's mother's brother and one's father's sister by separate terms (often the terms for ''father-in-law'' and ''mother-in-law'', since cross-cousins can be preferential marriage partners).
*[[Crow kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more descriptive terms, and relatives on the father's side have more classificatory terms.  Thus, Crow kinship is like Iroquois kinship, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's father's matrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's father's sister and one's father's sister's daughter, etc.
*[[Omaha kinship]]: like Iroquois, but further distinguishes between one's mother's side and one's father's side. Relatives on the mother's side of the family have more classificatory terms, and relatives on the father's side have more descriptive terms.  Thus, Omaha kinship is like Iroquois, with the addition that a number of relatives belonging to one's mother's patrilineage are grouped together, ignoring generational differences, so that the same term is used for both one's mother's brother and one's mother's brother's son, etc.

The basic principles of Crow and Omaha terminologies are symmetrical and opposite, with Crow systems having a matrilineal emphasis and Omaha systems a patrilineal emphasis.

==Relative age==
Some languages, such as [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (see [[Chinese kinship]]), [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], Cambodian, [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] ([[Filipino language|Filipino]]), [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Nepali language|Nepalese,]] and [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] add another dimension to some relations: relative age. Rather than one term for "brother", there exist, for example, different words for "older brother" and "younger brother". In Tamil, an older male sibling is referred to as ''Annan'' and a younger male sibling as ''Thambi'', whereas older and younger female siblings are called ''Akka'' and ''Thangai'' respectively.

==Identification of alternating generations==
Other languages, such as [[Chiricahua language|Chiricahua]], use the same terms of address for alternating generations. So a Chiricahua child (male or female) calls their paternal grandmother ''-ch’iné'', and likewise this grandmother will call her son's child ''-ch’iné''. Similar features are seen also in [[Huichol language|Huichol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Myerhoff|first=Barbara G.|year=1974|title=Peyote Hunt: The Sacred Journey of the Huichol Indians|location=Ithaca|publisher=Cornell, University Press|page=66|isbn=&lt;!--0-8014-9137-1--&gt;|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schaefer, Stacy and Peter T.

Terms that recognize alternating generations and the prohibition of marriage within one's own set of alternate generation relatives (0, ±2, ±4, etc.) are common in [[Australian Aboriginal kinship]].

The relative age and alternating-generations systems are combined in some languages.  For instance,
[[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] borrows the relative age system of the [[Chinese kinship]] and follows the generation system of kinship. [[Philippine Kinship|Philippine kinship]] distinguishes between generation, age and in some cases, gender.

== {{anchor|Dravidian kinship}} Tamil /Dravidian==
Floyd Lounsbury described&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = McGraw-Hill | pages = 351–393 | editors = Ward H.

The basic idea is that of applying an even/odd distinction to relatives that takes into account the gender of every linking relative for ego’s kin relation to any given person. A MFBD(C), for example, is a mother’s father’s brother’s daughter’s child. If each female link (M,D) is assigned a 0 and each male (F,B) a 1, the number of 1s is either even or odd; in this case, even. However, variant criteria exist.&lt;!-- which, ideally, would be detailed here. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In a Dravidian or Tamil system with a patrilineal [[modular arithmetic|modulo]]-2 counting system, marriage is prohibited with this relative, and a marriageable relative must be modulo-2 odd. There exists also a version of this logic with a matrilineal bias. Discoveries of systems that use modulo-2 logic, as in South Asia, Australia, and many other parts of the world, marked a major advance in the understanding of kinship terminologies that differ from kin relations and terminologies employed by Europeans.

The Dravidian or Tamil kinship system involves selective cousinhood. One's father's brother's children and one's mother's sister's children are ''not'' cousins but brothers and sisters one step removed. They are considered ''consanguineous'' (''pangali'' in Tamil), and marriage with them is strictly forbidden as incestuous. However, one's father's sister's children and one's mother's brother's children are considered cousins and potential mates (''muraicherugu'' in Tamil). Marriages between such cousins are allowed and encouraged. There is a clear distinction between [[cross cousin|cross cousins,]] who are one's true cousins and [[parallel cousin|parallel cousins,]] who are, in fact, siblings. Like Iroquois people, Dravidians use the same words to refer to their father's sister and mother-in-law (''atthai'' in Tamil &amp; ''atthe'' in Kannada) and their mother's brother and father-in-law ( Maamaa in Tamil &amp;''maava'' in Kannada). In Kannada, ''sodara'' is added before ''atthe'' and ''maava'' to specifically refer to father's sister and mother's brother respectively, although it is not used in direct address where as in Tamil only mother''s brother is captioned with "Thaai" before "maamaa" to specify it as mother''s brother (he is respected with high regards in their customs).

==Abbreviations for genealogical relationships==
The genealogical terminology used in many genealogical charts describes relatives of the subject in question. Using the abbreviations below, genealogical relationships may be distinguished by single or compound relationships, such as BC for a brother's children, MBD for a mother's brother's daughter, and so forth.

*B = Brother 
*C = Child(ren) 
*D = Daughter 
*F = Father 
*GC = Grandchild(ren) 
*GP = Grandparent(s) 
*H = Husband 
*LA = In-law 
*M = Mother 
*P = Parent 
*S = Son 
*SI = Siblings
*SP = Spouse 
*W = Wife 
*Z = Sister 
*(m.s.) = male speaking 
*(f.s.) = female speaking

A '''level spreader''' is an [[erosion control]] device designed to reduce [[water pollution]] by mitigating the impact of high-velocity [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff]].  It is used both on [[construction sites]] and for permanent applications such as drainage for [[road]]s and [[highway]]s. The device reduces the energy level in high-velocity flow by converting it into sheet flow, and disperses the discharged water so that it may be [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrated]] into [[soil]].

'''Lightwood's law''' is the principle that, in [[medicine]], [[bacterial]] infections will tend to localise while [[Virus|viral]] infections will tend to spread.&lt;ref name="GillO'Brien2017"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Denis Gill|author2=Niall O'Brien|title=Paediatric Clinical Examination Made Easy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQVODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246|date=9 March 2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-7020-7290-1|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based on the observation that while bacterial [[sepsis]] tends, despite affecting the whole body, to have a clear site of origin or 'focus', the opposite may be true of viral infections.&lt;ref name="Stephenson2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence Stephenson|title=Swine Flu: What Parents Need to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V1cSBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|year=2009|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|isbn=978-1-84905-085-2|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be multiple sites across the body which are affected including [[dermatological]] manifestations, [[respiratory]] symptoms and [[gastrointestinal]] symptoms. 

This principle is by no means infallible and in clinical practice a variety of diagnostic tests are used to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections.

'''Missing Middle Housing''' consists of multi-unit housing types such as [[duplex (building)|duplexes]], fourplexes, [[bungalow court]]s, and mansion apartments that are not bigger than a large house, that are integrated throughout most walkable pre-1940s [[neighborhoods]], often integrated into blocks with primarily single-family homes, and that provide diverse [[housing]] choices and generate enough density to support transit and locally-serving commercial amenities. Although many of these are a common feature in pre-war building stocks, these housing types have become much less common (hence the “missing”). The term was coined by architect and urban planner Daniel Parolek, Principal and Founder of Opticos Design, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=Missing Middle Housing: Responding to the Demand for Walkable Urban Living|url=http://www.smartgrowth.org/nationalconversation/compendium/12_Parolek_Missing_Middle_Housing_020713.pdf|website=www.smartgrowth.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310015016/http://www.smartgrowth.org/nationalconversation/compendium/12_Parolek_Missing_Middle_Housing_020713.pdf|archivedate=2013-03-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[AARP|American Association for Retired Persons]] recently released a new report, which showed that more and more, Americans want to “age in place,” and need easy access to services and amenities available in walkable, urban, transit-oriented communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aging U.S. Population Boosts Demand for Missing Middle Housing|url=http://opticosdesign.com/growing-missing-middle-housing-demand-among-u-s-aging-population/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millennials have also been shown to drive less, and seek housing choices in walkable neighborhoods close to transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Toppo|first1=Greg|title=Rocking the walking: Millennials drive new urban spaces|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/06/17/walkable-urban-places-findings/10623587/|website=USA Today|accessdate=June 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers of automobile miles traveled increased each year between 1946 and 2004; today Americans drive less than 2004, and no more per person than in 1996. The decline in driving is most striking among young people aged 16 to 34, who drove 23% fewer miles on average in 2009 than their age group did in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moore|first1=Patrick J.|title=U.S. Temporary Housing Trend: Millennials and the "Walkable Urban Neighborhood|url=http://www.bristolglobal.com/u-s-temporary-housing-trend-millennials-and-the-walkable-urban-neighborhood/|website=Bristol Global|accessdate=June 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120095859/http://www.bristolglobal.com/u-s-temporary-housing-trend-millennials-and-the-walkable-urban-neighborhood/#|archive-date=2014-11-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Millennials prefer amenity rich housing choices. These amenities are within walking distance,” presented Howard Ways of the Redevelopment Authority of Prince George's County in Washington D.C. “They prefer smaller units with open floor plans and are not interested in yard work at all.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yung|first1=John|title=APA14: Demographic Preferences Shifting in Favor of Walkable, Urban Communities|url=http://www.urbancincy.com/2014/04/apa14-demographic-preferences-shifting-in-favor-of-walkable-urban-communities/|website=UrbanCincy|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“There’s a convergence of the demand created by Baby Boomers who are moving back, not just into city centers but into surrounding single-family neighborhoods, and the Millennials who want walkable urban living. The demand is just going to continue to grow," said Dan Parolek in an article on the National Association of Realtors website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Gieson|first1=John|title=Mid-Range Density|url=http://www.realtor.org/articles/mid-range-density|website=National Association of Realtors|accessdate=December 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; “I find in my development work my primary buyers are empty nester Boomers who are selling the big house, the big lot, the kids are grown and gone, and they’re looking for more lifestyle freedom,” said Linda of The Cottage Company in the same article.

==Characteristics==

==Benefits==

Missing Middle Housing offers greater choice in housing types that still blend into existing single family neighborhoods, unlike mid-rise apartment buildings. They are typically more affordable than a [[Single-family detached home|single-family home]] because they are smaller and share communal parking and lawns. These building types typically have a residential unit density in the range of 16 to 30 units per acre but are often perceived as being less dense because they are smaller in scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agnew|first1=Spencer|title=CNU 21: Missing Middle Housing|url=http://blogs.stthomas.edu/realestate/2013/06/11/cnu-21-missing-middle-housing/|website=University of St. Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of The Cottage Company's cottage court developments are looking for a detached housing option that is smaller in size and requires less maintenance than a single-family home. The cottage court concept meets that need by grouping several small detached houses around shared lawns and parking. Residents get the benefit of their own detached home, and association fees take care of the lawn and parking maintenance. The most prevalent demographic groups in The Cottage Company's cottage court housing tend to be single women, empty nesters, and young professional couples.

Pursuing these housing types can also offer a financial benefit to developers. In a recent blog post, Daniel Parolek writes that a small infill builder in Norman, OK, recently made the decision to renovate an existing fourplex rather than turning it into a duplex. "He told me that if he had renovated the building into a duplex like he had planned before talking to me, he was expecting to get $600/month per bedroom and each unit would have been three bedrooms for a total of $3,600 in revenue per month for the two units. He was happy to tell me that he is now renting each of the one-bedroom units for $1,000 each for $4,000 in total monthly revenue. That is an 11% increase in monthly revenue! In this one project Keith has blown the top off of this market and is getting $1,000 per bedroom for these small, well-designed micro units located in a walkable context," Parolek wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=An Important Win for Housing Diversity|url=http://opticosdesign.com/win-housing-diversity/|website=Opticos Design, Inc.|accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parolek|first1=Daniel|title=A win for housing diversity|url=http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/dan-parolek/21476/win-housing-diversity|website=Better Cities &amp; Towns|accessdate=March 5, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308134742/http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/blogs/dan-parolek/21476/win-housing-diversity#|archive-date=2015-03-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lloyd Alter of Treehugger says there is a certain amount of density required for building green cities that support transit-oriented development, but that you don't want it to be too dense. "I have made the case that you don't want it too high; that there is a Goldilocks density that's just right. One form of housing that gets close to Goldilocks is the stacked townhouse," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Lloyd|title=Density creeps are coming to a city near you, and that's a good thing.|url=http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/density-creeps-are-coming-city-near-you.html|website=Treehugger|accessdate=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland, OR, has a number of historic Missing Middle housing types located throughout the city, most of which are duplexes, that were built before the 1920s before the city's first zoning plan was approved. Zoning for single-family homes was expanded in the 1950s and the building of duplexes or triplexes largely became illegal in Portland. Some local developers are now advocating for these Missing Middle types, saying that they are key to building the bike-friendly neighborhoods Portland is known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Michael|title=Why are these 11 buildings illegal in most of Portland?|url=http://bikeportland.org/2015/06/19/11-buildings-illegal-portland-144633|website=BikePortland.org|accessdate=June 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''mutual shaping''' was developed through [[Science and Technology Studies]] (STS) in an attempt to explain the detailed process of technological design.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping is a combination of [[social determinism]] and [[technological determinism]], suggesting that society and technology are not mutually exclusive to one another and, instead, influence and shape each other.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison of TD and SD ==
[[Technological determinism]] (TD), coined by [[Thorstein Veblen]], suggests that technology is the primary catalyst for change in society. Following this theory, the development and implementation of technology is beyond the control of society as it is pervasive in all elements of our lives. Once a technology has been created its influence on society is an inevitable, predetermined path. An example that supports technological determinism is the development of the [[printing press]] that accelerated the [[Protestant Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, L. (2010). Technological determinism. In S. Priest (Ed.), Encyclopedia of science and technology communication. (pp. 870-873). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc. {{DOI|10.4135/9781412959216.n293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, social determinism (SD), popularized by social theorists [[Karl Marx]] and [[Emile Durkheim]], purports that social structure is the driving factor towards change in society.&lt;ref&gt;Determinism. (2001). In World of sociology, Gale. Retrieved from http://esearch.credoreference.com/content/entry/worldsocs/determinism/0&lt;/ref&gt; Following this view, society is the governing force that determines social behaviour, and technology is created and adapted based on society’s wants and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mahood, Aurelea. (2008). Social and technological determinism. CultureNet @ CapilanoU. Retrieved from http://culturenet.wordpress.com/2008/03/07/social-and-technological-determinism/&lt;/ref&gt;

Both TD and SD are cause-and-effect theories suggesting that technology and society are mutually exclusive. The theory of mutual shaping suggests that technology design is a result of a synthesis of TD and SD. It sees technology and society working together to facilitate change. Society changes as a direct result of the implementation of technology that has been created based on society’s wants and needs. They function collectively to shape one another.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In social networks ==
Mutual shaping is exemplified through the integration of online [[Social networking|social networking platforms]] into daily life. They are a [[communications technology]] designed to complement pre-existing methods of communication, such as the phone or in-person conversations, that have become more convenient and/or affordable than their predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wellman | first1 = B. | last2 = Quan-Haase | first2 = A. | last3 = Witte | first3 = J. | last4 = Hampton | first4 = K. | year = 2013 | title = Does the internet increase, decrease, or supplement social capital?: Social networks, participation, and community commitment | url = | journal = American Behavioral Scientist| volume =  45| issue = | pages =  436–455 [440] | doi = 10.1177/00027640121957286 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TD would argue that these communication technologies have directly influenced our networking capabilities due to their accessibility. Without them we would not be able to conduct business or maintain friendships over long distances. SD would argue that these platforms were created as a result of a need to facilitate communication over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;Quan-Haase, A. (2013). Technology and society: Social networks, power, and inequality. Oxford University Press. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual shaping supports both of these arguments, believing that the two cannot be separated. Social networking platforms display how technology and society are inextricably linked as they work together towards the advancement of one another, exemplifying the theory of mutual shaping.

'''Nightshift''' is a free monthly music magazine in [[Oxford]], [[England]]. Distributed via music venues, pubs, and shops, it provides music news, gig listings, and reviews for the city and surrounding area.

== History ==
First published in March 1991, it was originally titled ''Curfew'', and continued under that name until the end of 1994, when the main [[Music venue|venues]] in  Oxford - [[O2 Academy Oxford|The Venue]], the [[Jericho Tavern]], and the Hollybush - closed down temporarily and there was little music scene to cover. ''Curfew'' had the earliest reviews and interviews with [[Radiohead]] and [[Supergrass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-33176717|title = Radiohead, Foals and 25 years of discovering Oxford music|work=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=March 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1995, publication started anew as ''Nightshift'',&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/archive/2000/07/06/Oxfordshire+Archive/6630975.Preview__Nightshift_night/ Preview: Nightshift night]", "[[Oxford Mail]]", July 6, 2000, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ahead of the opening of venues [[O2 Academy Oxford|The Zodiac]] and The Point.

== Content ==
Each month has a feature on one local artist or group, with their picture appearing on the front cover, and an interview inside. There are occasional exceptions to this format, for example the November 2010 issue featured a round up of the [[Heavy metal music|Metal]] scene, and July 2010 covered [[Truck Festival]].

The magazine includes local music news, [[Release (music)|new release]], [[live concert|gig]], and [[demo (music)|demo]], [[review]]s, and a gig guide for the month. [[Advertisement]]s support the magazine's production and distribution.

In the ''Demos'' section, editor Munro reviews demos sent by local musicians, with no pretence of being unbiased. The reviews are entirely based upon his opinions and preferences, but — despite sometimes harsh words for music deemed lacking — there is genuine constructive criticism, and many bands later submit improved demos.&lt;ref&gt;"New Year's Day Unsigned Music Guide", "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00cs8y8 BBC Radio Oxford, BBC Introducing]", January 1, 2011, accessed January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The best and worst entries in a month are put in ''Demo of the month'' and ''The Demo dumper'', respectively.

{{quote|text=Parachutes are apparently a five-piece band, though they sound more like some sausage-fingered bedroom hermit collapsing on the random play buttons of every instrument in his room and deluding himself that it’s something akin to ''avant garde'' genius.|sign=Ronan Munro|source=The Demo Dumper, Nightshift August 2009.}}

The instructions for submitting demos include the warning "If you can’t handle criticism, please don’t send us your demo".

The [http://nightshiftmag.co.uk/ Nightshift online] web site features [[PDF]] downloads of the magazine since 2005, and a [[Internet forum|bulletin board]] for local musicians, fans, and promoters.

==The Punt==
Nightshift organises ''The Punt'', an annual music event typically featuring around 20 unsigned Oxfordshire-based bands in five venues around Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Bearder, "[http://www.bbc.co.uk/oxford/content/articles/2009/03/02/punt09.shtml The Punt]", "BBC Oxford", March 2, 2009, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Punt was originally conceived during the warm-up for [[Oxford#Music|Oxford Sound City]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordtimes.co.uk/archive/2001/05/11/Oxfordshire+Archive/6617032.Punters_land_a_festival_gem/ Punters land a festival gem], "Oxford Times", May 11, 2001, Retrieved January 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Among the acts that received early exposure after being picked to play at The Punt were [[Young Knives]], [[Stornoway (band)|Stornoway]], [[Little Fish (band)|Little Fish]], [[Fixers (band)|Fixers]] and Elizabeth, the band featuring a teenage Yannis Phillipakis and Jack Bevan, later of [[Foals (band)|Foals]].

The Phoenix et al. study sought to discover whether [[gonadal hormones]] given during the prenatal period had organizing effects on guinea pigs’ reproductive behavior&lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC. Organizing action of prenatally administered testosterone propionate on the tissues mediating mating behavior in the female guinea pig. Endocrinology. 1959;65:369–382.  &lt;/ref&gt; It was found that when female controls, gonadectomized (removal of gonads) females, hermaphrodites, and [[castrated]] males were injected prenatally with [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] proprionate, the mean number of mounts increased. This increase in male-typical reproductive behavior shows that prenatal androgens have a masculinizing effect. Moreover, the organizing effects of hormones can have permanent effects. Phoenix et al. found that females injected with testosterone propionate while pregnant, instead of neonatally, did not have any effect on [[lordosis]]. This demonstrates that when testosterone is given postnatally in females, there may not be lasting effects as compared to prenatally administered testosterone. The data from this study supports the organizational hypothesis that states when [[androgens]] are given prenatally there is an organizing effect on sexual behavior, permanently altering normal female mating behavior as adults. &lt;ref&gt; Phoenix CH, Goy RW, Gerall AA, Young WC.

== Mechanisms in sexual differentiation ==
Sexual behavior in rats is organized prenatally and activated with steroids hormones in adulthood.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In males high levels of testosterone produced by testes and travel to the brain. Here, testosterone is aromatized to an estradiol and masculinizes and defeminizes the brain. Thus, [[estradiol]] is responsible for many male-typical behavior. In females, the ovaries produce large amounts of [[estrogen]] during gestation. Rats have alpha-fetoprotein that binds to the estrogen before it can reach the brain. The estrogen is eventually metabolized in the liver. This protein has a low affinity for androgens. Therefore, testosterone can reach the brain without being taken up by alpha-fetoprotein. Due to fact that males have different levels of androgens in the brain, this can lead to organizing effects from androgen exposure with the expression of masculine behaviour.

== Main points of organizational-activational theory ==
The organizational-activational theory has three main components.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

#Organizational effects are permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Gomes et al. showed that organizational effects can last a lifetime. Newborn female mice were exposed to either endured one minute of the neonatal handling stress procedure for the first ten days postpartum or were not handled at all. As adults, sexual receptiveness was recorded and handled female mice showed less [[lordosis]] than non-handled female mice and had less serum progesterone. &lt;ref&gt; Gomes C. (2012). “Neonatal handling induces alteration in progesterone secretion after sexual behavior but not in angiotensin II receptor density in the medial amygdala: implications for reproductive success.” Life Sciences. 2867-2871. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Neonatal handling not only affected reproductive behavior, but also affected sympathetic nerve activity and glucocorticoid levels into adulthood, indicating that emotional stress during developmentally sensitive periods can permanently change behavior. &lt;ref&gt; Nugent BM. (2012). “Hormonal Programming Across the Lifespan.” Hormone and Metabolic Research. 577–586. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects occur just prior to or after birth, but before neural tissues have matured.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Gorski et al. demonstrated the importance of the timing of hormonal influence in a study involving rats and the size of their [[medial preoptic nucleus]] (MPON). MPON size is a [[sexually dimorphic]] trait in that the MPON of male rats is larger than the MPON of female rats. But when male rats were castrated neonatally, their MPON was significantly smaller than male rats that were castrated after their brains were sexually differentiated. Despite both groups of males being castrated, the timing of the castration affected MPON size, indicating that organizational effects occur prior to maturation of neural tissues.&lt;ref&gt; Gorski R. (1978). “Evidence for a morphological sex difference within the medial preoptic area of the rat brain.” Brain Research. 333–346. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Organizational effects take place during a [[critical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Results from studies indicate that organizational effects are maximized during sensitive periods of brain development. One critical period is weeks 8-24 of gestation. Another sensitive period shortly after birth may exist with a peak in testosterone in male infants during postnatal months 1-5. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Auyeung et al. tested for an association between fetal and postnatal testosterone and autism in children. The results supported the idea that there is a critical period during which organizational effects occur. Fetal testosterone levels (taken from amniotic fluid during second trimester amniocentesis) and postnatal testosterone levels (from 18- to 24-month-olds' saliva) were compared with the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT), a measure of autistic traits in children. The authors found that only fetal testosterone was positively associated with Q-CHAT scores, signifying that fetal testosterone exposure during the critical period for sexual differentiation of the brain is associated with the development of autistic traits whereas postnatal androgens are not.&lt;ref&gt; Auyeung B. (2012). “Prenatal versus postnatal sex steroid hormone effects on autistic traits in children at 18 to 24 months of age.” Molecular Autism.17. Web. 25 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
There is evidence that organizational effects are not always permanent. In canaries, only the males produce song. Brain regions associated with bird song, including the hyperstriatum ventrale pars caudale (HVc) and nucleus robustus archistriatalis (RA), are larger in male canaries. However, the HVc and RA grow significantly larger in gonadectomized female canaries if given testosterone at 11 months of age and these females even begin to sing. These two brain regions change morphologically due to testosterone, indicating that neural tissue can be changed due to steroid hormones despite being organized to react to sex hormones in a female- or male-specific way.&lt;ref&gt; Nottebohm F. (1980). “Testosterone triggers growth of brain vocal control nuclei in adult female canaries.” Brain Res.429-436. Web. 24 Mar. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence ==
=== Facts of [[Digit ratio|2D:4D]] ratio ===
Finger ratio has been examined in relation to a number of physical traits that show sex differences and evidence suggests it is influenced by the prenatal environment, although there is no direct evidence for the latter.&lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in men have been motivated by two conflicting hypotheses. On the one hand, homosexual men were hypothesized to be exposed to high levels of testosterone in utero, which would be associated with a lower 2D:4D ratio than that found in heterosexual men. On the other hand, homosexual men have been hypothesized to have low prenatal testosterone exposure, and data from two studies are consistent with that hypothesis, showing homosexual men to have a higher finger ratio (on both hands) than heterosexual men. &lt;ref&gt; Arnold A. (1985) “Organizational and activational effects of sex steroids on brain and behavior: a reanalysis.” Hormones and Behavior. 469-498. Web. 24 Mar. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
   
=== Ovulation and gonadal secretion ===
The hormonal control of ovulation is also related to the organizational/activational hypothesis.  &lt;ref&gt; Nelson, R. An Introduction to Behavioral Endocrinology (4th ed.). Sunderland, Mass.: Sinauer Associates. 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both males and females rats exhibit luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses in which LH is released from the anterior pituitary due to the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. Females, however, show an increase in LH pulse frequency around ovulation due to the positive feedback mechanism. When estrogen is increased in the blood, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) of the hypothalamus causes the release of GnRH. The GnRH surge brings about a surge in LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Since females have a cyclic gonadal function, there may be a sexual dimorphism in the gonadal secretion. When female rats are injected with testosterone there is no positive feedback occurring and no LH surge. Moreover, castrated males will exhibit LH surges, similar to female cyclic gonadal behavior.

'''Phytochromes''' are a class of [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptor]] in [[plant]]s, bacteria and [[Fungus|fungi]] use to detect light. They are sensitive to light in the [[red]] and [[far-red]] region of the [[visible spectrum]] and can be classed as either Type I, which are activated by far-red light, or Type II that are activated by red light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3268501 | pmid=22303272 | doi=10.1199/tab.0148 | volume=9 | title=Phytochrome signaling mechanisms | journal=Arabidopsis Book | page=e0148 | vauthors=Li J, Li G, Wang H, Wang Deng X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances have suggested that phytochromes also act as temperature sensors, as warmer temperatures enhance their de-activation.&lt;ref&gt;http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/832&lt;/ref&gt;

Phytochromes control many aspects of plant development. They regulate the [[germination]] of [[seeds]] (photoblasty), the synthesis of [[chlorophyll]], the elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number and movement of [[leaf|leaves]] and the timing of [[flowering]] in adult plants. Phytochromes are widely expressed across many tissues and developmental stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3268501 | pmid=22303272 | doi=10.1199/tab.0148 | volume=9 | title=Phytochrome signaling mechanisms | journal=Arabidopsis Book | page=e0148 | vauthors=Li J, Li G, Wang H, Wang Deng X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plant photoreceptors include [[cryptochrome]]s and [[phototropin]]s, which respond to [[blue]] and [[ultraviolet]]-A light and [[UVR8]], which is sensitive to [[ultraviolet]]-B light.

== Structure ==
Phytochromes consist of a [[protein]], [[covalently]] linked to a [[bilin (biochemistry)|bilin]] [[chromophore]]. The protein part comprises two identical chains (A and B). Each chain has a [[PAS domain]], [[GAF domain]] and PHY domain. Domain arrangements in plant, bacterial and fungal phytochromes are comparable insofar, as the three N-terminal domains are always PAS, GAF and PHY domains. However C-terminal domains are more divergent. The PAS domain serves as a signal sensor and the GAF domain is responsible for binding to cGMP and also senses light signals. Together, these subunits form the phytochrome region, which regulates physiological changes in plants to changes in red and far red light conditions. In plants, red light changes phytochrome to its biologically active form, while far red light changes the protein to its biologically inactive form.

== Isoforms or states ==

Phytochromes are characterised by a red/far-red photochromicity. Photochromic pigments change their "colour" (spectral absorbance properties) upon light absorption. In the case of phytochrome the ground state is P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, the &lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; indicating that it absorbs red light particularly strongly. The absorbance maximum is a sharp peak 650–670&amp;nbsp;nm, so concentrated phytochrome solutions look turquoise-blue to the human eye. But once a red photon has been absorbed, the pigment undergoes a rapid conformational change to form the P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; state. Here &lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that now not red but far-red (also called "near infra-red"; 705–740&amp;nbsp;nm) is preferentially absorbed. This shift in absorbance is apparent to the human eye as a slightly more greenish colour&lt;!-- Unsourced image reference removed: "(see image below)" --&gt;. When P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; absorbs far-red light it is converted back to P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. Hence, red light makes P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, far-red light makes P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. In plants at least P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; is the physiologically active or "signalling" state.

== Biochemistry ==
Chemically, phytochrome consists of a ''[[chromophore]]'', a single bilin molecule consisting of an open chain of four [[pyrrole]] rings, covalently bonded to the [[protein]] moiety via highly conserved cysteine amino acid. It is the chromophore that absorbs light, and as a result changes the conformation of bilin and subsequently that of the attached protein, changing it from one state or isoform to the other.

The phytochrome chromophore is usually '''phytochromobilin''', and is closely related to [[phycocyanobilin]] (the chromophore of the [[phycobiliprotein]]s used 
by [[cyanobacteria]] and [[red algae]] to capture light for [[photosynthesis]]) and to the [[bile]] pigment [[bilirubin]] (whose structure is also affected by light exposure, a fact exploited in the [[phototherapy]] of [[jaundice]]d newborns).
The term "bili" in all these names refers to bile. Bilins are derived from the closed tetrapyrrole ring of haem by an oxidative reaction catalysed by haem oxygenase to yield their characteristic open chain. [[Chlorophyll]] too is derived from haem ([[Heme]]). In contrast to bilins, haem and chlorophyll carry a metal atom in the center of the ring, iron or magnesium, respectively.&lt;ref name=mauseth&gt;{{Cite book|ref=harv |last= Mauseth|first= James D.|title=Botany : An Introduction to Plant Biology |edition=3rd|year=2003|isbn=0-7637-2134-4|publisher= Jones and Bartlett Learning|location=Sudbury, MA|pages=422–427}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; state passes on a signal to other biological systems in the cell, such as the mechanisms responsible for [[gene]] expression. Although this mechanism is almost certainly a [[biochemical]] process, it is still the subject of much debate. It is known that although phytochromes are synthesized in the [[cytosol]] and the P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; form is localized there, the P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; form, when generated by light illumination, is translocated to the [[cell nucleus]]. This implies a role of phytochrome in controlling gene expression, and many genes are known to be regulated by phytochrome, but the exact mechanism has still to be fully discovered. It has been proposed that phytochrome, in the P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; form, may act as a [[kinase]], and it has been demonstrated that phytochrome in the P&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; form can interact directly with [[transcription factor]]s.

== Discovery ==
The phytochrome pigment was discovered by [[Sterling Hendricks]] and [[Harry Borthwick]] at the [[USDA-ARS]] [[Beltsville Agricultural Research Center]] in [[Maryland]] during a period from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Using a [[spectrograph]] built from borrowed and war-surplus parts, they discovered that red light was very effective for promoting germination or triggering flowering responses. The red light responses were reversible by far-red light, indicating the presence of a photoreversible pigment.

The phytochrome pigment was identified using a [[spectrophotometer]] in 1959 by biophysicist [[Warren Butler]] and biochemist [[Harold Siegelman]]. Butler was also responsible for the name, phytochrome.

In 1983 the laboratories of Peter Quail and Clark Lagarias reported the chemical purification of the intact phytochrome molecule, and in 1985 the first phytochrome [[gene sequence]] was published by Howard Hershey and Peter Quail. By 1989, molecular genetics and work with [[monoclonal antibodies]] that more than one type of phytochrome existed; for example, the [[pea]] plant was shown to have at least two phytochrome types (then called type I (found predominantly in dark-grown seedlings) and type II (predominant in green plants)). It is now known by [[genome sequencing]] that ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana|Arabidopsis]]'' has five phytochrome genes (PHYA - E) but that rice has only three (PHYA - C). While this probably represents the condition in several di- and monocotyledonous plants, many plants are [[polyploid]]. Hence [[maize]], for example, has six phytochromes - phyA1, phyA2, phyB1, phyB2, phyC1 and phyC2. While all these phytochromes have significantly different protein components, they all use phytochromobilin as their light-absorbing chromophore. Phytochrome A or phyA is rapidly degraded in the Pfr form - much more so than the other members of the family. In the late 1980s, the Vierstra lab showed that phyA is degraded by the ubiquitin system, the first natural target of the system to be identified in eukaryotes.

In 1996 David Kehoe and Arthur Grossman at the Carnegie Institution at Stanford University identified a proteins in the filamentous [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] Fremyella diplosiphon called RcaE with similarly to plant phytochrome that controlled a red-green photoreversible response called chromatic acclimation and identified a gene in the sequenced, published genome of the [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] ''[[Synechocystis]]'' with closer similarity to those of plant phytochrome. This was the first evidence of phytochromes outside the plant kingdom. Jon Hughes in Berlin and Clark Lagarias at UC Davis subsequently showed that this Synechocystis gene indeed encoded a ''bona fide'' phytochrome (named Cph1) in the sense that it is a red/far-red reversible chromoprotein. Presumably plant phytochromes are derived from an ancestral cyanobacterial phytochrome, perhaps by gene migration from the [[chloroplast]] to the nucleus. Subsequently, phytochromes have been found in other [[prokaryote]]s including ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' and ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''. In ''Deinococcus'' phytochrome regulates the production of light-protective pigments, however in ''Synechocystis'' and ''Agrobacterium'' the biological function of these pigments is still unknown.

In 2005, the Vierstra and Forest labs at the [[University of Wisconsin]] published a three-dimensional structure of a truncated ''[[Deinococcus]]'' phytochrome (PAS/GAF domains). This paper revealed that the protein chain forms a knot - a highly unusual structure for a protein. In 2008, two groups around Essen and Hughes in Germany and Yang and Moffat in the US published the three-dimensional structures of the entire photosensory domain. One structures was for the ''Synechocystis sp. (strain PCC 6803)'' phytochrome in Pr and the other one for the ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' phytochrome in the Pfr state. The structures showed that a conserved part of the PHY domain, the so-called PHY tongue, adopts different folds. In 2014 it was confirmed by Takala et al that the refolding occurs even for the same phytochrome (from ''[[Deinococcus]])'' as a function of illumination conditions.

== Genetic engineering ==
Around 1989, several laboratories were successful in producing ''[[transgenic plants]]'' which produced elevated amounts of different phytochromes (''[[overexpression]]''). In all cases the resulting plants had conspicuously short stems and dark green leaves. Harry Smith and co-workers at Leicester University in England showed that by increasing the expression level of phytochrome A (which responds to far-red light), [[shade avoidance]] responses can be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Robson, P. R. H., McCormac, A. C., Irvine, A. S. &amp; Smith, H. Genetic engineering of harvest index in tobacco through overexpression of a phytochrome gene. Nature Biotechnol. 14, 995–998 (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, plants can expend less energy on growing as tall as possible and have more resources for growing seeds and expanding their root systems. This could have many practical benefits: for example, grass blades that would grow more slowly than regular grass would not require mowing as frequently, or crop plants might transfer more energy to the grain instead of growing taller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2313">'''PlusCal''' (formerly called '''+CAL''') is a formal specification language created by [[Leslie Lamport]], which [[source-to-source compiler|transpiles]] to [[TLA+|TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11459">The field of '''population informatics''' is the systematic study of populations via secondary analysis of massive data collections (termed "[[big data]]") about people.  Scientists in the field refer to this massive data collection as the [[social genome]], denoting the collective [[digital footprint]] of our society.  Population informatics applies [[data science]] to social genome data to answer fundamental questions about human society and population health much like [[bioinformatics]] applies data science to [[human genome]] data to answer questions about individual health. It is an emerging research area at the intersection of SBEH (Social, Behavioral, Economic, &amp; Health) sciences, computer science, and statistics in which quantitative methods and computational tools are used to answer fundamental questions about our society.

== Introduction ==

=== History ===
The term was first used in August 2012 when the [http://research.tamhsc.edu/pinformatics/about-us/#history Population Informatics Research Group] was founded at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The term was first defined in a peer reviewed article in 2013&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Privacy-by-Design: Understanding Data Access Models for Secondary Data|journal = AMIA Joint Summits on Translational Science proceedings AMIA Summit on Translational Science|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 2153-4063|pmc = 3845756|pmid = 24303251|pages = 126–130|volume = 2013|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = Stanley|last2 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further elaborated on in another article in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Genome: Putting Big Data to Work for Population Informatics|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6678338&amp;url=http%253A%252F%252Fieeexplore.ieee.org%252Fiel7%252F2%252F5306045%252F06678338.pdf%253Farnumber%253D6678338|journal = Computer|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 56–63|volume = 47|issue = 1|doi = 10.1109/MC.2013.405|first = Hye-Chung|last = Kum|first2 = A.|last2 = Krishnamurthy|first3 = A.|last3 = Machanavajjhala|first4 = S.C.|last4 = Ahalt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [http://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in August 2015.

=== Goals ===
To study social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences using the massive data collections, aka [[social genome]] data, about people.  The primary goal of population informatics is to increase the understanding of social processes by developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to the [[social genome]] data.

Some of the important sub-disciplines are :
* [[Business analytics]]
* [[Social computing]]: social network data analysis
* Policy informatics
* [[Public health informatics]] 
* [[Computational journalism]]
* [[Computational transportation science]]
* [[Computational epidemiology]]
* [[Computational economics]]
* [[Computational sociology]]
* [[Computational social science]]

=== Approaches ===
[[Record linkage|Record Linkage]], the task of finding records in a dataset that refer to the same entity across different data sources, is a major activity in the population informatics field because most of the digital traces about people are fragmented in many heterogeneous databases that need to be linked before analysis can be done.

Once relevant datasets are linked, the next task is usually to develop valid meaningful measures  to answer the research question.  Often developing measures involves iterating between inductive and deductive approaches with the data and research question until usable measures are developed because the data were collected for other purposes with no intended use to answer the question at hand.  Developing meaningful and useful measures from existing data is a major challenge in many research projects.  In computation fields, these measures are often called features.

Finally, with the datasets linked and required measures developed, the analytic dataset is ready for analysis.  Common analysis methods include traditional hypothesis driven research as well more inductive approaches such as [[data science]] and [[predictive analytics]].

=== Relation to other fields ===
[[Computational social science]] refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the social sciences. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena. Fields include [[computational economics]] and [[computational sociology]].  The seminal article on computational social science is by Lazer et al. 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Life in the network: the coming age of computational social science|journal = Science |date = 2009-02-06|issn = 0036-8075|pmc = 2745217|pmid = 19197046|pages = 721–723|volume = 323|issue = 5915|doi = 10.1126/science.1167742|first = David|last = Lazer|first2 = Alex (Sandy)|last2 = Pentland|first3 = Lada|last3 = Adamic|first4 = Sinan|last4 = Aral|first5 = Albert Laszlo|last5 = Barabasi|first6 = Devon|last6 = Brewer|first7 = Nicholas|last7 = Christakis|first8 = Noshir|last8 = Contractor|first9 = James|last9 = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was a summary of a workshop held at Harvard with the same title.  However, the article does not define the term computational social science precisely.

In general, computational social science is a broader field and encompasses population informatics.  Besides population informatics, it also includes complex [[simulation]]s of social phenomena.  Often complex simulation models use results from population informatics to configure with real world parameters.

Data Science for Social Good (DSSG) is another similar field coming about.  But again, DSSG is a bigger field applying data science to any social problem that includes study of human populations but also many problems that do not use any data about people.

Population reconstruction is the multi-disciplinary field to reconstruct specific (historical) populations by linking data from diverse sources, leading to rich novel resources for study by social scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Population Reconstruction - Springer|url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|doi = 10.1007/978-3-319-19884-2|last = Bloothooft|first = G.|last2 = Christen|first2 = P.|last3 = Mandemakers|first3 = K.|last4 = Schraagen|first4 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related groups and workshops ===
The first [https://dmm.anu.edu.au/popinfo2015/ Workshop on Population Informatics for Big Data] was held at the ACM SIGKDD conference in Sydney, Australia, in 2015. The workshop brought together computer science researchers, as well as public health practitioners and researchers.  This Wikipedia page started at the workshop.

The [http://www.ipdln.org/ International Population Data Linkage Network (IPDLN)] facilitates communication between centres that specialize in data linkage and users of the linked data. The producers and users alike are committed to the systematic application of data linkage to produce community benefit in the population and health-related domains.

=== Challenges ===
Three major challenges specific to population informatics are: 
# Preserving privacy of the subjects of the data – due to increasing concerns of privacy and confidentiality sharing or exchanging sensitive data about the subjects across different organizations is often not allowed. Therefore, population informatics need to be applied on encrypted data or in a privacy-preserving setting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dinusha Vatsalan, Peter Christen, and Vassilios S. Verykios.

# Scalability – databases are continuously growing in size which makes population informatics computationally expensive in terms of the size and number of data sources.&lt;ref&gt;Thilina Ranbaduge, Dinusha Vatsalan, and Peter Christen.

[[File:Material on conveyor during commissioning (7548464136).jpg|thumb|Commissioning of a conveyor where equipment is being tested to its maximum rating and capacity of operation.]]

'''Project commissioning''' is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a [[building]] or [[industrial plant]] are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client. A commissioning process may be applied not only to new [[project]]s but also to existing units and systems subject to expansion, [[renovation]] or [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|revamping]].&lt;ref&gt; HORSLEY, D. Process Plant Commissioning, a User Guide, Institution of Chemical Engineering, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; FARES, F., MONTENEGRO, B., PRATES, A., ''Commissioning of Oil &amp; Gas Projects – Current Status, Evolution and Trends''. in: Rio Oil &amp; Gas 2010, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, set 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the commissioning process comprises the integrated application of a set of [[engineering]] techniques and procedures to check, inspect and test every operational component of the project, from individual functions, such as [[measurement instrument|instrument]]s and equipment, up to complex amalgamations such as [[Modular design|module]]s, [[subsystem]]s and [[system]]s.

Commissioning activities, in the broader sense, are applicable to all phases of the project, from the basic and detailed [[design]], [[procurement]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing|assembly]], until the final handover of the unit to the owner, including sometimes an [[assisted operation]] phase.

== Independent discipline ==
Commissioning of large civil and industrial projects is a complex and sophisticated technical specialty which may be considered as a specific and independent  [[:Category:Engineering disciplines|engineering discipline]]. As such, it can be as important as the more traditional ones, i.e. [[civil engineering|civil]], [[naval architecture|naval]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[instrumentation]], [[automation]], or [[telecommunications engineering|telecom]] engineering. Large projects for which this statement can be made include chemical and petrochemical [[plants]], [[oil platform|oil and gas platforms]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], metallurgical plants, paper and cellulose plants, coal handling plants, thermoelectric and hydroelectric plants, buildings, bridges, highways, and railroads.

However, there is currently no formal education or university degree which addresses the training or certification of a "Project Commissioning Engineer". Various short training courses and on-line training are available, but they are designed for qualified engineers. Commissioning for buildings is a specific discipline in itself, and there are qualifications available for this.

The International Association of Commissioning Engineers (IACE) was formed in 2015 by a group of Commissioning Professionals, and launched in January 2016. IACE is preparing accredited qualifications to fill the gap in the academic landscape for Commissioning Engineers.

== Objective and impact  ==

The main objective of commissioning is to affect the safe and orderly [[handover]] of the unit from the constructor to the owner, guaranteeing its [[operability]] in terms of [[performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], safety and information [[traceability]]. Additionally, when executed in a planned and effective way, commissioning normally represents an essential factor for the fulfillment of schedule, costs, safety and quality requirements of the project. &lt;ref&gt; BENDIKSEN, T., YOUNG, G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNOPuByI6eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Projects: The Manager's Handbook], AuthorHouse Publishers, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissioning management systems  ==

For complex projects, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, together with the need to guarantee adequate information traceability, normally leads to the use of powerful [[Information technology|IT]] tools, known as [[commissioning management systems]], to allow effective planning and monitoring of the commissioning activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12707">'''Public comment''' (or "'''''[[vox populi]]'''''") is a public meeting of government bodies which set aside time for public comments, usually upon documents. Such documents may either be reports such as Draft Environmental Impact Reports (DEIR's) or new regulations. There is typically a notice which is posted on the web and mailed to lists of interested parties known to the government agencies. If there is to be a change of regulations, there will be a formal [[notice of proposed rulemaking]].

The basis for public comment is found in general political theory of constitutional democracy as originated during and after the French Enlightenment, particularly by Rousseau.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Jaques Rousseau, The Social Contract, late 1700s, Public Domain&lt;/ref&gt; This basis was elaborated in the American Revolution, and various thinkers such as Franklin, Jefferson &lt;ref&gt;Declaration of Independence, Jefferson et al, 1776&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Paine &lt;ref&gt;Common Sense, Thomas Paine, late 1700s, public domain.&lt;/ref&gt; are associated with the rejection of tyrannical, closed government decision making in favor of open government. The tradition of the New England Town Hall is believed to be rooted in this early American movement, and the distillation of formal public comment in official proceedings is a direct application of this format in the workings of public administration itself.

==Overview: The Two Types of Public Comment==
Public comment embedded in actual meetings is typical of meetings convened by legislative or executive bodies; judicial units do not have public comment, but rather testimony from witnesses and procedural statements from attorneys. Public units such as city councils or county legislative bodies are typical examples of legislative public comment hearing bodies. Note that comment may be written, oral, or electronic.

There are two types of comment period. One is when comment goes to a specific agenda item. Secondly there is a class of public comment which pertains to items which are not on the agenda for that day. However, it is necessary that comments be restricted to matters within the jurisdiction of the government body.

This latter requirement is seldom enforced except in those unusual cases in which commentators have set themselves at odds with policy makers and have been designated as a nuisance. In such cases, there are usually more explicit reasons given for restricting the rights of such speakers, however most undesirable comments tend to be outside the scope of legislative jurisdiction. The above distinction between agenda-item public comment and what is called "General Public Comment" pertains both to legislative type bodies as well as executive agencies. These are typically commissions, committees or boards. There are typically public comment periods during meetings of agencies such as city councils, county boards, and agencies which are concerned with matters such as water quality, fish and game, sewer runoff management and transportation. Time limits frequently range from one to five minutes for unscheduled presentations. It is not typical to require that the person commenting be a resident, a registered voter, a qualified elector, or even a citizen, simply that they be present and able to speak.

A whole different class of public comment is requested by agencies which are seeking input on draft policy documents such as Environmental Impact Reports which provide information which may be used in policy determinations by their own agency and other agencies at various levels of government.Typically there is a notice of completion of the draft which is posted in the newspaper, on the web, and is mailed to known interested parties who may be designated as "stakeholders" or simply "interested parties". A public comment period is established and comments which are received by the cutoff date become part of the official public record. In some cases, there is a statutory mandate that those comments be replied to or incorporated in some fashion into the Final document.

==Oral public comment at public meetings==
Comments provided at public meetings may be oral or written and not infrequently utilize audio visual aids such as thumbdrives, CD's or overhead projectors (transparencies or opaque material). They may include video clips. A laser pointer, such as used by professional presenters, is useful but seldom utilized except by scheduled presenters on preset agendas, who are often credentialed professionals hired by the government agency to produce reports or provide consultation.

Public comment in some cases includes remarks from experts or public officials with some role in the issue at stake, but at a different time or level of process. Typically these kinds of comments may be ad hoc, not solicited by the governing agency which is conducting the hearing. There may be informal expectation that such a party may comment, but if it is an interested agency then there will be prior notification and a larger chunk of time may be allowed to such presenters. Surprisingly, however, these knowledgeable high level speakers, including office holders, often are limited to the same time constriction and queing requirements as all other public commentors. They simply wait in line, their name is called when their speaker slip happens to come to the top of the pile, and they are subject to being cut off after their two minutes or three minutes are up.This equalization between expert and lay commentator is an example of social leveling which occurs in democratic process and which is often harshly criticized by elitist theorists such as Machiavellians, fascists, communist technocrats and other conservative social thinkers.

Persons preparing public comment often think about and express the value of the constitutional protection and a certain level of gratitude for the opportunity to speak. Such expressions are considered good etiquette the first few times a speaker presents to a board, and it is also common to state one's background, credentials, or interest. Persons who speak frequently to a particular agency become better known and typically refrain from repeating such formalities to excess, and may go directly into their substantive testimony.

==Variation of official attitude toward public meeting comment==
In constitutional democracies which permit public comment, meeting facilitators can be relaxed, friendly and informal, allowing for errors on the part of public speakers such as exceeding allowable time. In some cases they are strict in enforcement of rules and may make somewhat hostile remarks to speakers. This attitude may be a result of prior episodes in which public commenters may have expressed accusations or hostility to seated officials. Frequently, such remarks result in warnings and may escalate to the point that the meeting chair may not recognize the public speaker and refuse to allow access to the microphone. Less frequently, speakers who are out of order are ordered to leave, escorted out of the building, or, rarely, placed under arrest for trespass or other charges. However, most government agencies in the United States are reluctant to resort to such measures, which may be viewed as restricting free speech protection of the US and various state constitutions. They may also result in litigation and in some cases do. For instance, Robert Norse filed suit against the City of Santa Cruz when he made a Nazi style straight arm salute to the Santa Cruz City Council as a protest for council not permitting one additional public speaker who had not put in a speaker's slip and would have exceeded the amount of time allowed for public comment. The suit, typical of a possible consequence of not permitting public comment, is based upon Title 42 Section 1983 of the US Code, and alleges that city council violated his First Amendment right to free speech by having him arrested for refusing to leave as ordered in response to his gesture.&lt;ref&gt;Norse vs. City of Santa Cruz, US District Court, North Central District, Public Record&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states and regions may differ widely in their policies and procedures with regard to public comment, ranging from the extremes of anarchist collectives in twentieth century Spain, in which many routine decisions were made by workers councils, to dictatorships in which making a comment on the performance of government officials can be proscribed by law as tantamount to slander or provoking insurrection. In such systems, even the very idea of exposure to risk of prosecution deters the flow of information needed for the system's self rationalization process, resulting in stifled innovation, accumulated inefficiencies, declline of group morale and trust levels, with  eventual system collapse.

Liberalized systems also typically proscribe slander, fabrications and personal attacks, however defined, and public commenters are discouraged from engaging in back and forth discussion with board or committee members. Comments which are directed from the floor towards persons who have the floor are generally classified as heckling.

==Public comment in authoritarian systems==
Authoritarian systems generally tend to take a dim view of public comment. In the writings of Benito Mussolini, he expressed the view that fascism offers "free" speech, but only to persons who were "qualified" to have an opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Readings on Fascism and National Socialism
Selected by members of the department of philosophy, University of Colorado Contents. The Doctrine of Fascism by Benito Mussolini&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the historical development of Nazism, public commentators at official [[NSDAP]] rallies were not infrequently beaten by the mob, or, if there were large numbers supporting the adverse commentator, brawls broke out.&lt;ref&gt;"Goebbels" by Ralf Georg Reuth&lt;/ref&gt; today's People's Republic of China, public comment on government policy is considered inappropriate, and may result in long prison terms for persons such as [[Wei Jingsheng]].

==Public comment as an aid to editing of government publications==
As indicated above, there is a separate and distinct form of public comment, in the US, does not occur at meetings but is solicited in written or electronic form prior to a set deadline. This type of comment may pertain to an intended action, such as permit issuance, or the classification of a particular species of plant or animal as endangered. Other instances occur with regard to publication of draft environmental impact reports, which comments are then answered and may be reflected in subsequent revisions to the document. These public comments are often posted on the web in advance of the deadline, which provides commentators with an opportunity to view the remarks of others before committing themselves in writing.

This type of comment process may be mandated in legislation or in regulations enforcing statutes such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or California's Cxxxx Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Triggering events may include development proposals, mandated master plan updates or discovery of an endangered species. The NIH requested and received massive public comment pertaining to its own openness to its generally sophisticated public, and they did a thorough job of analyzing the voluminous submissions which is posted on their website.&lt;ref&gt;http://publicaccess.nih.gov/analysis_of_comments_nih_public_access_policy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A government portal which may be useful allows review of comments and opportunity for making comment and can be searched by keyword.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.regulations.gov/#!home&lt;/ref&gt;
The keyword search crosses different government agencies and has drop-downs permitting a boolean exclusion algorithm narrowing the focus between alternative choices such as documents, rules, notice of proposed rule changes, etcetera.

Sarin is generally considered a [[weapon of mass destruction]]. Production and stockpiling of Sarin was outlawed as of April 1997 by the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]] of 1993, and it is classified as a [[List of Schedule 1 substances (CWC)|Schedule 1 substance]]. In June 1994, the UN Special Commission on Iraqi Disarmament reported that it had destroyed Iraq's stockpiles of Sarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |page= 36 |work= [[UN Chronicle]] |publication-date= September 1, 1994 |volume=31 |issue=3 |title= Nearly half a million litres of chemical warfare agents destroyed in two-year operation. |quote= The two-year operation managed to destroy ... the nerve agents Sarin and Tabun ....

== Health effects ==
[[File:Sarin Biological effects.svg|thumbnail|150px|Sarin (red), acetylcholinesterase (yellow), acetylcholine (blue)]]
Like some other nerve agents that affect the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, Sarin attacks the [[nervous system]] by interfering with the degradation of the neurotransmitter [[acetylcholine]] at neuromuscular junctions. Death will usually occur as a result of [[asphyxia]] due to the inability to control the muscles involved in breathing.

Initial symptoms following exposure to Sarin are a runny nose, tightness in the chest and constriction of the [[pupil]]s. Soon after, the person will have difficulty breathing and they will experience [[nausea]] and drooling. As they continue to lose control of bodily functions, they may vomit, defecate and urinate. This phase is followed by [[Muscle contraction|twitching]] and jerking. Ultimately, the person becomes comatose and suffocates in a series of convulsive [[spasm]]s. Moreover, common mnemonics for the symptomatology of organophosphate poisoning, including Sarin gas, are the "killer B's" of [[bronchorrhea]] and [[bronchospasm]] because they are the leading cause of death,&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Leon. [http://journals.lww.com/em-news/Fulltext/2005/07000/Nerve_Agents__Three_Mechanisms,_Three_Antidotes.11.aspx Nerve Agents: Three Mechanisms, Three Antidotes. Emergency Medicine News. 27(7):12, July 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SLUDGE syndrome|SLUDGE]] – salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal distress, and emesis (vomiting). Death may follow in 1 to 10 minutes after direct inhalation.

Sarin has a high [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatility]] (ease with which a liquid can turn into a gas) relative to similar nerve agents, therefore inhalation can be very dangerous and even vapor concentrations may immediately penetrate the skin. A person’s clothing can release sarin for about 30 minutes after it has come in contact with sarin gas, which can lead to exposure of other people.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sarin|url= https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/sarin/basics/facts.asp | publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] | date = November 18, 2015 | access-date = April 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management===
Treatment measures have been described.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Treatment is typically with the [[antidote]]s, [[atropine]] and [[pralidoxime]].&lt;ref name=niosh /&gt; [[Atropine]], an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] to [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, is given to treat the physiological symptoms of poisoning. Since muscular response to acetylcholine is mediated through [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]]s, atropine does not counteract the muscular symptoms. Pralidoxime can regenerate [[cholinesterase]]s if administered within approximately five hours. [[Biperiden]], a synthetic acetylcholine antagonist, has been suggested as an alternative to atropine due to its better [[blood–brain barrier]] penetration and higher efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shim|first=TM|author2=McDonough JH |title=Efficacy of biperiden and atropine as anticonvulsant treatment for organophosphorus nerve agent intoxication|journal=Archives of Toxicology|date=May 2000|volume=74|issue=3|pages=165–172|doi=10.1007/s002040050670|pmid=10877003|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA385192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism of action===
Specifically, Sarin is a potent [[acetylcholinesterase inhibitor|inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors =Abu-Qare AW, Abou-Donia MB |title=Sarin: health effects, metabolism, and methods of analysis |journal=[[Food Chem. Toxicol.]] |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=1327–33 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12387297 |doi=10.1016/S0278-6915(02)00079-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an enzyme that degrades the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]] after it is released into the [[synaptic cleft]].  In vertebrates, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter used at the [[neuromuscular junction]], where signals are transmitted between neurons from the central nervous systems to muscle fibres.  Normally, acetylcholine is released from the neuron to stimulate the muscle, after which it is degraded by acetylcholinesterase, allowing the muscle to relax.  A build-up of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, due to the inhibition of cholinesterase, means the neurotransmitter continues to act on the muscle fibre, so that any nerve impulses are effectively continually transmitted.

Sarin acts on cholinesterase by forming a [[covalent bond]] with the particular [[serine]] residue at the active site. Fluoride is the [[leaving group]], and the resulting [[phosphoester]] is robust and biologically inactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Millard CB, Kryger G, Ordentlich A, etal |title=Crystal structures of aged phosphonylated acetylcholinesterase: nerve agent reaction products at the atomic level |journal=Biochemistry |volume=38 |issue=22 |pages=7032–9 |date=June 1999 |pmid=10353814 |doi=10.1021/bi982678l |url=}}. See {{Proteopedia|1cfj}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hörnberg | first1 = Andreas | last2 = Tunemalm | first2 = Anna-Karin | last3 = Ekström | first3 = Fredrik | title = Crystal Structures of Acetylcholinesterase in Complex with Organophosphorus Compounds Suggest that the Acyl Pocket Modulates the Aging Reaction by Precluding the Formation of the Trigonal Bipyramidal Transition State†,‡ | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 46 | issue = 16 | pages = 4815–4825 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17402711 | doi = 10.1021/bi0621361 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its mechanism of action resembles that of some commonly used insecticides, such as [[malathion]]. In terms of biological activity, it resembles [[carbamate]] insecticides, such as [[Carbaryl|Sevin]], and the medicines [[pyridostigmine]], [[neostigmine]], and [[physostigmine]].

=== Diagnostic tests ===
Controlled studies in healthy men have shown that a nontoxic 0.43&amp;nbsp;mg oral dose administered in several portions over a 3-day interval caused average maximum depressions of 22 and 30%, respectively, in plasma and erythrocyte cholinesterase levels. A single acute 0.5&amp;nbsp;mg dose caused mild symptoms of intoxication and an average reduction of 38% in both measures of cholinesterase activity. Sarin in blood is rapidly degraded either ''in vivo'' or ''in vitro''. Its primary inactive metabolites have ''in vivo'' serum half-lives of approximately 24 hours. The serum level of unbound [[isopropylmethylphosphonic acid]] (IMPA), a Sarin hydrolysis product, ranged from 2-135&amp;nbsp;µg/L in survivors of a terrorist attack during the first 4 hours post-exposure. Sarin or its metabolites may be determined in blood or urine by gas or liquid chromatography, while cholinesterase activity is usually measured by enzymatic methods.&lt;ref&gt;R. Baselt, ''Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man'', 11th edition, Biomedical Publications, Seal Beach, CA, 2017, pp. 1926-1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

A newer method called "fluoride regeneration" or "fluoride reactivation" detects the presence of nerve agents for a longer period after exposure than the methods described above. Fluoride reactivation is a technique that has been explored since at least the early 2000s. This technique obviates some of the deficiencies of older procedures. Sarin not only reacts with the water in the blood plasma through hydrolysis (forming so-called ‘free metabolites’), but also reacts with various proteins to form ‘protein adducts’. These protein adducts are not so easily removed from the body, and remain for a longer period of time than the free metabolites. One clear advantage of this process is that the period, post-exposure, for determination of Sarin exposure is much longer, possibly 5 to 8 weeks according to at least one study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a484093.pdf|title = Fluoride ion regeneration of sarin (GB) from minipig tissue and fluids following whole-body gb vapor exposure|date = July 2003|accessdate = |website = |publisher = United States Army|last = Jakubowski et. al.|first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/5/364.full.pdf|title = Improvements of the Fluoride Reactivation Method for the Verification of Nerve Agent Exposure|last = Degenhardt, et. al.|first = |date = July 2004|journal = Journal of Analytical Toxicology|doi = 10.1093/jat/28.5.364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a nerve gas, Sarin in its purest form is estimated to be 26 times more deadly than [[cyanide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarin gas as chemical agent – ThinkQuest- Library |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/27393/dreamwvr/agents/sarin1.htm |accessdate=August 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808094319/http://library.thinkquest.org/27393/dreamwvr/agents/sarin1.htm |archivedate=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[LD50|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of subcutaneously injected Sarin in mice is 172 μg/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inns|first=RH|author2=NJ Tuckwell |author3=JE Bright |author4=TC Marrs |title=Histochemical Demonstration of Calcium Accumulation in Muscle Fibres after Experimental Organophosphate Poisoning|journal=Hum Exp Toxicol|date=July 1990|volume=9|issue=4|pages=245–250|doi=10.1177/096032719000900407|pmid=2390321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarin is highly toxic, whether by contact with the skin or breathed in. The toxicity of Sarin in humans is largely based on calculations from studies with animals. The lethal concentration of Sarin in air is approximately 35&amp;nbsp;mg per cubic meter per minute for a two-minute exposure time by a healthy adult breathing normally (exchanging 15 liters of air per minute). This number represents the estimated lethal concentration for 50% of exposed victims, the [[LCt50]] value.  There are many ways to make relative comparisons between toxic substances.  The list below compares some current and historic chemical warfare agents with Sarin, with a direct comparison to the respiratory Lct50:

== Production and structure ==
Sarin  is a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] molecule because it has four chemically distinct [[substituents]] attached to the [[Tetrahedral molecular geometry|tetrahedral]] phosphorus center.&lt;ref&gt;D.

At high [[pH]], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.

It is usually manufactured and weaponized as a [[racemic]] mixture—an equal mixture of both enantiomeric forms, as this is a simpler process and provides an adequate weapon.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

A number of production pathways can be used to create Sarin. The final reaction typically involves attachment of the isopropoxy group to the phosphorus with an [[alcoholysis]] with [[isopropyl alcohol]]. Two variants of this process are common. One is the reaction of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] with isopropyl alcohol, which produces [[hydrofluoric acid]] as a byproduct:

:[[File:Sarin synth with racemic stereochemistry.png|415px]]

The second process, uses equal quantities of [[methylphosphonyl difluoride]] and [[Methylphosphonic acid dichloride|methylphosphonic dichloride]], a mixture "Di-Di" in this process, rather than just the difluoride.  This reaction also gives Sarin, but [[hydrochloric acid]] as a byproduct instead. The Di-Di process was used by the United States for the production of its unitary sarin stockpile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/mctl98-2/p2sec04.pdf|title = Chemical Weapons Technology|date = 1998|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |author = Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scheme below describes an example of Di-Di process. The selection of reagents is arbitrary and reaction conditions and product yield depend on the selected reagents. Inert atmosphere and anhydrous conditions are used for synthesis of sarin and other organophosphates.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
[[File:Sarin-di-di-process-by-AHRLS-2011.png|500x500px|An example of "di-di" process using arbitrary reagents.|center|frameless]]

As both reactions leave considerable acid in the product, bulk sarin produced without further treatment has a very poor shelf life and would be rather destructive to containers or weapon systems. Various methods have been tried to resolve these problems. In addition to industrial [[refining]] techniques to purify the chemical itself, various additives have been tried to combat the effects of the acid, such as:
* [[Tributylamine]] was added to US sarin produced at [[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.wood.army.mil/chmdsd/images/pdfs/Jan-June%202006/Kirby-Nerve%20Gas.pdf|title = Nerve Gas: America's Fifteen Year Struggle for Modern Chemical weapons|last = Kirby|first = Reid|date = January 2006|journal = [[Army Chemical Review]]|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Isopropylamine]] was included as part of the [[M687]] 155&amp;nbsp;mm field artillery shell, which was a [[Binary chemical weapon|binary]] sarin weapon system developed by the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Michael Hedges |publication-date= May 18, 2004|title= Shell said to contain sarin poses questions for U.S. |work= [[Houston Chronicle]] |page=A1 |url=http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Artillery-shell-with-sarin-poses-dilemma-for-U-S-1974450.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012210347/http://www.chron.com/news/nation-world/article/Artillery-shell-with-sarin-poses-dilemma-for-U-S-1974450.php |archivedate=2015-10-12 |accessdate=December 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another byproduct of these two chemical processes is [[diisopropyl methylphosphonate]], formed when a second isopropyl alcohol reacts with the Sarin itself. This chemical degrades into [[isopropyl methylphosphonic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] |url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=967&amp;tid=203 |title=Toxic Substances Portal – Diisopropyl Methylphosphonate (DIMP)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation and shelf life ==
[[File:Sarin test rabbit.jpg|thumb|upright|Rabbit used to check for leaks at former Sarin production plant ([[Rocky Mountain Arsenal]]), 1970]]

The most important chemical reactions of phosphoryl halides is the [[hydrolysis]] of the bond between phosphorus and the fluoride. This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and [[hydroxide]]. At high [[pH]], sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic [[phosphonic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opcw.org/about-chemical-weapons/types-of-chemical-agent/nerve-agents/|title=Nerve agents|publisher=OPCW}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft1st|page=317}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial breakdown of sarin is into isopropyl methylphosphonic acid (IMPA), a chemical that is not commonly found in nature except as a breakdown product of sarin (this is useful for detecting the recent deployment of sarin as a weapon). IMPA then degrades into methylphosphonic acid (MPA), which can also be produced by other organophosphates.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Sample, ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 17, 2013, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/17/sarin-deadly-history-nerve-agent-syria-un Sarin: the deadly history of the nerve agent used in Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarin with residual acid degrades after a period of several weeks to several months. The shelf life can be shortened by impurities in [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor materials]]. According to the [[CIA]], some Iraqi sarin had a shelf life of only a few weeks, owing mostly to impure precursors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|date=July 15, 1996|url=https://fas.org/irp/gulf/cia/960715/72569.htm|title=Stability of Iraq's Chemical Weapon Stockpile|accessdate=August 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with nerve agents such as [[Tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]] and [[VX (nerve agent)|VX]], sarin can have a short shelf life. Therefore, it is usually stored as two separate precursors that produce sarin when combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/sarin-nerve-agent.html | title = Key Points on Sarin: The ‘Most Volatile’ of Nerve Agents | author = Russell Goldmanpril | date = April 6, 2017 | publisher = ''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sarin's shelf life can be extended by increasing the purity of the precursor and intermediates and incorporating [[Stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizers]] such as [[tributylamine]]. In some formulations, tributylamine is replaced by [[diisopropylcarbodiimide]] (DIC), allowing sarin to be stored in [[aluminium]] casings. In [[binary chemical weapon]]s, the two precursors are stored separately in the same [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] and mixed to form the agent immediately before or when the shell is in flight. This approach has the dual benefit of solving the stability issue and increasing the safety of Sarin munitions.

== History ==

Sarin was discovered in 1938 in [[Wuppertal]]-Elberfeld in Germany by scientists at [[IG Farben]] who were attempting to create stronger pesticides; it is the most toxic of the four [[Nerve agent#G-Series|G-Series nerve agents]] made by Germany. The compound, which followed the discovery of the [[nerve agent]] [[tabun (nerve agent)|Tabun]], was named in honor of its discoverers: [[Gerhard Schrader|'''S'''chrader]], [[Otto Ambros|'''A'''mbros]], Gerhard '''R'''itter, and von der L'''in'''de.&lt;ref name="Evans2008"&gt;{{cite book

=== Use as a weapon ===

In mid-1939, the formula for the agent was passed to the [[chemical warfare]] section of the [[German Army Weapons Office]], which ordered that it be brought into mass production for wartime use. Pilot plants were built, and a high-production facility was under construction (but was not finished) by the end of [[World War II]]. Estimates for total Sarin production by Nazi Germany range from 500&amp;nbsp;kg to 10&amp;nbsp;tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Shallow reading''' refers to social practices in which people acquire information or entertainment quickly from texts, images or other meaningful forms, individual or combination, by using various modern media. Shallow reading as a representational form of [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] [[Media culture|mass culture]] reflects a transition of expense principle tendency from [[print culture]] towards [[visual culture]].

== Background ==
With the continuous update of advanced media technology and popularization of [[Internet]], people are stepping into mobile Internet era shifting. In this process, an obvious change is that traditional reading mode is gradually shifting to shallow reading. The prevalence of shallow reading has attracted attention of media, publishing and library fields.

== Features ==
'''1. Superficial'''

In order to enable people obtain useful information during the process of quick browsing, the target materials of shallow reading are usually very clear and easy to understand as well as with clear-cut topics.

'''2. Visual'''

Objectives of shallow reading are often short texts with illustrations and pictures even images and/or video without text captions.

'''3. Recreational'''

For deep readers, traditional reading is a process of thinking training and a cultivation of aesthetic culture while Shallow reading gets rid of the seriousness of deep reading and mainly aim at facilitating readers acquire information and entertainment in a relaxing and interactive atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">A '''tidal shock''' occurs when a [[star cluster]] or other distributed [[astronomical object]] passes by a large mass
such as an [[interstellar cloud]], resulting in [[gravitational perturbation]] on a time scale that is much less than the mean time for a star to complete an orbit within the cluster. The [[tidal force]] from this event can increase the dynamic energy of the cluster, in effect heating it up. This causes the cluster to expand and shed some of the outer stars.&lt;ref name=aj176_L51/&gt;

Tidal shocks occur, for example, when a [[globular cluster]] passes through the galactic plane or near the core of the [[Milky Way]]. These events are an important factor during the early evolution of a globular cluster. They work to truncate the outer part of clusters, thereby limiting the impact of future tidal shocks.&lt;ref name=lee2001/&gt; Streams of stars shed from a globular cluster as a result of tidal shock can form what are termed [[tidal tail]]s. These are extended streams of stars that lead away from the cluster.&lt;ref name=raa9_10_1131/&gt; Such streams can be used to trace the orbital path of the cluster.&lt;ref name=jkas35_2_75/&gt;

This '''timeline of the evolutionary history of life''' represents the current [[scientific theory]] outlining the major events during the development of [[life]] on planet [[Earth]]. In [[biology]], [[evolution]] is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of [[biological organization]], from [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] to [[species]], and individual [[organism]]s and [[molecule]]s, such as [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a [[common descent|common ancestor]] from which all known species, living and [[Extinction|extinct]], have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{harvnb|McKinney|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 110]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

While the dates given in this article are estimates based on [[scientific evidence]], there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased [[biodiversity]] through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], there was great diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.wvu.edu/~kgarbutt/EvolutionPage/Studentsites/Burgesspages/models_of_evolution.html |title=The Burgess Shale &amp; Models of Evolution |last1=Hickman |first1=Crystal |last2=Starn |first2=Autumn |website=Reconstructions of the Burgess Shale and What They Mean... |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |location=Morgantown, WV |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|Briggs|Eisen|Goldstein|2007|loc=[http://www.evolution-textbook.org/content/free/figures/10_EVOW_Art/20_EVOW_CH10.pdf Figure 10.20]}} Four diagrams of evolutionary models&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extinction ==
{{Main|Extinction event}}
[[File:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|240px|Visual representation of the history of life on Earth as a spiral]]
Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a [[mass extinction]] in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/measuring-sixth-mass-extinction|title=Measuring the sixth mass extinction - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816103516/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |archive-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's [[obligate anaerobe]]s. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/big-five-extinctions|title=The big five mass extinctions - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* End of the [[Ordovician]]: 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including [[graptolite]]s
* Late [[Devonian]]: 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including most [[trilobite]]s
* End of the [[Permian]], "The Great Dying": 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including [[tabulate coral]]s, and most extant trees and [[synapsid]]s
* End of the [[Triassic]]: 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all of the [[conodont]]s
* End of the [[Cretaceous]]: 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all of the [[ammonite]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and nonavian [[dinosaur]]s

(Dates and percentages represent estimates.)

Smaller extinction-events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes, with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The [[Holocene extinction]] event is currently under way.&lt;ref name="pnas98_1"&gt;

Factors in mass extinctions include [[continental drift]], changes in atmospheric and marine [[chemistry]], [[volcanism]] and other aspects of [[mountain formation]], changes in [[glaciation]], changes in [[sea level]], and [[impact event]]s.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, literally the "period of well-displayed life," marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and/or trace-making organisms. It is subdivided into three eras, the [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], which are divided by major [[mass extinction]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19424">'''Cigarette smoke''' is an [[aerosol]] produced by the incomplete [[combustion]] of [[tobacco]] during the smoking of [[cigarettes]]. Temperatures in burning cigarettes range from about 400 ℃ between puffs to about 900 ℃ during a puff. During the burning of the cigarette tobacco (itself a complex mixture), thousands of [[chemical substances]] are generated by [[combustion]], [[distillation]], [[pyrolysis]] and [[pyrosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kapp"&gt;{{citation | author=Robert Kapp | contribution=Tobacco Smoke | title=Encyclopedia of Toxicology | edition=2nd | volume=4 | publisher=Elsevier | year=2005 | pages=200–202 | isbn=0-12-745354-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=Basic Principles of Cigarette Design and Function | author=Ken Podraza | publisher=Philip Morris USA | url=http://www.lsro.org/presentation_files/air/m_011029/podraza_102901.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tobacco smoke is used as a [[fumigant]] and [[inhalant]].

== Composition ==
The particles in tobacco smoke are liquid aerosol droplets (~ 20% water), with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) that is submicrometer (and thus, fairly "lung-respirable" by humans). The droplets are present in high concentrations (some estimates are as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; droplets per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Most cigarettes today contain a [[cigarette filter]], which can reduce "[[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]]" and [[nicotine]] smoke yields up to 50% by several different mechanisms, with an even greater removal rate for other classes of compounds (e.g., [[phenols]]).&lt;ref name="kapp" /&gt;

Tobacco smoke may be grouped into a particulate phase (trapped on a glass-fiber pad, and termed "TPM" (total particulate matter)) and a gas/vapor phase (which passes through such a glass-fiber pad). "Tar" is mathematically determined by subtracting the weight of the nicotine and water from the TPM. However, several components of tobacco smoke (e.g., [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[formaldehyde]], [[phenanthrene]], and [[pyrene]]) do not fit neatly into this rather arbitrary classification, because they are distributed among the solid, liquid and gaseous phases.&lt;ref name="kapp" /&gt;

Tobacco smoke contains a number of toxicologically significant chemicals and groups of chemicals, including [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]]s ([[benzopyrene]]), [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] ([[NNK]], [[N-Nitrosonornicotine|NNN]]), [[aldehyde]]s ([[acrolein]], [[formaldehyde]]), [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[nitrogen oxide]]s, [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[phenol]]s ([[phenol]], [[cresol]]), [[aromatic amine]]s ([[nicotine]], ABP ([[4-Aminobiphenyl]])), and [[harmala alkaloid|harmala alkaloids]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmala Alkaloid|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/harmala-alkaloid|website=Science Direct|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The radioactive element [[polonium-210]] is also known to occur in tobacco smoke.&lt;ref name="kapp" /&gt; The chemical composition of smoke depends on puff frequency, intensity, volume, and duration at different stages of cigarette consumption.&lt;ref name="health"&gt;{{citation | title=The Health Consequences of Smoking: The Changing Cigarette | page=49 | publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services | url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/NNBBSN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1933 and the late 1940s, the yields from an average cigarette varied from 33 to 49&amp;nbsp;mg "tar" and from &lt; 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, the average yield from cigarettes in Western Europe and the USA was around 16&amp;nbsp;mg tar and 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg nicotine per cigarette. Current average levels are lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=K. Rothwell | title=Health effects of interactions between tobacco use and exposure to other agents | series=[[Environmental Health Criteria]] | issue=211 | publisher=[[World Health Organization]] | year=1999 | url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc211.htm|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been achieved in a variety of ways including use of selected strains of tobacco plant, changes in agricultural and curing procedures, use of reconstituted sheets (reprocessed tobacco leaf wastes), incorporation of tobacco stalks, reduction of the amount of tobacco needed to fill a cigarette by expanding it (like [[puffed wheat]]) to increase its "filling power", and by the use of [[Cigarette filter|filters]] and high-porosity [[Cigarette paper|wrapping papers]].&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W. Cullen | editor3=Ellen R. Gritz | editor4=Thomas M. Vogt | editor5=Louis Jolyon West | title=Research on Smoking Behavior | author=Michael A. H.

In order to keep such products acceptable to the consumer, the manufacturers reconstitute aroma or flavor.&lt;ref name="health" /&gt;

Tobacco smoke, besides being an [[Irritation|irritant]] and significant [[indoor air pollution|indoor air pollutant]], is known to cause [[lung cancer]], [[heart disease]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[emphysema]], and other serious diseases in smokers (and, according to some, in non-smokers as well). The actual mechanisms by which smoking can cause so many diseases remain largely unknown. Many attempts have been made to produce lung cancer in animals exposed to tobacco smoke by the inhalation route, without success. It is only by collecting the "tar" and repeatedly painting this on to mice that tumors are produced, and these tumors are very different from those tumors exhibited by smokers.&lt;ref name="kapp" /&gt; Tobacco smoke is associated with an increased risk of developing respiratory conditions such as [[bronchitis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[asthma]]. Tobacco smoke aerosols generated at temperatures below 400 ℃ did not test positive in the [[Ames test|Ames assay]].&lt;ref name="a"&gt;{{citation | editor=Philip Wexler | author=C Lynn Humbertson | entry=Tobacco | title=Encyclopedia of Toxicology | edition=2nd | volume=4 | publisher=Elsevier | year=2005 | pages=197–200 | isbn=0-12-745354-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of all changes in cigarette design and manufacturing over the last 50 years, the use of filters and "light" cigarettes has neither decreased the nicotine intake per cigarette, nor has it lowered the incidence of lung cancers ([[National Cancer Institute|NCI]], 2001; IARC 83, 2004; U.S. Surgeon General, 2004).&lt;ref name="epidem"&gt;{{citation | editor1=Robert J. Mason | editor2=V. Courtney Broaddus | editor3=Thomas R. Martin | editor4=Talmadge E. King, Jr. | editor5=Dean E. Schraufnagel | editor6=John F. Murray | editor7=Jay A.

Samet | chapter=Epidemiology of Lung Cancer | volume=1 | edition=5th | year=2010 | publisher=Saunders | isbn=978-1-4160-4710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift over the years from higher- to lower-yield cigarettes may explain the change in the pathology of [[lung cancer]]. That is, the percentage of lung cancers that are [[adenocarcinoma]]s has increased, while the percentage of [[squamous cell cancer]]s has decreased. The change in tumor type is believed to reflect the higher [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines|nitrosamine]] delivery of lower-yield cigarettes and the increased depth or volume of inhalation of lower-yield cigarettes to compensate for lower level concentrations of nicotine in the smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Robert J. Mason | editor2=V. Courtney Broaddus | editor3=Thomas R. Martin | editor4=Talmadge E. King, Jr. | editor5=Dean E. Schraufnagel | editor6=John F. Murray | editor7=Jay A.

In the United States, lung cancer incidence and mortality rates are particularly high among African American men. Lung cancer tends to be most common in developed countries, particularly in North America and Europe, and less common in developing countries, particularly in Africa and South America.&lt;ref name="epidem" /&gt; Over 85% of all lung cancers are attributed to cigarette smoking; however, only a fraction of long-term cigarette smokers develop lung cancer. Cancer of the lung is occasionally observed among nonsmokers, indicating a genetic susceptibility in lung tumorigenesis. The incidence of lung cancer seems to have increased in dogs as well as in humans and cigarette smoking can hardly be incriminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W. Cullen | editor3=Ellen R. Gritz | editor4=Thomas M. Vogt | editor5=Louis Jolyon West | title=Research on Smoking Behavior | series=NIDA Research Monograph | volume=17 | year=1977 | author=Julien L. Van Lancker | contribution=Smoking and Disease | pages=230–280 | url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723034328/http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf | archivedate=2015-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobacco [[polyphenols]] (e. g., [[caffeic acid]], [[chlorogenic acid]], [[scopoletin]], [[rutin]]) determine the taste and quality of the smoke. Freshly cured tobacco leaf is unfit for use because of its pungent and irritating smoke. After [[fermentation]] and aging, the leaf delivers mild and aromatic smoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=T. C. Tso | contribution=Tobacco | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | pages=1–26 | doi=10.1002/14356007.a27_123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant smoke in general has a bacteriostatic effect and is one of the oldest methods of preserving meat (along with [[salt]]ing, adding sugar, and drying).

=== Nicotine hypothesis ===
According to the mainstream "nicotine hypothesis", nicotine is the main biochemical reason for tobacco smoking. Nicotine is similar to [[acetylcholine]], an important [[neurotransmitter]]. The uptake of nicotine may be facilitated by other chemicals present in tobacco smoke. However, the nicotine theory cannot explain the following contradictions:&lt;ref name="jarvik"&gt;{{citation | editor1=Murray E. Jarvik | editor2=Joseph W. Cullen | editor3=Ellen R. Gritz | editor4=Thomas M. Vogt | editor5=Louis Jolyon West | title=Research on Smoking Behavior | author=Murray E. Jarvik | contribution=Biological Factors Underlying the Smoking Habit | series=NIDA Research Monograph | issue=17 | year=1977 | pages=122–148 | url=http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723034328/http://archives.drugabuse.gov/pdf/monographs/17.pdf | archivedate=2015-07-23 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Nicotine alone does not seem capable of totally substituting for cigarette smoke.
* [[Lettuce cigarette]]s reinforced with nicotine were not accepted more readily than non-nicotine cigarettes (however, [[marijuana cigarette]]s are an exception).
* Nicotine given either by ingestion or intravenously was incapable of completely suppressing smoking in humans.
* Animals will not self-inject nicotine or do so only indifferently, whereas they will self-inject [[cocaine]] and [[amphetamine]] very readily.
* If nicotine were a reinforcer for smoking, smokers would not be expected to like low-nicotine cigarettes.

Other possibilities are various [[neurotransmitter]]-like [[psychoactive]] [[aromatic amine]]s ([[amphetamines]], [[indole]]-based [[synthetic cannabinoids]], [[ergine]]-type [[alkaloids]]), synthesized randomly by [[pyrolysis]] and [[pyrosynthesis]] during smoking and found in various plant smoke condensates. Nicotine itself may serve as a template for further psychoactive compounds.

Peak [[blood plasma|plasma]] levels of nicotine occur 2–10 min after smoking tobacco. Nicotine undergoes a large [[first-pass effect]] during which the liver metabolizes 80–90%. [[Protein binding]] ranges from 4.9% to 20%. The apparent [[volume of distribution]] varies between 1 and 3 l/kg. The metabolites include [[isomethylnicotinium]] ion, [[nornicotine]], [[cotinine]], and [[nicotine-1-N-oxide]]. Nicotine passes into [[breast milk]] in small quantities.&lt;ref name="a" /&gt; In addition to nicotine, tobacco smoke contains small amounts of the [[alkaloid]]s [[anatabine]], [[anabasine]], [[nornicotine]], [[N-methylanabasine]], [[anabaseine]], [[nicotine N'-oxide]], [[myosmine]], [[β-nicotyrine]], [[cotinine]], and [[2,3'-bipyridyl]].&lt;ref name="h"&gt;{{citation | title=How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease | chapter=Chemistry and Toxicology of Cigarette Smoke and Biomarkers of Exposure and Harm | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | year=2010 | pages=27–102 | isbn=978-0-16-084078-4 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53017/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK53017.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nicotine molecule contains two nitrogen atoms with basic properties. The nicotine molecule can thus add one proton to form a monoprotonated species or two protons to form the diprotonated species. Nicotine in tobacco smoke exists in either a [[protonation|protonated]] or unprotonated form, depending on the presence of natural acids and bases, the [[Cigarette tobacco|tobacco]] blend, [[Cigarette filter|tip]] ventilation, and the use of [[Cigarette additive|additives]]. Whereas protonated nicotine is positively charged and not volatile, unprotonated nicotine ("[[Free base|free-base]] nicotine") from tobacco smoke is volatile and readily passes into lipid [[cell membrane]]s. More unprotonated nicotine in a puff delivers more nicotine to the brain. The same holds true for other (tobacco and non-tobacco) alkaloids. The approximate dividing line between dominance by protonated forms or by the unprotonated form is a [[pH]] of 8. At pH 8, the two fractions are present in equal parts. At any lower pH, the fraction of protonated nicotine is greater.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

More unprotonated nicotine in tobacco smoke increases smoke "strength", "impact", or "kick". However, the irritation and harshness of smoke at higher pH makes it harder for smokers to inhale it. Cigarette design ensures that the smoke has enough unprotonated nicotine to rapidly transfer nicotine into the brain but not so much of it as to be too harsh for the smoker. Variability in the acid-base nature of tobacco leaf is considerable. Flue-cured ("bright") tobacco typically produces acidic smoke, whereas air-cured ("burley") tobacco typically produces basic smoke. The natural acids in tobacco smoke (e.g., [[formic acid]], [[acetic acid]], and [[propionic acid]]) can protonate nicotine, while the natural bases (e.g., [[ammonia]]) tend to neutralize the acids and keep more nicotine in the unprotonated form. Acidic tobacco additives such as [[levulinic acid]] are used as "smoothing" agents to reduce smoke harshness.&lt;ref name="h" /&gt;

'''Video self-modeling''' ('''VSM''') is a form of [[observational learning]] in which individuals observe themselves performing a [[behavior]] successfully on [[video]], and then [[Imitation|imitate]] the targeted behavior. VSM allows individuals to view themselves being successful, acting appropriately, or performing new tasks. [[Peter Dowrick]], a key researcher in the development of self-modeling, described two forms of VSM, ''feedforward'' and ''self-review''. ''Self-review'' involves someone with a relatively well developed skill watching examples of best performance.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"&gt;Dowrick, P. W. &amp; Biggs, J. (1983), Using Video: Psychological and social applications (1st ed.), New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the procedure used by [[Laura Wilkinson]], gold medal platform diver, prior to every meet. In an interview after her gold medal performance, she was asked how she prepares for competition.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;National Broadcasting Corporation (2000, September, 24). Laura Wilkinson gold medal interview - Sydney games. New York: NY.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she watches a video that consists of her best dives along with encouragement from family and coaches. Self-review is mainly used in sports training as a form of [[visual imaging]].&lt;ref name="Buggey"&gt;Buggey, T. (2009). Seeing is Believing: Self-modeling Applications with Children with Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. Baltimore; Woodbine House.&lt;/ref&gt; Feedforward, on the other hand, is used with people who do not have a skill or when a new skill is emerging. Thus, feedforward is the method most often used in instructional or clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Because Feedforward involves new skills or behaviors performed by the viewer, it usually requires some degree of [[video editing]] to make it appear that the viewer is performing in an advanced manner. The term feedforward can be contrasted with the more traditional term ''[[feedback]]'' as it relates to receiving information about performance. Feedback allows people to see how they are doing. Feedforward allows them to see how they could be performing; a [[future self]]. Feedforward is mainly used in [[education]] and [[therapy]] circles and mainly with children with [[disabilities]]. It has been found to be especially effective with children with [[autism]] who tend to be [[Visual learning|visual learners]] and who seem to attend better to monitors than to live models.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, M. L.  (1999). Autism: Clinical features and neurological observations. In [[Helen Tager-Flusberg]] (Ed.) Neurological Disorders (pp. 383-399). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Research across an array of behaviors and many types of disabilities has been ongoing since 1970 with very positive results. Researchers report that changes occur rapidly, there is good maintenance, and that changes [[Generalization|generalize]] across settings.&lt;ref name="Bellini"&gt;Bellini, S. &amp; Akullian, J., (2007). A [[meta-analysis]] of [[video modeling]] and video self-modeling interventions for children and adolescents with [[autism spectrum disorders]]. Exceptional Children, 73, 261-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption by educators and therapists has lagged behind the research possibly because of the technology requirements for editing videos. The advent of user-friendly editing software such as [[iMovie]] and [[Movie Maker]] has gone a long way in solving that problem. Another reason that the use of VSM seems to be gathering momentum is an article that appeared in 2007 by Scott Bellini and Jennifer Akulian.&lt;ref name="Bellini"/&gt;  These researchers conducted a meta-analyses of all forms of video modeling and concluded that both peer and self-modeling met the Council for Exceptional Children's requirements for research-based methods.
Self-modeling has several attributes that sets it apart as a good tool to use with children with disabilities. It uses only positive imagery which makes it fit well into most [[positive behavior support]] plans. Effects of VSM should be seen almost immediately. If change is not seen after two or three viewings, one can move quickly to an alternate intervention.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Finally, there appears to be no real down-side to the method. No damage is done if it does not work for an individual. As Buggey states in his book, the only tangible outcome when no results are seen is that the person ends up with a flattering video of him or herself.&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;
In his book, ''Seeing is Believing'', [[Tom Buggey]] lists three major ways video footage can be collected and compiled into a feedforward video:&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;

# '''Imitation''' – Particularly useful with [[language]] skills. Children are prompted to say words or phrases. Words can be new or rarely used and phrases and sentences can be longer or more complex than presently used. Individual words can even be extracted from videos using [[video editing software]] and joined into sentences.
# '''[[Role playing]]''' – Particularly useful for social skills. Children act out scenes of proper behavior that are usually challenging for them. For example, the triggers of [[tantrums]] can be determined and then each trigger can become a scene in the VSM video – with the person performing appropriate alternative behaviors rather than tantruming.
# '''Let the camera roll to capture rare behaviors''' – typically used with persons who cannot imitate or follow directions. This can be very time-consuming; however, it has been used effectively for eating problems. A child can be filmed during several lunch periods and best examples of appropriate eating (such as putting food to mouth) can be extracted and combined into a feedforward movie.

== Caveats ==
Although VSM has shown overwhelming success with a range of ages and types of disabilities it has had problematic results with children under 4 yrs&lt;ref name="Buggey, T. (In Press)"&gt;Buggey, T. (2016). Facilitating social initiations with young preschoolers with autism using self-modeling: A replication. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, E., Beck, D., Sloane, H., Goldsmith, D., Jenson, W., Bowen, J., Kehle, T. (1993). Self-Modeling with preschoolers. School Psychology International, 14, 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; and with persons with very severe [[cognitive disabilities]] (although it has been successful with children with severe autism).&lt;ref name="Hoomes"&gt;Buggey, T., Hoomes, G., Williams, S. &amp; Sherberger, B. (2010). Facilitating social initiations with preschoolers with autism using self-modeling. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt; Users must use caution to not depict behavior that is far beyond the viewer's ability. Showing skills beyond the reach of individuals can cause frustration and work counter to the purpose of VSM. Both [[Speech/language pathologist|speech/language]] and [[Physical therapy|physical]] or [[occupational therapist]]s need to be consulted when the skills needing to be addressed fall within their areas of expertise. (update: 2017. Studies with children under the age of 4 were restricted to the training of social skills. However, The Dept. of Education in Minnesota (MDOE) funded a training project for its Birth to 3 caregivers in 2013. Participants were trained in the use of VSM and were required to record and report results to a MDOE supervisor. Over 90 personnel were trained and 87 submitted results. All but 3 reported positive results. The skills addressed were mainly functional and language-based. Because none of these cases involved training social interaction skills, it was hypothesized that use of VSM with children under 4 [as young as 2 yrs. 1 mo.] was practical for certain behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, V. &amp; Buggey, T. (2014). The Minnesota Project: VSM use in Early Intervention. The Division of Early Childhood (CEC) Annual Conference. St. Louis, MO.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Users should also be aware of the differences between ''self-modeling'' and ''[[self-observation]]''. While self-modeling involves edited videos depicting only positive imagery, self-observation involves watching raw, unedited footage of behavior. The classic example of self-observation is watching game films in sports. Much can be gained by using self-observation; however, there is a risk that if behaviors viewed are too negative (e.g. a lineman missing blocking assignments 60% of the time) it could adversely affect [[self-confidence]], and thus the performance of the viewer. Buggey&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt; suggests that use of self-observation with children with disabilities should be used with extreme caution.

== Theory behind self-modeling ==

Many self-modeling researchers point to [[Albert Bandura]]'s studies&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;Bandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. In V. S. Ramachaudran (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 71-81). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  on [[Observational learning|social learning]] as key to the understanding of the effectiveness of VSM. Bandura made two fundamental findings that relate directly to self modeling. The first is that the best models are those as close to the viewer as possible in all attributes including ability. You cannot get closer than when the model and viewer are the same person with only a slight change in ability. The other finding involves [[self-efficacy]], the belief that one can succeed at a task. Bandura found that the higher the belief in success, the higher the success rate. Self-modeling allows children to see themselves succeeding, and increases self-efficacy (as long as the new behavior is attainable and developmentally appropriate).

One of the reasons VSM may work so well with social behaviors may have been uncovered by Thomas Kehle and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Theodore"&gt;Kehle, T. J., Bray, M. A., Margiano, S. G., Theodore, L. A., &amp; Zhou, Z. (2002). Self-modeling as an effective intervention for students with serious emotional disturbance: Are we modifying children's memories? Psychology in the Schools, 39, 203-207.&lt;/ref&gt; While working with children with [[emotional disorder]]s who had had VSM intervention, they noticed that clients had difficulty remembering negative behaviors during [[exit interview]]s. They hypothesized that these individual were not only getting new memories based on VSM experiences, but they were also supplanting memories of the old behaviors. Their hypothesis was substantiated in the 2002 study. Their findings are preliminary and there have not been any published [[replication (scientific method)|replication]]s, but if substantiated, it raises both interesting methodological and ethical issues.

== Possible applications ==
Any behavior that can be observed, and thus filmed, can be a subject of a self-modeling video. In their meta-analyes article, Bellini and Akulian identified behaviors that were addressed in studies they evaluated. These include:
# [[Cognitive skill]]s such as math computation
# [[Selective mutism]]
# Language skills
# [[Activities of daily living|Functional skill]]s such as making beds or getting dressed
# [[Motor skill|Physical skill]]s such as swimming or lifting legs when walking
# [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
# [[Stuttering]]
# [[Oral reading fluency]]
