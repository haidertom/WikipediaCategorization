      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6626">In [[mathematics]], '''abstract nonsense''', '''general abstract nonsense''', '''generalized abstract nonsense''', and '''general nonsense''' are terms used by [[mathematician]]s to describe abstract methods related to [[category theory]] and [[homological algebra]]. More generally, “abstract nonsense” may refer to a proof that relies on category-theoretic methods, or even to the study of category theory itself.

==Background==

Roughly speaking, category theory is the study of the general form, that is, categories of mathematical theories, without regard to their content.  As a result, [[mathematical proof]]s that rely on category-theoretic ideas often seem out of context, somewhat akin to a [[non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]].  Authors sometimes dub these proofs “abstract nonsense” as a light-hearted way of alerting readers to their abstract nature.  Labeling an argument "abstract nonsense" is usually ''not'' intended to be derogatory,&lt;ref name="monastyrsky"&gt;Michael Monastyrsky, ''Some Trends in Modern Mathematics and the Fields Medal.'' Can. Math. Soc. Notes, March and April 2001, Volume 33, nos. 2 and 3.  Online version available at http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/aboutus/FieldsMedal_Monastyrsky.pdf.
:"''In algebra, the term “abstract nonsense” has a definite meaning without any pejorative connotation.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mathworld" /&gt; and is instead used jokingly,&lt;ref name="maclane"/&gt; in a [[self-deprecating]] way,&lt;ref name="rotman"/&gt; affectionately,&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt; or even as a compliment to the generality of the argument.

Certain ideas and constructions in mathematics share a uniformity throughout many domains, unified by category theory. Typical methods include the use of [[classifying space]]s and [[universal property|universal properties]], use of the [[Yoneda lemma]], [[natural transformation]]s between [[functor]]s, and [[diagram chasing]].

When an audience can be assumed to be familiar with the general form of such arguments, mathematicians will use the expression ''Such and such is true by abstract nonsense'' rather than provide an elaborate explanation of particulars.&lt;ref name="mathworld"&gt;{{MathWorld| urlname=AbstractNonsense | title=Abstract Nonsense|author=Macura, Wiktor K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one might say ''By abstract nonsense, [[product (category theory)|products]] are unique up to isomorphism when they exist'', instead of arguing about how these isomorphisms can be derived from the [[universal property]] that defines the product. This allows one to skip proof details that can be considered trivial or not providing much insight, focusing instead on genuinely innovative parts of a larger proof.

==History==

The term predates the foundation of category theory as a subject itself. Referring to a joint paper with [[Samuel Eilenberg]] that introduced the notion of a "[[category (mathematics)|category]]" in 1942, [[Saunders Mac Lane]] wrote the subject was 'then called "general abstract nonsense"'.&lt;ref name="maclane"&gt;Saunders Mac Lane. "[http://www.pnas.org/content/94/12/5983.full The PNAS way back then]". ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA'' Vol. 94, pp.&amp;nbsp;5983–5985, June 1997.
:"''The first of these papers is a more striking case; it introduced the very abstract idea of a "category"—a subject then called "general abstract nonsense"!''"&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often used to describe the application of category theory and its techniques to less abstract domains.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040726025100/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jis/1999/lord.pdf An Application of Abstract Nonsense to Surface Area], Harriet Lord&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edsko.net/tcd/talks/cattheory.pdf Abstract Nonsense for Functional Programmers], Edsko de Vries&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is believed to have been coined by the mathematician [[Norman Steenrod]],&lt;ref&gt;Colin McLarty, ''The Uses and Abuses of the History of Topos Theory'', Br. J. Philos. Sci., 41 (1990) p 355.
: "''Steenrod jokingly tagged category theory 'abstract nonsense' and made it central to his axiomatics for homology''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rotman"&gt;Joseph Rotman, "''An Introduction to Homological Algebra'', by Charles A. Weibel" (book review), Bull. Am. Math. Soc., 33:4 (Oct. 1996) 473–476.
:"''The self-deprecating phrase ''general abstract nonsense'' (due to Steenrod) was promulgated by Eilenberg and Mac Lane, two of the major innovators of homological algebra, to highlight this aspect of the subject.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;[[Serge Lang]], "Algebra" Second Edition, Addison Wesley, 1984, p 175&lt;/ref&gt; himself one of the developers of the categorical point of view.

==Examples==

Consider the example of showing that a [[3-manifold]] ''M'' admits a [[map (mathematics)|map]] to the [[2-sphere]] that is non-trivial (i.e. non-homotopic to a constant map), when the 2nd [[Betti number]] of ''M'' is positive. This means the 2nd [[cohomology group]] has positive [[Rank of an abelian group|rank]] (by the  [[universal coefficient theorem for cohomology]]), so it has a non-zero element. The [[Cohomology#Eilenberg–MacLane spaces|properties of Eilenberg–MacLane space]]s then give a corresponding non-trivial map ''f'' from ''M'' to the infinite-dimensional [[complex projective space]] '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, since it is a [[K(Z,2)|''K''('''Z''',2)]] [[Eilenberg–MacLane space]]. The space '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt; can be realized as a [[CW complex]] with exactly one cell in each even dimension and no cells in odd dimension, while ''M'' can be realized with no cells in dimensions above 3, so by the [[cellular approximation theorem]] there is a map homotopic to ''f'' that maps ''M'' into the 3-skeleton of '''CP'''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the 2-sphere.

Though this proof establishes the truth of the statement in question, the proof technique has little to do with the [[topology]] or [[geometry]] of the 2-sphere, let alone 3-manifolds, as it relies on more general categorical principles.  Because of the reliance on these abstract principles, the result is independent of subtler geometric details, so offers little geometric insight into the nature of such a map.  On the other hand, the proof is surprisingly short and clean, and a “hands-on” approach involving the explicit construction of such a map would be potentially laborious.

'''Adaptive behavior''' refers to behavior that enables a person (usually used in the context of children) to get along in his or her environment with greatest success and least conflict with others.  This is a term used in the areas of psychology and special education.  Adaptive behavior relates to every day skills or tasks that the average person is able to complete, similar to the term [[life skills]].

Nonconstructive or disruptive social or personal behaviors can sometimes be used to achieve a constructive outcome. For example, a constant [[habit (psychology)|repetitive action]] could be re-focused on something that creates or builds something. In other words, the behavior can be adapted to something else.

In contrast, maladaptive behavior is a type of behavior that is often used to reduce one's anxiety, but the result is dysfunctional and non-productive. For example, avoiding situations because you have unrealistic fears may initially reduce your anxiety, but it is non-productive in alleviating the actual problem in the long term. Maladaptive behavior is frequently used as an indicator of [[abnormality (behavior)|abnormality]] or [[mental dysfunction]], since its assessment is relatively free from [[subjectivity]]. However, many behaviors considered [[morality|moral]] can be maladaptive, such as [[dissent]] or [[abstinence]].

Adaptive behavior reflects an individual’s social and practical competence to meet the demands of everyday living. Behavior patterns change throughout a person's development, across life settings and social constructs, changes in personal values, and the expectations of others. It is important to assess adaptive behavior in order to determine how well an individual functions in daily life: vocationally, socially and educationally.

==Examples==
*A child born with cerebral palsy will most likely have a form of [[hemiparesis]] or [[hemiplegia]] (the weakening, or loss of use, of one side of the body). In order to adapt to one's environment, the child may use these limbs as helpers, in some cases even adapt the use of their mouth and teeth as a tool used for more than just eating or conversation.
*Frustration from lack of the ability to verbalize one's own needs can lead to tantrums. In addition, it may lead to the use of signs or sign language to communicate one's desires. One subject that is pertinent to this article is [[ABA therapy]]. "Applied means that interventions are geared toward achieving socially-important goals, helping people be more successful in natural settings such as homes, schools, and communities. Behavioral means that ABA focuses on what people say or do, rather than interpretations or assumptions about behavior. And analytic means that assessments are used to identify relationships between behavior and aspects of the environment (e.g., screaming occurs most when Johnny is given a difficult task and allows him to delay or avoid that activity) before proceeding to intervention."&lt;ref name="Meme Hieneman, Viviana Gonzalez, &amp; Paula Chan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hieneman|first=Meme|url=http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com/news/what-aba-now-really-autism-33299272|publisher=Autism Support Network|accessdate=10 May 2013|title=What is ABA Therapy now, really?|author2=Viviana Gonzalez|author3=Paula Chan|page=2}} cited at [http://www.autismsupportnetwork.com Austism Support Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core problems==
Limitations in self-care skills and social relationships, as well as behavioral excesses are common characteristics of individuals with mental disabilities. Individuals with mental disabilities who require extensive supports are often taught basic self care skills such as dressing, eating, and hygiene.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Direct instruction and environmental supports, such as added prompts and simplified routines are necessary to ensure that deficits in these adaptive areas do not come to seriously limit one's quality of life.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

Most children with milder forms of mental disabilities learn how to take care of their basic needs, but they often require training in self-management skills to achieve the levels of performance necessary for eventual [[activities of daily living|independent living]]. Making and sustaining friendships and personal relationships present significant challenges for many persons with mental disabilities. Limited cognitive processing skills, poor language development, and unusual or inappropriate behaviors can seriously impede interacting with others. Teaching students with mental disabilities appropriate social and interpersonal skills is one of the most important functions of special education. Students with mental disabilities more often exhibit behavior problems than children without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt; Some of the behaviors observed by students with mental disabilities are difficulties accepting criticism, limited self-control, and inappropriate behaviors. The greater the severity of the mental disabilities, generally the higher the incidence of behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="Heward"/&gt;

==Adaptive behaviors in education==
In education, adaptive behavior is defined as that which (1) meets the needs of the community of stakeholders (parents, teachers, peers, and later employers) and (2) meets the needs of the learner, ''now'' and ''in the future''. Specifically, these behaviors include such things as effective speech, self-help, using money, cooking, and reading, for example.

Training in adaptive behavior is a key component of any educational program, but is critically important for children with special needs. The [[US Department of Education]] has allocated billions of dollars ($12.3 billion in 2008) for Special Education programs aimed at improving educational and early intervention outcomes for children with disabilities. 
In 2001, the [[United States National Research Council]] published a comprehensive review of interventions for children and adults diagnosed with [[autism]]. The review indicates that interventions based on [[applied behavior analysis]] have been effective with these groups.

Adaptive behavior includes socially responsible and independent performance of daily activities. However, the specific activities and skills needed may differ from setting to setting. When a student is going to school, school and academic skills are adaptive. However, some of those same skills might be useless or maladaptive in a job settings, so the transition between school and job needs careful attention.

==Specific skills==
Adaptive behavior includes the age-appropriate behaviors necessary for people to live independently and to function safely and appropriately in daily life. Adaptive behaviors include life skills such as grooming, dressing, safety, food handling, working, money management, cleaning, making friends, social skills, and the personal [[moral responsibility|responsibility]] expected of their age and [[social group]].&lt;ref name="Heward"&gt;William Heward: ''Exceptional Children'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Specific skills include:

==Adaptive skills==
Every human being must learn a set of skills that is beneficial for the environments and communities they live in. Adaptive skills are stepping stones toward accessing and benefiting from local or remote communities. This means that, in urban environments, to go to the movies, a child will have to learn to navigate through the town or take the bus, read the movie schedule, and pay for the movie. Adaptive skills allow for safer exploration because they provide the learner with an increased awareness of his/her surroundings and of changes in context, that require new adaptive responses to meet the demands and dangers of that new context. Adaptive skills may generate more opportunities to engage in meaningful social interactions and acceptance. Adaptive skills are socially acceptable and desirable at any age and regardless of gender (with the exception of gender specific biological differences such as menstrual care skills, etc.)

===Learning adaptive skills===
Adaptive skills encompass a range of daily situations and they usually start with a [[task analysis]]. The task analysis will reveal all the steps necessary to perform the task in the natural environment. The use of behavior analytic procedures has been documented, with children, adolescents and adults, under the guidance of behavior analysts&lt;ref&gt;[[Professional practice of behavior analysis]]&lt;/ref&gt; and supervised behavioral technicians. The list of applications has a broad scope and it is in continuous expansion as more research is carried out in applied behavior analysis (see ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'', ''[[The Analysis of Verbal Behavior]]'').

== Practopoietic theory ==
According to '''practopoietic''' theory,&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014|accessdate=2014-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; creation of adaptive behavior involves special, ''poietic'' interactions among different levels of system organization. These interactions are described on the basis of [[cybernetic]] theory in particular, [[good regulator]] theorem. In practopoietic systems, lower levels of organization determine the properties of higher levels of organization, but not the other way around. This ensures that lower levels of organization (e.g., genes) always possess cybernetically more general knowledge than the higher levels of organization&amp;mdash;knowledge at a higher level being a special case of the knowledge at the lower level. At the highest level of organization lies the overt behavior. Cognitive operations lay in the middle parts of that hierarchy, above genes and below behavior. For behavior to be adaptive, at least three adaptive traverses are needed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">'''Aesthetic distance''' refers to the gap between a viewer's conscious reality and the fictional reality presented in a work of art.  When a reader becomes fully engrossed in the illusory narrative world of a book, the author has achieved a close aesthetic distance.  If the author then jars the reader from the reality of the story, essentially reminding the reader they are reading a book, the author is said to have "violated the aesthetic distance." &lt;ref&gt;[http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/lit_term.html Literary terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/aesthetic+distance Merriam-Webster]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The concept originates from [[Immanuel_Kant|Immanuel Kant's]] [[Critique of Judgement]], where he establishes the notion of ''disinterested delight'' which does not depend on the subject's having a desire for the object itself, he writes, "delight in beautiful art does not, in the pure judgement of taste, involve an immediate interest. [...] it is not the object that is of immediate interest, but rather the inherent character of the beauty qualifying it for such a partnership-a character, therefore, that belongs to the very essence of beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1790). 'Critique of Pure Judgement.' trans. Meredith, James Creed. Blacksburg: Virginia Tech. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term aesthetic distance itself derives from an article by Edward Bullough published in 1912. In that article, he begins with the image of a passenger on a ship observing fog at sea. If the passenger thinks of the fog in terms of danger to the ship, the experience is not aesthetic, but to regard the beautiful scene in detached wonder is to take legitimate aesthetic attitude. One must feel, but not too much. Bullough writes, "Distance … is obtained by separating the object and its appeal from one's own self, by putting it out of gear with practical needs and ends. Thereby the 'contemplation' of the object becomes alone possible."&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, Edward (1912/1989). '"Psychical Distance" as a Factor in Art and as an Aesthetic Principle.' Dickie, G., Sclafani, R., Roblin, R. ''Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology.'' 2nd ed. New York: St. Martin's. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors of film, fiction, drama, and poetry evoke different levels of aesthetic distance.  For instance, [[William Faulkner]] tends to invoke a close aesthetic distance by using [[first-person narrative]] and [[Stream_of_consciousness_(narrative_mode)|stream of consciousness]], while [[Ernest Hemingway]] tends to invoke a greater aesthetic distance from the reader through use of [[Narrative_mode#Third-person_view|third person narrative]].

==Violating the aesthetic distance==

Anything that pulls a viewer out of the reality of a work of fiction is said to be a violation of aesthetic distance.  An easy example in theater or film is "breaking the fourth wall," when characters suspend the progress of the story to speak directly to the audience.  When the aesthetic distance is deliberately violated in theater, it is known as the [[distancing effect]], or ''Verfremdungseffekt'', a concept coined by playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].

Many examples of violating the aesthetic distance may also be found in [[meta-fiction]].  [[William Goldman]], in ''[[The Princess Bride]]'', repeatedly interrupts his own fairy tale to speak directly to the reader. In the musical, ''[[Stop the World I Want to Get Off]]'', the [[protagonist]], ''Littlechap'', periodically stops the progress of the play to address the audience directly.

In film, the aesthetic distance is often violated unintentionally.  Examples might include a director's cameo, poor special effects, or perhaps blatant [[product placement]] - any can be enough to pull a viewer out of the reality of the film.  [[David Mamet]] in ''[[On Directing Film]]'' asserts that any direct depiction of graphic sex or violence in film is an inherent violation of aesthetic distance, as audience members will instinctively make judgments as to whether or not what they just saw was real, and thus be pulled out of the story-telling.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2482">The '''Buchholz system''' (also spelled Buchholtz) is a ranking or scoring system in [[chess]] developed by Bruno Buchholz (died ca. 1958) in 1932, for [[Swiss system]] tournaments {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  It was originally developed as an auxiliary scoring method, but more recently it has been used as a tie-breaking system.  It was probably first used in the 1932 Bitterfeld tournament.  It was designed to replace the [[Neustadtl score]] {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.

The method is to give each player a raw score of one point for each win and a half point for each [[draw (chess)|draw]]. When used as an alternate scoring system, each player's Buchholz score is calculated by adding the raw scores of each of the opponents he played and multiplying this total by the player's raw score {{harvcol|Hooper|Whyld|1992}}.  When used for tie-breaking among players with the same raw score, no multiplying is necessary and the sum of the raw scores of the opponents played is used to break ties {{harvcol|Golombek|1977}}.  When used as a tie-break system, it is equivalent to the [[Tie-breaking in Swiss-system tournaments#Solkoff|Solkoff system]].

The major criticism of this system is that tie-break scores can be distorted by the set of opponents that each player plays (especially in early rounds). To avoid this problem a version of Buchholz, the '''Median-Buchholz System''' is sometimes used. In the Median-Buchholz System the best and worst scores of a player's opponents are discarded, and the remaining scores summed.

]]

The [[capital punishment|death penalty]] has been completely abolished in all [[Europe]]an countries except for [[Belarus]] and [[Russia]], the latter of which has a moratorium and has not conducted an execution since 1999. The absolute ban on the death penalty is enshrined in both the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] of the [[European Union]] (EU) and two widely adopted protocols of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] of the [[Council of Europe]], and is thus considered a central value. Of all modern European countries, [[San Marino]], [[Portugal]] and the [[Netherlands]] were the first to abolish capital punishment, whereas only Belarus still practices capital punishment in some form or another. In 2012, [[Latvia]] became the last EU Member State to abolish capital punishment in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcoalition.org/International-law-abolition-protocols-ratified-last-month.html|title=International law: abolition protocols ratified last month|website=World Coalition Against the Death Penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, in Europe, the death penalty for peacetime crimes has been abolished in all countries except Belarus, while the death penalty for wartime crimes has been abolished in all countries except Belarus and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/death-penalty/abolitionist-and-retentionist-countries|title=Death Penalty|website=www.amnesty.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Kazakhstan is a country situated partly in Europe and partly in [[Asia]]).

In [[Russia]] the death penalty has been indefinitely suspended (under [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]]), therefore is uncommon but not unheard of.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

Except for Belarus, which carried out two executions in 2018, the last executions by a European country occurred in Kazakhstan in 2003, and [[Ukraine]] in 1997.

===Legal instruments in Europe===
The [[Council of Europe]] has two main instruments against capital punishment: Protocol no.6 and Protocol no.13.

The [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=114&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.6] which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime has been ratified by all members of the Council of Europe, except Russia (which has signed, but not ratified).

[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13] prohibits the death penalty in all circumstances (including for war crimes).  All member states of the Council of Europe have ratified it, except Azerbaijan and Russia, which have not signed it, and Armenia, which has signed but not yet ratified. All have, however, abolished the death penalty. In 2014, [[Poland]] was the latest country to ratify [http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol no.13].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG|title=Full list|website=Treaty Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=187&amp;CM=1&amp;DF=&amp;CL=ENG Protocol No. 13 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, concerning the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances CETS No.: 187] Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

===The 21st century===
The only country in Europe that continues to execute in the 21st century is Belarus (last execution done in 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/europes-east/belarus-and-ukrainan-rebels-keep-death-penalty-alive-europe-313427|title=Belarus and Ukrainan rebels keep death penalty alive in Europe|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No member of the Council of Europe has carried out executions in the 21st century. The last execution on the present day territory of the Council of Europe took place in 1997 in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205224923/http://hub.coe.int/what-we-do/human-rights/death-penalty |archivedate=5 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handsoffcain.info/bancadati/schedastato.php?idcontinente=20&amp;nome=ukraine|title=NTC - Bancadati|website=www.handsoffcain.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Abolition has been common in European history, but has only been a real trend since the end of the [[Second World War]] when [[human rights]] became a particular priority. The [[Kingdom of Italy]] had abolished the death penalty for civilians with the adoption of the [[Zanardelli Penal Code]] of 1889, but the [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascists]] had reintroduced it with the 1930 Penal Code.

The [[European Convention on Human Rights]] was adopted in 1950, but some countries took many years to ratify it. The United Kingdom retained the death penalty for [[high treason]] until 1998; however, this technicality was superseded by the absolute ban on the death penalty in 1976. [[William Joyce]] was the last person to be put to death for high treason in the UK, on 3 January 1946.

A moratorium on the death penalty has been in place in Russia since 1 January 2010. According to the 19 November 2009 decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, the death penalty shall not be practiced in Russia at any time before the ratification of the above-mentioned protocol. The Constitutional Court has also clarified that the decision is not an extension of the moratorium but the abolition of the capital punishment, since it will be no longer possible to practice it legally.

2009 was the first year that no one was executed anywhere in Europe, however in March 2010 [[Belarus]] executed the last two people on its death row.&lt;ref name="Belarus 2"&gt;Phillips, Leigh (30 March 2010) [http://euobserver.com/9/29797 Europe's first ever execution-free year undone by Belarus], [[EU Observer]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Union (EU) has long since been against the death penalty, supporting the European Convention, and its 2000 [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] included an absolute ban on the death penalty in all circumstances. The Charter has been made legally binding by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] as it was fully ratified and became effective on 1 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6901353.stm Q&amp;A: The Lisbon Treaty] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The treaty also has a provision for the EU to join the Council of Europe and accede to the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU has been an active promoter of abolition worldwide and has been promoting a [[United Nations moratorium on the death penalty]]; however some EU member state governments such as Poland have opposed such moves.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The [[Council of Europe]] has made abolition of the death penalty a prerequisite for membership. As a result, no execution has taken place on the territory of the organisation's member states since 1997. The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] continues to monitor the capital punishment issue. The current General Rapporteur on the abolition of the death penalty for the Parliamentary Assembly is German member of parliament [[Marina Schuster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/NewsManager/EMB_NewsManagerView.asp?ID=8703&amp;L=2 PACE Rapporteurs condemn death sentence handed down in Belarus], Press release of 3 May 2013, [[Council of Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belarus==
{{main|Capital punishment in Belarus}}
The only European country that executes criminals is [[Belarus]], as that country is not party to the European Convention on Human Rights. Executions in Belarus are carried out by shooting.

==Russia==
{{main|Capital punishment in Russia}}
Capital punishment in Russia has been indefinitely suspended, although it still remains codified in its law. There exists both an implicit [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] established by the President [[Yeltsin]] in 1996, and an explicit one, established by the [[Constitutional Court of Russia]] in 1999 and which was most recently reaffirmed in 2009. Russia has not executed anyone in peacetime since 1996, and in wartime since 1999.

==Kazakhstan==
{{main|Capital punishment in Kazakhstan}}
Capital punishment in Kazakhstan has been abolished for ordinary crimes, but is still permitted for crimes occurring in special circumstances (such as war crimes). Kazakhstan has not carried out any executions since 2003, and currently only one person is on death row.
Kazakhstan is not a member of the Council of Europe.

== Bosnia and Herzegovina ==
{{main|Capital punishment in Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina have constitutionally abolished the death penalty, but capital punishment remains present in legal statutes, specifically in [[Republika Srpska]], Article 11. However, due to the constitutional abolition, the death penalty cannot be used.

== Separatist territories and partially recognized jurisdictions ==
In Europe there are also [[List of states with limited recognition|partially unrecognized states]]. In 2006 the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe wrote that: &lt;blockquote&gt;While [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] abolished the death penalty on 1 August 2003, when it decided to implement the Republic of Armenia's new Criminal Code on its territory, the other territories, [[Abkhazia]], [[Transnistria]] and [[South Ossetia]], have not done so, retaining capital punishment in their legislation both in peacetime and in wartime. As South Ossetia decided in 1992 to make Russian legislation applicable on its territory, it has observed a moratorium on executions since 1996. The death penalty is in the Transnistrian Criminal Code which came into force in 2002. In July 1999, de facto President Smirnov ordered a moratorium on executions, and there is said to be only one prisoner on death row in Transnistria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID%3D11376%26Language%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019050451/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/Doc/XrefViewHTML.asp?FileID=11376&amp;Language=en |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Abkhazia]] formalized its moratorium in 2007, moving towards full abolition. On 12 January 2007 the parliament of Abkhazia adopted a law entitled "Moratorium on the Death Penalty", establishing a moratorium on executions during peacetime. Since 1993 the country has had a ''de facto'' moratorium on executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur04/002/2007/en/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been 10 sentences of death in Abkhazia, these have never been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unpo.org/article/6148|title=UNPO: The Death Penalty Must Order its Final Meal|website=www.unpo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] retains the death penalty only for crimes committed under special circumstances (war-crimes). See also [[Capital punishment in Cyprus]].

The [[Donetsk People's Republic]] introduced the death penalty in 2014 for cases of treason, espionage, and assassination of political leaders. There had already been accusations of [[extrajudicial execution]] occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/donetsk-separatists-introduce-death-penalty-for-treason/505271.html|title=Donetsk Separatists Introduce Death Penalty for Treason|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1686">'''Chilton–Colburn J-factor analogy''' is a successful and widely used analogy between [[heat transfer|heat]], [[momentum]], and [[mass transfer]]. The basic mechanisms and mathematics of heat, mass, and momentum transport are essentially the same. Among many analogies (like [[Reynolds analogy]], Prandtl–Taylor analogy) developed to directly relate [[heat transfer]] coefficients, [[mass transfer]] coefficients, and [[friction]] factors Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy proved to be the most accurate.  

It is written as follows,

&lt;math&gt;J_M=\frac{f}{2} = J_H = \frac{h}{c_p\, G}\,{Pr}^{\frac{2}{3}}= J_D = \frac{k'_c}{\overline{v}} \cdot {Sc}^{\frac{2}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation permits the prediction of an unknown transfer coefficient when one of the other coefficients is known. The analogy is valid for fully developed [[turbulent flow]] in conduits with ''[[Reynolds number|Re]]'' &gt; 10000, 0.7 &lt; ''[[Prandtl number|Pr]]'' &lt; 160, and tubes where ''L''/''d'' &gt; 60 (the same constraints as the [[Nusselt number|Sieder–Tate correlation]]). The wider range of data can be correlated by Friend–Metzner analogy.

Relationship between Heat and Mass;

&lt;math&gt;J_M = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Sh}{Re\, Sc^{\frac{1}{3}}} = J_H = \frac{f}{2} = \frac{Nu}{Re\, Pr^{\frac{1}{3}}}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr circa 1930-edit.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The concept of "clear and present danger" is a rationale for the limitation of free speech originated in a majority opinion written in 1919 by Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes.]]
'''Clear and present danger''' was a doctrine adopted by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to determine under what circumstances limits can be placed on [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedoms of speech, press, or assembly. The test was replaced in 1969 with ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]''{{'}}s "[[imminent lawless action]]" test.

==History==
{{See also|First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Speech critical of the government|label 1=First Amendment issues related to speech critical of government}}
Before the 20th century, most free speech issues involved [[prior restraint]].  Starting in the early 1900s, the Supreme Court began to consider cases in which persons were punished 'after'  speaking or publishing.  The primary legal test used in the United States to determine if speech could be criminalized was the  [[bad tendency]] test.&lt;ref name=RCL&gt;Rabban, pp 132&amp;ndash;134, 190&amp;ndash;199.&lt;/ref&gt; Rooted in English [[common law]], the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it had a tendency to harm public welfare.&lt;ref name=RCL/&gt;  One of the earliest cases in which the Supreme Court  addressed punishment after material was published was   1907's ''[[Patterson v. Colorado]]'' in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.&lt;ref name=RCL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Patterson v. Colorado'', 205 U.S. 454 (1907).&lt;br/&gt;Before 1907, most free speech issues addressed prior restraint rather than punishment after speaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiwar protests during World War I gave rise to several important free speech cases related to sedition and inciting violence.  In the 1919 case ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'',  the Supreme Court held that an antiwar activist did not have a First Amendment right to advocate [[draft resistance]].&lt;ref name="Killian, p 1093"&gt;Killian, p 1093.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Schenck v. United States'', 249 U.S. 47 (1919).&lt;/ref&gt;  In his majority opinion, Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] introduced the clear and present danger test, which would become an important concept in First Amendment law; but the ''Schenck'' decision did not formally adopt the test.&lt;ref name="Killian, p 1093"/&gt;  Holmes later wrote that he intended the clear and present danger test to refine, not replace, the bad tendency test.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabban, pp 285&amp;ndash;286.&lt;/ref&gt;   Although sometimes mentioned in subsequent rulings, the clear and present danger test was never endorsed by the Supreme Court as a test to be used by lower courts when evaluating the constitutionality of legislation that regulated speech.&lt;ref name=K60&gt;Killian, pp 1096, 1100.&lt;br&gt;Currie, David P., ''The Constitution in the Supreme Court: The Second Century, 1888-1986, Volume 2'',  University of Chicago Press, 1994, p 269, {{ISBN|9780226131122}}.&lt;br&gt;Konvitz, Milton Ridvad, ''Fundamental Liberties of a Free People: Religion, Speech, Press, Assembly'', 	Transaction Publishers, 2003, p 304,  {{ISBN|9780765809544}}.&lt;br/&gt;Eastland,  p 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Court adopted the [[imminent lawless action]] test in 1969's ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969), which some commentators view as a modified version of the clear and present danger test.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a '''clear and present danger''' that they will bring about the substantive evils that the [[United States Congress]] has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree. When a nation is at war, many things that might be said in time of peace are such a hindrance to its effort that their utterance will not be endured so long as men fight, and that no Court could regard them as protected by any constitutional right.}}

The Court continued to use the bad tendency test during the early 20th century in cases such as 1919's ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'', which upheld the conviction of antiwar activists who passed out leaflets encouraging workers to impede the war effort.&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States'', 250 U.S. 616 (1919).&lt;br/&gt;The bad tendency test was also used in ''Frohwerk v. United States'', 249 U.S. 204 (1919); ''Debs v. United States'', 249 U.S. 211 (1919); and  ''Schaefer v. United States'', 251 U.S. 466 (1920).&lt;br/&gt;See Rabban, David, "Clear and Present Danger Test", in ''The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States'', p 183, 2005, {{ISBN|9780195176612}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Abrams'', Holmes and [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] dissented and encouraged the use of the clear and present test, which provided more protection for speech.&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p. 1094.&lt;br/&gt;Rabban, p 346.&lt;br&gt;Redish, p 102.&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1925's ''[[Gitlow v. New York]]'',  the Court extended the First Amendment  to the states, and upheld the conviction of Gitlow for publishing the "[[Left Wing Manifesto#.22Left Wing Manifesto.22 issued by the Left Wing National Council|Left Wing Manifesto]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Gitlow v. New York'', 268 U.S. 652 (1925).&lt;/ref&gt;    ''Gitlow'' was decided based on the bad tendency test, but the majority decision acknowledged the validity of the clear and present danger test, yet concluded that its use was limited to Schenck-like situations where the speech was not specifically outlawed by the legislature.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish, p 102.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandeis and Holmes again promoted the clear and present danger test, this time in a concurring opinion in 1927's ''[[Whitney v. California]]'' decision.&lt;ref name=Dunlap&gt;Dunlap, William V., "National Security and Freedom of Speech", in Finkelman (vol 1), pp 1072–1074.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Whitney v. California'' 274 U.S. 357 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;    The majority did not adopt or use the clear and present danger test,  but the concurring opinion encouraged the Court to support greater protections for speech, and it  suggested that  "imminent danger"{{spaced ndash}}a more restrictive wording than "present danger"{{spaced ndash}}should be required before speech can be outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 102&amp;ndash;104.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1095.&lt;/ref&gt;  After ''Whitney'', the bad tendency test continued to be used by the Court in cases such  1931's  ''[[Stromberg v. California]]'', which held that a 1919 California statute banning red flags was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;''Stromberg v. California'', 283 U.S. 359 (1931).&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1096.&lt;br/&gt;Another case from that era that used the bad tendency test was ''Fiske v. Kansas'', 274 U.S. 380 (1927).&lt;/ref&gt;

The clear and present danger test was invoked by the majority in the 1940 ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama]]'' decision in which a state antipicketing law was invalidated.&lt;ref name=K60/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Thornhill v. Alabama'', 310 U.S. 88  (1940).&lt;/ref&gt;   Although the Court referred to the clear and present danger test in a few decisions following ''Thornhill'',&lt;ref&gt;Including ''[[Cantwell v. Connecticut]]'', 310 U.S. 296 (1940): "When clear and present danger of riot, disorder, interference with traffic upon the public streets, or other immediate threat to public safety, peace, or order appears, the power of the State to prevent or punish is obvious ... we think that, in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioner's communication, considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees, raised no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question."&lt;br/&gt;
And ''[[Bridges v. California]]'', 314 U.S. 252 (1941): "And, very recently [in ''Thornhill''] we have also suggested that 'clear and present danger' is an appropriate guide in determining the constitutionality of restrictions upon expression ...  What finally emerges from the 'clear and present danger' cases is a working principle that the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high, before utterances can be punished."&lt;/ref&gt;  the bad tendency test was not explicitly overruled,&lt;ref name=K60/&gt;  and the clear and present danger test  was not applied in several subsequent free speech cases involving incitement to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Antieu, Chester James, ''Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States'', Wm. S. Hein Publishing, 1998, p 219, {{ISBN|9781575884431}}.  Antieu names ''[[Feiner v. New York]]'', 340 U.S. 315 (1951);  ''[[Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire]]'' 315 U.S. 568 (1942);  and ''[[Kovacs v. Cooper]]'', 335 U.S. 77  (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dennis v. United States''===
[[File:Fred m vinson.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson reaffirmed the applicability of the doctrine of "clear and present danger" in upholding the 1950 conviction of Communist Party USA leader Eugene Dennis.]]

In May 1950, one month before the appeals court heard  [[Oral argument in the United States|oral arguments]] in the ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''  case, the Supreme Court ruled on free speech issues in  ''[[American Communications Association v. Douds]]''.  In that case, the Court considered the clear and present danger test, but rejected it as too mechanical and instead introduced a [[balancing test]].&lt;ref&gt;Eastland,  p 47.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, p 1101.&lt;br /&gt;''American Communications Association v. Douds'' 339 U.S. 382 (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal appeals court heard oral arguments in the CPUSA case on June&amp;nbsp;21–23, 1950.   Judge [[Learned Hand]] considered the clear and present danger test, but his opinion adopted a balancing approach similar to that suggested in ''American Communications Association v. Douds''.&lt;ref name=Dunlap/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eastland, pp 96, 112&amp;ndash;113.&lt;br/&gt;Sabin, p 79.&lt;br/&gt;O'Brien, pp 7–8.&lt;br/&gt;Belknap (1994), p 222.&lt;br/&gt;Walker, p 187.&lt;br/&gt;Belknap, Michal, ''The Vinson Court: Justices, Rulings, and Legacy'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, p 109, {{ISBN|9781576072011}}.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 655.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendants appealed the Second Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court in ''[[Dennis v. United States]]''.  The 6–2 decision was issued on June 4, 1951, and upheld Hand's decision.  Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Fred Vinson's]] opinion stated that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] does not require that the government must wait "until the putsch is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited" before it interrupts seditious plots.&lt;ref&gt;Belknap (1994), p 223. Vinson quoted by Belknap.&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, Vinson endorsed the balancing approach used by Judge Hand:&lt;ref name=Dennis&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/341/494/case.html ''Dennis v. United States'' - 341 U.S. 494 (1951)]  Justia. Retrieved March 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Killian, p 1100.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, pp 654&amp;ndash;655.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Chief Judge Learned Hand ... interpreted the [clear and present danger] phrase as follows: 'In each case, [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the "evil", discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.' We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.}}

==Importance==
Following ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', "clear and present danger" became both a public metaphor for [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] speech&lt;ref name="Derrick2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Derrick |first=Geoffrey J. |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Why the Judiciary Should Protect First Amendment Political Speech During Wartime: The Case for Deliberative Democracy |journal=Lethbridge Undergraduate Research Journal |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2007 |url=http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol2n1/firstamend.xml |issn=1718-8482 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422191505/http://www.lurj.org/article.php/vol2n1/firstamend.xml |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tsai |first=Robert L. |authorlink=  |coauthors= |title=Fire, Metaphor, and Constitutional Myth-Making |journal=Georgetown Law Journal |volume=93 |issue= |pages=181–239 |year=2004 |url= |doi= |issn=0016-8092 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a standard test in cases before the Court where a United States law limits a citizen's First Amendment rights; the law is deemed to be [[constitutional]] if it can be shown that the language it prohibits poses a "clear and present danger".  However, the "clear and present danger" criterion of the ''Schenck'' decision was replaced in 1969 by ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Brandenburg v. Ohio, {{ussc|395|444|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the test refined to determining whether the speech would provoke an "[[imminent lawless action]]".

The vast majority{{Who|date=May 2017}} of legal scholars have concluded that in writing the ''Schenck'' opinion, Justice Holmes never meant to replace the "[[bad tendency (legal)|bad tendency]]" test which had been established in the 1868 English case ''[[Hicklin test|R. v. Hicklin]]'' and incorporated into American jurisprudence in the 1904 Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. ex rel. Turner v. Williams]]''{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}. This is demonstrated by the use of the word "tendency" in ''Schenck'' itself, a paragraph in ''Schenck'' explaining that the success of speech in causing the actual harm was not a prerequisite for conviction, and use of the bad-tendency test in the simultaneous ''[[Frohwerk v. United States]]'' and ''[[Debs v. United States]]'' decisions (both of which cite ''Schenck'' without using the words "clear and present danger").

However, a subsequent essay by [[Zechariah Chafee]] titled "Freedom of Speech in War Time" argued despite context that Holmes had intended to substitute clear and present danger for the bad-tendency standard a more protective standard of free speech.&lt;ref name="Chafee1919"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafee |first=Zechariah |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1919 |month= |title=Freedom of Speech in Wartime |journal=Harvard Law Review |volume=32 |issue= 8|pages=932&amp;ndash;973 |doi=10.2307/1327107 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bad tendency was a far more ambiguous standard where speech could be punished even in the absence of identifiable danger, and as such was strongly opposed by the fledgling [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and other libertarians of the time.

Having read Chafee's article, Holmes decided to retroactively reinterpret what he had meant by "clear and present danger" and accepted Chafee's characterization of the new test in his dissent in ''[[Abrams v. United States]]'' just six months after ''Schenck''.&lt;ref&gt;''Abrams v. United States'', {{ussc|250|616|1919}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Schenck'', ''Frohwerk'', and ''Debs'' all resulted in unanimous decisions, while ''Abrams'' did not.

===Brandenburg===

For two decades after the ''Dennis'' decision, free speech issues related to advocacy of violence were decided using balancing tests such as the one initially articulated in ''Dennis''.&lt;ref&gt;Including cases such as  ''Konigsberg v. State Bar of California'', 366 U.S. 36 (1961).&lt;br/&gt;Killian, pp 1101&amp;ndash;1103.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, the court established stronger protections for speech in the landmark case ''[[Brandenburg v. Ohio]]'',  which held that  "the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action".&lt;ref&gt;''Brandenburg v. Ohio'', 395 U.S. 444 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redish pp 104&amp;ndash;106.&lt;br/&gt;Killian, pp 1109&amp;ndash;1110.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Brandenburg'' is now the standard applied by the Court to  free speech issues related to advocacy of violence.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in cases such as ''Hess v. Indiana'', 414 U.S. 105 (1973).&lt;br/&gt;Redish, p 105.&lt;br/&gt;Kemper, p 653.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''Cognitive strategies''' are the specific methods that people use to [[Problem solving|solve problems]], including all sorts of reasoning, planning, arithmetic, etc. Importantly, a cognitive strategy need not be all "in the head", but will almost always interact with various aspects of what might be called the "execution context".

==Examples==

A commonly used and elegant example of cognitive strategies comes from small-number addition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. R. (1990) The adaptive character of thought. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous different ways (i.e., different strategies) by which one can get the sum of two (let's say) one digit numbers, for example 3+4 (=7). The way that most adults would solve this problem is by simply remembering the answer (a "memory" strategy), but a toddler would probably use one of a number of different finger-counting strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Siegler, R.S., &amp; Shipley, C. (1995). Variation, selection, and cognitive change. In T. Simon &amp; G. Halford (Eds.), Developing cognitive competence: New approaches to process modeling (pp. 31–76). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one can represent the first addend (3) on one's left hand by raising three fingers, and then do the same with four fingers on the right hand, and then count up the number of fingers that are raised. But there are many other ways to do this. For example, one can do the same first step (raise three fingers on one's left hand), and then start counting from 4 as one raises four more fingers one at a time on either the right hand, or even starting from the fourth finger on the left hand (which would require continuing from 6 on the right hand). Different strategies may have very different characteristics in terms of their time and space complexity, memory requirements, etc., and therefore in terms of their error characteristics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2078">'''Economic substance''' is a [[Legal doctrine|doctrine]] in the [[tax law]] of the [[Taxation in the United States|United States]] under which a transaction must have both a substantial purpose aside from reduction of tax liability and an economic effect aside from the tax effect in order to be considered valid. This doctrine is used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to determine whether [[tax shelter]]s, or strategies used to reduce tax liability, are considered "abusive."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/economic_substance_(1_25_05).pdf ''The Economic Substance Doctrine in the Current Tax Shelter Environment'']: Remarks by Donald L. Korb, Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service&lt;/ref&gt; Under the doctrine, for a transaction to be respected, the transaction must change the taxpayer's economic position in a "meaningful way" apart from the Federal income tax effects, and the taxpayer must have had a "substantial purpose" for entering into the transaction, apart from the Federal income tax effects.&lt;ref&gt;See subsection (o) of {{usc|26|7701}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17006">An '''Explainable AI''' ('''XAI''') or '''Transparent AI''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) whose actions can be easily understood by humans. It contrasts with the concept of the "[[black box]]" in machine learning, meaning the "interpretability" of the workings of complex algorithms, where even their designers cannot explain why the AI arrived at a specific decision.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sample|first1=Ian|title=Computer says no: why making AIs fair, accountable and transparent is crucial|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/nov/05/computer-says-no-why-making-ais-fair-accountable-and-transparent-is-crucial|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=the Guardian |date=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; XAI can be used to implement a social [[right to explanation]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Edwards|first=Lilian|last2=Veale|first2=Michael|date=2017|title=Slave to the Algorithm?

The technical challenge of explaining AI decisions is sometimes known as the '''interpretability problem'''.&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite news|title=How AI detectives are cracking open the black box of deep learning |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/07/how-ai-detectives-are-cracking-open-black-box-deep-learning|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|date=5 July 2017|language=en}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another consideration is ''info-besity'' (overload of information), thus, ''full transparency'' may not be always possible or even required. The amount of information presented should vary based on the stakeholder interacting with the intelligent system &lt;ref name="ConnectionScience"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theodorou|first=Andreas|last2=Wortham|first2=Robert R.|last3=Bryson|first3=Joanna J.|date=2017|title=Designing and implementing transparency for real time inspection of autonomous robots|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540091.2017.1310182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

AI systems optimize behavior to satisfy a mathematically-specified goal system chosen by the system designers, such as the command, "maximize accuracy of [[sentiment analysis|assessing how positive]] film reviews are in the test dataset". The AI may learn useful general rules from the testset, such as "reviews containing the word 'horrible'" are likely to be negative". However, it may also learn inappropriate rules, such as "reviews containing '[[Daniel Day-Lewis]]' are usually positive"; such rules may be undesirable if they are deemed likely to fail to generalize outside the test set, or if people consider the rule to be "cheating" or "unfair". A human can audit rules in an XAI to get an idea how likely the system is to generalize to future real-world data outside the test-set.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

== Goals ==
AI systems sometimes learn undesirable tricks that do an optimal job of satisfying explicit pre-programmed goals on the training data, but that do not reflect the complicated implicit desires of the human system designers. For example, a 2017 system tasked with image recognition learned to "cheat" by looking for a copyright tag that happened to be associated with horse pictures, rather than learning how to tell if a horse was actually pictured.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In another 2017 system, a [[supervised learning]] AI tasked with grasping items in a virtual world learned to cheat by placing its manipulator between the object and the viewer in a way such that it falsely appeared to be grasping the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DeepMind Has Simple Tests That Might Prevent Elon Musk’s AI Apocalypse|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-11/deepmind-has-simple-tests-that-might-prevent-elon-musk-s-ai-apocalypse|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=Bloomberg.com|date=11 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Learning from Human Preferences|url=https://blog.openai.com/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=OpenAI Blog|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One transparency project, the [[DARPA]] XAI program, aims to produce "glass box" models that are explainable to a "human-in-the-loop", without greatly sacrificing AI performance. Human users should be able to understand the AI's cognition (both in real-time and after the fact), and should be able to determine when to trust the AI and when the AI should be distrusted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable-artificial-intelligence|website=DARPA|publisher=DARPA|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Holzinger|first=Andreas|last2=Plass|first2=Markus|last3=Holzinger|first3=Katharina|last4=Crisan|first4=Gloria Cerasela|last5=Pintea|first5=Camelia-M.|last6=Palade|first6=Vasile|date=2017-08-03|title=A glass-box interactive machine learning approach for solving NP-hard problems with the human-in-the-loop|eprint=1708.01104|class=cs.AI}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History and methods ==
[[Mycin]], a research prototype that could explain which of its hand-coded rules contributed to a diagnosis in a specific case, was developed in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Van Lent, M., Fisher, W., &amp; Mancuso, M. (2004, July). An explainable artificial intelligence system for small-unit tactical behavior. In Proceedings of the National Conference on Artificial Intelligence (pp. 900-907). Menlo Park, CA; Cambridge, MA; London; AAAI Press; MIT Press; 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, L. M., Shortliffe, E. H., &amp; Buchanan, B. G. (1980). Computer-based medical decision making: from MYCIN to VM. Automedica, 3(2), 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 1990s researchers also began studying whether it is possible to meaningfully extract the non-hand-coded rules being generated by opaque trained neural networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tickle|first=A. B.|last2=Andrews|first2=R.|last3=Golea|first3=M.|last4=Diederich|first4=J.|date=November 1998|title=The truth will come to light: directions and challenges in extracting the knowledge embedded within trained artificial neural networks|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/728352/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1057–1068|doi=10.1109/72.728352|issn=1045-9227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers in clinical expert systems creating neural network-powered decision support for clinicians have sought to develop dynamic explanations that allow these technologies to be more trusted and trustworthy in practice.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The "deep learning" methods powering cutting-edge AI in the 2010s are naturally opaque,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mukherjee|first1=Siddhartha|title=A.I. Versus M.D.|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md|accessdate=30 January 2018|work=The New Yorker|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are other complicated neural networks; genetic algorithms likewise are naturally opaque. In contrast, decision trees and Bayesian networks are more transparent to inspection.&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N., &amp; Yudkowsky, E. (2014). The ethics of artificial intelligence.

In the 2010s public concerns about racial and other bias in the use of AI for criminal sentencing decisions and findings of creditworthiness may have led to increased demand for transparent artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== Recent developments ==

As regulators, official bodies and general users come to depend on AI-based dynamic systems, clearer accountability will be required for decision making processes to ensure trust and transparency. Evidence of this requirement gaining more momentum can be seen with the launch of the first global conference exclusively dedicated to this emerging discipline, the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence: Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IJCAI 2017 Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~dwaha/research/meetings/ijcai17-xai/|website=Earthlink|publisher=IJCAI |accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fabaxo1.jpg|thumb|300px|Fab Tree Hab, a "Local Biota Living Graft Structure"&lt;ref name="TerreformOne" /&gt;]]

The '''Fab Tree Hab''' is a hypothetical ecological home design developed at [[MIT]] by [[Mitchell Joachim]], Javier Arbona and Lara Greden. With the idea of easing the burden Humanity places on the environment with conventional housing by growing "living, breathing" [[tree house|tree homes]].&lt;ref name=CanadaFab&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|title=Grow your own home: 'Fab tree hab'|publisher=|accessdate=2015-11-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115053717/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=6a9be8a7-f32e-4ca6-8446-a23a28dd4594|archivedate=2016-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It would be built by allowing native trees to grow over a computer-designed ([[CNC]]) removable [[plywood]] [[scaffold]]. Once the plants are interconnected and stable,&lt;ref name="TerreformOne"&gt;{{Cite web |author=Mitchell Joachim |title=Terreform One |url=http://www.archinode.com/bienal.html |accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; the plywood would be removed and reused. MIT is experimenting with [[trees]] that grow quickly and develop an interwoven root structure that's soft enough to "train" over the scaffold, but then hardens into a more durable structure. The inside walls would be conventional [[clay]] and [[plaster]].

An old methodology new to buildings is introduced in this design - [[pleaching]]. Pleaching is a method of weaving together tree branches to form living [[arch]]ways, [[latticework|lattice]]s, or screens.&lt;ref name=Technologyreview&gt;{{Cite web|author = Tracy Staedter |title=Architects design a living home|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/read_article.aspx?id=17102|accessdate=2015-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;; the technique is also named "[[Tree shaping#Aeroponic culture|Aeroponic culture]]". The load-bearing part of the structure uses trees that self-graft or inosculate such as [[Live oak|Live Oak]], [[Elm]] and [[Dogwood]]. The lattice frame for the walls and roof are created with the branches of the trees. Vines create a dense protective layer woven along the exterior, interspersed with soil pockets and growing plants.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

The Fab Tree Hab is an experiment that would develop over time.  Extra operating costs required over the life-time of the home include pest management with organic pesticides and maintenance of the [[living machine]]'s water treatment system.  Technical demonstration and innovation is still needed for certain components, primarily the bioplastic windows that accept growth of the structure and the management of flows across the wall section to assure that the interior remains dry and animal-free.  All in all, the elapsed time to reach livability is greater than the traditional sense, but so should be the health and longevity of the home and family.  Above all, building this home could be achieved at a minimal price. Depending on the surrounding climate the house is to be grown in, the team expect it will take a minimum of five years to complete its structure.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt; Realization of these homes will begin as an experiment, and it is envisioned that thereafter, the concept of renewal will take on a new architectural form - one of inter-dependency between nature and people.

As of May 2007 Mitchell Joachim stated that there is a "50 per cent" organic project in California, combining natural elements and traditional construction.&lt;ref name=CanadaFab/&gt;

==Trees==
Main trees suggested to be used are [[elm]]s and [[oak]]s. The teams hopes the homes can be grown using mainly native trees.&lt;ref name=TerreformOne/&gt;

'''Fixed repeating schedule''' is a key element of the [[Toyota Production System]] and [[lean manufacturing]]. As its name suggests it is a production schedule which is 'unchanging' and repeated perhaps daily or over a longer period such as two weeks or month. If it can be implemented, economies of repetition start to become evident and suppliers and customers can be assured in their own activity scheduling. What impedes this being implemented is the uncertainty of demand and supply. Therefore whilst the scheduling becomes simple, the activities to make the scheduling possible become more complex. Thus the planning to move to FRS reveals issues which, if managed correctly, will reduce complexity overall and improve customer service.

== History ==

Fixed repeating schedules have been invented all over the place by many organisations as local solutions. Perhaps Ford's early production technique was a trivial example since by ensuring only one product, the black model T, the scheduling became simple as well.

The first widely publicised example with a systematic development was in the [[Toyota Production System]] where an FRS smooths flow in the factory and therefore reduces the waste of unevenness (or [[Mura (Japanese term)|mura]]).

== Implementation ==
=== Step 1: red stream/green stream ===

Since in all but the trivial example of constant demand there will actually be fluctuations in required production, FRS is only part of a scheduling solution. The challenge in the early steps of implementation is to isolate the maximum part of production that can be fixed from the part of production that cannot. This isolation, at least in the early stages, should extend to the supporting services as well as the value adding process or [[gemba]] itself. Thus procurement, stock keeping, deliveries and so on should be run separately for the fixed and non-fixed schedules. For example, this means two procurement 'contracts'; one for fixed deliveries of fixed amounts at regular intervals and one for deliveries as otherwise requested. If this disciple in not complete then the uncertainties in the unfixed side will 'leak' back into the fixed side which will then become unfixed for lack of resources.

To enforce this separation some factories have actually split the factory into two different parts with each part being represented and painted a different colour. This separation went as far as painting forklift trucks, tools, floor areas and stock containers in their corresponding colour as well as selecting staff based upon their temperament to work on one side or the other. The German factory director believed it was as close as he could come to actually running two factories, one FRS and the other flexible.

The benefit of this work was the significant cost decreases that occurred in the FRS 'factory' which far outweighed the slight increase in costs in the flexible 'factory'. In the FRS 'factory' all costs and activities will be repeated which allows significant process simplifications and time and cost reductions to occur across all functions. This is because the 'exceptions' to the standard process will no longer occur and schedules will always be achieved so that process failure 'safety net' processes and equipment and staff can be eliminated or re-deployed.

These benefits only accrue whilst the green stream/FRS products or services remain predictable in demand. Therefore it is critical to ensure appropriate frequency reviews of product demand to ensure promotion of stable products from the red stream and demotion of now less stable demand products to the red stream. This may follow product maturity curves where, after initial introduction, when demand stabilises products move into the FRS and then later, when purchase enthusiasm wanes, they are removed again. Seasonality can be built into FRS by having, for example, a summer and a winter fixed schedule.

=== Step 2: speed up the FRS ===

The implementation of step 1 will have allowed people in the 'FRS' factory to run simpler processes and to establish routines that were not possible in the schedule, reschedule, reschedule world that existed before, and may still exist in the 'non-FRS factory'. This will make the work more manageable and simplify the communications in the 'factory' that are so critical to performance. Because of this it will become much clearer what sub-processes are limiting production capability and therefore which operations can be simplified and improved. It is often the case that large stock levels pre-existed, or were built to make FRS 'possible', the actual causes of these stocks can now be addressed by operational improvements to reduce lot sizes and improve reliability. Once these have been done and supporting services have also adjusted then the aim is to shorten the period of the repeat in 'FRS'. This planning and then action will surface new issues along the lines of the earlier phase which should in their turn be managed as a priority. The shortening of the cycle will allow the reduction of finished goods and WIP stocks as well whilst maintaining availability of stocks for customers. This cycle should be repeated until management nerve breaks.

For Toyota the implementation of a fixed repeating schedule is one of the early steps in achieving [[production levelling]] which follows further steps to achieve lower lot sizes gain the lower costs and flexibility this makes possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27550">{{about|the Indian philosophical concept "Guna"|other uses|Guna (disambiguation)}}

'''{{IAST|Guṇa}}''' depending on the context means "string, thread, or strand", or "virtue, merit, excellence", or "quality, peculiarity, attribute, property".&lt;ref name="guna"&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html guna] Monier Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spokensanskrit.de"&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=guNa&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 guNa] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept is originally notable as a feature of [[Samkhya]] philosophy, though possibly a later feature of it.&lt;ref&gt; Larson, Gerald James. ''Classical Samkhya: An Interpretation''. p.37. Referring to the opinions of Surendranath Dasgupta. Quote: "An older school of Samkhya can be seen in the Caraka Samhita and in the doctrines of Pancasikha in Mahabharata 12.219. This school accepted only twenty-four principles. It included purusa within the avyakta prakrti. '''It had no theory of the gunas''', and the ultimate salvation state was a kind of unconscious annihilation."&lt;/ref&gt; The gunas are now a key concept in nearly all schools of [[Hindu philosophy]].&lt;ref name=jamesg&gt;James G. Lochtefeld, Guna, in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Vol. 1, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, page 265&lt;/ref&gt; There are three gunas, according to this worldview, that have always been and continue to be present in all things and beings in the world.&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt; These three ''gunas'' are called: ''{{IAST|[[sattva]]}}'' (goodness, constructive, harmonious), ''{{IAST|[[rajas]]}}'' (passion, active, confused), and ''{{IAST|[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]}}'' (darkness, destructive, chaotic).&lt;ref name=aw&gt;Alban Widgery (1930), The principles of Hindu Ethics, International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 40, No. 2, pages 234-237&lt;/ref&gt; All of these three ''gunas'' are present in everyone and everything, it is the proportion that is different, according to Hindu worldview.

Like all Sanskrit technical terms, ''guṇa'' can be difficult to summarize in a single word. Its original and common meaning is a thread, implying the original materials that weave together to make up reality. The usual, but approximate translation in common usage is "quality".&lt;ref name=khp&gt;Karl H. Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2: Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

;The root and origins
Guṇa is both a root and a word in Sanskrit language. Its different context-driven meanings are derived from either the root or the word. In verse VI.36 of Nirukta by [[Yāska]], a 1st millennium BC text on Sanskrit grammar and language that preceded [[Pāṇini|Panini]], ''Guṇa'' is declared to be derived from another root ''Gaṇa'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=gaNana&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes gaNana] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; which means "to count, enumerate".&lt;ref name=kv /&gt; This meaning has led to its use in speciation, subdivision, classification of anything by peculiarity, attribute or property. This meaning has also led to its use with prefixes such as ''Dviguna'' (twofold), ''Triguna'' (threefold) and so on.

In another context, such as phonology, grammar and arts, ''"Guṇa-"'' takes the meaning of ''amantrana'' (आमन्त्रणा, addressing, invitation) or ''abhyasa'' (अभ्यास, habit, practice).&lt;ref name=kv /&gt; In the Mahabharata Book 6 Chapter 2, the meaning of ''guna'' similarly comes in the sense of addressing each part (the root implying amantrana), and thereby it means ''avayava'' (अवयव, member, subdivision, portion). In Sanskrit treatises on food and cooking, ''guna'' means quality, tendency and nature of ingredient. Ancient South Indian commentators, such as Lingayasurin, explain that the meaning of ''guna'' as "thread, string" comes from the root guna- in the sense of repetition (''abhyasa''), while the Telugu commentator Mallinatha explains the root ''guna-'' is to be understood in Sisupalavadha as ''amredana'' (आम्रेडन, reiteration, repetition).&lt;ref name=kv /&gt; Larson and Bhattacharya suggest that the "thread" metaphor relates to that which connects and runs between what we objectively observe to the ''tattva'' (तत्त्व, elementary property, principle, invisible essence) of someone or something.&lt;ref name=gjl /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=tattva&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning=0 tattva] Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of philosophy, morality and understanding nature, ''"Guna-"'' with more dental ''na'' takes the meaning of addressing quality, substance, tendency and property.&lt;ref name=gjl /&gt;&lt;ref name=kv /&gt; In abstract discussion, it includes all hues of qualities – desirable, neutral or undesirable; but if unspecified, it is assumed with good faith to be good and divine in Indian philosophy. Thus, ''Guṇi'' from the root ''"Guṇa-"'' means someone or something with "divine qualities", as in Svetasvatara Upanishad hymn VI.2.&lt;ref name=kv&gt;Kapila Vatsyayan, Kalātattvakośa: Manifestation of nature : Sr̥ṣṭi vistāra, Volume 4, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815476}}, pages 144-148&lt;/ref&gt;

== The gunas under various philosophies ==
{{Hinduism}}
Innate qualities and tendencies are key ancient concepts in Indian literature. [[Maitrayaniya Upanishad]] is one of the earliest texts making an explicit reference to Hindu trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and linking them to their ''Guna'' – as creator/activity, preserver/purity, destroyer/recycler respectively.&lt;ref&gt;G. M. Bailey (1979), Trifunctional Elements in the Mythology of the Hindu Trimūrti, [[Numen (journal)|Numen]], Vol. 26, Fasc. 2, pages 152-163&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of three types of ''guna'', innate nature and forces that together transform and keep changing the world is, however, found in numerous earlier and later Indian texts.&lt;ref name=jg&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gonda | first1 = Jan | authorlink = Jan Gonda | year = 1968 | title = The Hindu Trinity | url = | journal = Anthropos | volume = 63 | issue = | pages = 215–219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Samkhya school of Hinduism ===
In [[Samkhya]] philosophy, a {{IAST|guṇa}} is one of three "tendencies, qualities": [[sattva]], [[rajas]] and [[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]]. This category of qualities has been widely adopted by various schools of [[Hinduism]] for categorizing behavior and natural phenomena. The three qualities are:
* ''[[Sattva]]'' is the quality of balance, harmony, goodness, purity, universal-ism, holism, construction, creativity, positivism, peacefulness, and virtue.&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Joseph S., ''Yoga in modern India'', 2004 Princeton University Press, p 55&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Rajas]]'' is the quality of passion, activity, neither good nor bad and sometimes either, self-centeredness, egoism, individualization, drivenness, movement, and dynamism.&lt;ref name=aw /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Feuerstein, Georg The Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga, Shambhala Publications, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Tamas (philosophy)|Tamas]]'' is the quality of imbalance, disorder, chaos, anxiety, impurity, destruction, delusion, negativity, dullness or inactivity, apathy, inertia or lethargy, violence, viciousness, and ignorance.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whicher, Ian '' The Integrity of the Yoga Darśana'', 1998 SUNY Press, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indian philosophy, these qualities are not considered as present in either-or fashion. Rather, everyone and everything has all three, only in different proportions and in different contexts.&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt; The living being or substance is viewed as the net result of the joint effect of these three qualities.&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt;&lt;ref name=aw /&gt;

According to Samkya school, no one and nothing is either purely Sattvik or purely Rajasik or purely Tamasik.&lt;ref name=aw /&gt; One's nature and behavior constitute a complex interplay of all of all three gunas, in varying degrees. In some, the conduct is Rajasik with significant influence of Sattvik guna; in some it is Rajasik with significant influence of Tamasik guna, and so on.&lt;ref name=aw /&gt;

The balance of Gunas of everything and everyone can change and does. However, change in one quality faces inertia from other two qualities in Indian worldview. Change needs internal or external influence or reinforcement, as knowledge and force to transform. The force to change comes from the ''Rajas'' guna, the Sattva guna empowers one towards harmonious and constructive change, while Tamas guna checks or retards the process.

In Indian mythology, Vishnu is envisioned with more ''Sattva'', Brahma with more ''Rajas'', and Shiva seen with all three ''Gunas''.&lt;ref name=jg /&gt;

=== Nyaya school of Hinduism ===
In [[Nyaya]] (logic) school of Hinduism, there is extensive debate on what ''Guna'' means, and whether quality is innate, subjective or describable. Early scholars of this school identified 17 qualities, which later scholars expanded to 24 {{IAST|guṇas}}. Different scholars of this school list the 24 differently; for example, Bhasarvajna disallows 6 of the 24 commonly accepted by the ancient scholars.&lt;ref name=khp /&gt; The most commonly accepted list is: color, taste, smell, touch, number, contact, disjunction, farness, nearness, dimension, separateness, knowledge, pleasure, frustration, desire, hatred, effort, weight, fluidity, viscosity, dispositional tendency, merit, demerit, and sound.&lt;ref name=khp2&gt;Karl H. Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2: Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 112-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Nyaya school considers quality as non-repeatable, a conceptual theme that is not found in Western philosophy on "quality" where it is presumed to be repeatable. It is also not found in some parallel schools of Hinduism. Repeatability means, that the white in one object is same as white in other object, and white means the same thing. Nyaya scholars hold that "whiteness" is a guna of "white", but that is different from "whiteness" of an object or living being. To them, white has many hues and the "whiteness" is subjective.&lt;ref name=khp2 /&gt;

In Laksanavali, an ancient Indian text by Udayana, ''Guna'' is discussed with more nuance. For example, he writes, "quality of earth" is specific only if it meets three conditions: it occurs in earth, does not occur in anything that is not earthy, and be a distinctive quality that cannot be described as combination of other qualities.&lt;ref&gt;Karl H. Potter (2011), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 2: Indian Metaphysics and Epistemology, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803091}}, page 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaisheshika school of Hinduism ===
In [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, which is most related to Nyaya school, ''Guna'' is considered as one of the ''[[padārtha]]'' (category) of relations. It states that our relational awareness, understanding and judgments of a person and anything in the world is relational. All relations, holds this school of Hinduism, is dyadic between ''anuyogin'' (referend) and ''pratiyogin'' (referent).&lt;ref name=kpsb /&gt; Inherence (''samavaya'') is one of its seven categories of relations, as is quality (''guna''), being (''bhava''), genus (''samanya''), species (''vishesha''), substance (''dravya'') and motion/action (''karman''). Unlike Vaisheshika, Nyaya considers inherence as subset of ''guna'' (quality).&lt;ref name=kpsb&gt;Karl H. Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6: Indian Philosophical Analysis, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-07384-2}}, pages 15-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gangesha Upadhyaya|Gangesha]], a Nyaya school scholar, suggests a somewhat different theory, stating that our awareness is of two types – true awareness and false awareness. True awareness is produced when we seek to observe some excellence (''guna'') in its cause, while false awareness results from observing fault (''dosha'') in its cause. In other words, in Gangesha's perspective, the observer's state of mind and attitude affects relational awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Karl H. Potter and Sibajiban Bhattacharya (1994), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies, Volume 6: Indian Philosophical Analysis, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-691-07384-2}}, pages 97-117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
Chapters 3, 7, 13, 14, 17 and 18 of [[Bhagavad Gita]] discuss ''Guna''.&lt;ref name=ckc&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2842-0}}, pages 185-194, 330-332, 634-661&lt;/ref&gt; Verse 17.2 refers to the three Guna – sattvic, rajasic and tamasic – as innate nature (psychology or personality of an individual).&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2842-0}}, pages 635&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gideon&gt;Gideon Arulmani et al (2014), Handbook of Career Development: International Perspectives, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-9459-1}}, pages 139-143&lt;/ref&gt; Sattvic guna is one driven by what is pure, truth, compassionate, without craving, doing the right because it is right, positive and good. Tamasic guna is one driven by what is impure, dark, destructive, aimed to hurt another, contemptuous, negative and vicious. Rajasic guna is one that is ego-driven, out of personal passion, active, ostentatious, seeking the approval of others.&lt;ref name=ckc /&gt;&lt;ref name=gideon /&gt;

In Chapters 17 and 18, Bhagavad Gita illustrates various items and actions by their three ''Guna''. For example, three types of charity are discussed, and what makes charity as Sattvic, Rajasic or Tamasic. Similarly, food, relationships, knowledge and actions are detailed in terms of the three ''Guna''.&lt;ref name=ckc /&gt; In Chapter 18, for example:&lt;ref name=ckc18action /&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;nowiki&gt;नियतं सङ्गरहितमरागद्वेषतः कृतम् । अफलप्रेप्सुना कर्म यत्तत्सात्त्विकमुच्यते ॥२३॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;यत्तु कामेप्सुना कर्म साहंकारेण वा पुनः । क्रियते बहुलायासं तद्राजसमुदाहृतम् ॥२४॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;अनुबन्धं क्षयं हिंसामनपेक्ष्य च पौरुषम् । मोहादारभ्यते कर्म यत्तत्तामसमुच्यते ॥२५॥&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Action that is virtuous, thought through, free from attachment, and without craving for results is considered Sattvic; Action that is driven purely by craving for pleasure, selfishness and much effort is Rajasic; Action that is undertaken because of delusion, disregarding consequences, without considering loss or injury to others or self, is called Tamasic.|Bhagavad Gita|Chapter 18, verses 23–25 &lt;ref name=ckc18action&gt;'''1st English translation''': Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2842-0}}, pages 684-686;&lt;br /&gt;'''2nd English Translation''': [https://archive.org/stream/Bhagavad-Gita.with.the.Commentary.of.Sri.Shankaracharya#page/n477/mode/2up Bhagavad Gita: Chapter 18] verses 23-25;&lt;br /&gt;'''With 11 interpretations/commentaries''' (Sanskrit): [https://archive.org/stream/Srimad.Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries.by.Shastri.Gajanana.Shambhu.Sandha/Srimad-Bhagavad-Gita.with.Eleven.Commentaries#page/n1377/mode/2up Bhagavad Gita] Chapter 18.23-25; pages 333-336&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, knowledge that is attached to object of action, without concern for understanding the cause, without concern for purpose or significance, is Tamasic knowledge; knowledge that is segregated, that considers everything unconnected, individualistic and meaningless is Rajasic; knowledge that sees one being in all beings, that seeks the whole, a unity in diversity, and similarities in the divided components is Sattvic.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Key Chapple, The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth–Anniversary Edition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1-4384-2842-0}}, pages 681-683&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guna in theory of ethics ==
''Guna'' is one of the four important elements in the framework of ethical theories in Indian philosophy.&lt;ref name=aw /&gt;&lt;ref name=scc&gt;S. Cromwell Crawford (2003), Chapter: Hindu Ethics, in Hindu Bioethics for the Twenty-first Century, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-5780-1}}, pages 11-30&lt;/ref&gt; Bommer et al. suggest that ethical/non-ethical behavior is an outcome of individual attributes, personal environment, social environment and institutional rules and laws.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bommer et al (1987), A behavioral model of ethical and unethical decision making, Journal of Business Ethics, 6(4): 265-280&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guna'' theory is the ancient Indian philosophy on individual attributes, while the theories of [[Dharma]] and [[Ashrama (stage)|Ashrama]]s address the personal and social environment, as well as part of its institutional framework. Guna theory, states Crawford,&lt;ref name=scc /&gt; represents a hierarchical theory of values, where the relative order of hierarchy is suggested to vary within each individual along with the relative proportion of each ''guna''. The interplay of three ''gunas'' affect an individual's values, and in Hindu worldview, these values affect individual's actions, as well as the happiness and serenity experienced by the individual.&lt;ref name=jamesg /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N Pani (2009), Hinduism, in Handbook of Economics and Ethics (Editors: Jan Peil and Irene Staveren), Edward Elgar, {{ISBN|978-1-84542-936-2}}, 216-221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NK Shastree, Value Management In Professions, {{ISBN|978-8180693410}}, pages 21-30&lt;/ref&gt; The ''gunas'' are not considered as static and set. Hindu literature, such as the Bhagavad Gita, state it to be dynamic and changeable with knowledge, introspection and understanding of ''sva-dharma''. Realizing one's ''sva-dharma'' and Self, is emphasized in Indian ethical theories. The highest state of existence and bliss, in Advaita school of Hinduism for example, is ''jivanmukti'' (Self realization) and [[moksha]].&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier (1985), Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, 35(1): 61-71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), The Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta Up to Śaṃkara and His Pupils, Vol. 3, Motilal Banarsidass, pages 210-215&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guna'' theory's perspective on values constituting human personality has uniqueness yet is congruent with other ethical theories.&lt;ref&gt;M Innes-Brown and S Chatterjee (1999), The Relevance of the Guna Theory in the Congruence of Eastern Values and Western Management Practice, Journal of Human Values, 5(2): 93-102&lt;/ref&gt;

== Guna in cosmology ==
Samkhya [[cosmology]] combines the three {{IAST|guṇas}} with primal matter (universe, [[Prakrti]]).&lt;ref name=lochtefeldprakriti&gt;James G. Lochtefeld (2001), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0-8239-3179-8}}, Pages 224, 265, 520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Axel Michaels (2003), Notions of Nature in Traditional Hinduism, Environment across Cultures, Springer, {{ISBN|978-3-642-07324-3}}, pages 111-121&lt;/ref&gt; These are present in all things and beings in the world, and it is their interplay that defines the physical and psychological character and nature.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldprakriti /&gt; They serve as the fundamental operating principles or 'tendencies' of {{IAST|[[prakṛti]]}} which are called: ''{{IAST|[[sattva]] guṇa}}'', ''{{IAST|[[rajas]] guṇa}}'', and ''{{IAST|[[tamas (philosophy)|tamas]] guṇa}}''.&lt;ref name="Bernard 74-76" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhagavad-Gita 1969, p 128"&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 128 (v 45) and p 269 v.13&lt;/ref&gt; When any of the ''guna'' is out of balance in a being or object, the Samkhya school suggests that a pattern of evolution starts, affecting not only itself but its environment.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldprakriti /&gt; [[Purusha]], or consciousness, is considered as separate from Prakriti and changeless.&lt;ref name=lochtefeldprakriti /&gt;

== Guna in other contexts ==

=== Sanskrit grammar ===
In the [[Sanskrit grammar|Sanskrit grammatical tradition]] ([[Vyakarana]]), ''{{IAST|guṇa}}'' is an ancient language innovation that strengthens vowel-stems, making it more visually palpable when written and more musically resonant when heard.&lt;ref name=benwd /&gt; Dwight states that the use of ''guna'' makes the Sanskrit language more dynamical, bringing out into relief the idea expressed, given its complexity; in other words, the use of ''guna'' in Sanskrit adds depth and sophistication in its phonetic delivery as well as intellectual structure.&lt;ref name=benwd /&gt; These innovations are not unique to Sanskrit, but also found in Greek, Latin, Italian and to some extent Russian.&lt;ref&gt;HA Woodham, Proceedings of the Philological Society, {{Google books|dA8ZAAAAIAAJ|Vol.1}}, No. 9, pages 98-101&lt;/ref&gt; ''Guna'' and other rules of language for Sanskrit are described by [[Pāṇini]] in his ''[[Ashtadhyayi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Macdonald, Arthur Anthony (1927[1886]), ''A Sanskrit Grammar for Students'' p. 11. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|0-19-815466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guna'' refers to a set of normal-length vowels that are less reduced than the basic set (in modern terms, the ''zero grade''), but more reduced than the ''[[vṛddhi|{{IAST|vṛddhi}}]]'' vowels (in modern terms, the ''lengthened grade'').  As an example, ''ṛ, i, u'' are basic (zero-grade) vowels, with corresponding {{IAST|guṇa}} (full-grade) vowels ''ar, e, o'' and {{IAST|vṛddhi}} (lengthened-grade) vowels ''ār, ai, au''. (This is more understandable once it is realized that, at an earlier stage of development, Sanskrit ''e'' and ''o'' were ''ai'' and ''au'', and Sanskrit ''ai'' and ''au'' were ''āi'' and ''āu''.) ''Guna'' corresponds to what is now termed the ''full grade'' in [[Indo-European ablaut]]. Another orthography and phonology concept related to ''Guna'' is ''[[Vṛddhi|Briddhi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;MW Woollaston, {{Google books|djOHEO1eeEcC|A Practical Grammar of the Sanskrit Language}}, Edward Hall, London&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ayurveda ===
In the terminology of [[Ayurveda]] (traditional medicine), ''guṇa'' can refer to one of twenty fundamental properties which any substance can exhibit, arranged in ten pairs of antonyms, viz.  heavy/light, cold/hot, unctuous/dry, dull/sharp, stable/mobile, soft/hard, non-slimy/slimy, smooth/coarse, minute/gross, viscous/liquid.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last=Chopra|first=Ananda S.|year=2003|chapter=Āyurveda|title=Medicine Across Cultures: History and Practice of Medicine in Non-Western Cultures|editor=Selin, Helaine|editor-link=Helaine Selin|pages=75–83|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|location=Norwell, MA|isbn=1-4020-1166-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=of-gv8-pPcsC&amp;pg=PA76}} p. 76, citing [[Sushrutasamhita]] 25.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guna is also a concept in [[Ayurvedic medicine]], as a system to assess conditions and [[diet (nutrition)|diets]]. For this reason Triguna and [[Dosha|tridosha]] are considered to be related in the traditions of [[Ayurveda]].

'''Homophobia''' encompasses a range of negative [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and feelings toward [[homosexuality]] or people who are identified or perceived as being [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]).&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Maurianne |last1=Adams |first2=Lee Anne |last2=Bell |first3=Pat |last3=Griffin|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|isbn =1135928509|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2007|pages=198–199|accessdate=December 27, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zgGUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA198|quote=Because of the complicated interplay among gender identity, gender roles, and sexual identity, transgender people are often assumed to be lesbian or gay (See ''Overview: Sexism, Heterosexism, and Transgender Oppression''). ...

Homophobia is observable in critical and hostile behavior such as [[discrimination]] and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]]s that are [[non-heterosexual]].&lt;ref name="Adams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Renzetti"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People: Race, Class, Gender, and the Persistence of Anti-LGBT Discrimination|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized types of homophobia include ''institutionalized'' homophobia, e.g. religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia, and ''internalized'' homophobia, experienced by people who have same-sex attractions, regardless of how they identify.

The term ''homophobia'' and its usage have been criticized by several sources as unwarrantedly pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01371377|title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues|first1=William|last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine E.|last2=Caselles|date=1 September 1993|publisher=|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=15|issue=3|pages=177–195|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/BF01371377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
Although sexual attitudes tracing back to [[Ancient Greece]] (8th to 6th centuries BC to the end of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]] (ca. 600 AD)) have been termed homophobia by scholars, the term itself is relatively new,&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |date=April 2004 |title=Beyond 'Homophobia': Thinking About Sexual Prejudice and Stigma in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Herek_2004_SRSP.pdf |journal=Sexuality Research and Policy: Journal of NSRC |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=6–24 |doi=10.1525/srsp.2004.1.2.6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an intolerance towards homosexuality and homosexuals grew during the Middle Ages, especially by adherents of [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Eric|title=Homophobia (psychology and society)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1758377/homophobia|website=britannica.com|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coined by [[George Weinberg (psychologist)|George Weinberg]], a [[Psychology|psychologist]], in the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/homophobia.html |title=Homophobia |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=2012-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318135700/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/homophobia.html |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''homophobia'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of (1) the word '''''homo'''sexual'', itself a mix of neo-classical [[morpheme]]s, and (2) ''[[phobia]]'' from the Greek φόβος, phóbos, meaning "fear" or "morbid fear".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/homophobia|title= Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |title=American Heritage Dictionary |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204061410/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=homophobia&amp;searchmode=none|title= Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg is credited as the first person to have used the term in speech.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt; The word ''homophobia'' first appeared in print in an article written for the May 23, 1969, edition of the American pornographic magazine ''[[Screw magazine|Screw]]'', in which the word was used to refer to heterosexual men's fear that others might think they are gay.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt;

Conceptualizing anti-LGBT prejudice as a [[social issues|social problem]] worthy of scholarly attention was not new.  A 1969 article in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described examples of negative attitudes toward homosexuality as "homophobia", including "a mixture of revulsion and apprehension" which some called ''[[homosexual panic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behavior: The Homosexual: Newly Visible, Newly Understood|journal=Time|date=October 1969|volume=94|issue=18|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,839116-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Kenneth Smith used ''homophobia'' as a personality profile to describe the psychological aversion to homosexuality.&lt;ref name=Smith1971&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith |first=Kenneth T |year=1971 |title=Homophobia: a tentative personality profile |journal=Psychological Reports |pages=1091–4 |volume=29 |issue=3 |issn=0033-2941 |oclc=100640283 |pmid=5139344 |doi=10.2466/pr0.1971.29.3f.1091}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg also used it this way in his 1972 book ''Society and the Healthy Homosexual'',&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972&gt;{{cite book|title=Society and the healthy homosexual |last=Weinberg |first=George |year=1973 |publisher=Garden City, New York Anchor Press Doubleday &amp; Co |isbn=978-0-385-05083-8 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/434538701 |origyear=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; published one year before the [[American Psychiatric Association]] voted to remove homosexuality from its list of [[mental disorder]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Recalling APA's Historic Step |url=http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |first=Alfred M |last=Freedman |periodical=APA News |date=September 1, 2000 |accessdate=2010-08-21 |issn=0033-2704 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203759/http://www.psychiatricnews.org/pnews/00-09-01/recalling.html |archivedate=November 21, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Macionis2005&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macionis |first1=John J. |year=2005 |title=Sociology: a global introduction |first2=Kenneth |last2=Plummer |edition=3 |publisher=Pearson Education |isbn=978-0-13-128746-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=P4z3GgAgMFYC |page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weinberg's term became an important tool for gay and lesbian activists, advocates, and their allies.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt; He describes the concept as a medical [[phobia]]:&lt;ref name=Weinberg1972 /&gt;

It was a religious fear and it had led to great brutality as fear always does.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004" /&gt;}}

In 1981, ''homophobia'' was used for the first time in ''[[The Times]]'' (of London) to report that the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] voted to refuse to condemn homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|title=Homosexuality best seen as a handicap, Dr Runcie says|date=February 28, 1981|author=Clifford Longley|authorlink = Clifford Longley|quote=Let us recognize where the problem lies&amp;nbsp;– in the dislike and distaste felt by many heterosexuals for homosexuals, a problem we have come to call ''homophobia''.|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02-008&amp;pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1981-02-28-02 | location=London}} and {{cite news|title=New light on Archbishop of Canterbury's view on homosexuality |last=Gledhill |first=Ruth |date=August 7, 2008 |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article4474226.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[American Psychiatric Association]], recognizing the power of the stigma against homosexuality, issued the following statement, reaffirmed by the Board of Trustees, July 2011:
"Whereas homosexuality ''per se'' implies no impairment in judgment, stability, reliability, or general social or vocational capabilities, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) calls on all international health organizations, psychiatric organizations, and individual psychiatrists in other countries to urge the repeal in their own countries of legislation that penalizes homosexual acts by consenting adults in private. Further, APA calls on these organizations and individuals to do all that is possible to decrease the stigma related to homosexuality wherever and whenever it may occur."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psych.org/ps2011homosexuality |publisher=American Psychiatric Association|title=Position Statement on Homosexuality }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many world religions contain anti-homosexual teachings, while other religions have varying degrees of ambivalence, neutrality, or incorporate teachings that regard homosexuals as [[third gender]]. Even within some religions which generally discourage homosexuality, there are also people who view homosexuality positively, and some [[religious denomination]]s bless or conduct [[same-sex marriages]]. There also exist so-called [[Queer religion]]s, dedicated to serving the spiritual needs of [[LGBTQI]] persons. [[Queer theology]] seeks to provide a counterpoint to religious homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=/CM/HTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614#queerspirit |title=Queer Spirituality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011751/http://www.mccchurch.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Resources&amp;Template=%2FCM%2FHTMLDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=614 |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, attorney and author [[Roberta Kaplan]] stated that [[Kim Davis]] "is the clearest example of someone who wants to use a religious liberty argument to discriminate [against [[homosexuality|same-sex]] couples]."&lt;ref name="Bromberger" &gt;{{cite news |last=Bromberger |first=Brian |date=October 15, 2015 |title=New book details Windsor Supreme Court victory |publisher=[[Bay Area Reporter]] |url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70989 |accessdate=October 16, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Christianity and the Bible =====
{{Main|Christianity and homosexuality|The Bible and homosexuality}}
The [[Bible]], especially the [[Old Testament]], contains some passages commonly interpreted as condemning homosexuality or same-gender sexual relations. [[Leviticus]] 18:22, says "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination." The destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] is also commonly seen as a condemnation of homosexuality. Christians and Jews who oppose homosexuality often cite such passages; historical context and interpretation is more complicated. Scholarly debate over the interpretation of these passages has focused on placing them in proper historical context, for instance pointing out that Sodom's sins are historically interpreted as being other than homosexuality, and on the translation of rare or unusual words in the passages in question. In ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex". She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|date=2 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official teaching of the [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church regarding homosexuality]] is that same-sex behavior should not be expressed.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, a February 2012 [[Pew Research Center]] poll shows that Catholics support [[gay marriage]] by a margin of 52% to 37%.({{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/Gay-Marriage-and-Homosexuality/Religion-and-Attitudes-Toward-Same-Sex-Marriage.aspx|title=Religion and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Marriage&amp;nbsp;– Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life|author=ANALYSIS February 7, 2012|date=2012-02-07|publisher=Pewforum.org|accessdate=2012-07-05}}) That is a shift upwards from 2010, when 46% of Catholics favored gay marriage.(Biden's support for gay marriage matches most Catholics' views, By Dan Gilgoff, CNN.com Religion Editor [http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/05/07/bidens-support-for-gay-marriage-matches-most-catholics-views/])&lt;/ref&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church States that, "'homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered.'...They are contrary to the natural law....

===== Islam and sharia =====
{{Main|Homosexuality and Islam}}
In some cases, the distinction between religious homophobia and state-sponsored homophobia is not clear, a key example being territories under [[Islamic]] authority. All major [[Islamic sects]] [[Homosexuality and Islam|forbid homosexuality]], which is a crime under [[Sharia Law]] and treated as such in most [[Muslim]] countries. In [[Afghanistan]], for instance, homosexuality carried the death penalty under the [[Taliban]]. After their fall, homosexuality was reduced from a capital crime to one that is punished with fines and prison sentences. The legal situation in the [[United Arab Emirates]], however, is unclear.

In 2009, the [[International Lesbian and Gay Association]] (ILGA) published a report entitled ''State Sponsored Homophobia 2009'',&lt;ref name="ilga.org"&gt;[http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf ILGA: 2009 Report on State Sponsored Homophobia (2009)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029181019/http://www.ilga.org/statehomophobia/ILGA_State_Sponsored_Homophobia_2009.pdf |date=October 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on research carried out by Daniel Ottosson at Södertörn University College, Stockholm, Sweden.

In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], homosexuality was considered [[sodomy]] and it was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the [[Medieval Inquisition]]s, when the sects of [[Cathars]] and [[Waldensians]] were accused of [[fornication]] and sodomy, alongside accusations of [[Satanism]]. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the [[Trial of the Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Legman "The Guilt of the Templars" (New York: Basic Books, 1966): 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of [[natural law]], arguing that "special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices."&lt;ref name="civ2"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003. Page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bisexuality was accepted as normal human behavior in Ancient China,&lt;ref name="civ"&gt;Crompton, Louis, ''Homosexuality and Civilization'', Harvard University, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; homophobia became ingrained in the late [[Qing Dynasty]] and the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] due to interactions with the Christian West,&lt;ref name="Kang1"&gt;Kang, Wenqing.

Despite there being no law in the [[communist]] People's Republic against homosexuality, "police regularly rounded up gays and lesbians." Other laws were used to prosecute homosexual people and they were "charged with hooliganism or disturbing public order."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = History of Chinese homosexuality|date= 2004-04-01 | work = Shanghai Star| accessdate= July 3, 2009 |url = http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-04/01/content_319807.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] under [[Vladimir Lenin]] decriminalized homosexuality in 1922, long before many other European countries. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet Communist Party]] effectively legalized no-fault divorce, abortion and homosexuality, when they abolished all the old [[Russian Empire|Tsarist]] laws and the initial Soviet criminal code kept these liberal sexual policies in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unity and diversity in socialist law |last=Hazard |first=John N |author2=Columbia University.

Homosexuals were one of the many groups alongside Jews that were murdered during [[the Holocaust]].

This can include extreme repression and denial coupled with forced outward displays of heteronormative behavior for the purpose of appearing or attempting to feel "normal" or "accepted." Other expressions of internalized homophobia can also be subtle. Some less overt behaviors may include making assumptions about the gender of a person's romantic partner, or about gender roles.&lt;ref name="Herek 2004"/&gt; Some researchers also apply this label to LGBT people who support "compromise" policies, such as those that find [[civil union]]s acceptable in place of [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Marriage amendments and psychological distress in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adults.

Researcher Iain R. Williamson, in his 1998 paper "Internalized Homophobia and Health Issues Affecting Lesbians and Gay Men" finds the term ''homophobia'' to be "highly problematic" but for reasons of continuity and consistency with the majority of other publications on the issue retains its use rather than using more accurate but obscure terminology.&lt;ref name="Iain"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Iain R.|date=2000-02-01|title=Internalized homophobia and health issues affecting lesbians and gay men|url=http://her.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/1/97.full|journal=Health Education Research|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=97–107|doi=10.1093/her/15.1.97|issn=0268-1153|pmid=10788206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase ''internalized sexual stigma'' is sometimes used in place to represent internalized homophobia.&lt;!-- This sentence is grammatically awkward. I'm not sure how to phrase it better though. --&gt;&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt; An internalized stigma arises when a person believes negative stereotypes about themselves, regardless of where the stereotypes come from. It can also refer to many stereotypes beyond sexuality and [[gender role]]s. Internalized homophobia can cause discomfort with and disapproval of one's own [[sexual orientation]]. [[Ego-dystonic sexual orientation]] or [[egodystonic]] homophobia, for instance, is a condition characterized by having a sexual orientation or an attraction that is at odds with one's idealized [[self-image]], causing [[anxiety]] and a desire to change one's orientation or become more comfortable with one's sexual orientation. Such a situation may cause extreme repression of homosexual desires.&lt;ref name=Adams96 /&gt; In other cases, a conscious internal struggle may occur for some time, often pitting deeply held religious or social beliefs against strong sexual and emotional desires. This discordance can cause [[clinical depression]], and a higher rate of [[suicide among LGBT youth]] (up to 30 percent of [[non-heterosexual]] youth attempt suicide) has been attributed to this phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek&gt;Journal of Adolescent Health Care, Volume 9, Issue 2, March 1988, pp. 114–122, Mental health issues of gay and lesbian adolescents, John C. Gonsiorek, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy, such as [[gay affirmative psychotherapy]], and participation in a sexual-minority affirming group can help resolve the internal conflicts, such as between religious beliefs and sexual identity.&lt;ref name=apa /&gt; Even informal therapies that address understanding and accepting of non-heterosexual orientations can prove effective.&lt;ref name=Gonsiorek /&gt; Many diagnostic "Internalized Homophobia Scales" can be used to measure a person's discomfort with their sexuality and some can be used by people regardless of gender or sexual orientation.

=== Social homophobia ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:RyanHalligan.jpg|thumb|170px|[[Suicide of Ryan Halligan|Ryan Halligan]] committed suicide due to bullying which included receiving homophobic messages]] --&gt;
The fear of being identified as gay can be considered as a form of social homophobia. Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay. Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title= Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, homophobia is allegedly rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters that is considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] male, such as [[association football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change|title= Fans' culture hard to change}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobic thoughts and feelings does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person. This interpretation alludes to the idea that a person may posit violent opposition to "the Other" as a means of establishing their own identity as part of the majority and thus gaining social validation.

Nancy J. Chodorow states that homophobia can be viewed as a method of protection of male masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.''

In some cases, the works of authors who merely have the word "Gay" in their name ([[Gay Talese]], [[Peter Gay]]) or works about things also contain the name (''[[Enola Gay]]'') have been destroyed because of a perceived pro-homosexual bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petras |first1=Kathryn |last2=Petras|first2=Ross|title=Unusually Stupid Americans (A compendium of all American Stupidity)|year=2003|publisher=Villard Books|location=New York|isbn=0-9658068-7-1|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, attitudes about people who are homosexual may vary on the basis of partisan identification. [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] are far more likely than [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to have negative attitudes about people who are gay and lesbian, according to surveys conducted by the [[National Election Studies]] from 2000 through 2004. This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or [[conservatism]] with respect to the traditional family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Democrats and Republicans—rhetoric and reality : comparing the voters in statistics and anecdotes |last=Fried |first=Joseph |year=2008 |publisher=Algora Pub |isbn=0-87586-605-0 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183179592 |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia also varies by region; statistics show that the [[Southern United States]] has more reports of anti-gay prejudice than any other region in the US.&lt;ref name=APCJ2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=P.

In a 1998 address, author, activist, and [[civil rights]] leader [[Coretta Scott King]] stated that "Homophobia is like racism and anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry in that it seeks to dehumanize a large group of people, to deny their humanity, their dignity and personhood."&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Defender, April 1, 1998, front page&lt;/ref&gt; One study of white adolescent males conducted at the [[University of Cincinnati]] by Janet Baker has been used to argue that negative feelings towards gay people are also associated with other [[discriminatory]] behaviors.&lt;ref name=jetstudy&gt;{{cite news|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0rkDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12|title= Homophobia, racism likely companions, study shows|work= Jet|date= January 10, 1994|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study, hatred of gay people, [[anti-Semitism]], and [[racism]] are "likely companions."&lt;ref name=jetstudy /&gt; Baker hypothesized "maybe it's a matter of power and looking down on all you think are at the bottom."&lt;ref name=jetstudy /&gt; A study performed in 2007 in the UK for the charity Stonewall reports that up to 90 percent of the population support [[anti-discrimination laws]] protecting gay and lesbian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/gayrights/story/0,,2086335,00.html |title=Majority support gay equality rights, poll finds|date=May 23, 2007|publisher=Guardian | location=London | first=Hugh | last=Muir | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional [[sport]]s in many countries involves homophobic expressions by star athletes and by fans. Incidents in the United States have included:
* Hockey
:The homophobic chants and attitudes of certain fans, for example the labeling of one fan who frequently dances at games as "Homo Larry", have been protested by attendees of [[New York Rangers]] games and by [[New York City Council]] Speaker [[Christine Quinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/sports/hockey/21fans.html | work=The New York Times | title=When Tradition and Taunts Collide: Gay Hockey Fans Criticize Garden | first=Katie | last=Thomas | date=March 21, 2008 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are at least two studies which indicate that homophobia may have a negative economic impact for the countries where it is widespread. In these countries there is a [[Queer migration|flight]] of their LGBT populations —with the consequent loss of talent—, as well as an avoidance of [[LGBT tourism]], that leaves the [[pink money]] in LGBT-friendlier countries. As an example, LGBT tourists contribute 6,800&amp;nbsp;million dollars every year to the [[Spanish economy]].&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=David |title=The Hidden Cost of Homophobia in Africa |url=https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/in-the-news/the-hidden-cost-of-homophobia-in-africa/ |website= the Williams institute |language=en |access-date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As soon as 2005, an editorial from the ''[[New York Times]]'' related the politics of ''[[don't ask, don't tell]]'' in the [[US Army]] with the lack of translators from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and with the delay in the translation of Arabic documents, calculated to be about 120,000 hours at the time. Since 1998, with the introduction of the new policy, about 20 Arabic translators had been expelled from the Army, specifically during the years the US was involved in wars in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Price of Homophobia |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/20/opinion/the-price-of-homophobia.html |access-date=10 December 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=20 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. V. Lee Badgett, an economist at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]], presented in March 2014 in a meeting of the [[World Bank]] the results of a study about the economical impact of homophobia in [[India]]. Only in health expenses, caused by depression, suicide, and [[HIV]] treatment, India would have spent additional 23,100 million dollars due to homophobia. On top, there would be costs caused by violence, workplace loss, rejection of the family, and bullying at school, that would result in a lower education level, lower productivity, lower wages, worse health, and a lower life expectancy among the LGBT population.&lt;ref name="Alimi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Alimi |first=Adebisi |title=The development costs of homophobia |url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/development-policy/development-costs-homophobia-302899 |language=en |date=19 June 2014 |access-date=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, she estimated for 2014 in India a loss of up to 30,800 million dollars, or 1,7 % of the Indian [[GDP]].&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Badgett |first=M.V.

The LGBT activist Adebisi Alimi, in a preliminary estimation, has calculated that the economic loss due to homophobia in [[Nigeria]] is about 1% of its GDP. Taking into account that in 2015 homosexuality is still illegal in 36 of the 54 African countries, the money loss due to homophobia in the continent could amount to hundreds of millions of dollars every year.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

A study had been conducted regarding socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact for 158 countries. They had found that prejudice against gay people the economic cost is $119.1 billion of GDP in worldwide. They had found Asian economical loss is 88.29 billion dollar for homophobia and for 8.04 billion dollar for latin America &amp; Caribbean. Economical cost of East Asia and middle asia is 10.85 billion dollar. Economical cost of Middle East and North Africa is 16.92 billion dollar. The researcher suggested that 1% decrease in the level of homophobia is associated with a 10% increase in the gross domestic product per capita.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamontagne |first1=Erik |last2=d’Elbée |first2=Marc |last3=Ross |first3=Michael W |last4=Carroll |first4=Aengus |last5=Plessis |first5=André du |last6=Loures |first6=Luiz |title=A socioecological measurement of homophobia for all countries and its public health impact |journal=European Journal of Public Health |date=3 March 2018 |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=967–972 |doi=10.1093/eurpub/cky023 |url=https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/28/5/967/4919666 |language=en |issn=1101-1262}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efforts to combat homophobia ==
[[File:Cologne Germany Cologne-Gay-Pride-2015 Parade-17b.jpg|thumb|LGBT activists at [[Cologne Pride]] carrying a banner with the flags of over 70 countries where [[LGBT rights by country or territory|homosexuality is illegal]].]]
Most international [[human rights]] organizations, such as [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]], condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the [[United Nations]] [[Human Rights Committee]] has also ruled that such laws violated the [[right to privacy]] guaranteed in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In 2008, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] issued a statement which "urges States to do away with criminal penalties against [homosexual persons]." The statement, however, was addressed to reject a resolution by the UN Assembly that would have precisely called for an end of penalties against homosexuals in the world.&lt;ref name="vatican.va"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/2008/documents/rc_seg-st_20081218_statement-sexual-orientation_en.html|title= Statement of the Holy See Delegation at the 63rd Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations on the Declaration on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity|date=18 December 2008|publisher=vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, described by CoE Secretary General as the first legal instrument in the world dealing specifically with one of the most long-lasting and difficult forms of discrimination to combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?Ref=PR277(2010)&amp;Language=lanEnglish&amp;Ver=original&amp;Site=DC&amp;BackColorInternet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorIntranet=F5CA75&amp;BackColorLogged=A9BACE|title = Council of Europe to advance human rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons|date = 2010-04-01|publisher = coe.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To combat homophobia, the LGBT community uses events such as [[gay pride parade]]s and [[political activism]] (''See [[gay pride]]).'' This is criticized by some{{Who|date=July 2009}} as counter-productive though, as gay pride parades showcase what could be seen as more "extreme" sexuality: fetish-based and gender-variant aspects of LGBT culture. One form of organized resistance to homophobia is the [[International Day Against Homophobia]] (or IDAHO),&lt;ref&gt;"[http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 Towards an international Day against Homophobia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217063659/http://ilga.org/news_results_b.asp?FileID=329 |date=2005-12-17 }}", April 10, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; first celebrated May 17, 2005 in related activities in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm 1st Annual International Day Against Homophobia to be Celebrated in over 40 Countries on May 17]", May 12, 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211224159/http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2005/5/emw239185.htm |date=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four largest countries of Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Colombia) developed mass media campaigns against homophobia since 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web|publisher=Pan American Health Organization|title=Campaigns against Homophobia in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico |url=http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=346&amp;Itemid=355 |accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to public expression, legislation has been designed, controversially, to oppose homophobia, as in [[hate speech]], [[hate crime]], and laws against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Successful preventative strategies against homophobic prejudice and bullying in schools have included teaching pupils about historical figures who were gay, or who suffered discrimination because of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/oct/26/gay-history-lessons-bullying-schools |title=Lessons on gay history cut homophobic bullying in north London school |publisher=The Guardian |date=26 October 2010 |accessdate=9 November 2010 |first=Jessica |last=Shepherd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that anti-LGBT prejudice is immoral and goes above and beyond the effects on that class of people. Warren J. Blumenfeld argues that this emotion gains a dimension beyond itself, as a tool for extreme right-wing conservatives and fundamentalist religious groups and as a restricting factor on gender-relations as to the weight associated with performing each role accordingly.&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992&gt;{{cite book|title=Homophobia : how we all pay the price |last=Blumenfeld |first=Warren J |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=978-0-8070-7919-5 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24544734}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Blumenfeld in particular stated:

{{quote|"Anti-gay bias causes young people to engage in sexual behavior earlier in order to prove that they are straight. Anti-gay bias contributed significantly to the spread of the AIDS epidemic. Anti-gay bias prevents the ability of schools to create effective honest sexual education programs that would save children's lives and prevent STDs ([[sexually transmitted diseases]])."&lt;ref name=Blumenfeld1992 /&gt;}}

Drawing upon research by [[Arizona State University]] Professor Elizabeth Segal, [[University of Memphis]] professors Robin Lennon-Dearing and Elena Delavega argued in a 2016 article published in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]'' that homophobia could be reduced through exposure (learning about LGBT experiences), explanation (understanding the different challenges faced by LGBT people), and experience (putting themselves in situations experienced by LGBT people by working alongside LGBT co-workers or volunteering at an LGBT community center).&lt;ref name="journaldosocialworkersapply"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Delavega|first1=Elena|last2=Lennon-Dearing|first2=Robin|title=Do Social Workers Apply "Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself" to Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transpersons in the South?|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|date=2016|volume=63|issue=9|pages=1171–1193|doi=10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2016.1150058|accessdate=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of meaning and purpose ==

=== Distinctions and proposed alternatives ===
Researchers have proposed alternative terms to describe prejudice and discrimination against [[LGBT]] people. Some of these alternatives show more [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]] while others do not include -''[[phobia]]'':

*''Homoerotophobia'', being a possible precursor term to ''homophobia'', was coined by Wainwright Churchill and documented in ''Homosexual Behavior Among Males'' in 1967.
*The etymology of ''homophobia'' citing the union of ''homos'' and ''phobos'' is the basis for [[LGBT history|LGBT historian]] Boswell's criticism of the term and for his suggestion in 1980 of the alternative ''homosexophobia''.&lt;ref name = BOS1980&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity, social tolerance, and homosexuality: Gay people in Western Europe from the beginning of the Christian era to the fourteenth century |first=John |last=Boswell |publisher=Chicago: University of Chicago Press |year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Homonegativity'' is based on the term ''homonegativism'' used by Hudson and Ricketts in a 1980 paper; they coined the term for their research in order to avoid ''homophobia'', which they regarded as being unscientific in its presumption of motivation.&lt;ref name=Hudson1980&gt;{{cite book|title=A strategy for the measurement of homophobia. |last=Hudson |first=WW |last2=Ricketts |first2=WA |journal=[[Journal of Homosexuality]] |pages=357–72 |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1980 |issn=0091-8369 |oclc=115532547 |doi=10.1300/J082v05n04_02 |pmid=7204951}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Heterosexism]]'' refers to a system of negative attitudes, bias, and discrimination in favour of opposite-sex sexual orientation and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;13&lt;/sup&gt; It can include the presumption that everyone is heterosexual or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[norm (sociology)|norm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/r_motclef/index800_1.asp |title=Avis au public |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |accessdate=2010-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20030402061812/http://www.granddictionnaire.com/btml/fra/R_MotClef/index800_1.asp |archivedate=2003-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior.
*''Sexual prejudice'' – Researcher at the [[University of California, Davis]] [[Gregory M. Herek]] preferred ''sexual prejudice'' as being descriptive, free of presumptions about motivations, and lacking value judgments as to the irrationality or immorality of those so labeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Herek GM |title=The context of [[Gay bashing|anti-gay]] violence: Notes on cultural and psychological heterosexism |journal=J Interpers Violence |volume=5 |pages=316–33 |year=1990 |doi=10.1177/088626090005003006|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herek |first=Gregory M. |title=The psychology of sexual prejudice |journal=Curr Dir Psychol Sci |volume=9 |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229101852/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/Current_Directions_preprint.pdf |archivedate=2006-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He compared ''homophobia'', ''heterosexism'', and ''sexual prejudice'', and, in preferring the third term, noted that ''homophobia'' was "probably more widely used and more often criticized." He also observed that "Its critics note that homophobia implicitly suggests that antigay attitudes are best understood as an irrational fear and that they represent a form of individual [[psychopathology]] rather than a socially reinforced prejudice."

=== Opposition to the term ''homophobia'' ===
People and groups have objected to the use of the term ''homophobia''.&lt;ref name="Banks2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Banks|first=James A.|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yDDqLBBk7BcC&amp;pg=PA1093|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2012-05-24|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-8152-1|pages=1093–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Eric|title=On Brokeback Mountain: Meditations About Masculinity, Fear, and Love in the Story and the Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2IM8prnsxQC&amp;pg=PR42|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2008-03-31|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-2165-8|pages=42–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Warhol-DownHerndl2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warhol-Down|first1=Robyn|last2=Herndl|first2=Diane Price|title=Feminisms Redux: An Anthology of Literary Theory and Criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZuisMJOOsbEC&amp;pg=PA196|accessdate=17 December 2012|date=2009-11-30|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4620-9|pages=196–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Non-neutral phrasing ====
Use of ''homophobia'', ''homophobic'', and ''homophobe'' has been criticized as [[pejorative]] against [[LGBT rights opposition|LGBT rights opponents]]. [[behavioral science|Behavioral scientists]] [[William O'Donohue]] and Christine Caselles stated in 1993 that "as [''homophobia''] is usually used, [it] makes an illegitimately pejorative evaluation of certain open and debatable value positions, much like the former disease construct of homosexuality" itself, arguing that the term may be used as an ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument against those who advocate values or positions of which the user does not approve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William |last1=O'Donohue|first2=Christine |last2=Caselles |title=Homophobia: Conceptual, definitional, and value issues |journal=J Psychopathol Behav Assess |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=September 1993 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0264m864t146585/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Gary Colwell stated in 1999 that "the boundary of the term 'homophobia' is made so elastic that it can stretch around, not just phobias, but every kind of rational fear as well; and not just around every kind of fear, but also around every critical posture or idea that anyone may have about the practice of homosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gary Colwell|title=Turning the Tables with 'Homophobia' |work=[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]|publisher=Wiley |date=1999|jstor = 24354374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the [[Associated Press Stylebook]] was revised to advise against using non-clinical words with the suffix -phobia, including homophobia, in "political and social contexts." AP Deputy Standards Editor Dave Minthorn said the word homophobia suggests a severe mental disorder, and that it could be substituted with "anti-gay" or similar phrasing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP nixes 'homophobia', 'ethnic cleansing'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2012/11/ap-nixes-homophobia-ethnic-cleansing-150315.html|last=Byers|first=Dylan|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Words with negative power|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-12-05/news/ct-oped-1205-page-20121205_1_homophobia-islamophobia-fear|first=Clarence|last=Page|accessdate=16 December 2012|date=5 December 2012|work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP's decision was criticized in some media outlets, especially those in the [[Gay media|LGBT area]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Huffington Post discussion|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/05/associated-press-ban-homophobia-discussion_n_2245697.html|accessdate=16 December 2012|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=5 December 2012|first=Noah|last=Michelson}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that homophobia did not necessarily have to be interpreted in a strict clinical sense.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-ap-homophobia-style-book-20121128,0,2905541.story|title=No more 'homophobia'?

The term ''heterophobia'' is sometimes used to describe [[reverse discrimination]] or negative attitudes towards heterosexual people and opposite-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; The scientific use of ''heterophobia'' in [[sexology]] is restricted to few researchers, notably those who question [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s sex research.&lt;ref&gt;''Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination of a People. An Investigation Into the Human Sexuality Research of Alfred C. Kinsey, Wardell B. Pomeroy, Clyde E. Martin, and Paul H. Gebhard'' by Judith A. Reisman and Edward W. Eichel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Sexuality'' by Robert T. Francoeur&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the existence or extent of heterophobia is mostly unrecognized by sexologists.&lt;ref name="noonan1999" /&gt; Beyond sexology there is no consensus as to the meaning of the term because it is also used to mean "fear of the opposite" such as in [[Pierre-André Taguieff]]'s ''The Force of Prejudice: On Racism and Its Doubles'' (2001).

Referring to the debate on both meaning and use, [[State University of New York|SUNY]] lecturer Raymond J. Noonan, in his 1999 presentation to The [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS) and the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, and Therapists (AASECT) Conference,&lt;ref name="noonan1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.bway.net/rjnoonan/Conf1999.html|title=Heterophobia: The Evolution of an Idea|author=Raymond J. Noonan|date=November 6, 1999|publisher=Dr. Ray Noonan’s 1999 Conference Presentations|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The term heterophobia is confusing for some people for several reasons. On the one hand, some look at it as just another of the many me-too social constructions that have arisen in the pseudoscience of victimology in recent decades. (Many of us recall John Money’s 1995 criticism of the ascendancy of victimology and its negative impact on sexual science.) Others look at the parallelism between heterophobia and homophobia, and suggest that the former trivializes the latter... For others, it is merely a curiosity or parallel-construction word game. But for others still, it is part of both the recognition and politicization of heterosexuals' cultural interests in contrast to those of gays—particularly where those interests are perceived to clash.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stephen M. White and Louis R. Franzini introduced the related term ''heteronegativism'' to refer to the considerable range of negative feelings that some gay individuals may hold and express toward heterosexuals. This term is preferred to ''heterophobia'' because it does not imply extreme or irrational fear.&lt;ref name="Franzini"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Heteronegativism?

'''''I'm too sad to tell you''''' (1970–71) is a [[mixed media]] art work by [[conceptual art]]ist [[Bas Jan Ader]].&lt;ref name = "Bomb"&gt;[http://bombmagazine.org/article/5672/bas-jan-ader-please-don-t-leave-me-in-search-of-the-miraculous-bas-jan-ader-discovery-file   Nato Thompson, “Bas Jan Ader Please Don't Leave Me”, [[Bomb (magazine)]], Summer 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The work includes a three-minute black-and-white silent film, still photographs and a post card all related to him crying for an unknown reason.  The photographs include both a short hair version and a long hair version.&lt;ref name = "NPR"&gt;[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/20/transcript [[Ira Glass]], “This American Life 20: From a Distance”, [[NPR]] radio transcript, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt; The post cards were mailed to his friends with the inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectiveexperience.org/cindy/ader.html Cindy Loehr, “Bas Jan Ader: Retrospective”, ''[[New Art Examiner]]'', March 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was an original, now lost, version of the film called ''Cry Claremont''.  It was shown in the [[Pomona College|Pomona College Gallery]] in [[Claremont, California]] in 1971-72.&lt;ref name="MOMA"&gt;Christophe Cherix, ''In &amp; Out of Amsterdam: Travels in Conceptual Art, 1960-1976'', MOMA, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-87070-753-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason for his sadness is never stated in the work.&lt;ref name="Dumbadze"/&gt;

==Composition and history==
The work's original form was a silent black and white movie shot outdoors in 1970 apparently in front of Ader's house.  The movie was shown in Claremont college, but has since been lost.&lt;ref name = MOMA/&gt;  A still from the movie, however, was extracted and made into a post card.  It shows Ader with his head in his hand crying.  The back of the post card had the written inscription “I'm too sad to tell you”.  It was dated September 13, 1970.  The card was mailed to a number of Ader's friends. The image has also been reproduced in a photographic version with the inscription written in the lower right hand corner.  The post card and photograph have become iconic of the work and a symbol that many artists have emulated (see Influence below).  
	
A second version of the film was made in Amsterdam in 1971.  This was more of a performance with Ader appearing to be calm before the shooting and rubbing his eyes during the filming to produce tears and build emotional intensity.  Ten minutes of film was shot with the final version edited to about three and a half minutes.  The edited version captures Ader at his most anguished.  His face is framed closely.  There is no introduction or conclusion, no reason given and no relief from the anguish that is presented.  Critics have said that it is hard not to be affected by the film, with its offering of “raw passion to anyone willing to watch”.&lt;ref name = "Dumbadze"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDouV4K9cEC&amp;pg=PA152 Alexander Dumbadze, “Bas Jan Ader: Death is Elsewhere”, University of Chicago Press, 2013, p 152 et seq.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical interpretation==
The work has inspired many critical interpretations and analysis.

There seems to be an overall tension between the sincerity of the artist's captured emotions and performance aspects of the works.  Artists James Roberts and [[Collier Schorr]], for example, feel the works are at once intensely personal and yet very arbitrary.  There was a true reason for Ader's sadness, but that is not shared with us.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;[http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/bas_jan_ader/ James Roberts and Collier Schorr, “Bas Jan Ader”, ''frieze'' (magazine), June 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bruce Hainley, contributing editor to [[Artforum]], thinks the reasons for his sadness are beside the point.  In his view, Ader walks a fine line between sincerity (the sadness is real) and melodrama (the work is staged multiple times).&lt;ref name = "Hainley"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Legend+of+the+fall.-a054169956 Bruce Hainley, "Legend of the fall." Artforum International , Vol. 37, No. 7, March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;  Jörg Heiser, coeditor of [[Frieze (magazine)]], views the work as an ironic statement of the artist taking on all of the embarrassment of the expressed emotion while leaving it open as to whether or not the viewer takes on the embarrassment as well.&lt;ref name = "Heiser"&gt;[http://www.artandresearch.org.uk/v2n1/heiser.html , “All of a Sudden: Things that Matter in Contemporary Art”, Art &amp; Research, A Journal of Ideas, Contexts, and Methods, Summer 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women reviewers have been more critical.  Jennifer Doyle in her book ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'' feels the work may be seen as real due to the tradition of the “melancholy white male artist”. She sees this in contrast to how a woman would have been perceived as either acting or in hysterics.&lt;ref name = "Doyle"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j-8DAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=%22I%27m+too+sad+to+tell+you%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9e_zU7STHoj_yQTCu4LQDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22I%27m%20too%20sad%20to%20tell%20you%22&amp;f=false Jennifer Doyle, ''Hold it Against Me: Difficulty and Emotion in Contemporary Art'',  Duke University Press, 12 March 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  Journalist Betty van Garrel goes so far as to say (in translation) "Ader is a sentimental loser, a romantic softie, a problem case and not even original in that."&lt;ref name = "LAS"&gt;[http://www.lostatsea.net/feature.phtml?fid=2150744464607d6c85df96 Samuel Klaus, "Bas Jan Ader, Lost at Sea", ''LAS Magazine'', 7 September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''I'm too sad to tell you'' has influenced a large number of artists, with many composing interpretations and [[homage (arts)|homages]] to the work.  These include:
*Alexander Brandt on his goal of imitating Ader's pose in his own self-portrait: 
::''“My appropriation of this visual has a strategic aim. I myself do not fit the cliché of a tragic artist.... It is the reactions it will produce with the audience that interest me.”'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feipingguo.com/sad0.html Alexander Brandt "I'm too sad to tell you" (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[David Horvitz]] on the influence for his book ''Sad Depressed People'':
::''"If you look at my book, all the images are with people's hands to their faces...this was actually a direct reference to Ader's image."'' &lt;ref name="andreview"&gt;[http://chertberlin.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/david_andreview.pdf Rachel Peddersen “In conversation with David Horvitz”, Andreview, Fall &amp; Winter 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweigard|work=Ideokinesis.com|url=http://www.ideokinesis.com/pioneers/sweigard/sweigard.htm|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some dance schools have integrated it into a standard [[somatics]] protocol for all dancers because it is thought to optimize motor control and performance by using periods of rest constructively.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Teaching at the Interface of Dance Science and Somatics|last1=Geber|first1=Pamela|last2=Wilson|first2=Margaret|year=2010|journal=Journal of Dance Medicine &amp; Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=52–53|pmid=20507721}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known among followers as "the Work",&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{citation|title=Imaginary Movements: Transform your body and your yoga practice with these nine visualizations from the ideokinesis system - all without moving a muscle|last=Rosen|first=Richard|date=1 April 1998|journal=Yoga Journal|issue=139|pages=79–87|issn=0191-0965}}&lt;/ref&gt; "ideokinesis" is sometimes used interchangeably with other terms, such as "mental practice", "mental rehearsal", "visuomotor behavior rehearsal", "covert rehearsal", and "ideokinetic facilitation", among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Motor imagery for stroke rehabilitation: current research as a guide to clinical practice|last=Batson|first=G|year=2004|journal=Alternative &amp; Complementary Therapies|volume=10|issue=2|pages=84–89|doi=10.1089/107628004773933325|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/107628004773933325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mabel Elsworth Todd|Mabel Todd]] conceived the ideokinesis approach; Barbara Clark and Lulu Sweigard,&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin|first=Eric|title=Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery|origyear=1996|year=2012|location=Champaign, IL|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736067898|pages=4, 6–7, 277|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22Dynamic%20alignment%20through%20imagery%22&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others contributed to its early evolution;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideokinesis.com/pioneers/intro/pioneers_intro.htm |title=Pioneers |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, André Bernard, Irene Dowd, Erick Hawkins, Pamela Matt, [[Eric Franklin]] and others lent their influence.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

Sweigard borrowed the word ''ideokinesis'', composed by two Greek words: ideo (thought) and kinesis (movement), from Bonpensière, a piano teacher, who applied imagery to his methodology. Ideokinesis can be translated roughly as "the image or thought as facilitator of movement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/ideokinesis-creative-body-alignment-an-introduction-to-ideokinesis/oclc/37473981&amp;referer=brief_results/ Bernard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49506">An '''internet relationship''' is a relationship between people who have met [[online]], and in many cases know each other only via the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last3=Crowcroft | first3=Jon | last2= Bodaghi |first2=Mansoureh|last1=Quercia |first1=Daniele|title=Loosing friends on facebook|journal=ACM Web Science Conference|url=http://delcampovillares.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/websci_loosing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online relationships are similar in many ways to [[pen pal]] relationships. This relationship can be romantic, platonic, or even based on business affairs. An internet relationship (or online relationship) is generally sustained for a certain amount of time before being titled a relationship, just as in-person relationships. The major difference here is that an internet relationship is sustained via computer or online service, and the individuals in the relationship may or may not ever meet each other in person. Otherwise, the term is quite broad and can include relationships based upon text, video, audio, or even virtual character. This relationship can be between people in different regions, different countries, different sides of the world, or even people who reside in the same area but do not communicate in person.

== Technological advances ==
According to J. Michael Jaffe, author of ''Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls'', "the Internet was originally established to expedite communication between governmental scientists and defense experts, and was not at all intended to be the popular 'interpersonal mass medium' it has become",&lt;ref name="Jaffe2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|title=Gender, Pseudonyms, and CMC: Masking Identities and Baring Souls|last=Jaffe|first=J. Michael|publisher=University of Michigan|work=Paper for 45th Annual Conference of the International Communication Association, 1995, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA|accessdate=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901232435/http://www.fragment.nl/mirror/Jaffe1995/|archivedate=1 September 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet new and revolutionary devices enabling the mass public to communicate online are constantly being developed and released.

Rather than having many devices for different uses and ways of interacting, communicating online is more accessible and cheaper by having an Internet function built into one device, such as [[mobile phone]]s, [[Tablet computer|tablets]], [[laptop]]s, and [[smartphone]]s. Other ways of communicating online with these devices are via services and applications such as [[Email]], [[Skype]], [[iChat]], [[instant messaging]] programs, [[social networking service]]s, asynchronous discussion groups, online games, [[virtual worlds]] and the [[World Wide Web]].

Some of these ways of communicating online are asynchronous (meaning not in real time), such as [[YouTube]] and some are synchronous (immediate communication), such as [[Twitter]]. Synchronous communication occurs when two or more participants are interacting in real time via voice or text chat.&lt;ref name="Wood, A and Smith, M.2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Online communication : linking technology, identity and culture|last=Wood|first=Andrew F.|last2=Smith|first2=Matthew J.|publisher=Erlbaum|year=2001|isbn=0-8058-3731-0|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of relationships ==
Many types of internet relationships are possible in today's world of technology.

=== Internet dating ===
Internet dating is very relevant in the lives of many individuals worldwide.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yENNc7Fp3vQC&amp;dq=online+dating+sites+in+the+90s|title=Social networking communities and e-dating services: concepts and implications|last=Romm- Livermore|first=Celia|publisher=Idea Group Inc. (IGI)|year=2009|isbn=9781605661049|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major benefit in the rise of Internet dating is the decrease in prostitution. People no longer need to search on the streets to find casual relationships. They can find them online if that is what they desire.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt; Internet dating websites offer matchmaking services for people to find love or whatever else they may be looking for. The creation of the internet and its progressive innovations have opened up doors for people to meet other people who they may very well have never met otherwise.&lt;ref name="E-Dating2" /&gt;

==== Dating website innovations ====
Although the availability of uploading videos to the internet is not a new innovation, it has been made easier since 2008 thanks to [[YouTube]]. YouTube began the surge of video streaming sites in 2005 and within three years, smaller web developers started implementing video sharing on their sites. Internet dating sites have benefitted greatly since the surge in easiness and accessibility of picture and video uploading.&lt;ref name="online videos2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usir.salford.ac.uk/2279/1/Proceedings_amcis-0635-2009-File001.pdf|title=Performing the Discourse of Sexuality Online Foucault, Butler, and Video-sharing on Sexual Social Networking Sites|last=Kreps|first=David G.|publisher=Proceedings of the Fifteenth Americas Conference on Information Systems,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Videos and pictures are equally important for most personal profiles. These profiles can be found on sites used for [[interpersonal relationships]] other than dating as well. "The body, although graphically absent, does not have to be any less present."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; Older and less advanced sites usually still allow, and often require, each user to upload a picture. Newer and more advanced sites offer the possibility of [[streaming media]] live via the user's profile for the site. The inclusion of videos and pictures has become almost a necessity for sexual social networking sites to maintain the loyalty of their members.&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt; It is appealing to internet users to be able to view and share videos, especially when forming relationships or friendships.&lt;ref name="Online dating has changed everything, author says2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jason|first=Sharon|date=January 23, 2013|title=Online dating has changed everything, author says|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/01/23/love-algorithms-online-dating/1856853/|journal=USA Today|issue=Internet Dating}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Who uses online dating sites ====
According to an article in the ''New York Times'', mediated matchmaking has been around since the mid-1800s.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaefer|first=Laura J.|date=14 February 2003|title=Looking for Love, Online or On Paer|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;oq=Looking+for+love%2C+online+or+on+paper.+The+New+York+Times+Shaefer&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=1&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;gs_l=hp.3...8030.10040.1.10149.9.9.0.0.0.0.92.585.8.8.0.crf.1.3Rk45Pdpew4&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=fb8265af22147407&amp;biw=1146&amp;bih=598|journal=The New York Times|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online dating was made available in the mid-1990s, with the creation of the first dating sites.&lt;ref name="Brooks2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinepersonalswatch.com/files/idea-white-paper-final-review-copy-only-updated-1-19.pdf|title=How has Internet dating changed society?  An Insider's Look|last=Brooks|first=Mark|publisher=Courtland Brooks|work=Scholarly Article|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dating sites create a space for liberation of sexuality. According to Sam Yagan of [[OkCupid]], "the period between New Year's Day and Valentine's Day is [our] busiest six weeks of the year".&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; Changes that online dating companies have created include not only the increase of pickiness in singles, but the rise in interracial marriages and spread the acceptance of homosexual individuals. Dating sites "are a place where sexual minorities, inter-sexed people and gay people are enjoying a newly found freedom".&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; Several studies have shown the availability of online dating to produce a greater closeness and intimacy between individuals because it circumvents barriers that face-to-face interactions might have.  "Participating in personal relationships online allow for almost full freedom from power relations in the offline/real world."&lt;ref name="online videos2" /&gt;

A plethora of virtual sexual identities are represented in online profiles. The amount of personal information users are being asked to provide is constantly increasing. More and more online users are starting to explore and experiment with aspects of their sexual identities, whereas before, they may have felt uncomfortable due to social constraints or fear of possible repercussions.&lt;ref name="Electronic Cloak2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=199529|title=Electronic Cloak: Secret Sexual Deviance in Cybersociety|last=DiMarco|first=Heather|publisher=William Publishing|year=2003|location=Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most internet sites containing personal profiles require individuals to fill in "personal information" sections. Often these sections include a series of multiple choice questions. Due to the anonymity of these virtual profiles, individuals are more frequent to 'role'-play at being one of the predefined 'types', although offline, reservations may inhibit the individual from sharing true answers.

There have also been many studies done to observe online daters and their reason for turning to the internet to look for romantic partners. According to Robert J. Brym and Rhonda L. Lenton, users of online games, websites, and other virtual communities are encouraged to conceal their identities and learn things about themselves that they never knew before.&lt;ref name="canada2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.bestsoftworks.com/docs/loveonline.pdf|title=Love Online: A Report On Digital Dating in Canada|last=Brym|first=Robert J.|publisher=Msn.ca|year=2001|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a concealed identity, an online user can be whoever they want to be at that exact moment. They have the ability to venture outside of their comfort zone and act as someone completely different.

The ''Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication'' reports the results of a study conducted by Robert J. Stephure, Susan D. Boon, Stacy L. MacKinnon, and Vicki L. Deveau on types of relationships online participants were seeking. They concluded that "when asked what they were looking for in an online relationship, the considerable majority of participants expressed interest in seeking fun, companionship, and someone to talk to. Most also reported interests in developing casual friendships and dating relationships with online partners. Substantially fewer reported using the Internet for the specific purposes of identifying potential sexual or marital partners."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Boon|first2=Susan D.|last3=MacKinnon|first3=Stacey L.|last4=Deveau|first4=Vicki L.|year=2009|title=Internet Initiated Relationships: Associations Between Age and Involvement in Online Dating|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=14|issue=3|pages=658–681|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2009.01457.x|last1=Stephure|first1=Robert J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2012 looked at about 19,000 married people and those who met their spouse online said their marriage was more satisfying than those who met their spouse offline. Plus, marriages that began online were less likely to end in separation or divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business Insider|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/happy-marriage-online-dating-2017-10|accessdate=31 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faye Mishna, Alan McLuckie, and Michael Saini, co-authors of the Oxford Journal article ''Real-World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse'', reported the results of their research and observation of over 35,000 individuals between the ages of 6 and 24 who have been or currently are a part of an internet relationship. Of the final 346 posts chosen to be included in the study, the average age of online users sharing information about their online relationship(s) was 14 years old.&lt;ref name="Abuse2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mishna|first=Faye|date=June 2009|title=Real- World Dangers in an Online Reality: A Qualitative Study Examining Online Relationships and Cyber Abuse|url=http://swr.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/2/107.full.pdf|journal=The Oxford Journal|volume=33|issue=2|author2=Alan McLuckie|author3=Michael Saini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overwhelming result was that children and youth consider their online relationships to be just as "real" as their offline relationships. The study also showed that the internet plays a crucial role in most sexual and romantic experiences of adolescent users.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt;

==== Success of dating websites and social networks ====
Canaan Partners have reported that the dating industry brings in an estimate of 3-4 billion dollars yearly from membership fees and advertisements.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt; The range of dating sites has expanded vastly over the past two decades. There are dating websites that focus on the [[matchmaking]] of certain groups of people based on religion, sexual preference, race, etc.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

The average life expectancy has been on a rise, leaving many young singles feeling as if they have plenty of time to find a [[life partner]]. This opens up time to travel and experience things without the burden of a relationship. As of 1996, more than 20% of Canadians "were not living in the same census subdivision as they were five years earlier"&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; and as of 1998, more than half of employed Canadians worried "they [did] not have enough time to spend with their family and friends".&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt; Due to an increase in many businesses requiring their employees to travel, singles, often young professionals, find online dating websites to be the perfect answer to their "problem", states Brym and Lenton.

Erik Shipmon, author of “Why Do People Date Online?", exclaims, "the Internet is the ultimate singles' bar—without the noise, the drunks, and the high cost of all those not-so-happy hours. Nor, thanks to online dating membership sites, do you have to depend on your friends and family to hook you up with people they think would be perfect for you—and who wouldn't be perfect for, well, anyone, which is why they are still unattached”.&lt;ref name="internet like singles bar2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cupidnights.com/dating-advice/article-12.html|title=Why do people date online|last=Shipmon|first=Erik|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cybersex ====
Some people who are in an online relationship also participate in [[cybersex]], which is a virtual sex encounter in which two or more individuals who are connected remotely via computer network send each other sexually explicit messages describing a sexual experience. This can also include individuals communicating sexually via video or audio. Some websites offer a cybersex service, where a patron pays the website owner in exchange for an online sexual experience with another person.

Cybersex sometimes includes real life masturbation. The quality of a cybersex encounter typically depends upon the participants' abilities to evoke a vivid, visceral mental picture in the minds of their partners. Imagination and suspension of disbelief are also critically important. Cybersex can occur either within the context of existing or intimate relationships, e.g. among lovers who are geographically separated, or among individuals who have no prior knowledge of one another and meet in virtual spaces or cyberspaces and may even remain anonymous to one another. In some contexts cybersex is enhanced by the use of a webcam to transmit real-time video of the partners.

=== Social networking relationships ===
Social networking has enabled people to connect with each other via the internet. Sometimes, members of a [[social networking service]] do know all, or many of their "friends" (Facebook) or "connections" (LinkedIn) etc. in person. However, sometimes internet relationships are formed through these services, including but not limited to: [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]], [[Google Plus]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Pinterest]], [[DeviantArt]] and [[Xanga]].

"Social networking service" is a very broad term, branching out to websites based on many different aspects. One aspect that is possible on all social networking sites is the possibility of an internet relationship. These sites enable users to search for new connections based on location, education, experiences, hobbies, age, gender, and more. This allows individuals meeting each other to already have some characteristic in common. These sites usually allow for people who do not know each other to "add" each other as a connection or friend and to send each other messages. This connection can lead to more communication between two individuals. An immense amount of information about the individuals can be found directly on their social network profile. Proving those individuals include plentiful and accurate information about themselves, people in online relationships can find out much about each other by viewing profiles and "about me's".  Communication between individuals can become more frequent, thus forming some type of relationship via the internet. This relationship can turn into an acquaintance, a friendship, a romantic relationship, or even a business partnership.

=== Online gaming ===
Online gaming elicits the introduction of many different types of people in one interface. A common type of online game where individuals form relationships is the MMORPG, or a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]. Some examples of MMORPGs are [[World of Warcraft]], [[EverQuest]], [[SecondLife]], [[Final Fantasy XI|Final Fantasy Online]], and [[Minecraft]] (see [[List of massively multiplayer online role-playing games]].) These games enable individuals to create a character that represents them and interact with other characters played by real individuals, while at the same time carrying out the tasks and goals of the actual game.

Online games other than MMORPGs can elicit internet relationships as well. Card games such as [[Online poker|poker]] and board games like [[Pictionary]] have been transformed into virtual interfaces that allow an individual to play against people across the internet, as well as chatting with them. [[Virtual pet site]]s such as [[Webkinz]] and [[Neopets]] are another type of popular online game that allow individuals to socialize with other players.

Games create social spaces for people of various ages, with userbases often crossing age brackets. Most of these games enable individuals to chat with each other, as well as form groups and [[Gaming clan|clans]]. This interaction can lead to further communication, turning into a friendship or romantic relationship.

=== Online forums and chatrooms ===
An [[Internet forum]] is a website that includes conversations in the form of posted messages. Forums can be for general chatting or can be broken down into categories and topics. They can be used to ask questions, post opinions, or debate topics. Forums include their own jargon, for example a conversation is a "thread". Different forums also have different lingo and styles of communicating.

There are religion forums, music forums, car forums, and countless other topics. These forums elicit communication between individuals no matter the location, gender, ethnicity, etc. although some do include age restrictions. Through these forums people may comment on each other's topics or threads, and with further communication form a friendship, partnership, or romantic relationship.

=== Professional relationships ===
Even in work settings, the introduction of the internet has established easier and sometimes more practical forms of communicating. Compared to traditional communication in business, communication through internet can be more efficient in the aspect of time-saving. The internet is often referred to as a vehicle for [[investor relations]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hedlin|first=Pontus|date=1 July 1999|title=The Internet as a vehicle for investor relations: the Swedish case|journal=European Accounting Review|volume=8|issue=2|pages=373–381|doi=10.1080/096381899336104}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "electronic highway" for business transactions in the United States.&lt;ref name="Business2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Doing More Business on the Internet: How the Electronic Highway Is Transforming American Companies|last=Cronin|first=Mary|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1995|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet has increased organizational involvement by facilitating the flow of information between face-to-face meetings and allowing for people to arrange meetings at virtually any given time. Socially, it has stimulated positive change in people's lives by creating new forms of online interaction and enhancing offline relationships worldwide, allowing for better and more efficient. In the real world, companies which are considered as leading companies in the world already introduced efficient ways of communication based on internet. (See [[business communication]]&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt;)

== Advantages ==
For more [[intimate relationship]]s, research has shown that personal disclosures create a greater sense of intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurenceau|first=JP|date=May 1998|title=Intimacy as an interpersonal process: the importance of self-disclosure, partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness in interpersonal exchanges|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=74|issue=5|pages=1238–51|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1238|pmid=9599440|author2=Barrett, LF|author3=Pietromonaco, PR}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gives a sense of [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]] and equality, which people search for in a relationship, and this is often easier to achieve online than face to face, although not all disclosures are responded to positively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pennebaker|first=James W.|year=1989|title=Confession, Inhibition, and Disease|journal=Department of Psychology|series=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|location=Dallas, TX|publisher=Southern Methodist University|volume=22|pages=211–244|doi=10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60309-3|isbn=9780120152223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are able to engage in more self-disclosure than an average interaction, because a person can share their inner thoughts, feelings and beliefs and be met with less disapproval and fewer sanctions online than is the case in face-to-face encounters.

Online, barriers that might stand in the way of a potential relationship such as [[physical attractiveness]], [[social anxiety]] and [[stuttering]] do not exist. Whereas those could hinder an individual in face-to-face encounters, an Internet interaction negates this and allows the individual freedom. Research has shown that stigmas such as these can make a large impact on first impressions in face-to-face meeting, and this does not apply with an online relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKenna|first=Katelyn Y. A.|date=1 September 1999|title=Causes and Consequences of Social Interaction on the Internet: A Conceptual Framework|journal=Media Psychology|volume=1|issue=3|pages=249–269|doi=10.1207/s1532785xmep0103_4|author2=Bargh, John A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, as the internet has become a worldwide phenomenon, many people can interact with others around the world, or find someone who fits their radar or their type, if there is no one who they find physically or emotionally attractive in their own area. The internet allows for interaction of many different people so there is greater chance of finding someone more attractive. The Internet "enhances face-to-face and telephone communication as network members become more aware of each others' needs and stimulate their relationships through more frequent contact".&lt;ref name="Wellman2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wellman|first=Barry|date=1 November 2001|title=Does the Internet Increase, Decrease, or Supplement Social Capital? : Social Networks, Participation, and Community Commitment|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/45/3/436.full.pdf+html|journal=[[American Behavioral Scientist]]|volume=45|issue=3|pages=436–455|doi=10.1177/00027640121957286|author2=ANAbel Quan Haase|author3=James Witte|author4=Keith Hampton|accessdate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Joseph Walter's Social Information Processing Theory, computer-mediated communications can work for people.&lt;ref&gt;http://crx.sagepub.com/content/21/4/460.short&lt;/ref&gt;  While online interactions take roughly four times longer than face-to-face interactions, this gives users the opportunity to evaluate and the time to think, making sure they say the perfect response.  Thus, chronemics is the only verbal clue available to digital communications.  With the focus on conversation and not appearance, digital interactions over time will develop higher levels of intimacy than face-to-face interactions.

In ''The Forms of Capital''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Pierre |last=Bourdieu |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm |title=The Forms of Capital |year=1986 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Bourdieu]] defines social capital as "the aggregate of the actual or potential resources which are linked to possession of a durable network of more or less institutionalized relationships of mutual acquaintance and recognition."

Social capital researchers have found&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Bargh|first1=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y. A.|title=THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL LIFE|url=http://www.uam.es/personal_pdi/psicologia/pei/download/bargh2004.pdf|publisher=The annual review of psychology|date=11 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that “various forms of social capital, including ties with friends and neighbors, are related to indices of psychological well-being, such as self-esteem and satisfaction with life”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Ellison|first1=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|title=The Benefits of Facebook “Friends:” Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x/full
|publisher=Journal of computer-mediated communication|date= July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to improve the [[social capital]].

More than helping to improve the [[social capital]], the use of a [[social networking service]] could help to retain it. For instance, Cummings, Lee and Kraut have shown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite books|last1=Cummings|first1=J.|last2=Lee|first2=J.|last3=Kraut|first3=R.|title=Communication technology and friendship during the transition from high school to college|publisher=Oxford University Press|date= 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; that communication services like [[instant messaging]] “help college students to remain close to their high school friends after they leave home for college”.

== Disadvantages ==
The Internet provides the opportunity for [[misrepresentation]], particularly in the early stages of a relationship when commitment is low, and self-presentation and enhancement agendas are paramount.&lt;ref name="Tice et al.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Butler|first2=J. L.|last3=Muarven|first3=M. B.|last4=Stillwell|first4=A.M.|year=1995|title=When modesty prevails: differential favourability of self-representation to friends and strangers|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=|pages=1120–38|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.6.1120|last1=Tice|first1=D. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving many complaints about his social networking site [[Ashley Madison]], founder Noel Biderman responded to accusations that his and other similar [[cyber-dating]] sites are at fault for the "rising divorce rates and growth in casual dating". Biderman argued that the idea for Ashleymadison.com came to him when he realized the growing number of people on "mainstream dating sites" were married or in a relationship but posing as singles in order to start an affair.&lt;ref name="Start of online dating2" /&gt;

In an empirical study of commitment and misrepresentation on the internet Cornwell and Lundgren (2001)&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Lundgren|first2=D. C.|year=2001|title=Love on the Internet: involvement and misrepresentation in romantic relationships in cyberspace vs. real-space|url=|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=17|issue=|pages=197–211|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(00)00040-6|last1=Cornwell|first1=B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; surveyed 80 chat-room users. Half about their 'realspace' relationships, and half about their cyberspace relationships.  They found that 'realspace' relationships were considered to be more serious, with greater feelings of commitment, than the cyber-relationship participants.  Both groups, however, reported similar levels of satisfaction and potential for 'emotional growth' with regard to romantic relationships.  Cornwell and Lundgren&lt;ref name="Cornwell, B. and Lundgren, D. C.(2001).2" /&gt; went on to ask about whether the participants had misrepresented themselves to their partner in a number of areas: their interests (e.g. hobbies, musical tastes); their age; their background; their appearance and 'mis-presentation of yourself in any other way' (p.&amp;nbsp;203). Participants responded using either yes or no to each question, and their score was summed into a misrepresentation measure. The results can be found below:&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2"&gt;Joinson, A. 2003. Understanding the Psychology of Internet Behaviour. Palgrave Macmillan. p.3. {{ISBN|0-333-98468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dangers of internet relationships ===
An often forgotten aspect on online interactions is the possible danger present. The option for an individual to conceal their identity may be harmless in many cases, but it can also lead to extremely dangerous situations. Hidden identities are often used in cases of [[Cyber-bullying|cyberbullying]] and [[cyberstalking]]. Concealing person's true identity is also a technique that can be used to manipulate their new online [[friend]] or [[Sexual partner|lover]] into convincing them that they are someone completely different. This is something most [[online predator]]s do in order to prey on victims. Despite the awareness of dangers, Mishna et al. found children and youth to still partake in online relationships with little care or concern for negative effects.&lt;ref name="Abuse2" /&gt; Brym and Lenton also claim that "although [their] true identities are usually concealed, they sometimes decide to meet and interact in real life". From these dangers, people seriously have considered a kind of policy forcing people to use their real name only and open their personal information. By doing this, people are not going to do harmful to others because their information can be checked by others.&lt;ref name="canada2" /&gt;

Engaging in internet relationships is also risky because the information placed online about an individual does not have to be accurate. An individual can formulate an entirely different persona and pose as this person as long as they desire. This can be hurtful to individuals who are honest about their identities and believe that they are in a positive relationship or friendship with the individual. This concept has been most recently illustrated on the television show, ''[[Catfish: The TV Show]]''.

=== Internet affairs ===
Internet affairs offer a new perspective on the definition of an [[affair]]. Some people consider internet relationships to be classified as an affair while others claim contact affairs are much more serious. Trent Parker and Karen Wampler conducted a [[qualitative study]] to discover the different perceptions of internet relationships based on gender differences. Through their study they found internet affairs were considered less of an affair than a physical relationship.&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Wampler|first2=Karen S.|year=2003|title=How Bad Is It? Perceptions Of The Relationship Impact Of Different Types Of Internet Sexual Activities|url=|journal=Contemporary Family Therapy: An International Journal|volume=25|issue=4|page=415|last1=Parker|first1=Trent S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the results from the same study Parker and Wampler also concluded that women considered sexual internet activities such as [[internet porn]] much more severe than the men did. Internet affairs and physical contact affairs are similar because they both involve another partner. "The primary difference between an internet affair and an affair is that in an affair, the couple meet to engage in the relationship. With internet affairs, on the other hand, the couple rarely meet. This offers a unique advantage to internet affairs."&lt;ref name="Parker, Trent S. 20032" /&gt;

== Effects on face-to-face interactions ==
Since the creation of the [[Internet]], [[communication]] has become one of it is prime uses. It has become a ubiquitous force in people's everyday lives due to the increase in the regularity and quality of [[interaction]]. The internet has also created a new approach to [[human]] [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], and it has changed the way people connect to one another in their [[social world]]s. Online relationships have also changed which effective strategies we use to perform maintenance on our relationships, depending on the exclusivity of the internet the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=Kevin B.|year=2004|title=On-line Relational Maintenance Strategies and Perceptions of Partners Within Exclusively Internet Based and Primarily Internet Based Relationships|journal=Communication Studies|volume=55|issue=2|pages=239–253|doi=10.1080/10510970409388617}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, [[Mail|postal services]] made communication possible without the necessity of physical presence, and the invention of the [[telephone]] allowed [[synchronous communication]] between people across long distances. The internet combined the advantages of both mail and telephone, unifying the speed of the telephone with the written character of the mail service. The evolution of communication within the Internet has arguably changed the nature of individuals' relationships with one another.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Some see a major negative impact resulting in an increased use of internet communication is of its diversion of true community&lt;ref name="Brooks2" /&gt; because online interaction via computers is often regarded as a more impersonal communication medium than face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="Comp Face to Face2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lebie|first=Linda|date=31 October 1995|title=Interaction Process in Computer-Mediated and Face-to-Face Groups|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/q21x4565t3217568/|journal=Computer Supported Cooperative Work|volume=4|issue=2–3|pages=127–152|doi=10.1007/BF00749744|author2=Jonathan A. Rhoades|author3=Joseph E. Mcgrath|accessdate=26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others consider the incorporation of the internet allowing online activities to be "viewed as an extension of offline activities".&lt;ref name="Wellman2" /&gt;  The multiple techniques that humans use to communicate, such as taking turns or nodding in agreement, are absent in these settings.&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; Without the [[body language]] cues present in a face-to-face conversation, such as pauses or gestures, participants in instant messaging may type over one another's messages without necessarily waiting for a cue to talk. Also, with or without the correct grammar, tone and context can be misunderstood. Recently people who already adapted internet-based communication have missed face-to-face interactions because this traditional way of communication is able to offer advancement in our relationships.

=== Early positive view ===
In 1991, Stone argued that when [[virtual communities]] began forming, this process generated a new type of social space where people could still apparently meet [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]], but this required a redefinition of the terms “meet” and “face-to-face.” These virtual communities allowed people to effortlessly access others, and in many ways to feel better connected, feel that they receive greater support from others, and to obtain emotional satisfaction from their [[families]], [[communities]] and [[society]]. However, it does have several obvious problems for people to communicate with others. The representative limitation of this way of communications is that it cannot contain people's diverse emotions completely, so it can cause diverse misunderstanding between people.&lt;ref name="Stone, A. R.2"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=114785|title=Cyberspace : first steps|last=Stone|first=Allucquere Rosanne|publisher=MIT Press|year=1991|isbn=0-262-02327-X|edition=4th print.|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=81–118|chapter=Will the real body please stand up?: boundary stories about virtual cultures|editor=Benedikt, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pseudocommunity theory ===
In 1987, this understanding of social spaces was challenged by scholars such as [[James R. Beniger]]. Beniger questioned whether these virtual communities were “real” or were pseudo communities,&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1987|title=Personalization of the mass media and the growth of pseudo-community|url=|journal=Communication Research|volume=14|issue=|pages=352–371|doi=10.1177/009365087014003005|last1=Beniger|first1=J.|authorlink=James R. Beniger}}&lt;/ref&gt; “a pattern relating that, while looking highly [[interpersonal]] interaction, is essentially impersonal.”&lt;ref name="Joinson, A.2" /&gt; He put forward the idea that in a society within the virtual world, participants lack the necessary honesty it would take to create a “real” virtual community.&lt;ref name="Beniger, J.2" /&gt;

=== Weakening of social ties ===
In many cases the introduction of the Internet as a social instigator may cause a repercussion leading to a weakening of social ties. In a study conducted in 1998, Robert Kraut et al. discovered that Internet users were becoming less socially involved. They linked this to an increase in [[loneliness]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]] in relation to use of the Internet.&lt;ref name="Kraut, R. E., Patterson, M., Lundmark, V., Kiesler, S., Mukhopadhyay, T., &amp; Scherlis, W.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=R|date=September 1998|title=Internet paradox. A social technology that reduces social involvement and psychological well-being?|journal=The American Psychologist|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1017–31|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.53.9.1017|pmid=9841579|author2=Patterson, M|author3=Lundmark, V|author4=Kiesler, S|author5=Mukopadhyay, T|author6=Scherlis, W|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kiesler/publications/1998pdfs/1998Kraut-InternetParadox.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though these findings may have been sound, in a later study, Kraut et al.&lt;ref name="kraut022"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kraut|first=Robert|date=1 January 2002|title=Internet Paradox Revisited|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=58|issue=1|pages=49–74|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00248|author2=Kiesler, Sara|author3=Boneva, Bonka|author4=Cummings, Jonathon|author5=Helgeson, Vicki|author6=Crawford, Anne|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1100&amp;context=hcii}}&lt;/ref&gt; revisited his original study with the idea of expanding his current initial sample and correlating it with new subsequently collected [[longitudinal data]]. This synthesis produced a different outcome than the one that Kraut had originally presented.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

In this newer paper, Kraut stated that there were fewer negative affects than he had originally found, and in some cases the negative effect had vanished. In the second study he saw that small positive effects began to appear in social [[involvement]] and psychological well-being. Assessing the effect of the Internet over a period of time, he saw people's use of the Internet increase in sophistication.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

During the Kraut et al. study, the researchers asked reclusive people if they use the Internet to counteract the loss of social skills that are needed in face-to-face encounters.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt; They also asked people with strong [[social skills]] whether they use the Internet to amplify their [[Aptitude|abilities]] to [[Social network|network]] amongst people. The study discovered that these people who already possessed strong social skills were the ones who received the most beneficial outcome to using the Internet. The concluding [[analysis]] was, that rather than helping to decrease the difference between those who already had social skills compared with those lacking in social skills, internet use had actually exacerbated the differences in the skill level needed for social interaction.&lt;ref name="kraut022" /&gt;

=== Assisting reclusive people ===
This theory was later challenged in a study, by McKenna et al.,&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bargh|first2=J. A.|year=1998|title=Coming out in the age of the Internet: Identity "demarginalization" through virtual group participation|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=75|issue=|pages=681–694|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.3.681|last1=McKenna|first1=K. Y. A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that indicated that people who are more [[socially inept]] use the internet to create an initial contact which allows them to explore their “true self" within these interactions. These social interactions within [[cyberspace]] tend to lead to closer and high quality relationships which influence face-to-face encounters. In essence, these findings meant that although it is not clear whether the internet helps reclusive people develop better social skills, it does allow reclusive people to form relationships that may not have existed otherwise because of their lack of comfort with interpersonal situations in general. When these relationships emerge into face-to-face relationships it is hard to distinguish these relationships from those that started as face-to-face interactions. Future studies on this topic may allow scholars to define whether or not society is becoming too dependent on the Internet as a social tool.&lt;ref name="McKenna, K. Y. A., &amp; Bargh, J. A.2" /&gt; Those relationships are also found for people suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[suicidal ideation]] and other [[mental health]] problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=McLean|first2=J. P.|last3=Sheffield|first3=J.|year=2009|title=Examining suicide-risk individuals who go online for suicide-related purposes|url=|journal=Archives of Suicide Research|volume=13|issue=3|pages=264–276|doi=10.1080/13811110903044419|pmid=19591000|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, suicidal people were more likely to go online in search of new interpersonal relationships and to seek interpersonal help. Similar findings were found for suicidal [[LGBT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2013|title=Sexuality and suicidality: Matched-pairs analyses reveal unique characteristics in non-heterosexual suicidal behaviors|url=|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=42|issue=5|pages=729–737|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0112-2|last1=Harris|first1=K. M.|pmid=23657812}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that people who have trouble meeting similar others, not only the 'socially inept', are using the internet to create stronger and more extensive interpersonal relationships.

===The danger of the “alone together”===

The meaning of the word “[[friend]]” remains somewhat unclear, especially when it comes to online friendship. Online friends are either relations that people know it the real world or people met once at a conference, or maybe they are friends with someone known on a [[social networking service]].
[[Albert Mehrabian]] showed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehrabian|first=Albert|year=1971|title=Silent Messages|publisher=[[Cengage Learning|Wadsworth]]|edition=1st|isbn=0-534-00910-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 93% of communication is through nonverbal means (including body language) and only 7% down to verbal communication. Thus, it would be difficult to build true friendships on a social network. Moreover, according to [[Sherry Tutkle]], a “face-to-face friendship is risky”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turkle, Sherry |title=Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other}}&lt;/ref&gt; That can lead people to a virtual confinement.
	
The other issue raised by experts is the race for Facebook friends. If a Facebook user had in 2012 243 friends in average,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/271947/social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender/|title=social-network-contacts-average-number-of-friends-in-the-uk-by-gender||date=January 11, 2018|website=Statista|publisher=|access-date=Mars 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; this number increased to 338 in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Aaron|title=6 new facts about Facebook|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/6-new-facts-about-facebook/|accessdate=10 March 2018|work=Pew research|date=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Whatever the exact number is, it is safe to assume that it is greater than 150. However, According to evolutionary anthropologist [[Robin Dunbar]], 150 is the largest number of people you can share trust and obligations with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dunbar, Robin I. M. |title=How many friends does one person need?: Dunbar's number and other evolutionary quirks |publisher=Faber and Faber |location=London |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-571-25342-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether new technologies such as the [[Internet]] and [[mobile phone]]s exacerbate social isolation (of any origin) is a debated topic among [[sociologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/1369118X.2010.513417 |title=Core Networks, Social Isolation and New Media: How Internet and mobile phone use is related to network size and diversity |year=2011 |last1=Hampton |first1=Keith |last2=Sessions |first2=Lauren |last3=Her |first3=Eun Ja |journal=Information, Communication and Society |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=130–155}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of online [[social networking]] communities, there are increasing options to become involved with social activities that do not require real-world physical interaction.

{{LGBT sidebar|history}}
'''Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender''' ('''LGBT''') '''social movements''' are [[social movements]] that advocate for LGBT+ people in society. Social movements may focus on equal rights, such as the 2000s movement for marriage equality, or they may focus on liberation, as in the gay liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Earlier movements focused on self-help and self-acceptance, such as the homophile movement of the 1950s. Although there is not a primary or an overarching central organization that represents all LGBT+ people and their interests, numerous [[List of LGBT rights organizations|LGBT rights organizations]] are active worldwide. The earliest organizations to support LGBT+ rights were formed in the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

A commonly stated goal among these movements is [[social equality]] for LGBT people, but there is still denial of full LGBT+ rights.&lt;ref&gt;hoades, M. (2011).

Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1038962171&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also focused on building LGBT+ communities or worked towards liberation for the broader society from [[biphobia]], [[homophobia]], and [[transphobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yedGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22sexual%2Boppression%22%2B%22it+lies+at+the+roots+of+the+oppression+of+LGBT+people+as+well%22|title=Actors to Gyms|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015|isbn=978-0-684-31262-0|author1=Stein|first1=Marc|date=2004-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a struggle for LGBT rights today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/10758216.2015.1041840|title=Nationalism and the Struggle for LGBTQ Rights in Serbia, 1991–2014|journal=Problems of Post-Communism|volume=62|issue=5|first1=John A. |last1=Gould |first2=Edward |last2=Moe |pages=273–286 |date=30 Jul 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT movements organized today are made up of a wide range of [[activism|political activism]] and cultural activity, including [[lobbying]], [[Demonstration (people)|street marches]], [[social group]]s, [[media (communication)|media]], [[art]], and [[academic research|research]].

Sociologist Mary Bernstein writes: "For the lesbian and gay movement, then, cultural goals include (but are not limited to) challenging dominant constructions of [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]], [[homophobia]], and the primacy of the gendered heterosexual [[nuclear family]] ([[heteronormativity]]). Political goals include changing laws and policies in order to gain new [[rights]], benefits, and protections from harm."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Mary (2002). ''Identities and Politics: Toward a Historical Understanding of the Lesbian and Gay Movement''. Social Science History 26:3 (fall 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein emphasizes that activists seek both types of goals in both the civil and political spheres.

As with other social movements, there is also conflict within and between LGBT movements, especially about strategies for change and debates over exactly who represents the constituency of these movements, and this also applies to changing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kitchen|first1= Julian|last2= Bellini|first2= Christine|title= Addressing Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) Issues in Teacher Education: Teacher Candidates' Perceptions. |journal=Alberta Journal of Educational Research|volume= 58|number=3 |pages=444–460|date=November 2012|issn=1923-1857|url=https://journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/index.php/ajer/article/view/55632}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is debate over what extent lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersexed people, and others share common interests and a need to work together.  Leaders of the lesbian and gay movement of the 1970s, 80s and 90s often attempted to hide masculine lesbians, feminine gay men, transgender people, and bisexuals from the public eye, creating internal divisions within LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bull, C., and J. Gallagher (1996) Perfect Enemies: The Religious Right, the Gay Movement, and the Politics of the 1990s. New York: Crown.&lt;/ref&gt; Roffee and Waling (2016) discovered that LGBTIQ people experience microaggressions, bullying and anti-social behaviours from other people within the LGBTIQ community. This is due to misconceptions and conflicting views as to what entails "LGBTIQ". For example, transgender people found that other members of the community were not understanding to their own, individual, specific needs and would instead make ignorant assumptions, and this can cause health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=RG |title=Sexuality, health, and human rights. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=June 2007 |volume=97 |issue=6 |pages=972–3 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.113365 |pmid=17463362|pmc=1874191 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, bisexual people found that lesbian or gay people were not understanding or appreciative of the bisexual sexuality. Evidently, even though most of these people would say that they stand for the same values as the majority of the community, there are still remaining inconsistencies even within the LGBTIQ community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=James Roffee &amp; Andrea Waling Rethinking microaggressions and anti-social behaviour against LGBTIQ+ Youth | doi=10.1108/SC-02-2016-0004 | volume=15 | issue=4 | journal=Safer Communities | pages=190–201| year=2016 | last1=Roffee | first1=James A. | last2=Waling | first2=Andrea }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBT movements have often adopted a kind of [[identity politics]] that sees gay, bisexual, and transgender people as a fixed class of people; a [[minority group]] or groups, and this is very common among LGBT communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|title=Measuring Multiple Minority Stress|journal=Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology|volume=17|issue=2|pages=163–174|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150307132821/http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cdp/17/2/163/|archive-date=2015-03-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=|doi=10.1037/a0023244|pmid=21604840|pmc=4059824|year=2011|last1=Balsam|first1=Kimberly F.|last2=Molina|first2=Yamile|last3=Beadnell|first3=Blair|last4=Simoni|first4=Jane|last5=Walters|first5=Karina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those using this approach aspire to [[liberalism|liberal]] political goals of freedom and [[equal opportunity]], and aim to join the political mainstream on the same level as other groups in society.&lt;ref&gt;One example of this approach is: [[Andrew Sullivan|Sullivan, Andrew]] (1997). ''Same-Sex Marriage: Pro and Con''. New York: Vintage.&lt;/ref&gt; In arguing that [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] are innate and cannot be consciously changed, attempts to change gay, lesbian, and bisexual people into heterosexuals ("[[conversion therapy]]") are generally opposed by the LGBT community. Such attempts are often based in [[religious beliefs]] that perceive gay, lesbian, and bisexual activity as immoral.

However, others within LGBT movements have criticised identity politics as limited and flawed, elements of the [[queer]] movement have argued that the categories of gay and lesbian are restrictive, and attempted to [[Deconstruction|deconstruct]] those categories, which are seen to "reinforce rather than challenge a cultural system that will always mark the nonheterosexual as inferior."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[French Revolution]] the anticlerical feeling in Catholic countries coupled with the liberalizing effect of the [[Napoleonic Code]] made it possible to sweep away sodomy laws. However, in [[Protestant]] countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on sodomy until late in the 20th century.

== History ==
{{See also|Timeline of LGBT history}}

=== Enlightenment era ===
In [[Enlightenment era|eighteenth]]- and [[History of Europe#19th century|nineteenth-century Europe]], same-sex sexual behaviour and [[cross-dressing]] were widely considered to be socially unacceptable, and were serious crimes under [[sodomy]] and [[sumptuary law]]s. There were, however, some exceptions. For example, in the 17th century cross dressing was common in plays, as evident in the content of many of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays and by the actors in actual performance (since female roles in [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan theater]] were always performed by males, usually [[prepubescent]] [[boy]]s).

[[Thomas Cannon]] wrote what may be the earliest published defense of homosexuality in English, ''Ancient and Modern Pederasty Investigated and Exemplify'd'' (1749). Although only fragments of his work have survived, it was a humorous anthology of homosexual advocacy, written with an obvious enthusiasm for its subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Closeted writing and lesbian and gay literature: classical, early modern, eighteenth-century | first=David M. | last=Robinson | publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-7546-5550-3 | page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the argument: "Unnatural Desire is a Contradiction in Terms; downright Nonsense. Desire is an amatory Impulse of the inmost human Parts: Are not they, however constructed, and consequently impelling, Nature?"

[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|[[Jeremy Bentham]], an early advocate for the decriminalisation of homosexuality.]]
Social reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] wrote the first known argument for homosexual law reform in England around 1785, at a time when the legal penalty for [[buggery]] was death by hanging. His advocacy stemmed from his [[utilitarianism|utilitarian philosophy]], in which the morality of an action is determined by the net consequence of that action on human well-being. He argued that homosexuality was a victimless crime, and therefore not deserving of social approbation or criminal charges. He regarded popular negative attitudes against homosexuality as an irrational prejudice, fanned and perpetuated by religious teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham, Jeremy]], ''Offences Against One's Self'', c1785  ([http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/sw25/bentham/index.html full text online]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not publicize his views as he feared reprisal; his powerful essay was not published until 1978.

The emerging currents of [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] thought which had inspired Bentham also informed the [[French Revolution]], and when the newly formed [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] began drafting the policies and laws of the new republic in 1792, groups of militant "sodomite-citizens" in Paris petitioned the [[Assemblée nationale]], the governing body of the [[French Revolution]], for freedom and recognition.&lt;ref name="blasius"&gt;Blasius, Mark and Phelan, Shane (eds.), 1997. "We Are Everywhere: A Historical Sourcebook of Gay and Lesbian Politics", New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1791, France became the first nation to decriminalize homosexuality, probably thanks in part to [[Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès]], who was one of the authors of the [[Napoleonic Code]]. With the introduction of the Napoleonic Code in 1808, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] also decriminalized homosexuality.&lt;ref name="vwdiou"&gt;[http://www.glbtqarchive.com/ssh/poland_S.pdf Poland]. ''The Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1830, the [https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/lim/lim-16-12-1830.htm new Penal Code] of the [[Brazilian Empire]] did not repeat the [http://www.ci.uc.pt/ihti/proj/filipinas/l5p1162.htm title XIII of the fifth book of the "Ordenações Philipinas"], which made [[sodomy]] a crime. In 1833, an anonymous English-language writer wrote a poetic defense of Captain Nicholas Nicholls, who had been sentenced to death in [[London]] for sodomy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Whence spring these inclinations, rank and strong?
And harming no one, wherefore call them wrong?&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Three years later in Switzerland, Heinrich Hoessli published the first volume of ''Eros: Die Männerliebe der Griechen'' (English: "Eros: The Male Love of the Greeks"), another defence of same-sex love.&lt;ref name="blasius" /&gt;

[[File:Karl Heinrich Ulrichs (from Kennedy).jpg|thumb|[[Karl Heinrich Ulrichs]], German gay rights activist of the 1860s]]
&lt;!-- It seems that the information regarding Karl Heinrich Ulrichs and Karl Maria Kertbeny was removed without any adequate replacement. --&gt;
In many ways, social attitudes to homosexuality became more hostile during the late [[Victorian era]]. In 1885, the [[Labouchere Amendment]] was included in the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885|Criminal Law Amendment Act]], which criminalized 'any act of gross indecency with another male person'; a charge that was successfully invoked to convict playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in 1895 with the most severe sentence possible under the Act.

From the 1870s, [[social reform]]ers began to defend homosexuality, but due to the controversial nature of their advocacy, kept their identities secret.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A secret British society called the "[[Order of Chaeronea]]" campaigned for the legalisation of homosexuality, and counted playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] among its members in the last decades of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;McKenna, Neil (2003), "The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde: An Intimate Biography". (London: Century) {{ISBN|0-7126-6986-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society was founded by [[George Cecil Ives]], one of the earliest gay rights{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} campaigners, who had been working for the end of oppression of homosexuals, what he called the "Cause". Ives met [[Oscar Wilde]] at the [[Authors' Club]] in London in 1892. Oscar Wilde was taken by his boyish looks and persuaded him to shave off his moustache, and once kissed him passionately in the [[Travellers' Club]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} In 1893, [[Lord Alfred Douglas]], with whom he had a brief affair, introduced Ives to several Oxford poets whom Ives also tried to recruit. In 1897, Ives created and founded the first homosexual rights group, the [[Order of Chaeronea]]. Members included [[Charles Kains Jackson]], [[Samuel Elsworth Cottam]], [[Montague Summers]], and [[John Gambril Nicholson]].

[[John Addington Symonds]] was a [[poet]] and an early advocate of male love. In 1873, he wrote ''A Problem in Greek Ethics'', a work of what would later be called "[[gay history]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Katz|title=Love Stories|pages=243–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits the medical writer [[Charles Gilbert Chaddock|C.G. Chaddock]] for introducing "homosexual" into the English language in 1892, Symonds had already used the word in ''A Problem in Greek Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;DeJean, "Sex and Philology," p. 132, pointing to the phrase [https://books.google.com/books?id=FJETAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22homosexual%20relations%22%20inauthor%3Asymonds "homosexual relations"] (here as it appears in the later 1908 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

Symonds also translated classical poetry on homoerotic themes, and wrote poems drawing on ancient Greek imagery and language such as ''Eudiades'', which has been called "the most famous of his homoerotic poems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Aldrich|title=The Seduction of the Mediterranean: Writing, Art, and Homosexual Fantasy|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the taboos of Victorian England prevented Symonds from speaking openly about homosexuality, his works published for a general audience contained strong implications and some of the first direct references to male-male sexual love in English literature. By the end of his life, Symonds' homosexuality had become an open secret in Victorian literary and cultural circles. In particular, Symonds' memoirs, written over a four-year period, from 1889 to 1893, form the earliest known self-conscious homosexual autobiography.

Another friend of Ives was the English [[socialism|socialist]] poet [[Edward Carpenter]]. Carpenter thought that homosexuality was an innate and natural human characteristic and that it should not be regarded as a sin or a criminal offence. In the 1890s, Carpenter began a concerted effort to campaign against discrimination on the grounds of [[sexual orientation]], possibly in response to the recent death of Symonds, whom he viewed as his campaigning inspiration. His 1908 book on the subject, ''[[The Intermediate Sex]]'', would become a foundational text of the [[LGBT movements]] of the 20th century. Scottish [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[John Henry Mackay]] also wrote in defense of same-sex love and [[androgyny]].

English [[sexology|sexologist]] [[Havelock Ellis]] wrote the first objective scientific study of homosexuality in 1897, in which he treated it as a neutral sexual condition. Called ''Sexual Inversion'' it was first printed in German and then translated into English a year later. In the book, Ellis argued that same-sex relationships could not be characterized as a [[pathology]] or a [[crime]] and that its importance rose above the arbitrary restrictions imposed by society.&lt;ref&gt;''Das Konträre Geschlechtsgefühle''. Leipzig, 1896. See {{cite book|last=White|first=Chris|title=Nineteenth-Century Writings on Homosexuality|year=1999|publisher=CRC Press|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied what he called 'inter-generational relationships' and that these also broke societal [[taboo]]s on age difference in sexual relationships. The book was so controversial at the time that one bookseller was charged in court for holding copies of the work. It is claimed that Ellis coined the term 'homosexual', but in fact he disliked the word due to its conflation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]].

These early proponents of LGBT rights, such as Carpenter, were often aligned with a broader socio-political movement known as '[[free love]]'; a critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorian sexual morality]] and the traditional institutions of family and marriage that were seen to enslave women. Some advocates of free love in the early 20th century, including Russian anarchist and feminist [[Emma Goldman]], also spoke in defence of same-sex love and challenged repressive legislation.

An early LGBT movement also began in Germany at the turn of the 20th century, centering on the doctor and writer [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. In 1897 he formed the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]] campaign publicly against the notorious law "[[Paragraph 175]]", which made sex between men illegal. [[Adolf Brand]] later broke away from the group, disagreeing with Hirschfeld's medical view of the "[[Third gender|intermediate sex]]", seeing male-male sex as merely an aspect of manly virility and male social bonding. Brand was the first to use "[[outing]]" as a political strategy, claiming that German [[Chancellor of Germany (German Reich)|Chancellor]] [[Bernhard von Bülow]] engaged in homosexual activity.

[[File:Lesbiche - 1928 - D- Die freundin 1928.jpg|thumb|May 14, 1928 issue of German lesbian periodical ''Die Freundin'' (''The Girlfriend'').]]

The 1901 book ''Sind es Frauen? Roman über das dritte Geschlecht'' ([[English language|English]]: ''Are These Women? Novel about the Third Sex'') by Aimée Duc was as much a political [[treatise]] as a novel, criticising pathological theories of homosexuality and gender inversion in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breger | first1 = Claudia | year = 2005 | title = Feminine Masculinities: Scientific and Literary Representations of "Female Inversion" at the Turn of the Twentieth Century | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Sexuality | volume = 14 | issue = 1/2| pages = 76–106 | doi=10.1353/sex.2006.0004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Rüling]], delivering a public speech in 1904 at the request of Hirschfeld, became the first female [[Uranian]] activist. Rüling, who also saw "men, women, and homosexuals" as three distinct genders, called for an alliance between the women's and sexual reform movements, but this speech is her only known contribution to the cause. Women only began to join the previously male-dominated sexual reform movement around 1910 when the German government tried to expand Paragraph 175 to outlaw sex between women. Heterosexual feminist leader [[Helene Stöcker]] became a prominent figure in the movement. [[Friedrich Radszuweit]] published LGBT literature and magazines in [[Berlin]] (e.g., ''Die Freundin'').

Hirschfeld, whose life was dedicated to social progress for people who were transsexual, transvestite and homosexual, formed the [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in 1919. The institute conducted an enormous amount of research, saw thousands of transgender and homosexual clients at consultations, and championed a broad range of sexual reforms including sex education, contraception and women's rights. However, the gains made in Germany would soon be [[History of Gays during the Holocaust|drastically reversed]] with the rise of [[Nazism]], and the institute and its library were destroyed in 1933. The Swiss journal [[Der Kreis]] was the only part of the movement to continue through the Nazi era.

USSR's Criminal Code of 1922 decriminalised homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Healey2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan Healey|title=Homosexual Desire in Revolutionary Russia: The Regulation of Sexual and Gender Dissent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_Et9nlFT2YC|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=15 October 2001|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-32233-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a remarkable step in the USSR at the time – which was very backward economically and socially, and where many conservative attitudes towards sexuality prevailed. This step was part of a larger project of freeing sexual relationships and expanding women's rights – including legalising abortion, granting divorce on demand, equal rights for women, and attempts to socialise housework. During Stalin's era, however, USSR reverted all these progressive measures – re-criminalizing homosexuality and imprisoning gay men and banning abortion.

In 1928, English writer [[Radclyffe Hall]] published a novel titled ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]''. Its plot centers on Stephen Gordon, a woman who identifies herself as an invert after reading Krafft-Ebing's ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'', and lives within the homosexual subculture of Paris. The novel included a foreword by Havelock Ellis and was intended to be a call for tolerance for inverts by publicizing their disadvantages and accidents of being born inverted.&lt;ref&gt;Faderman (1981), p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Hall subscribed to Ellis and Krafft-Ebing's theories and rejected (conservatively understood version of) Freud's theory that [[same-sex attraction]] was caused by childhood trauma and was curable.&lt;ref&gt;Doan, p. XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, several secret or semi-secret groups were formed explicitly to advance the rights of homosexuals as early as the turn of the 20th century, but little is known about them.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Rictor, (2005), "[http://rictornorton.co.uk/suppress.htm The Suppression of Lesbian and Gay History]"&lt;/ref&gt; A better documented group is [[Henry Gerber]]'s [[Society for Human Rights]] formed in Chicago in 1924, which was quickly suppressed.&lt;ref name="when"&gt;Bullough, Vern, "[http://hnn.us/articles/11316.html When Did the Gay Rights Movement Begin?]", 18 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homophile movement (1945–1969) ===
{{Main|Homophile}}
[[File:The Ladder, October 1957.jpg|thumb|Cover of U.S. lesbian publication ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' from October 1957. The motif of masks and unmasking was prevalent in the [[homophile]] era, prefiguring the political strategy of [[coming out]] and giving the [[Mattachine Society]] its name.]]

Immediately following [[World War II]], a number of homosexual rights groups came into being or were revived across the [[Western world]], in Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries and the United States. These groups usually preferred the term ''homophile'' to ''homosexual'', emphasizing love over sex. The homophile movement began in the late 1940s with groups in the Netherlands and Denmark, and continued throughout the 1950s and 1960s with groups in Sweden, Norway, the United States, [[Arcadie (French homophile organization)|France]], Britain and elsewhere. [[ONE, Inc.]], the first public homosexual organization in the U.S,&lt;ref name="before"&gt;Percy, William A. &amp; William Edward Glover, 2005, [http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm Before Stonewall], November 5, 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621122142/http://williamapercy.com/pub-Comments-PercyGlover.htm |date=June 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was bankrolled by the wealthy transsexual man [[Reed Erickson]]. A U.S. transgender rights journal, ''Transvestia: The Journal of the American Society for Equality in Dress'', also published two issues in 1952.

The homophile movement lobbied to establish a prominent influence in political systems of social acceptability. Radicals of the 1970s would later disparage the homophile groups for being [[Cultural assimilation|assimilationist]]. Any demonstrations were orderly and polite.&lt;ref name="matzner"&gt;Matzner, 2004, "[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html Stonewall Riots] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116051051/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/stonewall_riots.html |date=January 16, 2006 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; By 1969, there were dozens of homophile organizations and publications in the U.S,&lt;ref&gt;Percy, 2005, "[http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827185054/http://williamapercy.com/BeforeStonewallReview.htm |date=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a national organization had been formed, but they were largely ignored by the media. A 1962 gay march held in front of [[Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia, according to some historians, marked the beginning of the modern gay rights movement. Meanwhile, in San Francisco, the LGBT youth organization Vanguard was formed by Adrian Ravarour to demonstrate for equality, and Vanguard members protested for equal rights during the months of April–July 1966, followed by the August 1966 Compton's riot, where transgender street prostitutes in the poor neighborhood of [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin]] rioted against police harassment at a popular all-night restaurant, [[Compton's Cafeteria riot|Gene Compton's Cafeteria.]]

The [[Wolfenden Report]] was published in Britain on 4 September 1957 after publicized convictions for homosexuality of well-known men, including [[Lord Montagu]]. Disregarding the conventional ideas of the day, the committee recommended that "homosexual behaviour between consenting adults in private should no longer be a criminal offence". All but James Adair were in favour of this and, contrary to some medical and psychiatric witnesses' evidence at that time, found that "homosexuality cannot legitimately be regarded as a disease, because in many cases it is the only symptom and is compatible with full mental health in other respects." The report added, "The law's function is to preserve public order and decency, to protect the citizen from what is offensive or injurious, and to provide sufficient safeguards against exploitation and corruption of others … It is not, in our view, the function of the law to intervene in the private life of citizens, or to seek to enforce any particular pattern of behaviour."

The report eventually led to the introduction of the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967|Sexual Offences Bill 1967]] supported by [[labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Roy Jenkins]], then the Labour [[Home Secretary]]. When passed, The [[Sexual Offences Act]] decriminalised homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age ''in private'' in [[England]] and [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/02/tories-out-in-force-gay-pride "From Section 28 to a Home Office float – Tories come out in force at gay march"], ''The Guardian'', London, 3 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activism became more visible toward the end of the 1960s in the United States. In 1966 bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] founded the Student Homophile League at Columbia University and New York University. In 1967 Columbia University officially recognized this group, thus making them the first college in the United States to officially recognize a gay student group.&lt;ref name="binetusa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihealth.html|title=TIMELINE: THE BISEXUAL HEALTH MOVEMENT IN THE US|publisher=BiNetUSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activism on behalf of bisexuals in particular also began to grow, especially in San Francisco. One of the earliest organizations for bisexuals, the Sexual Freedom League in San Francisco, was facilitated by Margo Rila and Frank Esposito beginning in 1967.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt; Two years later, during a staff meeting at a San Francisco mental health facility serving LGBT people, nurse Maggi Rubenstein came out as bisexual. Due to this, bisexuals began to be included in the facility's programs for the first time.&lt;ref name="binetusa" /&gt;

The American Psychiatric Association removed "homosexuality" from the diagnostics manual of mental illness in 1973.

[[File:Barbara Gittings 1965.jpg|thumb|Gay equality activist [[Barbara Gittings]] picketing [[Independence Hall]] in 1965.]]
The [[new social movements]] of the sixties, such as the [[Black Power]] and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam war]] movements in the US, the May 1968 insurrection in France, and [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation]] throughout the Western world, inspired many LGBT activists to become more radical,&lt;ref name="matzner" /&gt; and the [[Gay Liberation]] movement emerged towards the end of the decade. This new radicalism is often attributed to the [[Stonewall riots]] of 1969, when a group of gay men, lesbians, and drag queens at a bar in [[New York City|New York]] resisted a police raid.&lt;ref name="when" /&gt;

Immediately after Stonewall, such groups as the [[Gay Liberation Front]] (GLF) and the [[Gay Activists' Alliance]] (GAA) were formed. Their use of the word ''[[gay]]'' represented a new unapologetic defiance—as an antonym for ''straight'' ("respectable sexual behaviour"), it encompassed a range of non-normative sexualities and sought ultimately to free the bisexual potential in everyone, rendering obsolete the categories of homosexual and heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Altman|Altman, D.]] (1971). ''Homosexual: Oppression and Liberation''. New York: Outerbridge &amp; Dienstfrey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam, B. D. (1987). ''The rise of a gay and lesbian movement''. Boston: Twayne Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gay Lib writer [[Toby Marotta]], "their Gay political outlooks were not homophile but liberationist".&lt;ref&gt;Marotta, Toby, ''The Politics of Homosexuality'', Boston, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; "Out, loud and proud," they engaged in colourful [[street theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Gallagher, John &amp; Bull, Chris, 1996, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/books/chap1/perfectenemies.htm Perfect Enemies]&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF's "A Gay Manifesto" set out the aims for the fledgling gay liberation movement, and influential intellectual [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] published "The Politics of Being Queer" (1969). Chapters of the GLF were established across the U.S. and in other parts of the Western world. The [[Front Homosexuel d'Action Révolutionnaire]] was formed in 1971 by lesbians who split from the [[Mouvement Homophile de France]].

The [[Gay liberation|Gay Liberation]] movement overall, like the gay community generally and historically, did not welcome transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=68, 77, 110|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF allowed but was not inclusive toward transgender people from its creation, and the GAA specifically excluded transgender people from its agenda, mission and activism. Transgender communities formed their own organizations, including STAR ([[Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries]]), [[Queens Liberation Front|Queen's Liberation Front]] (QLF), and the Transsexual Activist Organization. [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Marsha P. Johnson]] founded STAR in 1970 to provide transgender street kids with a free &amp; safe place to live, food, clothing, and an education. QLF was founded by [[Lee Brewster]] and Bunny Eisenhower to combat the erasure of drag and transgender visibility in the first LGBT pride march, demonstrating how quickly and fully the gay liberation movement excluded transgender activists despite their key role in the Stonewall Riots and previous LGBTQ activism. TAO, founded by Angela K. Douglas in 1970, was the first international [[grassroots]] transgender community organization, and is known for publishing the ''Moonshadow'' and ''Mirage'' newsletters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=110–112|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bisexual activist [[Brenda Howard]] is known as the "Mother of Pride" for her work in coordinating the first [[pride parade|LGBT pride march]]; the first [[Christopher Street Liberation Day|Christopher Street Liberation Day March]] eventually occurred in New York on June 27, 1970.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transgender History : the roots of today's revolution|last=Stryker|first=Susan|publisher=Seal Press|year=2018|isbn=9781580056892|edition= Second |location=New York, NY|pages=111|oclc=990183211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard also originated the idea for a week-long series of events around [[pride parade|Pride Day]]  which became the genesis of the annual [[Gay pride|LGBT Pride celebrations]] that are now held around the world every June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thirteen.org/pressroom/release.php?get=2475 |title=Channel 13/WNET Out! 2007: Women In the Movement|publisher=WNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/the-gay-pride-issue-20070618/ |title=The Gay Pride Issue|date=Jun 18, 2007 |last=Belonsky|first=Andrew|work=Queerty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Howard along with bisexual activist [[Stephen Donaldson (activist)|Robert A. Martin (a.k.a. Donny the Punk)]] and [[L. Craig Schoonmaker]] are credited with popularizing the word "Pride" to describe these festivities.&lt;ref&gt;Dynes, Wayne R. [http://homolexis.com/glossary/index.php/Pride_(trope) Pride (trope), Homolexis]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712215328/http://homolexis.com/glossary/index.php/Pride_%28trope%29 |date=July 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As bisexual activist [[Tom Limoncelli]] put it, "The next time someone asks you why LGBT Pride marches exist or why [LGBT] Pride Month is June tell them 'A bisexual woman named [[Brenda Howard]] thought it should be.'"

One of the values of the movement was [[gay pride]]. Within weeks of the Stonewall Riots, Craig Rodwell, proprietor of the [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop|Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookshop]] in lower Manhattan, persuaded the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations (ERCHO) to replace the Fourth of July Annual Reminder at Independence Hall in Philadelphia with a first commemoration of the Stonewall Riots. Liberation groups, including the Gay Liberation Front, Queens, the Gay Activists Alliance, Radicalesbians, and Street Transvestites Action Revolutionaries (STAR) all took part in the first Gay Pride Week. Los Angeles held a big parade on the first Gay Pride Day. Smaller demonstrations were held in San Francisco, Chicago, and Boston.

In the United Kingdom the GLF had its first meeting in the basement of the [[London School of Economics]] on 13 October 1970. [[Bob Mellors]] and Aubrey Walter had seen the effect of the GLF in the United States and created a parallel movement based on revolutionary politics and alternative lifestyle.&lt;ref name=outrage-p2&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1971, the UK GLF was recognized as a political movement in the national press, holding weekly meetings of 200 to 300 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Alternative to Sexual Shame: Impact of the new militancy among homosexual groups|publisher=The Times|author=Victoria Brittain|date=28 August 1971|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLF Manifesto was published, and a series of high-profile direct actions, were carried out.&lt;ref name=DANGO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dango.bham.ac.uk/record_details.asp?id=2896&amp;recordType=ngo |title=Gay Liberation Front (GLF) |publisher=Database of Archives of Non-Government Organisations |accessdate=2009-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disruption of the opening of the 1971 [[Nationwide Festival of Light|Festival of Light]] was the best organised of [[UK Gay Liberation Front 1971 Festival of Light action|GLF action]]. The Festival of Light, whose leading figures included [[Mary Whitehouse]], met at [[Westminster Central Hall|Methodist Central Hall]]. Groups of GLF members in [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] invaded and spontaneously kissed each other; others released [[mouse|mice]], sounded horns, and unveiled banners, and a contingent dressed as workmen obtained access to the basement and shut off the lights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Times|title=Uproar at Central Hall as demonstrators threaten to halt Festival of Light|date=10 September 1971|page=14|first=Basil|last=Gingell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 the gay liberation movement in Germany, Austria and Switzerland started with [[Rosa von Praunheim]]s movie [[It Is Not the Homosexual Who Is Perverse, But the Society in Which He Lives]].

Easter 1972 saw the Gay Lib annual conference held in the Guild of Undergraduates Union (students union) building at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name="gaybrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gaybirminghamremembered.co.uk/topics/GLF%20National%20Conference|title=Gay Birmingham Remembered – The Gay Birmingham History Project|publisher=[[Birmingham LGBT Community Trust]]|accessdate=3 October 2012|quote=Birmingham hosted the Gay Liberation Front annual conference in 1972, at the chaplaincy at Birmingham University Guild of Students.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, internal disagreements had led to the movement's splintering. Organizations that spun off from the movement included the [[London Lesbian and Gay Switchboard]], ''[[Gay News]]'', and [[Gay's the Word (bookshop)|Icebreakers]]. The GLF Information Service continued for a few further years providing gay related resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lucas|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLF branches had been set up in some provincial British towns (e.g., Bradford, Bristol, Leeds, and Leicester) and some survived for a few years longer. The Leicester group founded by Jeff Martin was noted for its involvement in the setting up of the local "Gayline", which is still active today and has received funding from the [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]]. They also carried out a high-profile campaign against the local paper, the ''[[Leicester Mercury]]'', which refused to advertise Gayline's services at the time.&lt;ref&gt;''Gay News'' (1978) No. 135; ''Peace News'' (13 January 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1970 activists protested the classification of homosexuality as a mental illness by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in their [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], and in 1974 it was replaced with a category of "sexual orientation disturbance" then "ego-dystonic homosexuality," which was also deleted, although "gender identity disorder" (a term used for [[Gender dysphoria]]) remains.

In 1972, [[Sweden]] became the first country in the world to allow people who were transsexual by [[legislation]] to surgically change their sex and provide free [[hormone replacement therapy (male-to-female)|hormone replacement therapy]]. Sweden also permitted the age of consent for same-sex partners to be at age 15, making it equal to heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name=RFSU&gt;{{cite web|author=''Hanna Jedvik'' |url=http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |title=Lagen om könsbyte ska utredas |publisher=''RFSU'' |accessdate=24 June 2007 |date=5 March 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012000954/http://www.rfsu.se/lagen_om_konsbyte_ska_utredas.asp |archivedate=12 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, LGBT groups were established in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;「オトコノコのためのボーイフレンド」（1986）&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:ja:LGBTの社会運動#日本におけるLGBTの社会運動|LGBT social movements in Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, [[:ja:東郷健|Ken Togo]] ran for the Upper House election.

[[Bisexual American history|Bisexuals]] became more visible in the LGBT rights movement in the 1970s.

From the anarchist Gay Liberation movement of the early 1970s arose a more [[reformism|reformist]] and single-issue Gay Rights movement, which portrayed gays and lesbians as a [[minority group]] and used the language of civil rights—in many respects continuing the work of the homophile period.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, S. (1999). ''Gay and lesbian movements in the United States: Dilemmas of identity, diversity, and political strategy''. in B. D. Adam, J. Duyvendak, &amp; A.

Gay and lesbian rights advocates argued that one's sexual orientation does not reflect on one's gender; that is, "you can be a man and desire a man... without any implications for your gender identity as a man," and the same is true if you are a woman.&lt;ref&gt;David Valentine, "'I Know What I Am': The Category 'Transgender' in the Construction of Contemporary U.S. American Conceptions of Gender and Sexuality" (Ph.D. diss., New York University, 2000), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; Gays and lesbians were presented as identical to heterosexuals in all ways but private sexual practices, and butch "bar dykes" and flamboyant "street queens" were seen as negative stereotypes of lesbians and gays. Veteran activists such as [[Sylvia Rivera]] and [[Beth Elliot]] were sidelined or expelled because they were transgender.

In 1974, [[Maureen Colquhoun]] came out as the first Lesbian [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the UK.

In 1975, the groundbreaking film portraying homosexual gay icon [[Quentin Crisp]]'s life, [[The Naked Civil Servant (film)|The Naked Civil Servant]] was transmitted by [[Thames Television]] for the British Television channel [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]. The British journal [[Gay Left]] also began publication.&lt;ref name="Knitting Circle"&gt;[http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html The Knitting Circle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114112010/http://knittingcircle.org.uk/gayleftcollective.html |date=2007-01-14 }} – 'Gay Left Collective'&lt;/ref&gt; After [[British Home Stores]] sacked an openly gay trainee Tony Whitehead, a national campaign subsequently picketed their stores in protest.

In 1977, [[Harvey Milk]] was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] becoming the first openly gay man in the United States elected to public office.  Milk was assassinated by a former city supervisor [[Dan White]] in 1978.

In 1977, a former Miss America contestant and orange juice spokesperson, [[Anita Bryant]], began a campaign "Save Our Children," in Dade County, Florida (greater Miami), which proved to be a major set-back in the Gay Liberation movement. Essentially, she established an organization which put forth an amendment to the laws of the county which resulted in the firing of many public school teachers on the suspicion that they were homosexual.

In 1979, a number of people in [[Sweden]] called in sick with a case of ''being homosexual,'' in protest of homosexuality being classified as an illness.  This was followed by an activist occupation of the main office of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]]. Within a few months, Sweden became the first country in the world to remove homosexuality as an illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quistbergh.se/view/514 |language=Swedish |title=Jag känner mig lite homosexuell idag |trans-title=I feel a little gay today |accessdate=12 December 2009 |year=2001 |first=Frederick Quist |last=Bergh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lesbian feminism]], which was most influential from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s, encouraged women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and advocated lesbianism as the logical result of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich|Rich, A]]. (1980). ''[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]''. Signs, 5, 631–660.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Gay Liberation, this understanding of the lesbian potential in all women was at odds with the minority-rights framework of the Gay Rights movement. Many women of the Gay Liberation movement felt frustrated at the domination of the movement by men and formed separate organisations; some who felt gender differences between men and women could not be resolved developed "[[lesbian separatism]]," influenced by writings such as [[Jill Johnston]]'s 1973 book ''Lesbian Nation''. Organizers at the time focused on this issue. [[Diane Felix]], also known as DJ Chili D in the Bay Area club scene, is a Latino American lesbian once joined the Latino American queer organization GALA. She was known for creating entertainment spaces specifically for queer women, especially in Latino American community. These places included gay bars in San Francisco such as A Little More and Colors.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, Heather. "Music's the life for Chili D." Bay Area Reporter. BAR Media Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreements between different political philosophies were, at times, extremely heated, and became known as the [[lesbian sex wars]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html Lesbian Sex Wars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321044928/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/lesbian_sex_wars.html |date=2006-03-21 }}, article by Elise Chenier from GLBTQ encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; clashing in particular over views on [[sadomasochism]], [[prostitution]] and [[Transsexualism|transsexuality]]. The term "gay" came to be more strongly associated with homosexual males.

In Canada, the coming into effect of [[Section Fifteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 15]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] in 1985 saw a shift in the gay rights movement in Canada, as Canadian gays and lesbians moved from liberation to litigious strategies. Premised on Charter protections and on the notion of the immutability of homosexuality, judicial rulings rapidly advanced rights, including those that compelled the Canadian government to legalize same-sex marriage. It has been argued that while this strategy was extremely effective in advancing the safety, dignity and equality of Canadian homosexuals, its emphasis of sameness came at the expense of difference and may have undermined opportunities for more meaningful change.&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, M.  (2005). ''Getting Gay Rights Straight''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Segal]], often referred to as the dean of American gay journalism, disrupted the CBS evening news with [[Walter Cronkite]] in 1973, an event covered in newspapers across the country and viewed by 60% of American households, many seeing or hearing about homosexuality for the first time.

Another setback in the United States occurred in 1986, when the US Supreme Court upheld a Georgia anti-sodomy law in the case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]''.  (This ruling would be overturned two decades later in ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]).

=====AIDS epidemic=====
Some historians posit that a new era of the gay rights movement began in the 1980s with the emergence of [[AIDS]], which decimated the leadership and shifted the focus for many.&lt;ref name="before" /&gt; This era saw a resurgence of militancy with [[direct action]] groups like [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power]] (ACT UP), formed in 1987, as well as its offshoots [[Queer Nation]] (1990) and the [[Lesbian Avengers]] (1992). Some younger activists, seeing ''gay and lesbian'' as increasingly normative and politically conservative, began using ''[[queer]]'' as a defiant statement of all [[sexual minority|sexual minorities]] and [[gender variant]] people—just as the earlier liberationists had done with ''gay''. Less confrontational terms that attempt to reunite the interests of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people also became prominent, including various [[Acronym and initialism|acronyms]] like ''[[LGBT]]'', ''LGBTQ'', and ''LGBTI'', where the ''Q'' and ''I'' stand for ''[[queer]]'' or ''[[Questioning (sexuality and gender)|questioning]]'' and ''[[intersex]]'', respectively.

====="The Overhauling of Straight America"=====
A 1987 essay titled "The Overhauling of Straight America", by [[Marshall Kirk]] and Hunter Madsen (writing as Erastes Pill),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title=The Overhauling of Straight America |url=http://library.gayhomeland.org/0018/EN/EN_Overhauling_Straight.htm |author=Kirk, Marshall and Pill, Erastes (pseud.) |date=1987 |publisher=Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; lays out a six-point plan for a campaign, which was first published in ''Guide'' magazine. They argued that gays must portray themselves in a positive way to straight America, and that the main aim of making homosexuality acceptable could be achieved by getting Americans "to think that it is just another thing, with a shrug of their shoulders". Then "your battle for legal and social rights is virtually won". The pair developed their argument in the 1989 book ''"After the Ball: How America Will Conquer Its Fear and Hatred of Gays in the '90s."''  The book outlined a public relations strategy for the LGBT movement. It argues that after the [[gay liberation]] phase of the 1970s and 1980s, gay rights groups should adopt more professional public relations techniques to convey their message. After its publication Kirk appeared in the pages of ''Newsweek'', ''Time'' and ''The Washington Post''. The book is often critically described by social conservatives such as [[Focus on the Family]] as important to the success of the LGBT Movement in the 90's and as part of an alleged "homosexual agenda".&lt;ref name="osten"&gt;{{Citation

=====Warrenton "War Conference"=====
A "War Conference" of 200 gay leaders was held in Warrenton, VA in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/02/27/Gay-rights-leaders-gather-in-Virginia/5403572936400/?spt=su |publisher=United Press International |title=Gay rights leaders gather in Virginia |date=1988-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The closing statement of the conference set out a plan for a media campaign:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/09/19/gay-activists-divided-on-whether-to-bring-out-politicians/5ddd8954-c65b-4c3e-8e99-c1b46f8b154a/ |date=1989-09-19 |publisher=Washington Post |author=Weiser, Benjamin |title=Gay Activists Divided on Whether to "Bring Out" Politicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="warrentonpaper"&gt;{{cite paper |url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/HRC/exhibition/stage/REX023_164.pdf |title=Final Statement of the War Conference, Airlie House, Warrenton, VA |date=February 28, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote |First, we recommend a nation-wide media campaign to promote a positive image of gays and lesbians. Every —national, state, and local—must accept the responsibility. We must consider the media in every project we undertake. We must, in addition, take every advantage we can to include public service announcements and paid advertisements, and to cultivate reporters and editors of newspapers, radio, and television. To help facilitate this we need national media workshops to train our leaders. And we must encourage our gay and lesbian press to increase coverage of the national process. Our media efforts are fundamental to the full acceptance of us in American life. But they are also a way for us to increase the funding of our movement. A media campaign costs money, but ultimately it may be one of our most successful fund-raising devices.}} 
The statement also called for an annual planning conference "to help set and modify our national agenda."&lt;ref name="warrentonpaper"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Campaign]] lists this event as a milestone in gay history and identifies it as where [[National Coming Out Day]] originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/the-history-of-coming-out | publisher=Human Rights Campaign | title = The History of Coming Out | date=2017-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 24, 1994, the first Gay Pride march was celebrated in Asia in the Philippines. In the Middle East, LGBT organizations remain illegal, and LGBT rights activists face extreme opposition from the state.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The 1990s also saw the emergence of many LGBT youth movements and organizations such as LGBT youth centers, [[gay-straight alliance]]s in high schools, and youth-specific activism, such as the [[National Day of Silence]]. Colleges also became places of LGBT activism and support for activists and LGBT people in general, with many colleges opening LGBT centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |title=List of Colleges with a LGBT Center |website=College Equality Index |date= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726161842/http://www.collegeequalityindex.org/list-colleges-lgbt-center |archivedate=2014-07-26 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1990s also saw a rapid push of the [[transgender]] movement, while at the same time a "sidelining of the identity of those who are transsexual." In the English-speaking world, [[Leslie Feinberg]] published ''Transgender Liberation: A Movement Whose Time Has Come'' in 1992. Gender-variant peoples across the globe also formed minority rights movements. [[Hijra (South Asia)|Hijra]] activists campaigned for recognition as a [[third gender|third sex]] in India and [[Travesti]] groups began to organize against police brutality across [[Latin America]] while activists in the [[United States]] formed direct-confrontation groups such as the [[Transexual Menace]].

The [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] was the first country to allow [[same-sex marriage]] in 2001.

For example, [[Rhea County, Tennessee]] unsuccessfully tried to "ban homosexuals" in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/03/18/national/main607050.shtml|title=Tenn. County Reverses On Gay Ban|date=18 March 2004|publisher=|accessdate=7 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, in the case ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] struck down [[sodomy laws]] in fourteen states, making consensual homosexual sex legal in all 50 states, a significant step forward in LGBT activism and one that had been fought for by activists since the inception of modern LGBT social movements.&lt;ref&gt;Cordova, Jeanne, ''When We Were Outlaws'' (2011) p 51-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6 to 9 November 2006, [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] on application of [[international human rights law]] in relation to [[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] was adopted by an international meeting of 29 specialists, the [[International Commission of Jurists]] and the [[International Service for Human Rights]].
The [[UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 13 December 2008.

On 22 October 2009, the assembly of the [[Church of Sweden]], voted strongly in favour of giving its blessing to homosexual couples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Synod opened on same-sex marriages |url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |newspaper=DN.se |date=22 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226085746/http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/kyrkomotet-oppnade-for-homovigslar-1.979744 |archivedate=December 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of the term marriage, ("matrimony").

[[Iceland]] became the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage through a unanimous vote: 49-0, on 11 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/06/11/icelands-parliament-unanimously-approves-gay-marriage/|title=Iceland's parliament unanimously approves gay marriage|work=PinkNews|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, [[Argentina]] became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage.

The 1993 "Don't ask, don't tell" law, forbidding homosexual people from serving openly in the United States military, was repealed in 2010. This meant that gays and lesbians could now serve openly in the military without any fear of being discharged because of their sexual orientation. In 2012, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] issued a regulation to prohibit discrimination in federally-assisted housing programs.  The new regulations ensure that the Department's core housing programs are open to all eligible persons, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

On June 26, 2015, in ''[[Obergefell v.

Between September 12 and November 7, 2017, Australia held a [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey|national survey]] on the subject of same sex marriage; 61.6% of respondents supported legally recognizing same-sex marriage nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/world/australia/yes-same-sex-marriage-gay.html|title=Australia Votes for Gay Marriage, Clearing Path to Legalization|last=Baidawi|first=Adam|date=2017-11-14|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-16|last2=Cave|first2=Damien|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cleared the way for a private member's bill to be debated in the federal parliament.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a former teacher in the public school system, Rofes recounts how he was fired from his teaching position after making the decision to come out as gay. As a result of the stigma that he faced as a gay teacher he emphasizes the necessity of the public to take [[political radicalism|radical]] approaches to making significant changes in public attitudes about homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; According to Rofes, radical approaches are grounded in the belief that "something fundamental needs to be transformed for authentic and sweeping changes to occur."The radical approaches proposed by Rofes have been met with strong opposition from [[LGBT rights opposition|anti-gay rights]] activists such as [[John Briggs (politician)|John Briggs]]. Former [[California]] senator, John Briggs proposed [[Briggs Initiative|Proposition 6]], a [[ballot initiative]] that would require that all California state public schools fire any gay or lesbian teachers or counselors, along with any faculty that displayed support for gay rights in an effort to prevent what he believe to be " the corruption of the children's minds".&lt;ref name="Fetner"&gt;Fetner, Tina. 2008. How the Religious Rights Shaped Lesbian and Gay Activism. University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The exclusion of homosexuality from the sexual education curriculum, in addition to the absence of sexual counseling programs in public schools, has resulted in increased feelings of isolation and alienation for gay and lesbian students who desire to have gay counseling programs that will help them come to terms with their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="Rofes" /&gt; Eric Rofes founder of youth homosexual programs, such as [[Out There (youth program)|Out There]] and [[Committee for Gay Youth]], stresses the importance of having support programs that help youth learn to identify with their sexual orientation.

[[David Campos]], author of the book, ''Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook'', illuminates the argument proposed by proponents of sexual education programs in public schools. Many gay rights supporters argue that teachings about the diverse sexual orientations that exist outside of [[heterosexuality]] are pertinent to creating students that are well informed about the world around them. However, Campos also acknowledges that the sex education curriculum alone cannot teach youth about factors associated with sexual orientation but instead he suggests that schools implement policies that create safe school learning environments and foster support for LGBT youth.&lt;ref name="Campos"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campos, David|title=Sex, Youth, and Sex Education: A Reference Handbook|location=Washington, D.C|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging|year=2002|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FKmVUwbUlGgC&amp;printsec=copyright#v=onepage|isbn=978-1-57607-776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is his belief that schools that provide unbiased, factual information about sexual orientation, along with supportive counseling programs for these [[homosexual]] youth will transform the way society treats homosexuality.&lt;ref name="Campos" /&gt;

Many opponents of LGBT social movements have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality as being a result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Fetner" /&gt; In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that educators should refrain from teaching about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in schools entirely. In her book entitled "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [[Margaret Cruickshank]] provides statistical data from the [[Harris Insights &amp; Analytics|Harris and Yankelovich polls]] which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and [[abortion]] should be included in the curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.&lt;ref name="Darder"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Darder, Antoninia|editor2=Marta Baltodano|editor3=Raldolfo Torres|lastauthoramp=y|title=The Critical Pedagogy Reader|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge Falmer|year=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a2bvKJ6S-L8C&amp;lpg=PR4&amp;pg=PA496#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-415-92261-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It had been suggested that education has a positive impact on support for same sex marriage. African Americans statistically have lower rates of educational achievement; however, the education level of African Americans does not have as much significance on their attitude towards [[same-sex marriage]] as it does on white attitudes. Educational attainment among whites has a significant positive effect on support for same-sex marriage, whereas the direct effect of education among African Americans is less significant. The income levels of whites have a direct and positive correlation with support for same-sex marriage, but African American income level is not significantly associated with attitudes toward same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sherkat, Darren E.|author2=Kylan M.

Location also affects ideas towards same-sex marriage; residents of [[rural]] and southern areas are significantly more opposed to same-sex marriage in comparison to residents elsewhere. Gays and lesbians that live in rural areas face many challenges, including: sparse populations and the traditional culture held closely by the small population of most rural areas, generally hostile social climates towards gays relative to urban areas, and less social and institution support and access compared to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;Wienke, Chris &amp; Hill, Gretchen. (2013). Does Place of Residence Matter? Rural-Urban Differences and the Wellbeing of Gay Men and Lesbians. Journal of homosexuality. 60. 1256-79. 10.1080/00918369.2013.806166.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to combat this problem that the LGBT community faces, social networks and apps such as Moovs have been created for "LGBT individuals with like-minds" that are "enabled to connect, share, and feel the heartbeat of the community as one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/17876310/|title=Moovz - The Global LGBT Social Network|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/28/moovz-gay-social-network_n_4681259.html|title='Moovz,' Gay Social Network, Launched By Interacting Technology|last=Nichols|first=JamesMichael|date=2014-01-28|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study conducted by Darren E. Sherkat, Kylan M. de Vries, and Stacia Creek at the [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]],  researchers found that women tend to be more consistently supportive of LBGT rights than men and that individuals that are divorced or have never married are also more likely to grant marital rights to same-sex couples than married or widowed individuals. They also claimed that white women are significantly more supportive than white men, but there are no gender discrepancies among African Americans. The year in which one was born was also found to be a strong indicator of attitude towards same-sex marriage—generations born after 1946 are considerably more supportive of same-sex marriage than older generations. Finally, the study reported that statistically African Americans are more opposed to same-sex marriage than any other ethnicity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Studies show that Non-Protestant Christians are much more likely to support same-sex unions than [[Protestants]]; 63% of African Americans claim that they are [[Black church|Baptist]] or Protestant, whereas only 30% of white Americans are. [[Religion]], as measured by individuals' religious affiliations, behaviors, and beliefs, has a lot of influence in structuring same-sex union attitudes and consistently influences opinions about homosexuality. The most liberal attitudes are generally reflected by [[Jews]], liberal Protestants, and people who are not affiliated with religion. This is because many of their religious traditions have not "systematically condemned homosexual behaviors" in recent years. Moderate and tolerant attitudes are generally reflected by Catholics and moderate Protestants. And lastly, the most conservative views are held by [[Evangelicalism in the United States|Evangelical Protestants]]. Moreover, it is a tendency for one to be less tolerant of homosexuality if their social network is strongly tied to a religious congregation. Organized religion, especially Protestant and Baptist affiliations, espouse conservative views which traditionally denounce same-sex unions. Therefore, these congregations are more likely to hear messages of this nature. Polls have also indicated that the amount and level of personal contact that individuals have with homosexual individuals and traditional morality affects attitudes of same-sex marriage and homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Olson, Laura R.|author2=Wendy Cadge|author3=James T. Harrison|title=Religion and Public Opinion about Same-Sex Marriage|journal=Social Science Quarterly|series=2nd ser.|volume=87|issue=2|year=2006|pages=341–60|url=http://www.wendycadge.com/assets/OlsonCadgeHarrison2006.pdf|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6237.2006.00384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiction literature also has an increased role in shaping people's attitude towards same-sex marriages. An original idea appears in [[Rafael Grugman]] dystopian fiction book ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008). He describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world (in this world same-sex love is a traditional love). At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who unfortunately were born as heterosexuals in a homosexual world and they forced to hide their feelings and their sexual orientation. For a homosexual society love between man and women is a non-traditional love. Underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. It is unusual approach that supports human rights of all people and same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Grugman|title=Nontraditional Love|location=New York|publisher=Liberty Publishing House|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global version ==

Suppose a system is represented as

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{\mathbf{x}} = f \left(\mathbf x \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of variables, with

: &lt;math&gt; f \left( \mathbf 0 \right) = \mathbf 0. &lt;/math&gt;

If a &lt;math&gt;C^1&lt;/math&gt; [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;V(\mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that

: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x&lt;/math&gt;  (negative semidefinite),

then the set of [[accumulation point]]s of any trajectory is contained in &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; is the union of complete trajectories contained entirely in the set &lt;math&gt; \{\mathbf x : \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;. 

If we additionally have that the function &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   for all  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; V( \mathbf 0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

and if &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal I}&lt;/math&gt; contains no trajectory of the system except the trivial trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the origin is [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

Furthermore, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is radially unbounded, i.e.

: &lt;math&gt; V(\mathbf x) \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;, as     &lt;math&gt; \Vert \mathbf x \Vert \to \infty &lt;/math&gt;

then the origin is globally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Local version ==

If 
: &lt;math&gt;V( \mathbf x) &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;,   when  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x \neq \mathbf 0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(\mathbf x) \le 0 &lt;/math&gt;

hold only for &lt;math&gt; \mathbf x &lt;/math&gt; in some neighborhood &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; of the origin, and the set

: &lt;math&gt; \{ \dot{V}( \mathbf x) = 0 \} \bigcap D &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectories of the system besides the trajectory &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t)=\mathbf 0, t \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the local version of the invariance principle states that the origin is locally [[asymptotic stability|asymptotically stable]].

== Relation to Lyapunov theory ==

If &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} ( \mathbf x) &lt;/math&gt; is [[negative definite]], the global asymptotic stability of the origin is a consequence of [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. The invariance principle gives a criterion for asymptotic stability in the case when &lt;math&gt;\dot{V} ( \mathbf x)&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]].

== Example: the pendulum with friction ==

This section will apply the invariance principle to establish the local [[asymptotic stability]] of a simple system, the pendulum with friction. This system can be modeled with the differential equation {{ref|nd1}}

:&lt;math&gt; m l \ddot{\theta} = - m g \sin \theta - k l \dot{\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle the pendulum makes with the vertical normal, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum,  &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction coefficient]], and [[standard gravity|''g'']] is acceleration due to gravity.

This, in turn, can be written as the system of equations

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_1 = x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{x}_2 = -\frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 - \frac{k}{m} x_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using the invariance principle, it can be shown that all trajectories which begin in a ball of certain size around the origin &lt;math&gt;x_1 = x_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; asymptotically converge to the origin. We define &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt; V(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} (1 - \cos x_1) + \frac{1}{2} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

This &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2)&lt;/math&gt; is simply the scaled energy of the system {{ref|nd2}} Clearly, &lt;math&gt;V(x_1,x_2) &lt;/math&gt; is [[positive definite]] in an open ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; around the origin. Computing the derivative,

:&lt;math&gt; \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = \frac{g}{l} \sin x_1 \dot{x}_1 + x_2 \dot{x}_2 =  - \frac{k}{m} x_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Observe that &lt;math&gt;V(0) = \dot{V}(0) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. If it were true that &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, we could conclude that every trajectory approaches the origin by [[Lyapunov stability|Lyapunov's second theorem]]. Unfortunately, &lt;math&gt; \dot{V} \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{V}&lt;/math&gt; is only [[negative semidefinite]]. However, the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | \dot{V}(x_1,x_2) = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

which is simply the set

:&lt;math&gt; S = \{ (x_1,x_2) | x_2 = 0 \} &lt;/math&gt;

does not contain any trajectory of the system, except the trivial trajectory '''x''' = '''0'''. Indeed, if at some time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=0&lt;/math&gt;, then because 
&lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; must be less than &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; away from the origin, &lt;math&gt; \sin x_1 \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{x}_2(t) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;. As a result, the trajectory will not stay in the set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.

All the conditions of the local version of the invariance principle are satisfied, and we can conclude that every trajectory that begins in some neighborhood of the origin will converge to the origin as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow \infty &lt;/math&gt; {{ref|tw1}}.

== History ==
The general result was independently discovered by [[Joseph P. LaSalle|J.P. LaSalle]] (then at [[Research Institute for Advanced Studies|RIAS]]) and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|N.N. Krasovskii]], who published in 1960 and 1959 respectively. While [[Joseph P. LaSalle|LaSalle]] was the first author in the West to publish the general theorem in 1960, a special case of the theorem was in communicated in 1952 by Barbashin and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]], followed by a publication of the general result in 1959 by [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Krasovsky|Krasovskii]] {{ref|vid}}.

'''Landlord harassment''' is the willing creation, by a [[landlord]] or his agents, of conditions that are uncomfortable for one or more [[Leasehold estate|tenants]] in order to induce willing abandonment of a [[Real estate contract|rental contract]].   Such a strategy is often sought because it avoids costly legal [[expenses]] and potential problems with [[eviction]].  This kind of activity is common in regions where [[rent control]] laws exist, but which do not allow the direct extension of rent-controlled prices from one tenancy to the subsequent tenancy, thus allowing landlords to set higher prices.  Landlord [[harassment]] carries specific legal penalties in some [[jurisdiction]]s, but enforcement can be very difficult or even impossible in many circumstances.  However, when a [[crime]] is committed in the process and motives similar to those described above are subsequently proven in court, then those motives may be considered an [[Attendant circumstance|aggravating factor]] in many jurisdictions, thus subjecting the offender(s) to a stiffer [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].

==Types==
Various methods may be employed in cases of landlord harassment, such as, but not limited to the following:
* Withholding maintenance on the [[property]], such as [[Waste collection|garbage collection]], [[landscaping]], or repair of broken fixtures
* Verbal and written complaints, imagined or exaggerated, of tenant's supposed improper conduct (see [[notice to quit]])
* Deliberate [[Defacement (vandalism)|defacing]] of the rented facilities or the property of the tenant
* Creating a [[nuisance]] for the tenant (for example, by generating loud noise)
* [[Intimidation]] and [[threats]] of physical or financial injury directed at the tenant
* [[Physical assault]] or other direct [[criminal activity]] directed against the tenant
* Attempt to enter apartment or housing without cause, or without emergency need to check on premises or on tenant activity
* Claiming emergency when no emergency exists to enter apartment, housing, dwelling etc., without proper notice.
* Not letting tenant peace on property via repeated attempts to enter dwelling.
* Harassment about Rent Not Paid, or Not paid in full.
* Disconnecting water supply or electricity, without proper notice

==Protections==
{{Main|Nuisance}}
At [[common law]] tenants were entitled to the "quiet enjoyment" of leased premises.&lt;ref name="Kroll"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Kroll, David G.|year=1992|title=The Landlord/Tenant Warranty of Habitability and the Covenant of Quiet Enjoyment|journal=Colorado Lawyer|volume=21|issue=June|page=1159}}&lt;/ref&gt; American common law has also adopted the "warranty of habitability" which ensures that residential premises remain in repair.&lt;ref name="Kroll" /&gt;

In the United Kingdom and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], the [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] may provide a basis to establish what is fair and reasonable between tenant and landlord.  The [[right]] to [[Right to privacy|private]] and family life, and the right to [[Property rights|enjoy one's possessions]], are enshrined in this law.  The right to an effective [[Legal remedy|remedy]] and the right to express oneself freely should give the tenant the confidence to seek timely and reasonable resolution should they be suffering or under [[duress]].  Although [[human rights]] legislation is generally only enforceable against [[public bodies]], it provides a framework of [[Reasonable person|reasonability]].

Depending on the specific circumstances, United Kingdom legislation such as the [[Public Order Act 1986]] and the [[Fraud Act 2006]] may provide specific remedies.  Both common law and public order legislation makes it an offence for persons to behave wrongfully in a dwelling e.g. [[breach of the peace]].  Fraud legislation makes it an offence for a person to make a wrongful or forced gain (monetary or other) personally or for the body they represent.

Many local jurisdictions have very specific landlord-tenant legislation that sets out the duties of the landlord, a breach of which may be considered "harassment".  For example, in [[California]], Civil Code Section 1954, limits the landlord's right of entry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Landlord and Tenant|publisher=California Department of Real Estate|url=http://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/refbook/ref09.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[New Mexico]], there is an extensive "Owner-Resident Relations Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Obligations of Landlords and Tenants for Safety, Maintenance and Repairs|publisher=Law Help New Mexico, New Mexico Legal Aid|url=http://www.lawhelpnewmexico.org/?q=content/obligations-landlords-and-tenants-safety-maintenance-and-repairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasonable entry by the landlord==
The conduct of business inside or at a [[dwelling]] must depend upon the reasonableness and willingness of the parties.  If a landlord desires to inspect the dwelling at reasonable intervals and at reasonable times, it is advisable to have this in a contract proper--- Regardless, the purpose of the inspection must be clear, and the conduct of the inspection must be properly regulated.  The purpose of any inspection is surely to ensure the integrity and good maintenance of the property, and the adherence to the agreement that exists between landlord and tenant.  Entry into a dwelling does not give the landlord the right to gather information on, or to investigate, or interfere with, the privacy of the tenant.  If the tenant is not comfortable dealing with the landlord or agent, then the tenant may wish to appoint a representative or friend.  In either case, a simple and sensible record should be made.

The time taken to carry out the task should be reasonable.  The tenant may not wish to conduct business inside a dwelling, and can reasonably ask the landlord to meet or transact business at an alternate place or address.

For example, the landlord (or agent) may attend at the premises to carry out an inspection which will normally take only a matter of minutes.  The parties may then agree to exchange a simple written [[Agreed statement|statement of facts]], and then meet at a neutral place to discuss the matter or remedy.

==Frequency of landlord visits==
In carrying out repairs, replacements and other work, the landlord should make reasonable efforts to limit the frequency of entries to those actually necessary to accomplish the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ltb.gov.on.ca/en/Law/STDPROD_078964.html|title=Landlord and Tenant Board - SJTO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the sake of retention of one’s tenants and the avoidance of strife during tenancy, the keys to exercise of the right to entry are as follows.  1.  Enter as infrequently as possible.  2.  Always give ample notice and, if possible, allow rescheduling of the entry at least once to accommodate the tenant.  3.  Always enter with a clearly defined objective in mind, and notify the tenant of it unless there is a strong reason not to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landlord.com/landlord_right_of_entry_by_state.htm#ARIZONA:_|title=Landlord.com Government Housing|website=www.landlord.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landlord entering the unit==
Legally, even a rented home is the tenant's castle, and the landlord does not have an unlimited right of access. Once an individual has rented an [[apartment]], they have legal possession of it for the duration of their tenancy.  The landlord must give the tenant reasonable notice, before he can enter the tenant's private home.

Originally, in an [[Agrarian society|agricultural society]], the law expected the landlord to rent the property to a tenant and then leave the tenant alone.  It gave the landlord no right of access, but also no responsibility for repairs.  The modern [[Urban area|urban]] tenancy, especially in a multi-unit [[building]] with many building-wide systems, has forced that law to change.  The landlord now has an [[obligation]] to make repairs and gets a right of access for that purpose.  But that does not supersede the [[Tenant rights|tenant's rights]] to privacy and to "quiet enjoyment" of the premises.

One of the most common landlord-tenant disputes involves access for making repairs.  State [[Sanitary]] [[Legal code (municipal)|Codes]]{{which|date=February 2013}} require tenants to allow the landlord "reasonable access" at reasonable times to repair code violations.  What is "reasonable", however, is the subject of frequent disputes.  A tenant may insist on giving the landlord access only by appointment, but they must be reasonable about scheduling appointments.  To give an extreme example, since the landlord usually must schedule tradespeople during the normal working day, it is not reasonable for the tenant to insist that the [[plumber]] can only come in on [[Sunday]] evening.  Plumbers, [[carpenter]]s, [[House painter and decorator|painter]]s, and other tradesmen sometimes operate on unpredictable or busy schedules, so if they fail to keep appointments, tenants are encouraged to document the missed appointment in writing to the landlord, in a letter or e-mail, and keep a copy.  Because some landlords may use lack of access as an excuse, tenants are also encouraged to keep scheduled appointments and maintain a good written record of their efforts to allow the landlord access to their property to make the desired repairs.  In addition, because of documented cases{{which|date=February 2013}} of tradesmen [[stealing]] property, making [[Long-distance call|long-distance phone call]]s, or committing other abuses while making repairs, tenants are also urged to make sure that the landlord or a representative be with repairmen at all times when they are in the tenant's property during the tenant's absence.

Housing courts can often be helpful in [[Mediation|mediating]] disputes over access.  The tenant's credibility in court will be improved if he or she has consistently cooperated reasonably with the landlord's need for access, and has documented their cooperation with careful record-keeping.  If necessary, with a particularly difficult landlord, the tenant may benefit from asking a [[witness]] to observe interactions, and later [[testify]] about the landlord's conduct.

Many leases give the landlord certain entry rights.  For example, under [[Massachusetts General Laws]], ch.186, §15B, a rental agreement may only provide for the following rights to access:
* to inspect the premises;
* to make repairs;
* to show the premises to a prospective tenant, purchaser, [[mortgagee]], or its agent.

The landlord may also enter the premises in accordance with a [[court order]] or if the tenant appears to have [[Abandoned property|abandoned]] the premises.  If a lease allows the landlord to enter for any other reason, that provision is illegal and [[Void (law)|void]].  In addition, the landlord's right to inspect the premises or to show them to a prospective purchaser does not mean that he or she can do it twice every day; the tenant can limit inspections to reasonable frequency.  Unless the lease provides that the tenant must give the landlord a key to their property, the landlord has no right to one.  The fact that a lease allows the landlord a right to enter for certain purposes also does not mean that the landlord may enter a private residence at any time without an appointment.

The right of the landlord to enter if the tenant appears to have abandoned the premises sometimes causes a problem when tenants are [[Moving (address)|moving out]].  The tenant may have moved out most of their [[furniture]] and intend to return to pick up the last few things and clean up the apartment before turning in the keys.  If the landlord believes the tenant has [[vacated]] the premises, however, he or she may come in ahead of the tenant, remove the remaining property, and attempt to charge the tenant for the "mess" they left.  To avoid this situation, tenants are encouraged to be clear with landlords about plans to vacate, and to do so in writing.  In one documented case,{{which|date=February 2013}} a tenant came back from his [[vacation]] and found someone else living in his apartment, with his furniture stored in the [[Basement|cellar]].  He wasn't behind on his [[Renting|rent]], but he had been away for a while, and the landlord concluded that he had abandoned the apartment.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}  To preclude any perception of abandonment, a tenant who is going out of town may benefit from informing his or her landlord of the trip, preferably in writing.  If the tenant is away for an extended time, does not pay the rent, and does not respond to inquiries from the landlord, a [[court]] may find the landlord justified in concluding that the tenant has abandoned the property.

==Retaliation==
A landlord cannot [[Retaliatory eviction|try to evict]] a tenant, raise the rent, or change the terms of tenancy because the tenant has complained in writing to the landlord, or to any government agency, regarding conditions.  The landlord also cannot retaliate in this fashion because a tenant has organized or joined a [[tenant union]], or engaged in certain other protected activities.  Within six months after a tenant has engaged in any of these protected activities, any act by the landlord of raising the rent, attempting eviction (except for non-payment), or making any change in any of the terms of tenancy is presumed to be a retaliation.  This means that in any court proceeding, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden]] will be on the landlord to prove that he or she is not retaliating against the tenant.  In order to defeat a retaliation claim, a landlord must convince the court that he or she took the action for reasons independent of the tenant's protected action, and that he or she would have done the same thing at the same time even if the tenant hadn't engaged in the protected activity.  If the landlord waits until six months after protected actions, retaliation may still be found, but the burden of proof is on the tenant.

If a landlord is found to be retaliating, he or she will not be able to evict the tenant, who may also be awarded [[damages]] from the landlord of one to three months' rent plus [[Lawyer|attorney]]'s fees.  The landlord also cannot willfully deprive the tenant of [[Heating|heat]], [[hot water]], [[gas]], [[electricity]], [[Light fixture|lights]], [[water]], or [[refrigeration]] service.  Nor can the landlord lock out the tenant or remove him/her from their apartment without going through the proper court procedure.  The tenant can ask the court to issue a [[restraining order]], [[Filing (legal)|file]] a [[criminal complaint]] against the landlord, or sue him/her for money damages and attorney's fees.  Because of these options for recourse, it may be to the tenant's advantage to complain about code violations in writing before the landlord issues a notice of an eviction or a rent increase.  If a tenant attempts to claim retaliation, but did not complain about violations until after he or she received notice from the landlord, the tenant will be found to have no valid claim.  The court will not find that the landlord was retaliating against the tenant for an action he or she had not yet taken.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Consumer protection law==
[[Consumer protection laws]] also provide some protection against landlord harassment in some states.  One such statute is Chapter 93A of the Massachusetts General Laws, commonly called the "Consumer Protection Law".  Like the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] on which it is based, and similar "baby [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]]" laws in other states, it prohibits the use of any unfair and deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of any trade or business.  Housing rental is generally considered to be a trade or business, and the [[Massachusetts Attorney General]] has issued [[regulation]]s which define unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the rental housing field.  Practices defined as unfair include failure by the landlord to disclose, to a tenant or prospective tenant, any fact of the disclosure of which may have influenced the latter not to enter into the transaction.  Also defined as an unfair practice is any violation of any law meant to protect consumers, and any act which is oppressive or otherwise unconscionable in any respect.  While the Consumer Protection Law provides some protections for tenants.  If a landlord is the owner-occupant of a two-family or three-family house and owns no other rental property, he or she is not considered to be engaged in a trade or business, and is not subject to this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleXV/Chapter93a|title=Chapter 93A|website=www.malegislature.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|right|The [[Baphomet]], from Eliphas Levi's ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'', 1854, adopted symbol of some western esoteric "Left-Hand Path" [[life stance|belief systems]].]]

In [[Western esotericism]] the '''Left-Hand Path''' and '''Right-Hand Path''' are the [[dichotomy]] between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]]. In some definitions, the ''Left-Hand Path'' is equated with malicious [[black magic]] and the ''Right-Hand Path'' with benevolent [[white magic]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{Cite book|last=Evans|first=Dave |title=The History of British Magick after Crowley |publisher=Hidden Publishing|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left–Right dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|176}}

In more recent definitions, which base themselves on the terms' origins in Indian [[Tantra]], the Right-Hand Path, or RHP, is seen as a definition for those magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], while the Left-Hand Path adopts the opposite attitude, espousing the breaking of [[taboo]] and the abandoning of set [[morality]]. Some contemporary occultists, such as Peter J. Carroll, have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Terminology ==

=== Right-Hand Path ===
The Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:
* They divide the concepts of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[spirit]] into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"&gt;Hine, Phil, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as [[karma]] or the [[Threefold Law]].&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"/&gt;

The occultists [[Dion Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;Fortune, Dion; ''The Mystical Qabalah'', Aquarian Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-85030-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William G. Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William; ''Exorcising The Tree of Evil: How To Use The Symbolism Of The Qabalistic Tree of Life To Recognise And Reverse Negative Energy'', [Helios/Weisers/Kima Global], 1974/1984/2002, (originally The Tree of Evil)&lt;/ref&gt; consider non-magical [[Abrahamic religions]] to be RHP.

=== Left-Hand Path ===
The historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:
*They often reject societal convention and the [[status quo]], which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as [[taboo]], for instance using [[sex magic]] or embracing [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|197}} As Mogg Morgan wrote, the "breaking of taboos makes magic more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a [[vegetarian]] community can have the same liberating effect as [[anal intercourse]] in a sexually inhibited straight society."&lt;ref&gt;Shual. ''Sexual Magic''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They often question religious or moral [[dogma]], instead adhering to forms of personal [[anarchism]].&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|198}}
* They often embrace [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and incorporate it into magical ritual.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|205}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of both terms has come from various occultists. The Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, [[Andrew D. Chumbley]], stated that they were simply "theoretical constructs" that were "without definitive objectivity", and that nonetheless, both forms could be employed by the magician. He used the analogy of a person having two hands, a right and a left, both of which served the same master.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sentiments were expressed by the [[Wicca]]n High Priest [[John Belham-Payne]], who stated that "For me, magic is magic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the terms ==

=== Vamachara ===
{{Main|Vamachara}}
''Vāmācāra'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "left-handed attainment" and is synonymous with Left-Hand Path or Left-path (Sanskrit: ''Vāmamārga'').&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, N. N.

(1999) {{ISBN|81-7304-025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tantra, ''Vamamarga'' [http://www.ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html (The Left Handed Path: [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] sadhana)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523175705/http://ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe a particular mode of worship or spiritual practice (Sanskrit: ''[[sadhana]]'') that is not only [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Nāstika]]'') to standard [[Vedic]] injunction, but extreme in comparison to prevailing cultural norms. These practices are often generally considered to be [[tantra|Tantric]] in orientation. The converse term to ''Vāmācāra'' is ''[[Dakshinachara]]'' (glossed "Right-Hand Path") which is used to refer not only to orthodox (''Āstika'') sects but to modes of spirituality that engage in spiritual practices that not only accord with Vedic injunction but are generally agreeable to prevailing cultural norms. That said, left-handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox schools of [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] and are a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, ''sadhana'' and dharmic lineage (''[[parampara]]'').

=== Tantra and Madame Blavatsky ===
The occidental use of the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right Hand-Path'' originated with [[Madame Blavatsky]], a 19th-century occultist who founded the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]]. She had travelled across parts of [[southern Asia]] and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. She developed the term ''Left-Hand Path'' as a translation of the term [[Vamachara]], an Indian [[Tantra|Tantric]] practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having [[sexual intercourse]] in ritual, drinking [[alcohol]], eating [[meat]] and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term ''Vamachara'' literally meant "the left-hand way" in [[Sanskrit]], and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|178}}

Returning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate ''left'' with [[evil]] in many European countries, where it already had an association with many negative things; as the historian Dave Evans noted, [[homosexuals]] were referred to as "left-handed", and while in [[Protestant]] nations [[Roman Catholics]] were called "left-footers".&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|177}}

=== Adoption into the western esoteric tradition ===
In New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the [[Theosophical Society]] with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) in which she introduced the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right-Hand Path'', firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of Black Magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, "had not been known before" in the Western Esoteric Tradition.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|181–182}} For instance, [[Dion Fortune]], the founder of an esoteric magical group (the [[Society of the Inner Light]]) also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that "black magicians", or followers of the LHP, were [[homosexuals]] and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess [[Kali]] against their European masters.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

[[Aleister Crowley]] further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", or a "Black Brother", as one who failed to attain the grade of [[A∴A∴#Magister Templi|Magister Templi]] in Crowley's system of ceremonial magic.&lt;ref name="payattention"&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/mwt/mwt_12.html Magick Without Tears]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley also referred to the Left-Hand Path when describing the point at which the [[A∴A∴#Adeptus Exemptus|Adeptus Exemptus]] (such as his old Christian mentor, [[Macgregor Mathers]]) chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of [[Choronzon]] and the illusory eleventh [[Sephirot|Sephira]], which is [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'ath]] or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated [[Karma]] is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a "babe of the abyss", arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt; Crowley associated all this with "Mary, a blasphemy against [[BABALON]]", and with the celibacy of Christian clergy.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt;

Another of those figures that Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was [[Arthur Edward Waite]], who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|182–183}} However, despite Waite's attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with Black Magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of [[Dennis Wheatley]]; Wheatley also conflated the two with [[Satanism]] and also the political ideology of [[communism]], which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|189–190}} In one of his novels, ''Strange Conflict'' (1941), he stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:The Order of the Left-Hand Path... has its adepts... the Way of Darkness is perpetuated in the horrible [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] cult which had its origins in [[Madagascar]] and has held [[Africa]], the Dark Continent, in its grip for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Wheatley|Wheatley, Dennis]] (1941). ''Strange Conflict''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later 20th and 21st centuries===
In the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP, but did not consider themselves as following [[Black Magic]]. In 1975, [[Kenneth Grant]], a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in ''Cults of the Shadow'' that he and his group, the [[Typhonian Order]], practiced the LHP. Grant's usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|193}}

When [[Anton Szandor LaVey]] was developing his form of [[LaVeyan Satanism]] during the 1960s, he emphasised the rejection of traditional Christian morality and as such labelled his new philosophy to be a form of the Left-Hand Path. In his ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', he wrote that "Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal—all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path."&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton Szandor. ''The Satanic Bible''. The Book of Lucifer 3: paragraph 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia there is a tradition of Left Hand Path practices within the [[Rodnovery|Rodnover]] community under the influence of [[Volhv]] [[Veleslav]],&lt;ref&gt;Чёрная Книга Мары» (2008) - The Black Book of Mary; Шуйный путь: чёрная книга нави» (2011) - Шуйный путь: The Black Book of the Navi [NOTE: 'Шуйный путь' remains untranslated to distinguish it from the Shuyngj Way within Odinism]; Книга Великой Нави: Хаософия и Русское Навославие» (2011) - The Book of the Great Navi: Хаософия (The Wisdom of Chaos [Chaosophy]) and Russian Навославие (Praising of the Navi).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within the [[Odinism|Odinist]] community with [[Askr Svarte]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nikarevleshy.blogspot.ru/2013/06/evgeny-nechkasov-askr-svarte.html, {{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217064149/http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in England with [[Nikarev Leshy]]. Veleslav has also written numerous books on Tantra and the Left Hand Path.&lt;ref&gt;[[Veleslav#Written works]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D. of the Temple of Set states in his book ''Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent'' there are two criteria to be considered a true Lord of the Left Hand Path and they are Self-Deification and [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|Antinomianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent by Stephen E. Flowers Ph.D. pg.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Tantra ==
[[Tantra]] is a set of [[esoteric]] [[India]]n traditions with roots in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Tantra is often divided by its practitioners into two different paths: ''[[dakshinachara]]'' and ''[[vamachara]]'', translated as ''Right-Hand Path'' and ''Left-Hand Path'' respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]], while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as [[sexual ritual]]s, consumption of [[alcohol]] and other [[intoxicant]]s. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to [[bodhi|enlightenment]]. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the faster&lt;ref&gt;p. 265 ''Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother'', Vanamali, Inner Traditions. {{ISBN|1-59477-199-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vajrayana#Paramitayana and Vajrayana|Distinguishing Paramitayana from Mantrayana]] in ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', Robert E. Buswell, Ed., Macmillan USA, New York, NY, 2004. {{ISBN|0-02-865910-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra.

===Left-Hand Path relation to Tantra in Buddhism===
Robert Beér's ''Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' clarifies widespread taboos and deprecation that associate the left hand as dark, female, inferior and 'not right':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Buddhist tantra, the right hand symbolises the male aspect of compassion or skilful means, and the left hand represents the female aspect of wisdom or emptiness. Ritual hand-held attributes, such as the vajra and bell, vajra and lotus, damaru and bell, damaru and khatvanga, arrow and bow, curved knife and skull-cup, sword and shield, hook and rope snare, etc., placed in the right and left hands respectively, symbolise the union of the active male aspect of skilful means with the contemplative female aspect of wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In both Hinduism and Buddhism the goddess is always placed on the left side of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places his left arm over her left shoulder and dallies with her left breast'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In representations of the Buddha image, the right hand often makes an active mudra of skilful means—the earth-touching, protection, fearlessness, wish-granting or teaching mudra; while the left hand often remains in the passive mudra of meditative equipoise, resting in the lap and symbolising meditation on emptiness or wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert; ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'', Serindia Publications, Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beér's preceding explanations correspond to [[Yab-Yum]] (father-mother) symbolism and contemplation on or practice of [[sexual ritual]]s associated with [[Vajrayogini]] and [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. The metaphorical union of bliss and emptiness is commonly represented within [[Thangka]] paintings of the [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]] depicting the sexual union of the deity Saṃvara and his consort [[Dorje Pakmo]].

'''Liquid Fly-back Booster''' (LFBB) was a [[German Aerospace Center]]'s (DLR's) project concept to develop a [[Reusable launch system|reusable]] [[liquid rocket boosters|liquid rocket booster]] for [[Ariane 5]] in order to significantly reduce the high cost of space transportation and increase [[Environmentally friendly|environmental friendliness]].&lt;ref name="Satellitenkatapult"/&gt; LFBB would replace existing [[solid rocket booster]]s, providing main thrust during the liftoff. Once separated, two winged boosters would perform an [[atmospheric entry]], fly back autonomously to the [[French Guiana]], and land horizontally on the airport like an airplane.

Additionally a family of derivative launch vehicles was proposed in order to take an advantage of [[economies of scale]], further reducing launch costs. These derivatives include a Reusable First Stage in a class of small and medium size launch vehicles like [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] and [[Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre|Arianespace Soyuz]], the Super-Heavy Lift Launcher capable of lifting nearly 70 tonnes to the orbit,&lt;ref name=near70/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt;{{rp|15}} and a Two-Stage-To-Orbit system operating a dedicated reusable orbiter.

German Aerospace Center studied Liquid Fly-back Boosters as a part of future launcher research program from 1999 to 2004. After the cancellation of the project, publications at DLR continued until 2009.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

The German Aerospace Center (DLR) studied potential future launch vehicles of the [[European Union]] under the ''Ausgewählte Systeme und Technologien für Raumtransport'' ([[ASTRA program|ASTRA]]; English: Systems and Technologies for Space Transportation Applications) programme from 1999 to 2005, with additional studies continuing until 2009.&lt;ref name="Satellitenkatapult"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.astronews.com/news/artikel/2007/04/0704-003.shtml|title=Sonnensegel und Satellitenkatapult|language=DE|publisher=astronews.com|date=4 April 2007|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt; The LFBB design was one of two projects within the ASTRA program, the other being [[Phoenix RLV]].&lt;ref name="SART"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6639/11294_read-25975/|title=Space Launcher Systems Analysis (SART)|publisher=DLR|accessdate=9 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330043102/http://www.dlr.de/irs/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-6639/11294_read-25975/|archivedate=30 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RLVSdesign"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2002-5220.pdf|title=Progress in the Design of a Reusable Launch Vehicle Stage|format=PDF|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.|via=[[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR)|year=2012|accessdate=9 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110171054/http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2002-5220.pdf|archivedate=10 January 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DLRsiteLFBBmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7582/12834_read-32243/ |title=Liquid Fly-back Booster (LFBB) |publisher=DLR |accessdate=9 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050518/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7582/12834_read-32243/ |archivedate=10 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During development, scale models were constructed for testing various configurations in DLR's [[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] ''Trisonische Messstrecke Köln'' (TMK; English: Trisonic measuring section at [[Cologne]]) and in their ''Hyperschallwindkanal 2 Köln'' (H2K; English: [[Hypersonic speed|Hypersonic]] wind canal at Cologne) [[wind tunnel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gülhan |first=Ali |year=2008 |title=RESPACE - Key Technologies for Reusable Space Systems |location=[[Cologne]] |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |page=20,22,26 |isbn=978-3-540-77819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2003-7056.pdf|title=Experimental studies on a Liquid Fly-Back-Booster configuration (LFBB) in wind tunnels|format=PDF|page=4,5|publisher=[[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]]|date=December 2003|accessdate=21 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610105732/http://www.la.dlr.de/ra/sart/publications/pdf/2003-7056.pdf|archivedate=10 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preliminary mechanical design of other major elements was done by the companies [[EADS Space Transportation]] and [[MAN SE|MAN]].&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt;{{rp|213}}

The advantages of reusable boosters include simplicity from using only one type of fuel, environmental friendliness, and lower reoccurring costs. Studies concluded that reusable fly-back boosters would be the most affordable and the least risky way for European space launch systems to start becoming reusable. These fly-back boosters had the potential to reduce launch costs. However, when other projects, such as [[Space Shuttle]] or [[VentureStar]], undertook this objective, they failed to meet their goals. Supporting technologies needed for LFBB construction can be developed within 10 years, and additional launchers can be developed based on fly-back boosters to minimise costs and provide maintenance synergy across multiple classes of launch vehicles.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt; 

Eventually, the hardware grew too large and the LFBB project was scrapped, with one member of the French space agency ([[CNES]]) remarking:

{{quote|The thing that shocked me was that at the beginning, this reusable flyback booster was just a cylinder with engines and little wings, just a turbo fan in the back.

== Description ==
[[Image:LFBB line drawing plain.svg|thumb|400px|A line drawing of DLR's LFBB, showing top, front, and side views|alt=A line drawing of DLR's liquid fly-back booster, showing top, front, and side views]]The overall concept of the liquid boosters in the LFBB programme was to retain the Ariane 5's core and upper [[Multistage rocket|stages]], along with the [[payload fairing]]s, and replace its [[solid rocket booster]]s (EAP P241, from French ''Étages d’Accélération à Poudre'') with reusable [[liquid rocket booster]]s. These boosters would provide the main thrust during take-off. After separation, they would return to a [[spaceport]] in [[French Guiana]] for landing. This vertical take-off, horizontal landing ([[VTHL]]) mode of operation would allow liquid fly-back boosters to continue operating from the [[Guiana Space Centre]], thus avoiding any major changes to the ascend profile of Ariane 5. Launch vehicle payload performance of the [[Cryogenic fuel|Cryogenic]] Evolution type-A (ECA) variant would increase from {{convert|10500|kg|abbr = on}} to {{convert|12300|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://elib.dlr.de/64860/1/RC-56-LFBB.pdf|title=Wiederverwendbare Boosterstufen für Ariane 5|trans-title=Reusable booster stages for Ariane 5|language=DE|publisher=Raumfahrt Concret|date=January 2009|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|214}}

In the reference design, each LFBB consists of three engines installed in a circular arrangement at the [[aft]] of the vehicle. Each engine is a [[Vulcain]] engine with reduced [[expansion ratio]]. An additional three [[turbofan]] [[air-breathing engine]]s, installed in the [[nose cone|nose]] section, provide power for fly-back. The [[fuselage]] is {{convert|41|m|abbr = on}} long, with an outer tank diameter of {{convert|5.45|m|abbr = on}}, specifically designed to match the existing Ariane 5 core stage and to reduce manufacturing costs. A [[low-wing]] [[V tail|V-tail]] [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] configuration was selected,&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt; with a [[wingspan]] of approximately {{convert|21|m|abbr = on}} and an area of {{Convert|115|m2|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name=near70/&gt; The [[aerofoil]] was based on a [[transonic]] profile from the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE 2822). The [[gross lift-off mass]] (GLOW) of each booster is {{convert|222.5|t|ST}}, with {{convert|54|t|ST}} upon separation and {{convert|46.2|t|ST}} dry mass. In comparison, the GLOW for EAP P241 is {{convert|273|t|ST}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-bc3ae811-c581-3b79-b123-8acfded8f087|title=Long-term/strategic scenario for reusable booster stages|first1=Martin|last1=Sippel|first2=Chiara|last2=Manfletti|first3=Holger|last3=Burkhardt|work=[[Acta Astronautica]]|issue=58|publisher=[[Elsevier]]| pages=209–221| doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2005.09.012| issn=0094-5765| publication-date=2006|date=28 September 2005|bibcode=2006AcAau..58..209S}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|209,210,214}}

The booster was designed to have four independent propulsion systems, the first of which – main rocket propulsion – would be based on three [[Gimbaled thrust|gimbaled]] [[Vulcain]] engines fueled by {{convert|168500|kg|abbr = on}} of propellant. Second, [[Eurojet EJ200]] fly-back turbofan engines would be propelled with hydrogen to reduce fuel mass. Further, ten {{Convert|2|kN|abbr = on}} thrusters placed on each side of the vehicle would be used by the [[reaction control system]]. Finally, the fourth propulsion system would be based on solid rocket motors that separate the boosters from the core stage. An up-scaled version of the motors used in existing EAP boosters would be mounted in the attachment ring and inside the wing's main structure.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|211,212}}

A typical mission profile would begin with the ignition of a main stage and both boosters, followed by an acceleration to {{Convert|2|km/s|abbr = on}} and then a separation at the altitude of {{Convert|50|km|abbr = on}}. As the main stage continues its flight into orbit, the boosters follow a [[ballistic trajectory]], reaching an altitude of {{Convert|90|-|100|km|abbr = on}}. After low-energy [[atmospheric entry]], the boosters reach denser layers of the atmosphere where they perform a [[Banked turn#Banked turn in aeronautics|banking turn]] toward the target airfield. Gliding continues until they achieve an altitude that is optimal for engaging turbofan engines and entering [[cruise flight]]. At this point, about {{Convert|550|km|abbr = on}} from the launch point, the boosters would be flying over the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The cruise back to the airport requires about {{convert|3650|kg|abbr = on}} of hydrogen fuel and takes over two hours to complete. An undercarriage is deployed and each booster lands autonomously.

The development of liquid fly-back boosters has the potential to enable three additional space transportation systems with an objective of increasing production and creating [[economies of scale]]. The aim of the LFBB project at DLR was to reduce Ariane 5 operational costs and to develop future derivatives, including a reusable first stage of a small-to-medium launch vehicle, a super-heavy launch vehicle capable of lifting {{Convert|67|tonnes|ST}}&lt;ref name=near70&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|title=ASTRA LFBB configuration|publisher=[[German Aerospace Center]]|accessdate=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225812/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Low Earth orbit]], and a reusable [[two-stage-to-orbit]] launch vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DLR - Institut für Raumfahrtsysteme - ASTRA LFBB configuration|url = http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|website = www.dlr.de|accessdate = 30 September 2015|first = Sabine|last = Lindemann|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923225812/http://www.dlr.de/irs/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-7593/12849_read-32301/|archivedate = 23 September 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, LFBBs would be used only on Ariane 5. Over time, alternative configurations could phase out [[Arianespace Soyuz]] and [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]].&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|215}}

===Reusable first stage===
[[Image:LFBB RFS.svg|thumb|Top view of RFS configurations: Vega and Ariane 5 derivatives (top), large cryogenic upper stage (bottom) with the LFBB shown in blue]]
The LFBB was studied with the three upper stage composites, to attain a Reusable First Stage (RFS) configuration. The first was a [[Vega (rocket)|Vega]] derivative, with a [[Zefiro 23]] second stage, a [[Zefiro 9]] third stage and an AVUM upper stage. With the LFBB replacing the [[P80 (rocket stage)|P80 stage]], the payload to [[sun-synchronous orbit]] (SSO) would increase to {{convert|1882|kg|abbr = on}}, compared to the {{convert|1450|kg|abbr = on}} of the Vega. The second was an [[Ariane 4]] derivative called H-25&lt;!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source--&gt;. It was  based on an H10 upper stage with a [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci rocket engine]] and {{Convert|25|tonnes|ST}} of [[cryogenic fuel]]. Depending on the method of deceleration, the payload to SSO is between {{Convert|1481|and|2788|kg|abbr = on}}. The third was a large cryogenic upper stage, called H-185, based on an alternative, yet-to-be-developed Ariane 5 main stage with {{Convert|185|tonnes|ST}} of cryogenic fuel. Its payload to SSO is {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications"/&gt;{{rp|216}}

Two of the lighter configurations (the Zefiro 23 and the H-25) use upper stages mounted on top of the booster. Due to the lower weight, it might have been necessary to lower the amount of fuel in a booster to ensure that the separation velocity, the flight path, and the reentry do not exceed design bounds. In the case of H-25, it might be necessary to accelerate the fly-back boosters to above {{Convert|2|km/s|abbr = on}} to help the upper stage achieve its desired orbit. Consequently, two solutions were proposed to decelerate the boosters after separation. The first option was to actively decelerate them using {{Convert|10|tonnes|ST}} of fuel and reduce the velocity by {{Convert|300|m/s|abbr = on}}. However, launch performance would drop below that of the Vega derivative. Another option is to use aerodynamic forces to decelerate. However, a [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic]] parachute was deemed too expensive and too complex. As a result, an alternative [[ballute]] was proposed. Flight dynamics simulation revealed that a ballute with a cross-section of {{Convert|45|m2|abbr = on}} offered the best compromise between loads on the booster and deceleration by aerodynamic forces. In this configuration, a launch performance of up to {{convert|2788|kg|abbr = on}} could be achieved, partly thanks to a higher separation velocity.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|216}}

The heaviest configuration uses a single booster with an asymmetrically mounted, large, expendable cryogenic stage designated H-185&lt;!-- spelled with a hyphen in a source--&gt;. It was proposed as a future variant of the Ariane 5 core stage (H158), eventually meant to phase out the main stage in a standard launch configuration with LFBB. H-185 would use a new Vulcain&amp;nbsp;3 main engine, with increased vacuum thrust. When launched with a single booster, both stages would be operated in parallel, and be delivered to a {{Convert|180 by 800|km|abbr = on}} orbit before separation. The remaining upper stage composite would weigh {{convert|7360|kg|abbr = on}}, with a {{convert|5000|kg|abbr = on}} payload performance to SSO. When launching to [[Low Earth orbit]], payload mass can be increased to over {{convert|10000|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|215–217}}

===Super-heavy lift launcher===
[[Image:LFBB SHLL.svg|thumb|Top view of the SHLL configuration with the LFBB shown in blue]]
The Super-Heavy Lift Launcher (SHLL) would consist of a new cryogenic main stage, five liquid fly-back boosters, and a re-ignitable injection stage. This configuration was designed to provide increased capabilities for complex missions, including manned explorations to the [[Moon exploration|Moon]] and to [[Mars exploration|Mars]], as well as the launch of large solar-powered satellites.&lt;ref name="Wiederverwendbare"/&gt;{{rp|15}}

The new core stage would stand {{convert|28.65|meters|abbr = on}} tall and have a diameter of {{convert|10|meters|abbr = on}}, feeding {{convert|600|tonnes|ST}} of [[Liquid oxygen|LOX]]/[[Liquid hydrogen|LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] to three Vulcain&amp;nbsp;3 engines. The increased circumference of the main stage allows five LFBBs to be integrated with either retractable or [[variable geometry wing|variable-geometry wing]]s. The upper stage would be a derivative of the Ariane 5 ESC-B, with the size upped to {{convert|5.6 x 8.98|m|ft|abbr = on}}, and strengthened to bear higher loads. The [[Vinci (rocket engine)|Vinci engine]] was proofed to be sufficiently powerful for [[orbital insertion]]. Payload would be enclosed in an {{convert|8 x 29.5|m|ft|abbr = on}} [[Payload fairing|fairing]]. The launch vehicle would have a total height of {{convert|69|meters|abbr = on}} and a [[Gross lift-off mass|mass]] of {{convert|1900|tonnes|ST}}. The payload to [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] would be {{convert|67280|kg|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

When launched to a {{Convert|200 x 600|km|abbr = on}} Low Earth transfer orbit, the LFBBs would separate at an altitude of {{convert|51|km|abbr = on}}, at a speed of {{Convert|1.55|km/s|abbr = on}}. To avoid simultaneous separation of all boosters, either a cross-feed to the main stage, or [[Rocket engine throttling|throttling]] could be used. The return flight of the boosters would require an estimated {{convert|3250|kg|abbr = on}} of fuel, including a 30% reserve.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|218–219}}

===Two-stage-to-orbit===
[[Image:LFBB TSTO.svg|thumb|Top view of the TSTO configuration with the LFBB shown in blue]]
{{See also|Two-stage-to-orbit}}
A reusable Two-Stage-To-Orbit (TSTO) launch vehicle was planned to be implemented about 15 years after the addition of LFBBs to Ariane 5.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|216}} However, only a preliminary analysis of TSTO was completed. The proposed configuration consisted of two boosters with retractable wings attached to the external fuel tank, and a reusable orbiter with fixed wings carrying payload on top of it. During [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) missions, an additional, expandable upper stage would be used.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|219}}

The external tank, being a core of the system, would have a diameter of {{convert|5.4|m|ft}} and a height of {{convert|30.5|m|ft}}, carrying {{convert|167.5|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The attached orbiter would be {{convert|28.8|m|ft}} tall and {{convert|3.6|m|ft}} in diameter, carrying {{convert|50|tonnes|ST}} of propellant. The payload fairing mount atop the orbiter would be {{convert|5.4 x 20.5|m|ft}}. For LEO missions, the launch vehicle would be {{convert|57.3|m|ft}} tall, with a gross lift-off mass of {{convert|739.4|tonnes|ST}}. The payload to LEO would be {{convert|12800|kg}}, with an increase to {{convert|8500|kg}} to GTO when using an expandable upper stage.&lt;ref name="longTermApplications" /&gt;{{rp|219}}

[[File:Paul Gauguin - D'ou venons-nous.jpg|thumb|380px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]'', one of [[Post-Impressionist]] [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings]]

The '''meaning of life''', or the '''answer to the question "What is the meaning of life?"''', pertains to the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[Life|living]] or [[existence]] in general. Many other related questions include: "Why are we here?", "What is life all about?", or "What is the purpose of existence?" There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], [[theological]], and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. 

The meaning of life as we perceive it is derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]].  Many other issues are also involved, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], [[Teleology|purpose]], [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of one or multiple gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the "how" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question, "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"

==Questions==
&lt;!--This section is the introduction for the article, and should be presented first.--&gt;Questions about the meaning of life have been expressed in a broad variety of ways, including the following:

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
{{Further information|Eudaimonia#Eudaimonia and modern psychology|Meaningful Life}}
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;

Many members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities think that science can provide the relevant context, and set of parameters necessary for dealing with topics related to the meaning of life. In their view, science can offer a wide range of insights on topics ranging from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] to [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. Scientific inquiry facilitates this through nomological investigation into various   aspects of [[life]] and [[reality]], such as the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]], and by studying the objective factors which correlate with the subjective experience of meaning and happiness.

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Researchers in [[positive psychology]] study empirical factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). "Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being." ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990). ''Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience''. New York: Harper and Row. {{ISBN|0060920432}}.&lt;/ref&gt; making a fuller contribution by utilizing one's personal strengths,&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Christopher; Seligman, Martin (2004). ''Character strengths and virtues: A handbook and classification''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195167015}}. {{cite web |title=See brief summary |url=http://www.meaningandhappiness.com/psychology-research/list-of-personal-strengths.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and meaning based on investing in something larger than the self.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, M.E.P. (2002). ''Authentic Happiness: Using the New Positive Psychology to Realize Your Potential for Lasting Fulfillment.'' New York: Free Press. {{ISBN|0743222970}} (Paperback edition, 2004, Free Press, {{ISBN|0743222989}})&lt;/ref&gt;  Large-data studies of [[flow (psychology)|flow]] experiences have consistently suggested that humans experience meaning and fulfillment when mastering challenging tasks, and that the experience comes from the way tasks are approached and performed rather than the particular choice of task.  For example, flow experiences can be obtained by prisoners in concentration camps with minimal facilities, and occur only slightly more often in billionaires.  A classic example&lt;ref name="Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály 1990"/&gt; is of two workers on an apparently boring production line in a factory.  One treats the work as a tedious chore while the other turns it into a game to see how fast she can make each unit, and achieves flow in the process.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]]—the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Experimental philosophy]] and [[neuroethics]] research collects data about human ethical decisions in controlled scenarios such as [[trolley problems]].  It has shown that many types of ethical judgment are universal across cultures, suggesting that they may be innate, whilst others are culture specific.  The findings show actual human ethical reasoning to be at odds with most logical philosophical theories, for example consistently showing distinctions between action by cause and action by omission which would be absent from utility based theories.   Cognitive science has theorized about differences between conservative and liberal ethics and how they may be based on different metaphors from family life such as strong fathers vs nurturing mother models.

[[Neurotheology]] is a controversial field which tries to find neural correlates and mechanisms of religious experience.  Some researchers have suggested that the human brain has innate mechanisms for such experiences and that living without using them for their evolved purposes may be a cause of imbalance.  Studies have reported conflicted results on correlating happiness with religious belief and it is difficult to find unbiased meta-analyses.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.   One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

Emerging research shows that meaning in life predicts better physical health outcomes. Greater meaning has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boyle PA, Buchman AS, Barnes LL, Bennett DA. Effect of a purpose in life on risk of incident Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment in community-dwelling older persons. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2010;67:304–310.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of heart attack among individuals with coronary heart disease,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kim E, Sun J, Park N, Kubzansky L, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced risk of myocardial infarction among older US adults with coronary heart disease: A two-year follow-up. Journal of Behavioral Medicine. (2):124–133.&lt;/ref&gt; reduced risk of stroke,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kim ES, Sun JK, Park N, Peterson C. Purpose in life and reduced incidence of stroke in older adults: The Health and Retirement Study. Journal of Psychosomatic Research. 2013;74(5):427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; and increased longevity in both American and Japanese samples.&lt;ref&gt;Boyle PA, Barnes LL, Buchman AS, Bennett DA. Purpose in life is associated with mortality among community-dwelling older persons. Psychosomatic Medicine. 2009;71:574–579.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the British [[National Health Service]] began recommending a five step plan for mental well-being based on meaningful lives, whose steps are:  (1) Connect with community and family; (2) Physical exercise; (3) Lifelong learning; (4) Giving to others; (5) [[Mindfulness]] of the world around you.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/Pages/improve-mental-wellbeing.aspx|title=Five steps to mental wellbeing|work=www.nhs.uk|date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin and nature of biological life===
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|[[DNA]], the molecule containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world hypothesis]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], and [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name="Dawkins selfish gene"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=The Selfish Gene |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1976 |isbn=978-0198575191|title-link=The Selfish Gene }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins river"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=River out of Eden |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |date=1995 |isbn=978-0465069903|title-link=River out of Eden }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has not achieved universal agreement; [[Jeremy Griffith]] is a notable exception, maintaining that the meaning of life is to be integrative.&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"&gt;{{cite book |author=Griffith J. |year=2012 |chapter=What is the Meaning of Life? |title=The Book of Real Answers to Everything! |isbn=978-1741290073 |chapter-url=http://www.worldtransformation.com/what-is-the-meaning-of-life/ |accessdate=2012-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to an interview question from Richard Dawkins about "what it is all for", [[James Watson]] stated "I don't think we're ''for'' anything. We're just the products of evolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The God Delusion|last = Dawkins|first = Richard|publisher = Houghton Mifflin|date = 2006|isbn = 978-0618680009|location = |pages = 99–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |title=Complete Archive for Astrobiology Press Release, News Exclusive, News Briefs |work=Astrobiology Magazine |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013130816/http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 |archivedate=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html|title=Defining Life, Explaining Emergence|work=nbi.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life "feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]"&lt;ref name="worldtransformation.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1944 |isbn=978-0521427081}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author2=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |date=1995 |isbn=978-0520220218}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0192862181}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |date=2003 |isbn=978-9812383990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|which regulate their internal environments as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North  Alabama |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101024755/http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |archivedate=1 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

===Origins and ultimate fate of the universe===
[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|The [[metric expansion of space]]. The [[inflationary epoch]] is the expansion of the [[metric tensor]] at left.]]

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0691005461}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name="Prantzos &amp; Lyle"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Nikos Prantzos |author2=Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2000 |isbn=978-0521770989}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |date=2001 |isbn=978-9042014077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

Theoretical [[cosmology]] studies many alternative speculative models for the origin and fate of the universe beyond the big bang theory.   A recent trend has been models of the creation of 'baby universes' inside [[black holes]], with our own [[big bang]] being a [[white hole]] on the inside of a [[black hole]] in another parent universe.&lt;ref name="Poplawski"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Radial motion into an Einstein-Rosen bridge, Physics Letters B | first=Nikodem J. |last=Poplawski |volume=687 | date=April 2010 |pages=110–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Multiverse]] theories claim that every possibility of [[quantum mechanics]] is played out in parallel universes.

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name="Whitehouse"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |date=2001 |isbn=978-1859734278}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0198520900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 013.jpg|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Churchland"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M. Churchland |authorlink=Paul Churchland |title=A Neurocomputational Perspective: The Nature of Mind and the Structure of Science |publisher=MIT Press |date=1989 |isbn=978-0262531061}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daniel Clement Dennett |authorlink=Daniel Dennett |title=Consciousness Explained |publisher=Little, Brown and Co. |date=1991 |isbn=978-0316180665|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that [[consciousness]], like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name="Barrow, Davies, Harper"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Explaining the process of [[free will]] through [[quantum]] phenomena is a popular alternative to [[determinism]].

==== Parapsychology ====

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the "ground of all being".&lt;ref name="Walker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Alexandra Bruce |title=Beyond the Bleep: The Definitive Unauthorized Guide to What the Bleep Do We Know!? |publisher=The Disinformation Company |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932857221}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ho"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |date=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=978-9810234270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]].

=== Nature of meaning in life ===

The most common{{quantify|date=May 2018}} definitions of meaning in life involve three components.{{cn|date=May 2018}} First, Reker and [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] define personal meaning as the "cognizance of order, coherence and purpose in one's existence, the pursuit and attainment of worthwhile goals, and an accompanying sense of fulfillment" (p.&amp;nbsp;221).&lt;ref&gt;Reker, G.T., &amp; Wong, P.T.P. (1988). Aging as an individual process: Towards a theory of personal meaning. In J.E. Birren, &amp; V.L. Bengston (Eds.), ''Emergent theories of aging'' (pp. 214-246). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Martela and Steger defined meaning as coherence, purpose, and significance.&lt;ref&gt;Martela, F., &amp; Steger, M.F. (2016). The three meanings of meaning in life: Distinguishing coherence, purpose, and significance. ''The Journal of Positive Psychology, 11''(5), 531-545.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Paul T. P. Wong|Wong]] has proposed a four-component solution to the question of meaning in life,&lt;ref&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2011). Positive psychology 2.0: Towards a balanced interactive model of the good life. ''Canadian Psychology, 52''(2), 69-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Wong, P.T.P. (2012). From logotherapy to meaning-centered counseling and therapy. In P.T.P. Wong (Ed.), ''The human quest for meaning: Theories, research, and applications'' (2nd ed., pp. 619-647). New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; with the four components purpose, understanding, responsibility, and enjoyment (PURE):

# You need to choose a worthy ''purpose'' or a significant life goal.
# You need to have sufficient ''understanding'' of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
# You and you alone are ''responsible'' for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal. 
# You will ''enjoy'' a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
Thus, a sense of significance permeates every dimension of meaning, rather than stands as a separate factor.

Although most psychology researchers consider meaning in life as a subjective feeling or judgment, most philosophers (e.g., Thaddeus Metz, Daniel Haybron) propose that there are also objective, concrete criteria for what constitutes meaning in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Meaning in life|last= Metz|first= Thaddeus|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 2013|isbn= 978-0199599318|location= Oxford|pages= |via= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Wong has proposed that whether life is meaningful depends not only on subjective feelings but, more importantly, on whether a person's goal-striving and life as a whole is meaningful according to some objective [[Normative ethics| normative standard]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main article|Platonism}}
[[Plato]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers. His reputation comes from his [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] of believing in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. His [[Theory of Forms]] proposes that universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as heavenly forms. In the [[dialogue]] of ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the character of [[Socrates]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. His theory on justice in the soul relates to the idea of happiness relevant to the question of the meaning of life.

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main article|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become "good"; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is "good".|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake. It is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other "goods" desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as "happiness", "well-being", "flourishing", and "excellence".
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
{{Main article|Cynicism (philosophy)}}
[[Antisthenes]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], first outlined the themes of Cynicism, stating that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] which agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is the consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., "''Cynicism''," in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., "''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''" in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
{{Main article|Cyrenaics}}
[[Aristippus of Cyrene]], a pupil of [[Socrates]], founded an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/|title=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|work=utm.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hedonism.org|title=The Future Of Hardcore Hedonism|work=hedonism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main article|Epicureanism}}

[[Epicurus]], a pupil of the Platonist Pamphilus of Samos, taught that the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic "abstention" from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul."&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], "Letter to Menoeceus", contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because "Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us."&lt;ref name="Russel"&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
{{Main page|Stoicism}}
[[Zeno of Citium]], a pupil of [[Crates of Thebes]], established the school which teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'', or reason, an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is "freedom from [[suffering]]" through ''[[apatheia]]'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having "clear judgement", ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that "good lies in the state of the soul", itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: "''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature."&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: "to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy".&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further information|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: "'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general." —[[C.A.J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: "Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end."  —[[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]

[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[Deontology|deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the "[[Categorical Imperative]]", derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a [[moral universalism|universal action]], no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jeremy Bentham]]]]

The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. {{ISBN|0415220947}} "It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice."&lt;/ref&gt; who found that "nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure", then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': "that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people". He defined the meaning of life as the "[[greatest happiness principle]]".

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of "the devaluing of the highest values".&lt;ref name="Bindé"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |date=2004 |isbn=978-1571814425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name="Reginster"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |date=2006 |isbn=978-0674021990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Martin - The Great Day of His Wrath - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby "[[being]]" is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name="Bindé"/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called "[[God is dead|death of God]]" a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the [[absurdity]] of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (Camus novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be "heroic nihilists", living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with "secular saintliness", fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th-century philosophy===
{{Further information|20th-century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in both formal and popular conceptions of human nature. The knowledge disclosed by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world. Advances in medicine and technology have freed humans from significant limitations and ailments of previous eras;&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—has altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other are conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have also seen radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]) to efforts to meta-theorize about [[meaning-making]] as a personal, individual-driven activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]] originated in the late-19th-century US, concerning itself (mostly) with [[truth]], and positing that "only in struggling with the environment" do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of humankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |date=1909 |isbn=978-1573921381}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Corti"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |date=1976 |isbn=978-3787303526}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Theism====
{{Main article|Philosophical theism}}
Theists believe God created the universe and that God had a purpose in doing so. Theists also hold the view that humans find their meaning and purpose for life in God's purpose in creating.  Theists further hold that if there were no God to give life ultimate meaning, value and purpose, then life would be absurd.&lt;ref name = "Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life"&gt;[http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~morourke/446-phil/05%20Spring/Handouts/Philosophical/Theistic%20Perspectives-MOL.htm Philosophy 446: Theistic Perspectives on the Meaning of Life]. Webpages.uidaho.edu. Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Existentialism====
{{Main article|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of their life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a "[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]", arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2002 |isbn=978-0521893114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: "What is the meaning of life?" by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name="Jacquette"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1996 |isbn=978-0521473880}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |date=1999 |isbn=978-3110166019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism ("all that happens is meaningless") as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name="Reginster"/&gt;

====Absurdism====
{{Main article|Absurdism}}
{{Quote box |quote="''... in spite of or in defiance of the whole of existence he wills to be himself with it, to take it along, almost defying his torment. For to hope in the possibility of help, not to speak of help by virtue of the absurd, that for God all things are possible—no, that he will not do. And as for seeking help from any other—no, that he will not do for all the world; rather than seek help he would prefer to be himself—with all the tortures of hell, if so it must be.''" |source=[[Søren Kierkegaard]], ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]''&lt;ref name="KierkegaardSuD"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kierkegaard|first=Søren|authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard|title=The Sickness Unto Death|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=1941|isbn=978-1448675029}}&lt;/ref&gt; |width=30% |align=right}}
In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, "escaping existence"): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a "[[leap of faith]]"). However, Camus regarded this solution as "philosophical suicide".
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution (notably in his 1947 allegorical novel ''The Plague'' or ''La Peste''), while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as "demoniac madness": "''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |date=1941 |isbn=978-1448675029}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====
{{Further information|Secular Humanism}}
[[File:HumanismSymbol.PNG|left|thumb|The "[[Happy Human]]" symbol representing [[Secular Humanism]].]]

Per [[secular humanism]], the [[Human|human species]] came to be by reproducing successive generations in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral expression of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name="humanifesto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto I |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |date=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070730070437/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |archivedate=30 July 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humanifesto2"&gt;{{cite web |title=Humanist Manifesto II |work=American Humanist Association |date=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809102124/http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human knowledge comes from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]), and not from supernatural sources; the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, "[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities" are determined "by means of intelligent inquiry"&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and "are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience", that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name="humanifesto3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist Manifesto III |work=American Humanist Association |date=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809103515/http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |archivedate=9 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CDSH"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Secular Humanist Declaration |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |date=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context."&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life. [[Secular humanism|Humanism]] seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; "Humanism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity".&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of all humanity, in part because humans are social animals who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]] and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical subgenres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible and seek to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture. In this light, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social "meaning of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |date=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Secular humanism|humanism]]-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could be reinterpreted as "What is the meaning of ''my'' life?"&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; This approach emphasizes that the question is personal—and avoids focusing on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose. There are many therapeutic responses to this question.  For example, [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for "Dereflection", which translates largely as: cease endlessly reflecting on the self; instead, engage in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question itself—what is the meaning of life?—evaporates when one is fully engaged in life. (The question then morphs into more specific worries such as "What delusions am I under?"; "What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?"; "Why do I neglect loved-ones?".) ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: "What is the meaning of life?", "What is the meaning in asking?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1970 |isbn=978-0026166904}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). "Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?" (Chapter 4). In E. Morscher, ed., ''Philosophie als Wissenschaft''.&lt;/ref&gt; and "If there are no objective values, then, is life meaningless?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=McNaughton |first=David |date=August 1988 |title=Moral Vision: An Introduction to Ethics |chapter=Section 1.5: Moral Freedom and the Meaning of Life |publisher=Oxford: Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0631159452}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and the [[logical positivists]] said:{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} "Expressed in language, the question is meaningless"; because, ''in'' life the statement the "meaning of x", usually denotes the ''consequences'' of x, or the ''significance'' of x, or ''what is notable'' about x, etc., thus, when the meaning of life concept equals "x", in the statement the "meaning of x", the statement becomes [[recursion|recursive]], and, therefore, nonsensical, or it might refer to the fact that biological life is essential to having a meaning in life.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for themselves, others) as the life events resulting from their achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name="Russel"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is "the Good," we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case—or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to "values"—that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects—lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to "values" lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has "value", we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114144956/http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html |date=14 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further information|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a "meaning of life", in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]).

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

====Embodied cognition====
[[Embodied cognition]] uses the neurological basis of emotion, speech, and cognition to understand the nature of thought. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] has identified brain areas necessary for these abilities, and genetic studies show that the gene [[FOXP2]] affects neuroplasticity which underlies language fluency. 
[[George Lakoff]], a professor of cognitive linguistics and philosophy, advances the view that metaphors are the usual basis of meaning, not the logic of verbal symbol manipulation. Computers use [[logic programming]] to effectively query databases but humans rely on a trained [[biological neural network]]. Post modern philosophies that use the indeterminacy of symbolic language to deny definite meaning ignore those who feel they know what they mean and feel that their interlocutors know what they mean. Choosing the correct metaphor results in enough common understanding to pursue questions such as the meaning of life. Improved knowledge of brain function should result in better treatments producing healthier brains. When combined with more effective training, a sound personal assessment as to the meaning of one’s life should be straightforward.

===Mohism===
{{further information|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring—a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name="philosophers"&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further information|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because humankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, "we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence."&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further information|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans. According to the [[Charter for Compassion]] signed by many of the world's leading religious and secular organizations, the core of religion is the [[golden rule]] of `treat others as you would have them treat you'.  The Charter's founder, [[Karen Armstrong]], quotes the ancient Rabbi [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] who suggested that `the rest is commentary'.   This is not to reduce the commentary's importance, and Armstrong considers that its study, interpretation and ritual are the means by which religious people [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalize]] and  live the golden rule.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

{{Further information|Abrahamic religion|Iranian philosophy}}

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions. Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], humanity's ultimate purpose is to discover their creator [[Allah]] ({{lang-en|God}}) through His signs, and be grateful to Him through sincere love and devotion. This is practically shown by following the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is a test, determining one's position of closeness to [[Allah]] in the hereafter. A person will either be close to Him and His Love in ''[[Jannah]]'' (Paradise) or far away in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the "[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: "Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving" (Qur'an 67:1–2) and "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah)." (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most English translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to "worship", but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that "ABADON" means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, on the day of Judgement the final decision is of Allah alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iqra.net/Hadith/judgement.php The Day of Judgement].

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[salat]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]]. The five pillars are not mentioned directly in the Quran.

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] and the [[Ahmadiyya]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

The Sufi view of the meaning of life stems from the [[hadith qudsi]] that states "I (God) was [[a Hidden Treasure]] and loved to be known. Therefore I created the Creation that I might be known."  One possible interpretation of this view is that the meaning of life for an individual is to know the nature of God, and the purpose of all of creation is to reveal that nature, and to prove its value as the ultimate treasure, that is God. However, this hadith is stated in various forms and interpreted in various ways by people, such, as [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]],&lt;ref name='Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."'&gt;{{cite web|last=Bahá|first=Abdu'l|title=Commentary on the Islamic Tradition "I Was a Hidden Treasure ..."|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan|work=Bahá'í Studies Bulletin|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn'Arabī]]'s Fuṣūṣ al-Ḥikam.&lt;ref name="SUMMARY OF THE FUSÛS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chittick|first=William C.|title=The Imprint of the Bezels of the Wisdom|url=http://www.ibnarabisociety.org/articlespdf/naqshalfusus.pdf|work=Ibn 'Arabi's Own Summary of the Fusûs|accessdate=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |volume=Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/bahaism}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Bahá'ís, the purpose of life is focused on spiritual growth and service to humanity. Human beings are viewed as intrinsically spiritual beings. People's lives in this material world provide extended opportunities to grow, to develop divine qualities and virtues, and the [[Manifestation of God|prophets]] were sent by God to facilitate this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=P. |date=1999 |title=A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |pages=325–328 |isbn=978-1851681846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a more detailed Bahá'í perspective, see {{cite web |title={{-'}}The Purpose of Life' Bahá'í Topics An Information Resource of the Bahá'í International Community |url=http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |access-date=13 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829233333/http://info.bahai.org/article-1-4-0-6.html |archive-date=29 August 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
In the [[Judaism|Judaic]] world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh') and prepare it for the world to come ('[[Jewish eschatology|Olam HaBa]]'), the [[Jewish messianism|messianic era]]. This is called [[Tikkun Olam]] ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is not focused on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.

Judaism's most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|absolute Being]], who created and governs the universe. Closeness with the God of Israel is through study of His [[Torah]], and adherence to its [[mitzvot]] (divine laws). In traditional Judaism, God established a special [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with a people, the people of Israel, at [[Mount Sinai]], giving the [[613 mitzvot|Jewish commandments]]. Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] and the transcribed [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]], further developed through the generations. The Jewish people are intended as "a kingdom of priests and a holy nation"&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:6&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[Light Unto the Nations|light to the Nations]]", influencing the other peoples to keep their own religio-ethical [[Seven Laws of Noah]]. The messianic era is seen as the perfection of this dual path to God.

Jewish observances involve ethical and ritual, affirmative and prohibitive injunctions. Modern [[Jewish denominations]] differ over the nature, relevance and emphases of mitzvot. [[Jewish philosophy]] emphasises that God is not affected or benefited, but the individual and society benefit by drawing close to God. The rationalist [[Maimonides]] sees the ethical and ritual divine commandments as a necessary, but insufficient preparation for philosophical understanding of God, with its love and awe.&lt;ref&gt;''Maimonides' Confrontation with Mysticism'', Menachem Kellner, Littman Library; particularly the parable of the King's Palace in divine worship, in the [[Guide for the Perplexed]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among fundamental [[Jewish ethics|values]] in the Torah are pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name="Cohn-Sherbok"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |date=2003 |isbn=978-0415236614}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heschel"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2005 |isbn=978-0826408020}}&lt;/ref&gt; The world to come,&lt;ref name="Shuchat"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |date=2006 |isbn=978-1932687316}}&lt;/ref&gt; prepared in the present, elevates man to an everlasting connection with God.&lt;ref name="Braham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Randolph L. Braham |title=Contemporary Views on the Holocaust |publisher=Springer |date=1983 |isbn=978-0898381412}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simeon the Just|Simeon the Righteous]] says, "the world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness." The [[Siddur|prayer book]] relates, "blessed is our God who created us for his honor...and planted within us everlasting life." Of this context, the [[Talmud]] states, "everything that God does is for the good," including suffering.

The Jewish mystical [[Kabbalah]] gives complimentary esoteric meanings of life. As well as Judaism providing an [[Divine immanence|immanent]] relationship with God (personal [[theism]]), in Kabbalah the spiritual and physical creation is a paradoxical manifestation of the immanent aspects of God's Being ([[panentheism]]), related to the [[Shekhinah]] (Divine feminine). Jewish observance unites the [[sephirot]] (Divine attributes) on high, restoring harmony to creation. In [[Lurianic Kabbalah]], the meaning of life is the messianic rectification of the shattered sparks of God's persona, exiled in physical existence (the [[Kelipot]] shells), through the actions of Jewish observance.&lt;ref&gt;''Kabbalah: A Very Short Introduction'', Joseph Dan, Oxford University Press, chapter "Early modern era: Safed spirituality"&lt;/ref&gt; Through this, in [[Hasidic Judaism]] the ultimate essential "desire" of God is the revelation of the Omnipresent Divine essence through materiality, achieved by man from within his limited physical realm, when the body will give life to the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Habad intellectual Hasidic thought: source text [[Tanya]] I: 36, 49; secondary text ''Heaven On Earth'', Faitel Levin, Kehot publications&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx The new Seven Wonders of the World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209062632/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx |date=9 February 2010 }}. Hindustan Times (2007-07-08). Retrieved on 2013-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]

[[Christianity]] has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]]. Its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]] as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation]] through the grace of God and intercession of Christ ([[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26). The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the [[Adam and Eve|first Parents]] to inherit [[Original Sin]] and its consequences. Christ's [[Passion of Jesus|passion]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] provide the means for transcending that impure state ([[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 6:23). The good news that this restoration from sin is now possible is called the [[gospel]]. The specific process of appropriating salvation through Christ and maintaining a relationship with God varies between different [[List of Christian denominations|denominations]] of Christians, but all rely on faith in Christ and the gospel as the fundamental starting point. Salvation through faith in God is found in [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 2:8–9 – "&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast" ([[New American Standard Bible|NASB]]; 1973). The gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, thereby allowing God to [[Regeneration (theology)|regenerate]] (change) the believer and instill in them a new heart after God's own will with the ability to live righteously before him. This is what the terms ''[[Born again]]'' or ''saved'' almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: "What is the chief end of Man?" (that is, "What is Man's main purpose?"). The answer is: "Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever". God requires one to obey the revealed moral law, saying: "love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself".&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000717/http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |archive-date=11 March 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question "Why did God make you?" by saying "God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us."&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Catholicism]]'s way of thinking is better expressed through the Principle and Foundation of [[St. Ignatius of Loyola]]: "The human person is created to praise, reverence, and serve God Our Lord, and by doing so, to save his or her soul. All other things on the face of the earth are created for human beings in order to help them pursue the end for which they are created. It follows from this that one must use other created things, in so far as they help towards one's end, and free oneself from them, in so far as they are obstacles to one's end. To do this, we need to make ourselves indifferent to all created things, provided the matter is subject to our free choice and there is no other prohibition. Thus, as far as we are concerned, we should not want health more than illness, wealth more than poverty, fame more than disgrace, a long life more than a short one, and similarly for all the rest, but we should desire and choose only what helps us more towards the end for which we are created."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/prs/stign/ignatian_spirit.html St. Ignatius | Ignatian Spirituality].

[[Mormonism]] teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience and to have joy.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles|title=Gospel Principles|website=Lds.org|accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that humans are literally the spirit children of God the Father, and thus have the potential to progress to become like Him. Mormons teach that God provided his children the choice to come to Earth, which is considered a crucial stage in their development—wherein a mortal body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name="Gospel Principles"/&gt; The Fall of Adam is not viewed as an unfortunate or unplanned cancellation of God's original plan for a paradise; rather, the opposition found in mortality is an essential element of God's plan because the process of enduring and overcoming challenges, difficulties, and temptations provides opportunities to gain wisdom and strength, thereby learning to appreciate and choose good and reject evil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.11#10 2 Nephi 2:11].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.55#54 Moses 6:55].&lt;/ref&gt; Because God is just, he allows those who were not taught the gospel during mortality to receive it after death in the spirit world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138|title=Doctrine and Covenants 138|work=lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that all of his children have the opportunity to return to live with God, and reach their full potential.

A recent alternative Christian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|date=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nonetheless, the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the [[Propitiation|propitiatory sacrifice]] of Jesus' death on the cross.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name="weightman"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |date=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=978-0140514803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |date=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1421265311 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=978-1421265315}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): (i)''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), (ii)''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), (iii)''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and (iv)''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as "brahmanic householder values" see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the "four main goals of life" (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as "any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}" see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] ("[[Tat Tvam Asi]]" (thou art that),  "Aham Brahmāsmi", "Prajñānam Brahma" and "Ayam Ātmā Brahma" (the soul and the world are one)).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further information|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita Vedanta}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], "The One Without a Second",&lt;ref name="bhaskaranandaessential"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |date=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=978-1884852022}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |date=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=978-8185301754}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name="monierwilliams"/&gt;&lt;ref name="werner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |date=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 978-0700702794}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement "ayam ātmā brahma" (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Theistic dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name="werner"/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525061446/http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html |date=25 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====

{{Further information|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}

[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the living become attached to the non-living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher= RE Today|format=PDF}}, [http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] &lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Earlier Buddhism =====
Buddhists practice to embrace with mindfulness the ill-being (suffering) and well-being that is present in life. Buddhists practice to see the causes of ill-being and well-being in life. For example, one of the causes of suffering is unhealthy attachment to objects material or non-material. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about "the meaning of life" or "the purpose of life", but about the potential of human life to end suffering, for example through embracing (not suppressing or denying) cravings and conceptual attachments. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally "Teaching of Analysis", which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of [[Nirvana]], or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death. The way to attain Nirvana is by following and practicing the [[Noble Eightfold Path]].

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further information|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda.svg|thumb|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]

The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term "Sikh" means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally "the counsel of the gurus") or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: "The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him."&lt;ref name="Singh"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name="Mayled"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |date=2002 |isbn=978-0435336264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhcoalition.org|title=The Sikh Coalition|work=sikhcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name="p252"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |date=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=978-0871961297}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from "the inward eye", or the "heart", of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name="p252"/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]

[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. "Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves."&lt;ref name="Ming-Dao"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |date=1990 |isbn=978-0062502322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]

[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means "the path of the [[kami]]", but more specifically, it can be taken to mean "the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way". The "divine" crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name="Mason"&gt;{{Cite book |author=J.W.T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1412245517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==In popular culture==
[[File:Allisvanity.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Allan Gilbert]]'s ''All is Vanity,'' an example of ''[[vanitas]],'' depicts a young [[woman]] amidst her makeup and perfumes, preoccupied with her own beauty at the [[mirror]] of her [[lowboy|vanity]]. But all is positioned in such a way as to make the image of a [[human skull|skull]] appear, expressing ''[[memento mori]]'', that no matter how good she looks, it won't last, as death is inevitable.]]

The mystery of life and its true meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing "the meaning of life", which she opens and reads out to the audience: "Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations."&lt;ref name="useless website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp|title=Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script|work=intriguing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burnham"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |date=2005 |isbn=978-0471716952}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fernandez"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |date=2002 |isbn=978-1885473486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life ("[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]") and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution "[[42 (number)|42]]", after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that "I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Fourth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|language=English|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-03-29|quote=I think the problem such as it was, was too broadly based. You never actually stated what the question was.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baggini"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yeffeth"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Glenn Yeffeth |title=The Anthology at the End of the Universe: Leading Science Fiction Authors on Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |publisher= BenBella Books, Inc |date=2005 |isbn=978-1932100563}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Badke"&gt;{{Cite book |author=William B.

Deep Thought then constructs another computer—the Earth—to calculate what the Ultimate Question actually is. 
Later Ford and Arthur manage to extract the question as the Earth computer would have rendered it. That question turns out to be "what do you get if you multiply six by nine"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Adams|first1=Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy (Fit the Sixth)|publisher=BBC Radio 4|format=Audio, Radio|date=1978-04-12|quote=That’s it. Six by nine… forty-two! I always said there was something fundamentally wrong about the universe!}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is realised that [[Garbage_in,_garbage_out|the program was ruined by the unexpected arrival of the Golgafrinchans]] on Earth, and so the actual Ultimate Question Of Life, The Universe, And Everything remains unknown. While 6 x 9 would be written as 42 in the [[List_of_numeral_systems#Standard_positional_numeral_systems|tridecimal numeral system]], author Douglas Adams claimed that this was mere coincidence and completely serendipitous.

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hamlet]] meditating upon [[Yorick]]'s skull has become the most lasting embodiment of the imagery of [[vanitas]], conveying the theme ''[[memento mori]]'' ('Remember you shall die'). Whatever the meaning of life, it (life) is fleeting.]]

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Homer the Heretic]]", a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name="Pinsky"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I. Pinsky |title=The Gospel According To The Simpsons: The Spiritual Life Of The World's Most Animated Family |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |date=2001 |isbn=978-0664224196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Red vs. Blue]]'' season 1 episode 1 the character Simmons asks Grif the question "Why are we here?" and is a major line in the series.

In ''[[Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', the characters are asked how we should live our lives, and reply with a version of the [[golden rule]] `be excellent to each other' followed by 'party on, dudes!'.

In [[Person of Interest (TV series)|''Person of Interest'']] season 5 episode 13, an artificial intelligence referred to as The Machine tells [[Harold Finch (Person of Interest)|Harold Finch]] that the secret of life is  ''"Everyone dies alone. But if you mean something to someone, if you help someone, or love someone. If even a single person remembers you then maybe you never really die at all."'' This phrase is then repeated at the very end of the show to add emphasis to the finale.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Life has no meaning===
* Life or human existence has no real meaning or purpose because human existence occurred out of a random [[contingency (philosophy)|chance]] in nature, and anything that exists by chance has no intended purpose.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;

* There is no point in life, and that is exactly what makes it so special.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;

===One should not seek to know and understand the meaning of life===
* The answer to the meaning of life is too profound to be known and understood.&lt;ref name="Tang" /&gt;
* You will never live if you are looking for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* The meaning of life is to forget about the search for the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Seaman" /&gt;
* Ultimately, a person should not ask what the meaning of their life is, but rather must recognize that it is they themselves who are asked. In a word, each person is questioned by life; and they can only answer to life by answering for their own life; to life they can only respond by being responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Man's Search for Meaning'', Viktor Frankl. Beacon Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0807014264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life is bad===
* Better never to have been. People will always experience pain (harm) which outweighs any pleasure. Not coming into existence means people will not experience pain, nor will they be disadvantaged by not experiencing pleasure as they do not exist. This is described as the asymmetry of pleasure and pain (see [[antinatalism]]).&lt;ref name="Benetar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benatar|first=David|authorlink=David Benatar|title=Better Never to Have Been – The Harm of Coming into Existence|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199296422|page=237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S. Turner |page=78 |quote=...a rejection of any dualism between mind and body, and a consequent insistence on the argument that the body is never simply a physical object but always an embodiment of consciousness. |isbn=1412929873 |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYKjzsc6SkAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing's being immaterial...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

have focused primarily on the body rather than the mind.

The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state. The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adamantidis A.R. |author2=Zhang F. |author3=Aravanis A.M. |author4=Deisseroth K. |author5=de Lecea L. |year=2007 |title=Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions===
{{main|Dualistic cosmology|Gnosticism}}
In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:
{{quote|My view is that this gland is the principal seat of the soul, and the place in which all our thoughts are formed.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Treatise of Man''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Treatise of Man''}}{{quote|[The] mechanism of our body is so constructed that simply by this gland's being moved in any way by the soul or by any other cause, it drives the surrounding spirits towards the pores of the brain, which direct them through the nerves to the muscles; and in this way the gland makes the spirits move the limbs.&lt;ref name=Lokhorst1&gt;{{cite web |title=Descartes and the Pineal Gland |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/pineal-gland/ |author=Lokhorst, Gert-Jan |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |date=Nov 5, 2008}} Lokhorst quotes Descartes in his ''Passions of the Soul''&lt;/ref&gt;|René Descartes|''Passions of the Soul''}}

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.
{{quote|...whatever it is that impinges on us from the mind-independent world does not come located in a spatial or a temporal matrix,...The mind has two pure forms of intuition built into it to allow it to... organize this 'manifold of raw intuition'.&lt;ref name=Brook&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Andrew Brook|Brook, Andrew]] |title=Kant's View of the Mind and Consciousness of Self|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta (ed.)|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2011/entries/kant-mind/ |date=October 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Andrew Brook]] |''Kant's view of the mind and consciousness of self: Transcendental aesthetic''}}
Kant views the mind–body interaction as taking place through forces that may be of different kinds for mind and body.&lt;ref name=Watkins&gt;{{cite book |author=Eric Watkins |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIIsaGoHshoC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108 |chapter=Causality in context |title=Kant and the Metaphysics of Causality |isbn=0521543614 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].
{{quote|On the epiphenomenalist view, mental events play no causal role. Huxley, who held the view, compared mental events to a steam whistle that contributes nothing to the work of a locomotive.&lt;ref name=Robinson2&gt;{{cite web |author=Robinson, William, |title=Epiphenomenalism |work= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2012 Edition)|editor=Edward N. Zalta|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2012/entries/epiphenomenalism/|date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William Robinson|''Epiphenomenalism''}}

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead. The Algebra of Metaphysics. Applied Process Metaphysics Summer Institute Memorandum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170727230542/http://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics |date=2017-07-27 }}'', Louvain-la-Neuve, Éditions Chromatika, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-2-930517-08-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.
{{quote|The body–mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously [namely]: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that ''act'' upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 ''acts'' upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of body–mind interaction.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;|Karl Popper|''Notes of a realist on the body–mind problem''}}

===Searle===
{{Main|John Searle}}
For [[John Rogers Searle|Searle]] (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a [[false dichotomy]]; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain.  
{{quote|According to Searle then, there is no more a mind–body problem than there is a macro–micro economics problem. They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena. [...] But Searle is careful to maintain that the mental – the domain of qualitative experience and understanding – is autonomous and has no counterpart on the microlevel; any redescription of these macroscopic features amounts to a kind of evisceration, ...&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;

The '''National Bureau of Classification''' ('''NBC'''), previously the '''Film Censor Board of Maldives''', is a government office founded on 21 May 1956 with the objective of presenting and promoting [[Film industry|cinema]] and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.

==History and overview==
The Government of [[Maldives]] first formed a Film Censor Board on 21 May 1956 under the President’s Office. This Board was formed with the objective of presenting and promoting cinema and theatrical performances for the benefit of the Maldivian people.
On 15 May 1983 the Film Censor Board was transferred under the mandate of the Ministry of Home Affairs and Housing. The mission of the five-member Board was to check films and theatrical dramas to see if they had issues that conflicted:

1. The tenets of Islam.
2. The Constitution, Laws and Regulations of the Maldives.
3. The Maldivian Culture.

On 1 April 1998 the Film Censor Board became a [[subsidiary]] of the Ministry of Information, Arts and Culture and on 29 December 2005, the Film Censor Board was re-branded as the National Bureau of Classification, NBC. This change was brought as the government believed that classification and education was the key to manage and regulate different content so as to protect values of artistic productions and safeguard consumer interests at the same time. Presently, the National Bureau of Classification is under the Ministry of Youth and Sports.

==Film ratings==
Classification Certificates issued by NBC are based on the following categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classification Ratings |publisher=National Bureau of Classification |location=Maldives |url=http://nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |accessdate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220024616/http://www.nbc.gov.mv/services/classification-ratings |archivedate=20 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Testament''' uses a number of '''[[military]] [[metaphor]]s''' in discussing Christianity, especially in the [[Pauline epistles]].

In [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:25&amp;version=NIV Philippians 2:25, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] 1:2,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon+1:2&amp;version=NIV Philemon 1:2, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] describes fellow Christians as "fellow soldiers" (in Greek, συστρατιώτῃ, ''sustratiōtē'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Thomas O'Brien]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpbiGkWRKc0C&amp;pg=PA330 The Epistle to the Philippians: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 1991, {{ISBN|0-85364-531-0}}, pp. 330–331.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a soldier is also used in [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] 2:3–4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:3-4&amp;version=NIV 2 Timothy 2:3–4, NIV (BibleGateway):] "Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.

[[File:Obsolete Russian units of length - ru.svg|thumb]]
A native system of weights and measures was used in [[Imperial Russia]] and after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], but it was abandoned after [[July 1925#July 21, 1925 (Tuesday)|July 21, 1925]], when the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the [[metric system]], per the order of the [[Council of People's Commissars]].

The [[Obsolete Tatar weights and measures|Tatar system]] is very similar to the Russian one, but some names are different.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The system existed since [[ancient Rus']], but under [[Peter the Great]], the Russian units were redefined relative to the [[English unit|English system]].&lt;ref name=Shost&gt;Шостьин Н. А. Очерки истории русской метрологии XI — начала XX века. М.: 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Until Peter the Great the system also used [[Cyrillic numerals]], and only in the 18th century did Peter the Great replace it with the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Shost/&gt;

==Length==
The basic unit is the Russian [[cubit]], called the ''arshin'', which has been in use since the 16th century.  It was standardized by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the 18th century to measure exactly twenty-eight English inches ({{convert|28|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}). Thus, 80 vershoks = 20 piads = 5 arshins = 140 English inches ({{convert|140|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}).&lt;ref name=Carda&gt;{{cite book|author=Cardarelli, F.|year=2004|title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins|publisher=Springer|edition=2nd|pages=120–124|isbn=1-85233-682-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC&amp;pg=PA118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''piad'' ({{lang|ru|пядь}}, “palm”, “five”) or ''chetvert'' ({{lang|ru|че́тверть}}, “quarter”) is a [[span (unit)|hand span]], the distance between ends of the spread thumb and [[index finger]].

== Weight/mass ==

Two systems of weight were in use, an ordinary one in common use, and an [[apothecaries' system]].

|}

The pood was first mentioned in a number of documents of the twelfth century. {{cn|date=February 2014}} It may still be encountered in documents dealing with agricultural production (especially with reference to cereals), and has been revived in determining weights when casting bells in belfries following the rebirth of the Orthodox Churches in the former Soviet lands.  It is also popular in the modern fitness industry of the 21st century, as the pood is used when referencing the weight of a [[kettlebell]], a Russian invention, especially in CrossFit. {{cn|date=February 2014}}

===Apothecaries' system===
The Imperial Russian apothecaries' weight was defined by setting the grain ({{lang-ru|гран}}) to be exactly seven-fifths of a ''dolia''.  The only unit name shared between the two was the ''funt'' (pound), but the one in the apothecaries' system is exactly seven-eighths of the ordinary ''funt''.

==Idiomatic expressions==
The obsolete units of measurement survived in [[Russian culture]] in a number of [[idiom]]atic expressions and [[proverb]]s, for example:

* Слышно за ''версту'': (It) can be heard a verst away - about something very loud
* Бешеной собаке семь ''вёрст'' не крюк.: 7 versts is not a detour for a mad dog - about excessive energy or hassle
* Милому дружку семь ''вёрст'' не околица: 7 verst is not too far for a darling friend
* ''Верста'' коломенская: [[Kolomna]] verst - about a very tall and slim person (in this case the reference is to the verst pole road mark: (''verstovoy stolb''))
* ''Косая сажень'' в плечах:  Skew sazhen in the shoulders - about a strong, wide-shouldered person
* Мерить всех на свой ''аршин''. To gauge everybody by the same [literally: one's own] yardstick
* Проглотить ''аршин''. To swallow an arshin (yardstick)  - about standing very straight and still 
* От горшка два ''вершка''. Two vershok above the pot. - Very young kid
* Сто ''пудов''. - Hundred poods - very large amount. In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of "very much" and "very", as well as "most surely";&lt;ref&gt;English-Russian-English dictionary of slang, jargon and Russian names. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective 'stopudovy' and the adverb 'stopudovo' derive from this expression, although it is more likely a mangled contraction of "100%" (stoprocentny).
* Семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Seven 'pyad' across the forehead - very smart
* Не семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Not seven 'pyad' across the forehead - not so smart
* Мал ''золотник'', да до́рог. A zolotnik is small, but expensive : when quality rather than quantity is important 
* Идти ''семимильными'' шагами. To walk in 7-mile steps  - Any kind of very fast progress, e.g., of improvement
* Узнать, почём ''фунт'' лиха. To learn how much a pound of ''[[likho]]'' costs - To experience something bad
* Ни ''пяди'' земли (не уступить). Do not give up (even) a ''pyad'' of land
* Съесть ''пуд'' соли (вместе с кем-либо). To eat a 'pood' of salt (with somebody) - To have a long common experience with somebody (with the implication "to know someone well")

In [[mathematics]], a '''partial function''' from ''X'' to ''Y'' (sometimes written as {{math|''f'' : ''X'' ↛ ''Y''}} or {{math|''f'': ''X'' ⇸ ''Y''}}) is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] {{math|''f'': ''X''{{′}} → ''Y''}}, for some proper [[subset]] ''X''{{′}} of&amp;nbsp;''X''. It generalizes the concept of a function {{math|''f'' : ''X'' → ''Y''}} by not forcing ''f'' to map ''every'' element of ''X'' to an element of ''Y'' (only some proper subset ''X''{{′}} of ''X''). If {{nowrap|1=''X''{{′}} = ''X''}}, then ''f'' is called a '''total function''' and is equivalent to a function. Partial functions are often used when the exact [[domain of a function|domain]], ''X'', is not known (e.g. many functions in [[computability theory]]{{examples|date=September 2017}}).

Specifically, we will say that for any {{nowrap|''x'' ∈ ''X''}}, either:
* {{nowrap|1=''f''(''x'') = ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}} (it is defined as a single element in ''Y'') or
* ''f''(''x'') is undefined.

For example, we can consider the [[square root]] function restricted to the [[integer]]s
:&lt;math&gt;g\colon \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g(n) = \sqrt{n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus ''g''(''n'') is only defined for ''n'' that are [[square number|perfect squares]] ({{nowrap|i.e., 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, ...}}). So, {{nowrap|1=''g''(25) = 5}}, but ''g''(26) is undefined.

== Basic concepts ==
There are two distinct meanings in current mathematical usage for the notion of the [[domain of a function|domain]] of a partial function. Most mathematicians, including [[recursion theory|recursion theorists]], use the term "domain of ''f''" for the set of all values ''x'' such that ''f''(''x'') is defined (''X&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' above). But some, particularly [[category theory|category theorists]], consider the domain of a partial function ''f'':''X''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''Y'' to be ''X'', and refer to ''X&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' as the '''domain of definition'''.  Similarly, the term [[range (mathematics)|range]] can refer to either the [[codomain]] or the ''image'' of a function.

A partial function is said to be [[injective]] or [[surjective]] when the total function given by the restriction of the partial function to its domain of definition is injective or surjective respectively.  A partial function may be both injective and surjective (and thus [[bijection|bijective]]).

Because a function is trivially surjective when restricted to its image, the term [[partial bijection]] denotes a partial function which is injective.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014-251"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Hollings|title=Mathematics across the Iron Curtain: A History of the Algebraic Theory of Semigroups|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9wJBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA251|year=2014|publisher=American Mathematical Society|isbn=978-1-4704-1493-1|page=251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An injective partial function may be inverted to an injective partial function, and a partial function which is both injective and surjective has an injective function as inverse. Furthermore, a total function which is injective may be inverted to an injective partial function.

The notion of [[transformation (function)|transformation]] can be generalized to partial functions as well. A '''partial transformation''' is a function {{nowrap|''f'': ''A'' ⇸ ''B''}}, where both ''A'' and ''B'' are [[subset]]s of some set ''X''.&lt;ref name="Hollings2014-251"/&gt;

==Total function==
'''Total function''' is a [[synonym]] for [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. The use of the adjective "total" is to suggest that it is a special case of a partial function (specifically, a total function with domain ''X'' is a special case of a partial function over ''X'').  The adjective will typically be used for clarity in contexts where partial functions are common, for example in [[computability theory]].

==Function spaces==
The set of all partial functions {{nowrap|''f'': ''X'' ⇸ ''Y''}} from a set ''X'' to a set ''Y'', denoted by {{nowrap|[''X'' ⇸ ''Y'']}}, is the union of all total functions defined on subsets of ''X'' with same codomain ''Y'':
:&lt;math&gt;[X\not\to Y] =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\limits_{D \subseteq{X}} [D \to Y]&lt;/math&gt;, 
the latter also written as &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\limits_{D\subseteq{X}} Y^D&lt;/math&gt;. In finite case, its cardinality is
:&lt;math&gt;|[X\not\to Y]| =&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;(|Y|+1)^{|X|}&lt;/math&gt;,
because any partial function can be extended to a total function by any fixed value ''c'' not contained in ''Y'', so that the codomain is {{nowrap|''Y'' ∪ {''c''}}}, an operation which is injective (unique and invertible by restriction).

==Discussion and examples==
The first diagram above represents a partial function that is ''not'' a total function since the element 1 in the left-hand set is not associated with anything in the right-hand set.  Whereas, the second diagram represents a total function since every element on the left-hand set is associated with exactly one element in the right hand set.

===Natural logarithm===
Consider the [[natural logarithm]] function mapping the [[real number]]s to themselves. The logarithm of a non-positive real is not a real number, so the natural logarithm function doesn't associate any real number in the codomain with any non-positive real number in the domain. Therefore, the natural logarithm function is not a total function when viewed as a function from the reals to themselves, but it is a partial function. If the domain is restricted to only include the [[positive reals]] (that is, if the natural logarithm function is viewed as a function from the positive reals to the reals), then the natural logarithm is a total function.

===Subtraction of natural numbers===
Subtraction of [[natural numbers]] (non-negative [[integers]]) can be viewed as a partial function:

:&lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}\not\to \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = x - y.&lt;/math&gt;

It is defined only when &lt;math&gt;x \ge y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Bottom element===

In [[denotational semantics]] a partial function is considered as returning the [[bottom element]] when it is undefined.

In [[computer science]] a partial function corresponds to a subroutine that raises an exception or loops forever. The [[IEEE floating point]] standard defines a [[not-a-number]] value which is returned when a floating point operation is undefined and exceptions are suppressed, e.g. when the square root of a negative number is requested.

In a [[programming language]] where function parameters are [[statically typed]], a function may be defined as a partial function because the language's [[type system]] cannot express the exact domain of the function, so the programmer instead gives it the smallest domain which is expressible as a type and contains the true domain.

===In category theory===

In [[category theory]], when considering the operation of [[morphism]] composition in [[concrete categories]], the composition operation &lt;math&gt;\circ : \operatorname{hom}(C) \times \operatorname{hom}(C) \to \operatorname{hom}(C)&lt;/math&gt; is a total function if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{ob}(C)&lt;/math&gt; has one element. The reason for this is that two morphisms &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g:U\to V&lt;/math&gt; can only be composed as &lt;math&gt;g \circ f&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;Y=U&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the codomain of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must equal the domain of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

===In abstract algebra===
[[Partial algebra]] generalizes the notion of [[universal algebra]] to partial [[Operation (mathematics)|operations]]. An example would be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]], in which the multiplicative inversion is the only proper partial operation (because [[division by zero]] is not defined).&lt;ref name="RosenbergSabidussi1993"&gt;{{cite book|editors=Ivo G. Rosenberg and Gert Sabidussi|title=Algebras and Orders|year=1993|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-2143-9|author=Peter Burmeister|chapter=Partial algebras – an introductory survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of all partial functions (partial [[transformation (function)|transformation]]s) on a given base set, ''X'', forms a [[regular semigroup]] called the semigroup of all partial transformations (or the partial transformation semigroup on ''X''), typically denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{PT}_X&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="CliffordPreston1967"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred Hoblitzelle Clifford|author2=G. B. Preston|title=The Algebraic Theory of Semigroups.

Higgins|title=Techniques of semigroup theory|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press, Incorporated|isbn=978-0-19-853577-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GanyushkinMazorchuk2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Olexandr Ganyushkin|author2=Volodymyr Mazorchuk|title=Classical Finite Transformation Semigroups: An Introduction|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-84800-281-4|pages=16 and 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The set of all partial bijections on ''X'' forms the [[symmetric inverse semigroup]].&lt;ref name="CliffordPreston1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Higgins1992"/&gt;

===Charts and atlases for manifolds and fiber bundles===
Charts in the [[Atlas (topology)|atlases]] which specify the structure of [[manifold]]s and [[fiber bundle]]s are partial functions. In the case of manifolds, the domain is the point set of the manifold. In the case of fiber bundles, the domain is the total space of the fiber bundle. In these applications, the most important construction is the [[Atlas (topology)#Transition maps|transition map]], which is the composite of one chart with the inverse of another. The initial classification of manifolds and fiber bundles is largely expressed in terms of constraints on these transition maps.

The reason for the use of partial functions instead of total functions is to permit general global topologies to be represented by stitching together local patches to describe the global structure. The "patches" are the domains where the charts are defined.

'''Pierre-Paul Grassé''' (November 27, 1895, [[Périgueux]] ([[Dordogne]]) – July 9, 1985) was a French [[zoologist]], author of over 300 publications including the influential 52-volume ''[[Traité de Zoologie]]''. He was an expert on [[termite]]s and one of the last proponents of [[Neo-Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]] evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Théodoridès, Jean.  (1986). ''Obituary: Pierre-Paul Grassé (1895-1985)''. ''History of Science Journal''. Volume 39, No. 1, pp. 79-82.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loison, Laurent. (2011). ''French Roots of French Neo-Lamarckisms, 1879–1985''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. (Dordrecht, the Netherlands: Springer) 44 (4): 713-744.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Education ===
Grassé began his studies in Périgueux where his parents owned a small business. He went on to study [[medicine]] at the [[University of Bordeaux]] and studied [[biology]] in parallel, including the lectures of the entomologist [[Jean de Feytaud]] (1881–1973). Mobilized during [[World War I]], he was forced to interrupt his studies during four years. By the end of the war he was a military surgeon.

Grassé continued his studies in Paris, focusing exclusively on science. He obtained his [[Licence]] in Biology and frequented the laboratory of biologist [[Étienne Rabaud]] (1868–1956). He abandoned his preparations for the [[agrégation]] to accept a position as professor in the École Nationale Supérieure Agronomique de [[Montpellier]] (1921), where the department of zoology was led by [[François Picard (zoologist)|François Picard]] (1879–1939). There he frequented several [[Phytogeography|phytogeographers]] like [[Charles Flahault]] (1852–1935), [[Josias Braun-Blanquet]] (1884–1980), [[Georges Kuhnholtz-Lordat]] (1888–1965) and [[Marie Louis Emberger]] (1897–1969). He became the assistant of [[Octave Duboscq]] (1868–1943) who oriented the young Grassé toward the study of [[protozoan]] [[parasite]]s. After the departure of Duboscq to Paris, Grassé worked for [[Eugène Bataillon]] (1864–1953) and there discovered techniques for experimental embryology.

In 1926, Grassé became vice-director of the École supérieure de [[Sericulture|sériciculture]]. He submitted his theses, ''Contribution à l'étude des flagellés parasites'', in 1926, and it was published in the ''Archives de zoologie expérimentale et générale''.

=== Teaching and research ===
In 1929, Grassé became professor of zoology at the Université de [[Clermont-Ferrand]]. He supervised the  theses of several students on [[insect]]s. He conducted his first field research trip in Africa in 1933-1934, and returned there several times (1938–1939, 1945, 1948). During these trips he studied [[termite]]s, and became one of the great specialists on these insects.

In 1935, he became an Assistant Professor at the [[Université de Paris]] where he worked alongside [[Germaine Cousin (entomologist)|Germaine Cousin]] (1896–1992), and received the Prix Gadeau de Kerville de la Société entomologique de France for his work on [[orthoptera]] and termites. In 1939 he chaired the [[Société zoologique de France]] and in 1941 the [[Société entomologique de France]].

After having been briefly mobilized in [[Tours]], in 1944 he succeeded [[Maurice Caullery]] as Chair in Zoology and the Evolution of Beings. Grassé was elected a member of the [[Académie des sciences (France)|Académie des sciences]] on November 29, 1948, in the anatomy and zoology sector and presided over the institution in 1967. In 1976 he changed sectors, into the newly created animal and vegetal biology sector.

Grassé received numerous honours and titles during his career: commander of the [[Légion d'honneur]], doctor ''honoris causa'' of the universities of [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|Brussels]], [[University of Basel|Basel]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[Ghent University|Ghent]], [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]] and [[University of São Paulo|São Paulo]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Société Française de Parasitologie]] in 1962. He was also a member of several academic societies, including the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] and [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium]].

=== Publications ===
Grassé began publishing a very big project in 1946 entitled ''[[Traite de Zoologie|Traité de zoologie]]''. The 38 volumes required almost forty years of work, uniting some of the greatest names in zoology. They are still essential references in the field for the groups that are treated in their pages. Ten volumes are dedicated to mammals, nine to insects. Apart from this treatise, he led two collections published by [[Masson (publisher)|Masson]]: the first, entitled ''Grands problèmes de la biologie'', has thirteen volumes and the second is entitled ''Précis de sciences biologiques''. Alongside Andrée Tétry, he composed the two volumes dedicated to zoology in the collection ''[[Bibliothèque de la Pléiade]]'', published by [[Gallimard]]. He also supervised the edition of the ''Abrégé de zoologie'' (two volumes, Masson).

He also composed the ''Termitologia'' (1982, 1983, 1984), a work in three volumes totalling over 2400 pages. In it Grassé compiles all available knowledge concerning termites. It was by studying symbiotic flagellates in termites that he eventually began studying their hosts. In this publication, Grassé introduced the concept of [[Stigmergy]] :
:"Stigmergy manifests itself in the termite mound by the fact that the individual labour of each construction worker stimulates and guides the work of its neighbour.".&lt;ref&gt;Pesson, Paul. (1985). ''Hommage à Pierre-Paul Grassé (1895–1985), Professeur honoraire à l’Université de Paris, Membre de l’Académie des Sciences''. ''Bulletin de la Société entomologique de France'' '''90''' (9-10): 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also created three scientific reviews: ''Arvernia biologica'' (1932), ''Insectes sociaux'' (1953) et ''Biologia gabonica'' (1964). He participated in several reviews like the ''Annales des sciences naturelles'' and the ''Bulletin biologique de la France et de la Belgique''. Apart from his numerous scientific publications, he published several works popularising science such as ''La Vie des animaux'' ([[Éditions Larousse|Larousse]], 1968). He also signed the articles "Évolution" and "Stigmergie" of the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]''.

Grassé also authored many works where he talks of his views on [[evolution]] and [[metaphysics]] such as ''Toi, ce petit Dieu'' (Albin Michel, 1971), ''L’Évolution du vivant, matériaux pour une nouvelle théorie transformiste'' (Albin Michel, 1973), ''La Défaite de l’amour ou le triomphe de Freud'' (Albin Michel, 1976), ''Biologie moléculaire, mutagenèse et évolution'' (Masson, 1978), ''L’Homme en accusation: de la biologie à la politique''  (Albin Michel, 1980)...

== Neo-Lamarckism ==

Grassé was a supporter of the French tradition of [[Lamarckism]]. He occupied the Chair of Evolutionary Biology of the Faculty of Paris, of which the two previous occupiers, [[Alfred Giard]] (1846–1908) and [[Maurice Caullery]] (1868–1958), were both also supporters of Lamarckism. Only after Grassé's retirement did the chair become occupied by a partisan of Darwinism, [[Charles Bocquet]] (1918–1977).&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"&gt;Blanc, Marcel. (1990). ''Les Héritiers de Darwin. L’évolution en Mutation''. Seuil (Paris), collection ''Science'' ouverte: pp. 10-11, p. 238. {{ISBN|2-02-012510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In support of Lamarck's theories he organised an international congress in Paris in 1947 under the auspices of the [[CNRS]] with the theme "paleontology and transformism". The records were published in 1950 by Albin Michel. He united many of the greatest French authorities on the question including [[Lucien Cuénot]] (1866–1951), [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881–1955), and Maurice Caullery.&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt; They were all opponents to certain tenets of [[neo-Darwinism]]. Other brilliant biologists present were [[John Burdon Sanderson Haldane]] (1892–1964) and [[George Gaylord Simpson]] (1902–1984).&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt; Grassé stated his support for Lamarck in other ways too, like an article in the ''[[Encyclopædia Universalis]]'', and by affirming that Lamarck had been unjustifiably slandered and ought to be rehabilitated.&lt;ref&gt;Lapidus, Rémy Lestienne et Roxanne. (2000). ''Chance, Progress and Complexity in Biological Evolution''. SubStance, 29 (1), 91: 39-55. &lt;/ref&gt;

Some authors, like Marcel Blanc explain the strong support of [[Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck|Lamarck]] by French biologists by giving simple patriotic reasons and the historical and social context: Catholic culture favoring support of Lamarckism whilst [[Protestant culture]] favored support of Darwinism, although Grassé was a Protestant.&lt;ref name="Blanc 1990"/&gt;

===Evolution of Living Organisms===

Grassé presents his arguments against [[neo-Darwinism]] in his work ''L'évolution du vivant'' (1973), translated into English as ''Evolution of Living Organisms'' in 1977. Against the idea which states that the evolution of living things is the product of their adapting to changes in their environments, he opposes [[living fossil]]s, meaning species which stopped evolving at some point in time and have remained relatively identical to this day regardless of great climatic or geological changes (he cites numerous examples in ''Les formes panchroniques et les arrêts de l'évolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;133). Therefore, evolution is in his opinion a process which is not ''necessary'', it does not occur in living beings under the constraints of external physical forces (cf. ''Necessity-utility is not the primus movens of biological evolution'', p.&amp;nbsp;302). To explain evolution he instead thinks that you must look at the internal dynamics of living things.

Biologist [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] wrote in a review that Grassé's belief that evolution is directed by some unknown mechanism does not explain anything. He concluded that "to reject what is known, and to appeal to some wonderful future discovery which may explain it all, is contrary to sound scientific method. The sentence with which Grassé ends his book is disturbing: "It is possible that in this domain biology, impotent, yields the floor to metaphysics."&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky, Theodosius]]. (1975). ''Darwinian or 'Oriented' Evolution? L'Evolution du Vivant by Pierre P. Grassé''. ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. Vol. 29, No. 2, pp. 376-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] reviewed ''Evolution of Living Organisms'' for the ''[[New Scientist]]'' stating that the book was a criticism of neo-Darwinism, with the opinion that paleontology is "the only true science of evolution". Patterson a paleontologist disputed this statement. He also noted that Grassé's own theory of neo-Lamarckism was "hard to disentangle, and there were other places where Grassé's reasoning was difficult to follow." According to Patterson the book did not mention [[gene duplication]], but this has been well-established in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]]. (1978). ''Evolution of Living organisms''. ''[[New Scientist]]''. 7, September. p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Geologist [[David B. Kitts]] negatively reviewed the book commenting that all of "Grassé's arguments have been marshaled against Darwinian theory before and, in the opinion of most Darwinians, have been adequately countered." Grassé stated that evolution was driven by an internal factor.  Regarding the identification of this factor, Kitts quotes Grassé as saying "perhaps in this area of biology can go no further: the rest is metaphysics". Kitts found this statement unacceptable commenting that "the fundamental issues raised by Grassé's theory of evolution do not even belong to biology, but to some other discipline."&lt;ref&gt;[[David B. Kitts|Kitts, David B]]. (1979). ''Search for the Holy Transformation. Evolution of Living Organisms: Evidence for a New Theory of Transformation by Pierre-P. Grassé''. ''[[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]]''. Vol. 5, No. 3. pp. 353-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9554">{{main|Plot (narrative)}}
A '''plot device''', or '''plot mechanism''', {{citation needed|date=August 2017}} is any [[narrative technique|technique]] in a [[narrative]] used to move the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Pfeil|title=Another Tale to Tell: Politics and Narrative in Postmodern Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18mRgWs-ptEC&amp;pg=PA267|accessdate=27 July 2013|year=1990|publisher=Verso|isbn=978-0-86091-992-6|page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contrived or arbitrary plot device may annoy or confuse the reader, causing a loss of the [[suspension of disbelief]]. However a well-crafted plot device, or one that emerges naturally from the setting or characters of the story, may be entirely accepted, or may even be unnoticed by the audience.

== Examples of stories using plot devices ==
Many stories, especially in the fantasy genre, feature an object or objects with some great power. Often what drives the plot is the hero's need to find the object and use it for good, before the villain can use it for evil, or if the object has been broken by the villains, to retrieve each piece that must be gathered from each antagonist to restore it, or, if the object itself is evil, to destroy it. In some cases destroying the object will lead to the destruction of the villain. In the [[Indiana Jones]] film series, Jones is always on the hunt for some mystical artifact. In ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', he is trying to retrieve the [[Ark of the Covenant]]; in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', Jones is on a search for the [[Holy Grail]]. This plot device is also used in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'' tale of "[[The City of Brass]]," in which a group of travelers on an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] expedition journeys across the [[Sahara]] to find a brass vessel that [[Solomon]] once used to trap a [[Genie|jinn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=148–9 &amp; 217–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X00141540|title=An Allegory from the Arabian Nights: The City of Brass|first=Andras|last=Hamori|journal=[[School of Oriental and African Studies|Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]]|volume=34|issue=1|year=1971|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=9–19 [9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several books in the [[Harry Potter]] series orient around a certain object. In ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', Harry believes there is a magical stone in [[Hogwarts]] with special powers. [[Lord Voldemort]] needs this stone to bring back his body, and Harry looks for the stone first to prevent Voldemort's return.

The [[One Ring]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' has been labeled a plot device, since the quest to destroy it drives the entire plot of the novel. However, as [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]] puts it: "Tolkien, on the whole, gets away with the trick by minimizing the arbitrariness of the ring's plot-power and putting more stress than his imitators on the way the ring's power moulds the character of its wielder and vice-versa."&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The MacGuffin ===
{{main|MacGuffin}}
A MacGuffin is a term, popularized by [[film director]] [[Alfred Hitchcock]], referring to a plot device wherein a character pursues an object, though the object's actual nature is not important to the story. Another object would work just as well if the characters treated it with the same importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VP_DGfInVBcC&amp;pg=PA367&amp;dq=MacGuffin+definition#v=onepage&amp;q=MacGuffin%20definition&amp;f=false | title = A Year of Hitchcock: 52 Weeks with the Master of Suspense | isbn = 9780810863897 | last1 = McDevitt | first1 = Jim | last2 = Juan | first2 = Eric San | date = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the MacGuffin, Alfred Hitchcock stated, "In crook stories it is almost always the necklace and in spy stories it is most always the papers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://the.hitchcock.zone/wiki/MacGuffin
 |title=The Alfred Hitchcock Wiki
 |accessdate=2018-06-10
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This contrasts with, for example, the One Ring (from [[The Lord of the Rings]]), whose very nature is essential to the entire story.

MacGuffins are sometimes referred to as ''plot coupons'' (especially if multiple ones are required) as the protagonist only needs to "collect enough plot coupons and trade them in for a [[dénouement]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Davies | first = Mark | edition = illustrated | year = 2007 | title = Designing character-based console games | publisher = | page = 69 | isbn = 1584505214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]].&lt;ref name=Lowe&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Nick Lowe (classicist)|Nick Lowe]]|title=The Well-tempered Plot Device|url=http://news.ansible.co.uk/plotdev.html}}''In normal usage, when people talk of a plot device they mean something in the story that's just a little bit too obviously functional to be taken seriously.''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deus ex machina ===
{{main|Deus ex machina}}
The term ''deus ex machina'' is used to refer to a narrative ending in which an improbable event is used to resolve all problematic situations and bring the story to a (generally happy) conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deus%20ex%20machina |title=deus ex machina |work=Merriam Webster Online |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase "[[deus]] ex machina" has its origins in the conventions of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] tragedy, and refers to situations in which a [[mechane]] (crane) was used to lower actors playing a [[god]] or gods onto the stage at the end of a play.

The Greek [[Tragedy|tragedian]] [[Euripides]] is notorious for using this plot device as a means to resolve a hopeless situation. For example, in Euripides' play ''[[Alcestis (play)|Alcestis]]'', the [[eponymous]] heroine agrees to give up her own life to Death in exchange for sparing the life of her husband, Admetus. In doing so, however, she imposes upon him a series of extreme promises. Admetus is torn between choosing death or choosing to obey these unreasonable restrictions.{{which | date = July 2013}} In the end, though, [[Heracles]] shows up and seizes Alcestis from Death, restoring her to life and freeing Admetus from the promises. Another example of a ''deus ex machina'' is [[Gandalf]] in ''[[The Hobbit]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=D7eOal3UhFcC&amp;pg=PT24&amp;dq=%22Deus+ex+machina%22+gandalf+the+hobbit | title = Tolkien's Art: A Mythology for England | isbn = 0813138094 | last1 = Chance | first1 = Jane | date = 2001-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of seemingly limitless magical capabilities, he rescues the other main characters from all sorts of troubles. The first person known to have criticized the device was [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', where he argued that the resolution of a plot must arise internally, following from previous action of the play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Shoulder angel ===
{{main|Shoulder angel}}
A shoulder angel is a plot device&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iyYGbs_QLioC&amp;pg=PT47&amp;dq=%22Shoulder+angel%22+fiction | title = Hatch's Plotbank | date = 2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; used for either dramatic or humorous effect in animation and comic strips (and occasionally in live-action television). The angel represents conscience and is often accompanied by a shoulder devil representing temptation. They are handy for easily showing inner conflict of a character. Usually, the angel is depicted on (or hovering near) the right shoulder and the devil or demon on the left, as the left side traditionally represents dishonesty or impurity (see [[Left-handedness#Negative associations of language|Negative associations of left-handedness in language]]). The Shoulder Angel and Shoulder Devil are both derived from the concept of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] in [[Psychoanalysis]], with the person in the center of the dispute being the [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] between the [[super-ego]] Angel and the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]] Devil.

=== Red herring ===
{{main|Red herring}}
The function of a red herring is to divert the audience's attention away from something significant. Red herrings are very common plot devices in mystery, horror, and crime stories. The typical example is in [[whodunit]]s, in which facts are presented so that the audience is tricked into thinking that a given character is the murderer, when it is actually another character.

=== Plot voucher ===
{{See also|Chekhov's gun}}

A ''plot voucher'', as defined by Nick Lowe,&lt;ref name=Lowe/&gt; is an object given to a character (especially to the protagonist) before they encounter an obstacle that requires the use of the object. An example of a plot voucher is a gift received by a character, which later impedes a deadly bullet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16565">'''Positive affectivity''' ('''PA''') is a human characteristic that describes how much people experience positive affects (sensations, emotions, sentiments...); and as a consequence how they interact with others and with their surroundings.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Ashby, F. G., Isen, A. M., &amp; Turken, A. U. (1999). A neuropsychological theory of positive affect and its influence on cognition. Psychological Review, 106(3), 529-550. doi:10.1037/0033-295x.106.3.529&lt;/ref&gt;

People with high positive affectivity are typically enthusiastic, energetic, confident, active, and alert. Research has linked positive affectivity with an increase in longevity, better sleep, and a decrease in stress hormones.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, T. S., Yeung, S. E., &amp; Thornton, W. L. (2015). Positive affect predicts everyday problem-solving ability in older adults. Aging &amp; Mental Health, 20(8), 871-879. doi:10.1080/13607863.2015.1043619&lt;/ref&gt; People with a high positive affectivity have healthier coping styles, more positive self-qualities, and are more goal oriented.&lt;ref&gt;3. Li, Y. I., Starr, L. R., &amp; Hershenberg, R. (2017). Responses to positive affect in daily life: positive rumination and dampening moderate the association between daily events and depressive symptoms. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 39(3), 412-425. doi:10.1007/s10862-017-9593-y&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Paterson, T. S., Yeung, S. E., &amp; Thornton, W. L. (2015). Positive affect predicts everyday problem-solving ability in older adults. Aging &amp; Mental Health, 20(8), 871-879. doi:10.1080/13607863.2015.1043619&lt;/ref&gt; Positive affectivity also promotes an open-minded attitude, sociability, and helpfulness.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Those having low levels of positive affectivity (and high levels of ''negative'' affectivity) are characterized by sadness, lethargy, distress, and un-pleasurable engagement (see [[#Negative affectivity|negative affectivity]]). Low levels of positive affect are correlated with social anxiety and depression, due to decreased levels of dopamine.&lt;ref&gt; Cohen, Jonah N., et al. "Positive and negative affect as links between social anxiety and depression: predicting concurrent and prospective mood symptoms in unipolar and bipolar mood disorders." Behavior Therapy, vol. 48, no. 6, 2017, pp. 820–833., doi:10.1016/j.beth.2017.07.003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and findings ==
Studies are finding there is a relationship between dopamine release and positive affect in cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; For instance, when dopamine levels are low, positive affect can stimulate the release of more dopamine, temporarily increasing cognitive, motor, and emotional processing. Stimulating dopamine release influences several cognitive functions. First, an increase in dopamine in the nigrostriatal system can temporarily relieve motor or cognitive dysfunction, due to Parkinson’s.

An increase in dopamine release also influences the mesocorticolimbic system, via VTA cells, increasing mood and open mindedness in older adults. Positive affect also stimulates dopamine production in the prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate facilities, which help with processing working memory and executive attention. Lastly, PA indirectly improves memory consolidation in the hippocampus, by increasing acetylcholine release from an increase in dopamine.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Overall, positive affect results in a more positive outlook, increases problem solving skills, increases social skills, increases activity and projects, and can play a role in motor function.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;4. Nelis, S., Bastin, M., Raes, F., Mezulis, A., &amp; Bijttebier, P. (2016). Trait affectivity and response styles to positive affect: Negative affectivity relates to dampening and positive affectivity relates to enhancing. Personality and Individual Differences, 96, 148-154. doi:10.1016/j.paid.2016.02.087&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negative affectivity==
Positive affectivity (PA) and negative affectivity (NA) are nearly independent of each other;&lt;ref name="EPP"&gt;Naragon, K., &amp; Watson, D. (2009). "Positive affectivity". In S. Lopez (Ed.), ''The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology'' (pp. 707-711). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; it is possible for a person to be high in both PA and NA, high in one and low in the other, or low in both. Affectivity has been found to be moderately stable over time and across situations (such as working versus relaxing).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Positive affectivity may influence an individual's choices in general, particularly their responses to questionnaires.

[[Happiness]], a feeling of well-being, and high levels of [[self-esteem]] are often associated with high levels of positive affectivity, but they are each influenced by negative affectivity as well.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Trait PA roughly corresponds to the dominant [[Personality psychology|personality factors]] of [[extraversion]];&lt;ref name="Watson 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Watson|first= David|last2= Clark|first2= Lee Anna|date= 1984|title= Negative Affectivity: The Disposition to Experience Aversive Emotional States|url= |journal= [[Psychological Bulletin]]|publisher= [[American Psychological Association]] (APA)|volume= 96|issue= 3|pages= 465–490|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.96.3.465|accessdate= |pmid=6393179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tellegen"/&gt; however, this construct is also influenced by interpersonal components.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;

==Testing==
Because there is not a hard-and-fast rule for defining certain levels of positive affectivity, different [[Self-report study|self-reported assessments]] use different scales of measure.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt; Several prominent tests are listed below; in each of these, the respondent determines the degree to which a given adjective or phrase accurately characterizes him or her.

*Differential Emotions Scale (DES): A PA scale that assesses enjoyment (happy or joyful feelings) and interest (excitement, [[alertness]], [[curiosity]]).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Multiple Affect Adjective Checklist – Revised (MAACL-R): Measures PA according to the DES scale and to an additional scale assessing thrill-seeking behavior (i.e., how daring or adventurous the person is).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Profile of Mood States (POMS): Uses vigor scale to assess the domain of PA.&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*Expanded Form of the Positives and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X): This test uses three main scales: joviality (how cheerful, happy, or lively), self-assurance (how confident and strong), and attentiveness (alertness and concentration).&lt;ref name="EPP"/&gt;
*International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule Short-Form (I-PANAS-SF): This is a brief, 10-item version of the PANAS that has been developed and extensively validated for use in English with both native and non-native English speakers.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=E.R.|title=Development and validation of an internationally reliable short-form of the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS)|journal=[[Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology]]|year=2007|volume=38|issue=2|pages=227–242|doi=10.1177/0022022106297301|url=http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/lit/Articles/ThompsonE2007a.pdf}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internal consistency]] reliability for the 5-item PA scale is reported to range between .72 and .78.&lt;ref name="Thompson" /&gt;

==In business management==
Positive affectivity is a managerial and organizational behavior tool used to create positive environments in the workplace. Through the use of PA, the manager can induce a positive employee experience and culture. "Since affectivity is related to the employee experiences, we expect the employees with high PA to feel considerable organizational support. Their optimism and confidence also helps them discuss their views in a manner characterized by constructive controversy with their supervisor, so that problems are solved and their positive feelings confirmed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hui|first1=Chun|last2=Wong|first2=Alfred|last3=Tjosvold|first3=Dean|title=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology (2007), 80, 735–751|journal=Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology|page=738|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive Affectivity allows creative problem solving to flourish in an environment where employees are not intimidated to approach managers, therefore employees believe they are playing a key role in the organization in coming forward with solutions. The goal is to maximize PA and minimize any negative affectivity circulating in the business. Negative emotions, such as [[fear]], [[anger]], stress, [[hostility]], [[sadness]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], increase the predictability of [[workplace deviance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|last2=Kibeom|last3=Allen|first3=Natalie J|title=Organizational Citizenship Behavior and Workplace Deviance: The Role of Affect and Cognitions|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2002|volume=87|issue=1|pages= 131–142|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.87.1.131|pmid=11916207}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore reduce the productivity of the business.

==Effects==
Positive affectivity is an integral part of [[everyday life]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} PA helps individuals to process emotional information accurately and efficiently, to solve problems, to make plans, and to earn achievements. The [[broaden-and-build]] theory of PA&lt;ref name="Fred 1"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fredrickson|first= Barbara L.|date= September 1998|title= What Good Are Positive Emotions?|url= |journal= [[Review of General Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 2|issue= 3|pages= 300–319|doi= 10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.300|accessdate= |pmid=21850154 |pmc=3156001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fredrickson2001&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fredrickson|first= Barbara L.|date= March 2001|title= The Role of Positive Emotions in Positive Psychology: The Broaden-and-Build Theory of Positive Emotions|journal= [[American Psychologist]]|publisher= APA|volume= 56|issue= 3|pages= 218–226|doi= 10.1037/0003-066x.56.3.218|pmid=11315248 |pmc=3122271}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that PA broadens people's momentary thought-action repertoires and builds their enduring personal resources.

Research shows that PA relates to different classes of variables, such as social activity and the frequency of pleasant events.&lt;ref name="Watson 1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiser"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Beiser|first= Morton|date= December 1974|title= Components and Correlates of Mental Well-Being|journal= [[Journal of Health and Social Behavior]]|publisher= [[American Sociological Association]]|volume= 15|issue= 4|pages= 320–327|doi= 10.2307/2137092|jstor=2137092}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradburn"&gt;Bradburn, N.

Maser (Eds.), ''Anxiety and the Anxiety Disorders'', (pp.&amp;nbsp;681–706), Hilssdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the content similarities between these affective traits and life satisfaction have led some researchers to view both PA, NA, and life satisfaction as specific indicators of the broader construct of [[subjective well-being]].&lt;ref name="DeNeve"&gt;{{cite journal |last= DeNeve|first= Kristina M.|last2= Cooper|first2= Harris|date= September 1998|title= The Happy Personality: A Meta-Analysis of 137 Personality Traits and Subjective Well-Being|url= |journal= Psychological Bulletin|publisher= APA|volume= 124|issue= 2|pages= 197–229|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.197|accessdate=|pmid=9747186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These resources are physical (e.g., better health), social (e.g., [[social support]] [[Social network|networks]]), and intellectual and psychological (e.g., [[Psychological resilience|resilience]], optimism, and [[creativity]]).

PA provides a psychological break or respite from [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], supporting continued efforts to replenish resources depleted by stress.&lt;ref name="Lazarus"&gt;Lazarus, R. S.

In [[philosophy]] and [[bioethics]], '''potential (future) person''' (in plural, sometimes termed '''potential people''') has been defined as an entity which is not currently a person but which is capable of developing into a person, given certain biologically and/or technically possible conditions.&lt;ref name=warren1977&gt;''Do Potential People Have Moral Rights?'' By Mary Anne Warren. Canadian Journal of Philosophy. Vol. 7, No. 2 (Jun., 1977), pp. 275-289 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40230690]&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''unconceived''' has also been used in a similar sense, but does not necessarily include the capability of being conceived or developing into a person.

==Definitions==
In 1977, Canadian Philosopher Mary Anne Warren discussed various definitions for ''potential people''.  Most simply, a ''potential person'' could be defined as the currently existing genetic material that will constitute them, such as a sexually viable egg and sperm cell taken together, also when still being located in separate places.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;  Potential people may also be defined from reproductive capability, which also includes the presence of other necessary factors for becoming a person,&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; such as the availability of a womb to grow in, the will and means of parents to conceive, or even the care after birth to raise the individual into a complete sentient being. Thus the progression towards existence of a potential person usually lies mainly in the maturation of previous people to develop the will and ability to become potential parents. 

In this sense, destroying sperm cells, for instance, does not significantly reduce the number of potential persons, because, provided the will and other means to conceive a person remains the same, there is still the possibility to extract the genetic information from remaining sperm cells or, theoretically, even from somatic cells such as skin cells (by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]). Actually, in this sense, for a man that intends to conceive only two children, the billions on sperm cells he produces throughout his lifetime may, taken together, still only be regarded as a contributing factor to a maximum of two potential persons. 

If including the will to conceive as a necessary component of a potential person, the mere certain decision of a woman to not let an embryo grow inside her uterus may be regarded as sufficient to disqualify that embryo as a potential person, because a will that is strong enough would make that woman turn to even [[unsafe abortion]], and a certain future abortion makes it certain that there won't be a necessary uterus for the embryo to grow inside to become a person. 

Strangely, in such a view, an act of a woman in changing her mind from abortion to proceeding with the pregnancy may be regarded as creating a potential person rather than saving the life of one, but other views may be applied once the [[beginning of human personhood|beginning of actual human personhood]] has been reached. When taking this view to a larger scale, a population that is very intent on reproducing can be expected to constitute a larger number of potential persons than a population refusing to reproduce, all other factors being equal. When there is only one or a few factors absent to constitute a potential person, that entity may still be termed "a potential person except for...", but the ensuing arguments from this may differ.

The people of the twenty-fifth century have been taken as an example of potential persons, because, although their particular [[gamete]]s or [[embryo]]s do not currently exist, there is reproductive capability of the currently living people and [[resource]]s to make the future existence of those people possible.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; The mere likelihood of future existence is usually regarded as sufficient to apply the term, as there is a risk that, for example, the people of the twenty-fifth century will never exist because of an event of [[human extinction]].&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; 

The [[beginning of human personhood]], where a potential person is instead regarded as a proper person, is a concept currently debated by religion and philosophy. However, there could theoretically be no beginning of ''potential'' human personhood because it is dependent on the reproductive capability of the previous generation, which, in turn, is dependent on the reproductive capability of the generation before that etc. etc.

==Value of potential persons==
It has been argued that the mere potential of becoming a person confers moral rights on a [[prima facie]] basis,&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;&lt;ref name=hare1975p212-213&gt;Page 212 and 213 in: ''Abortion and the Golden Rule'' By R. M. Hare. Philosophy and Public Affairs. Vol. 4, No. 3 (Spring, 1975), pp. 201-222 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2265083]&lt;/ref&gt; or by holding that they are really in some sense actuals.&lt;ref name=bigelow/&gt; On the other hand, there is the opinion that the potential itself is not of significance.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;

Among views that reject a prima facie right to potential people, there are, on one hand, claims that potential people are non-actuals and cannot be either benefited or harmed.&lt;ref name=bigelow/&gt; Also, there are views that, although a potential person has no value in the present, the rightfulness of actions that we make today are still dependent on how they will affect such people in the future, and that we have moral obligations for future generations.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; An argument for such a view is in finding it logical that the value of an action can be seen as equivalent to the total [[instrumental value]] at any time of the chain of events that that action started, which in turn can be seen as equivalent to the total [[Intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic value]] of whatever [[ends-in-themselves]] are generated or benefited at the end of that chain of events. For example, a remote friend has a baby, and is about to conceive another, and, for example, happiness is taken as the end-in-itself and receiving a toy is taken as an instrument to it, then, the yet unconceived baby may not be regarded as currently having ethic value, in contrast to the existing baby, but nevertheless, the instrumental value in the action of posting a toy to either of them can be regarded as equivalent, because either alternative would generate equal amount of intrinsic value in the form of happiness in the future, with some modification for, for example, the risk of failing to conceive again, and the burden for the post office or parent in storing the toy until, at least, birth. In such a view, it is uncertain to which extent a lesser probability of becoming a person affects the moral value of that potential person, putting uncertainty to claiming, for example, that a potential person with 50% probability of becoming a person should be treated as having 50% the value of an actual person.

===Bringing people into existence===
Even among views that the rightfulness of current actions depend on how they will affect yet non-existent people, there may still be differences regarding the justification of bringing people into existence in the first place, or the prevention of it.

A major factor in this issue is whether ends-in-themselves are generally regarded to optimally be maximized or minimized on a total basis or as an average among the people (such as, for example, [[average and total utilitarianism|total versus average utilitarism]]). A view that favors maximizing an end-in-itself on a total basis may consider it beneficial to have more people brought into existence by the motivation that there are more people to generate it. On the other hand, a view that favors maximizing an end-in-itself on an average basis has suggested that the benefit or harm in an action that supports or prevents bringing a potential person into existence depends on whether that person, on average, will constitute or generate more or less end-in-itself than the average.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; For example, if happiness is regarded as the end-in-itself, then, it has been claimed to be morally objectionable to bring a potential person into existence that is predicted to be very unhappy.&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt;

Another factor that has been suggested is the possible positive or negative value of nonexistence, which can be regarded as weighting against or adding to the values of existence when considering the rightfulness of bringing potential people into existence.&lt;ref name=bigelow&gt;''Morality, Potential Persons and Abortion''. By John Bigelow and Robert Pargetter. American Philosophical Quarterly. Vol. 25, No. 2 (Apr., 1988), pp. 173-181 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20014236]&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Practical consequences====
The personal opinion on the value of bringing potential people into existence may be a major factor in many issues, including:
*[[Natalism]] (promoting [[human reproduction]]) or [[antinatalism]]
*Issues of [[optimum population]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], or [[population decline]]
*[[Pro-choice]] or [[pro-life]]

From a view that favors the act of bringing people into existence, it has been argued that avoidance from conceiving a child when there are prerequisites for raising it is comparable to causing the death of one.&lt;ref name=Savulescu2002&gt;''Abortion, embryo destruction and the future of value argument'' By J Savulescu. J Med Ethics 2002 28: 133-135. {{doi|10.1136/jme.28.3.133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has been argued that contraception, and even the decision not to procreate at all could be regarded as immoral on a similar basis as [[abortion]].&lt;ref name=warren1977/&gt; However, holding value in potential persons does not necessarily decrease support for [[abortion]] rights. It has been regarded as justified to induce abortion of a severely disabled fetus in favor for conceiving a new child. However, a major reason that has been given to be cautious about performing abortion with such motivation is the fact that the likelihood of successfully bringing the new child into existence is substantially lower, as the parents may separate, one of them may become sterile, or they may change their minds about having children.&lt;ref name=hare1975p212-213/&gt; A comparable situation is the abortion of an [[unintended pregnancy]] in favor for conceiving a new child later in better conditions.&lt;ref name=Savulescu2002/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16875">&lt;!--Overview of discipline:--&gt;
'''Pre-attentive processing''' is the subconscious accumulation of information from the environment.&lt;ref name="Atienza"&gt;Atienza, M., Cantero, J. L., &amp; Escera, C. (2001). Auditory information processing during human sleep as revealed by event-related brain potentials. Clinical Neurophysiology, 112(11), 2031-2045.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Van der Heijden, A. H. C. (1996). Perception for selection, selection for action, and action for perception. Visual Cognition, 3(4), 357-361.&lt;/ref&gt;  All available information is pre-attentively processed.&lt;ref name="Van" /&gt; Then, the brain filters and processes what is important.  Information that has the highest salience (a stimulus that stands out the most) or relevance to what a person is thinking about is selected for further and more complete analysis by conscious (attentive) processing.&lt;ref name="Atienza" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Van" /&gt; Understanding how pre-attentive processing works is useful in advertising, in education, and for prediction of [[Cognition|cognitive ability]].

== Pure-capture and contingent-capture ==

The reasons are unclear as to why certain information proceeds from pre-attentive to attentive processing while other information does not.  It is generally accepted that the selection involves an interaction between the salience of a stimulus and a person’s current intentions and/or goals.&lt;ref&gt;Egeth, H. E., Yantis, S. (1997). Visual attention: Control, representation, and time course. Annual Review of Psychology, 48, 269-297.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two models of pre-attentive processing are pure-capture and contingent-capture.&lt;ref name="Folk"&gt;Folk, C. L., &amp; Remington, R. (2006). Top-down modulation of preattentive processing: Testing the recovery account of contingent capture. Visual Cognition, 14, 445-465.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The "pure-capture" model focuses on stimulus salience.&lt;ref name="Tollner"&gt;Tollner, T., Zehetleitner, M., Gramann, K., &amp; Muller, H. J. (2010). Top-down weighting of visual dimensions: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence. Vision Research, 50(14), 1372-1381.&lt;/ref&gt; If certain properties of a stimulus stand out from its background, the stimulus has a higher chance of being selected for attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; This is sometimes referred to as "bottom-up" processing, as it is the properties of the stimuli which affect selection. Since things that affect pre-attentive processing do not necessarily correlate with things that affect attention, stimulus salience may be more important than conscious goals. For example, pre-attentive processing is slowed by sleep deprivation while attention, although less focused, is not slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Raz, A., Deouell, L. Y., &amp; Bentin, S. (2001). Is pre-attentive processing compromised by prolonged wakefulness? Effects of total sleep deprivation on the mismatch negativity. Psychophysiology, 38, 787-795.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, when searching for a particular visual stimulus among a variety of visual distractions, people often have more trouble finding what they are looking for if one or more of the distractions is particularly salient.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; For example, it is easier to locate a bright, green circle (which is salient) among distractor circles if they are all grey (a bland color) than it is to locate a green circle among distractor circles if some are red (also salient colour). This is thought to occur because the salient red circles attract our attention away from the target green circle. However, this is difficult to prove because when given a target (like the green circle) to search for in a laboratory experiment, participants may generalize the task to searching for anything that stands out, rather than solely searching for the target.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; If this happens, the conscious goal becomes finding anything that stands out, which would direct the person’s attention towards red distractor circles as well as the green target. This means that a person’s goal, rather than the salience of the stimuli, could be causing the delayed ability to find the target.

The "contingent-capture" model emphasizes the idea that a person’s current intentions and/or goals affect the speed and efficiency of pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; The brain directs an individual’s attention towards stimuli with features that fit in with their goals. Consequently, these stimuli will be processed faster at the pre-attentive stage and will be more likely to be selected for attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Tollner" /&gt; Since this model focuses on the importance of conscious processes (rather than properties of the stimulus itself) in selecting information for attentive processing, it is sometimes called "top-down" selection.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt;  In support of this model, it has been shown that a target stimulus can be located faster if it is preceded by the presentation of a similar, priming stimulus.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; For example, if an individual is shown the color green and then required to find a green circle among distractors, the initial exposure to the color will make it easier to find the green circle. This is because they are already thinking about and envisioning the color green, so when it shows up again as the green circle, their brain readily directs its attention towards it. This suggests that processing an initial stimulus speeds up a person’s ability to select a similar target from pre-attentive processing. However, it could be that the speed of pre-attentive processing itself is not affected by the first stimulus, but rather that people are simply able to quickly abandon dissimilar stimuli, enabling them to re-engage to the correct target more quickly.&lt;ref name="Folk" /&gt; This would mean that the difference in reaction time occurs at the attentive level, after pre-attentive processing and stimulus selection has already taken place.

== Vision ==
Information for pre-attentive processing is detected through the five senses. In the visual system, the receptive fields at the back of the eye ([[retina]]) transfer the image via [[axon|axons]] to the [[thalamus]], specifically the [[lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Meng"&gt;Meng, X., &amp; Wang, Z. (2009). A pre-attentive model of biological vision. IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Intelligent Systems, 3, 154-158.&lt;/ref&gt;  The image then travels to the [[visual cortex|primary visual cortex]] and continues on to be processed by the [[visual cortex|visual association cortex]].  At each stage, the image is processed with increasing complexity.  Pre-attentive processing starts with the [[retina]]l image; this image is magnified as it moves from [[retina]] to the cortex of the brain.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  Shades of light and dark are processed in the [[lateral geniculate nucleus|lateral geniculate nuclei]] of the [[thalamus]].&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  Simple and complex cells in the brain process boundary and surface information by deciphering the image's contrast, orientation, and edges.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt;  When the image hits the [[fovea centralis|fovea]], it is highly magnified, facilitating object recognition. The images in the [[peripheral vision|periphery]] are less clear but help to create a complete image used for scene perception.&lt;ref name="Meng" /&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Klein, S. A., Carney, T., Barghout-Stein, L., &amp; Tyler, C. W. (1997, June). Seven models of masking. In Electronic Imaging'97 (pp. 13-24). International Society for Optics and Photonics. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Barghout-Stein, Lauren. On differences between peripheral and foveal pattern masking. Diss. University of California, Berkeley, 1999. &lt;/ref&gt;

Visual scene segmentation is a pre-attentive process where stimuli are grouped together into specific objects against a background.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;Appelbaum, L. G., &amp; Norcia, A. M. (2009). Attentive and pre-attentive aspects of figural processing. Journal of Vision, 9(11), 1-12. {{doi|10.1167/9.11.18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figure and background regions of an image activate different processing centres: figures use the [[occipital lobe|lateral occipital areas]] (which involve object processing) and background engages dorso-medial areas.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kourtzi, Z., &amp; Kanwisher, N. (2000). Cortical regions involved in perceiving object shape. Journal of Neuroscience, 20, 3310-3318.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Visual pre-attentive processing uses a distinct memory mechanism.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher"&gt;Krummenacher, J., Grubert, A., &amp; Müller, H. J. (2010). Inter-trial and redundant-signals effects in visual search and discrimination tasks: Separable pre-attentive and post-selective effects. Vision Research, 50(14), 1382-1395. {{doi|10.1016/j.visres.2010.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When a stimulus is presented consecutively, the stimulus is perceived at a faster rate than if different stimuli are presented consecutively.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt;  The theory behind this is called the dimension-weighting account (DWA) where each time a specific stimulus (i.e. color) is presented it contributes to the weight of the stimuli.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt; More presentations increase the weight of the stimuli, and therefore, subsequently decrease the reaction time to the stimulus.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt;  The dimensional-weighting system, which calculates pre-attentive processing for our visual system, codes the stimulus and thus directs attention to the stimulus with the most weight.&lt;ref name="Krummenacher" /&gt; 

Visual pre-attentive processing is also involved in the perception of emotion.&lt;ref name="Balconi"&gt;Balconi, M., &amp; Mazza, G. (2009). Consciousness and emotion: ERP modulation and attentive vs. pre-attentive elaboration of emotional facial expressions by backward masking. Springer Science, 33, 113-124.&lt;/ref&gt;  Human beings are social creatures and are very adept at critiquing facial expressions.  We have the ability to unconsciously process emotional stimuli and equate the stimuli, such as a face, with meaning.&lt;ref name="Balconi" /&gt;

== Audition ==
The auditory system is also very important in accumulating information for pre-attentive processing. When a person’s eardrum is struck by incoming sound waves, it vibrates. This sends messages, via the [[cochlear nerve|auditory nerve]], to the brain for pre-attentive processing. The ability to adequately filter information from pre-attentive processing to attentive processing is necessary for the normal development of social skills.&lt;ref name="Seri"&gt;Seri, S., Pisani, F., Thai, J. N., &amp; Cerquiglini, A. (2007). Pre-attentive auditory sensory processing in autistic spectrum disorder. Are electromagnetic measurements telling us a coherent story? International Journal of Psychophysiology, 63(2), 159-163.&lt;/ref&gt; For acoustic pre-attentive processing, the [[temporal lobe|temporal cortex]] was believed to be the main site of activation, however, recent evidence has indicated involvement of the [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] as well.&lt;ref name="Habermeyer"&gt;Habermeyer, B., Herdener, M., Esposito, F., Hilti, C. C., Klarhofer, M., di Salle, F., Wetzel, S., et al. (2009). Neural correlates of pre-attentive processing of pattern deviance in professional musicians. Human Brain Mapping, 30, 3736-3747.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klamer"&gt;Klamer, D., Svensson, L., Fejgin, K., &amp; Palson, E. (2011). Prefrontal NMDA receptor antagonism reduces impairments in pre-attentive information processing. European Neuropsychopharmacology, 21(3), 248-253.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[frontal lobe|frontal cortex]] is predominantly associated with attentional processing, but it may also be involved in pre-attentive processing of complex and/or salient acoustic stimuli.&lt;ref name="Appelbaum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;  For example, detecting slight variations in complex musical patterns has been shown to activate the right ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]].&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;

It has been shown that in acoustic pre-attentive processing there is some degree of [[lateralization of brain function|lateralization]].&lt;ref name="Zaehle"&gt;Zaehle, T., Jancke, L., Herrmann, C. S., Meyer, M. (2009). Pre-attentive spectro-temporal feature processing in the human auditory system. Brain Topography, 22, 97-108.&lt;/ref&gt; The left hemisphere responds more to temporal acoustic information whereas the right hemisphere responds to the frequency of auditory information.&lt;ref name="Zaehle" /&gt;  Also, there is [[lateralization of brain function|lateralization]] in the perception of speech which is left hemisphere dominant for pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref&gt;Sorokin, A., Alku, P., &amp; Kujala, T. (2010). Change and novelty detection in speech and non-speech sound streams. Brain Research, 1327, 77-90. {{doi|10.1016/j.brainres.2010.02.052}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multisensory integration ==
	Vision, sound, smell, touch, and taste are processed together pre-attentively when more than one sensory stimuli are present.&lt;ref name="Fairhall"&gt;Fairhall, S. L., &amp; Macaluso, E. (2009). Spatial attention can modulate audiovisual integration at multiple cortical and subcortical sites. European Journal of Neuroscience, 29, 1247-1257.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[multisensory integration]] increases activity in the [[superior temporal sulcus]] (STS), [[thalamus]], and [[superior colliculus]].&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  Specifically, the pre-attentive process of [[multisensory integration]] works jointly with attention to activate brain regions such as the [[superior temporal sulcus|STS]].&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  [[Multisensory integration]] seems to give a person the advantage of greater comprehension if both auditory and visual stimuli are being processed together.&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;  But it is important to note that [[multisensory integration]] is affected by what a person pays attention to and their current goals.&lt;ref name="Fairhall" /&gt;

== Plasticity ==
	Training can lead to changes in activity and brain structures involved in pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Habermeyer"/&gt; Professional musicians, in particular, show larger ERP ([[Event-related potential]]) responses to deviations in auditory stimuli and have possibly related structural differences in their brains ([[transverse temporal gyrus|Heschl’s gyrus]], [[corpus callosum]], and [[corticospinal tract|pyramidal tracts]]).&lt;ref name="Habermeyer" /&gt;  This plasticity of pre-attentive processing has also been shown in perception.  Using EEG ([[electroencephalography]]) methods in pre-attentive colour perception, a study observed how easy it was for bilinguals to adapt to the linguistic constructs of a different culture.&lt;ref name="Athanasopoulos"&gt;Athanasopoulos, P., Dering, B., Wiggett, A., Kuipers, J., &amp; Thierry, G. (2010). Perceptual shift in bilingualism: Brain potentials reveal plasticity in pre-attentive colour perception. ''Cognition'', 116(3), 437-443. {{doi|10.1016/j.cognition.2010.05.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that pre-attentive processes are not hard-wired but malleable.&lt;ref name="Athanasopoulos" /&gt;

== Deficits ==
Deficits in the transition from pre-attentive processing to attentive processing are associated with disorders such as [[schizophrenia]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], and [[autism]].&lt;ref name="Seri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tales"&gt;Tales, A., Haworth, J., Wilcock, G., Newton, P., &amp; Butler, S. (2008). Visual mismatch negativity highlights abnormal pre-attentive visual processing in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Neuropsychologia, 46(5), 1224-1232.&lt;/ref&gt; Abnormal [[prefrontal cortex]] function in [[schizophrenia|schizophrenics]] results in the inability to use pre-attentive processing to recognize familiar auditory stimuli as non-threatening.&lt;ref name="Klamer" /&gt;  [[schizophrenia|Schizophrenics]] with positive symptoms have a greater capability of pre-attentively processing emotionally negative odors.&lt;ref name="Pause"&gt;Pause, B. M., Hellman, G., Goder, R., Aldenhoff, J. B., &amp; Ferstl, R. (2008). Increased processing speed for emotionally negative odors in schizophrenia. International Journal of Psychophysiology,  70, 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  This heightened ability to distinguish odors seems to be involved in their hypersensitivity to threatening situations.&lt;ref name="Pause" /&gt; [[Alzheimer's disease]] is typically thought to affect high-level brain functioning (like memory) but can also have negative impacts on visual pre-attentive processing.&lt;ref name="Tales" /&gt; Some of the difficulties with social interaction seen in [[autism|autistics]] may be due to an impairment in filtration of pre-attentive auditory information.&lt;ref name="Seri" /&gt; For example, they often have difficulty following a conversation as they cannot distinguish which parts are important and are easily distracted by other sounds.

'''Prejudice''', or '''bigotry''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wedgwood|first=Hensleigh|authorlink=Hensleigh Wedgwood|title=English Etymologies|journal=Transactions of the Philological Society|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3924121;view=1up;seq=123|year=1855|issue=8|pages=113-116}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an affective feeling towards a person or group member based solely on that person's group membership (tribal behavior). The word is often used to refer to preconceived, usually unfavorable, feelings towards people or a person because of their [[sex]], [[gender]], [[belief]]s, [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[social class]], [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], [[religion]], [[sexual orientation|sexuality]], [[Race (human classification)|race]]/[[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[nationality]], [[beauty]], [[job|occupation]], [[education]], [[criminality]], [[Fan loyalty|sport team affiliation]] or other personal characteristics. In this case, it refers to a positive or negative evaluation of another person based on that person's perceived group membership.&lt;ref&gt;Dovidio, J. F., &amp; Gaertner. S. L. (2010). "Intergroup bias". In S. T. Fiske, D. T. Gilbert, &amp; G. Lindzey (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pye5IkCFgRYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Prejudice&amp;f=false The Handbook of Social Psychology]'' (5th ed., Vol. 2). New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prejudice can also refer to unfounded or [[pigeonholed]] beliefs&lt;ref&gt;Turiel, Elliot. "[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0165025407083670 Commentary: The problems of prejudice, discrimination, and exclusion]." International Journal of Behavioral Development 31.5 (2007): 419-422.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William James]] wrote: "A great many people think they are thinking when they are merely rearranging their prejudices." [http://www.freemaninstitute.com/quotes.htm Quotable Quotes – Courtesy of The Freeman Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and it may include "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosnow |first1=Ralph L. |title=Poultry and Prejudice |journal=Psychologist Today |date=March 1972 |volume=5 |issue=10 |pages=53–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Allport]] defined prejudice as a "feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allport|first=Gordon|title=The Nature of Prejudice|year=1979|publisher=Perseus Books Publishing|isbn=0-201-00179-9|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the evolutionary psychology perspective, see [[Prejudice from an evolutionary perspective]]. [[Lene_Auestad|Auestad]] (2015) defines prejudice as characterized by 'symbolic transfer', transfer of a value-laden meaning content onto a socially formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Auestad|first1=Lene|title=Respect, Plurality, and Prejudice|date=2015|publisher=Karnac|location=London|isbn=9781782201397|pages=xxi–xxii|edition=1|url=http://www.karnacbooks.com/product/respect-plurality-and-prejudice-a-psychoanalytical-and-philosophical-enquiry-into-the-dynamics-of-social-exclusion-and-discrimination/35283/?MATCH=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical approaches==
The first [[psychological research]] conducted on prejudice occurred in the 1920s. This research attempted to prove [[white supremacy]]. One article from 1925 which reviewed 73 studies on race concluded that the studies seemed "to indicate the mental superiority of the white race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0075064 |title=A review of race psychology |year=1930 |last1=Garth |first1=T. Rooster. |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=27 |issue=5 |pages=329–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies, along with other research, led many psychologists to view prejudice as a natural response to inferior races.

In the 1930s and 1940s, this perspective began to change due to the increasing concern about [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]]. At the time, theorists viewed prejudice as pathological and they thus looked for personality syndromes linked with [[racism]]. [[Theodor Adorno]] believed that prejudice stemmed from an [[authoritarian personality]]; he believed that people with authoritarian personalities were the most likely to be prejudiced against groups of lower status. He described authoritarians as "rigid thinkers who obeyed authority, saw the world as [[black and white thinking|black and white]], and enforced strict adherence to social rules and hierarchies".&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"&gt;Plous, S. "[http://www.understandingprejudice.org/apa/english/ The Psychology of Prejudice]". Understanding Prejudice.org. Web. 07 Apr. 2011.{{vs|where's the URL?|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Gordon Allport]], in his classic work ''[[The Nature of Prejudice]]'', linked prejudice to categorical thinking. Allport claimed that prejudice is a natural and normal process for humans. According to him, "The human mind must think with the aid of categories… Once formed, categories are the basis for normal prejudgment. We cannot possibly avoid this process. Orderly living depends upon it."&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W. (1954). ''The Nature of Prejudice''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, research began to show that prejudice tends to be based on [[In-group favoritism|favoritism towards one's own groups]], rather than negative feelings towards another group. According to [[Marilyn Brewer]], prejudice "may develop not because [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]] are hated, but because positive emotions such as admiration, sympathy, and trust are reserved for the ingroup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/0022-4537.00126 |title=The Psychology of Prejudice: Ingroup Love and Outgroup Hate? |year=1999 |last1=Brewer |first1=Marilynn B. |journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]] |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=429–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Thomas Pettigrew]] described the [[ultimate attribution error]] and its role in prejudice. The ultimate attribution error occurs when ingroup members "(1) attribute negative outgroup behavior to dispositional causes (more than they would for identical ingroup behavior), and (2) attribute positive outgroup behavior to one or more of the following causes: (a) a fluke or exceptional case, (b) luck or special advantage, (c) high motivation and effort, and (d) situational factors."&lt;ref name="Plous, S 2011"/&gt;

[[Elisabeth_Young-Bruehl|Youeng-Bruehl]] (1996) argued that prejudice cannot be treated in the singular; one should rather speak of different prejudices as characteristic of different character types. Her theory defines prejudices as being social defences, distinguishing between an obsessional character structure, primarily linked with anti-semitism, hysterical characters, primarily associated with racism, and narcissistic characters, linked with sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young-Bruehl|first1=Elizabeth|title=An Anatomy of Prejudices|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674031913|page=38|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674031913&amp;content=reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary theories and empirical findings==

The [[out-group homogeneity]] effect is the perception that members of an out-group are more similar (homogenous) than members of the in-group. Social psychologists Quattrone and Jones conducted a study demonstrating this with students from the rival schools [[Princeton University]] and [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.38.1.141 |title=The perception of variability within in-groups and out-groups: Implications for the law of small numbers |year=1980 |last1=Quattrone |first1=George A. |last2=Jones |first2=Edward E. |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=38 |pages=141–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students at each school were shown videos of other students from each school choosing a type of music to listen to for an auditory perception study. Then the participants were asked to guess what percentage of the videotaped students' classmates would choose the same. Participants predicted a much greater similarity between out-group members (the rival school) than between members of their in-group.

The justification-suppression model of prejudice was created by Christian Crandall and Amy Eshleman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.414 |title=A justification-suppression model of the expression and experience of prejudice |year=2003 |last1=Crandall |first1=Christian S. |last2=Eshleman |first2=Amy |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=3 |pages=414–46 |pmid=12784937}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model explains that people face a conflict between the desire to express prejudice and the desire to maintain a positive [[self-concept]]. This conflict causes people to search for justification for disliking an out-group, and to use that justification to avoid negative feelings ([[cognitive dissonance]]) about themselves when they act on their dislike of the out-group.

The [[realistic conflict theory]] states that competition between limited resources leads to increased negative prejudices and discrimination. This can be seen even when the resource is insignificant. In the Robber's Cave experiment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Muzafer |last1=Sherif |first2=O. J. |last2=Harvey |first3=B. Jack |last3=White |first4=William R. |last4=Hood |first5=Carolyn W. |last5=Sherif |year=1988 |title=The Robbers Cave Experiment: Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation |location=Middletown, Connecticut |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |isbn=978-0-8195-6194-7}}{{page needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; negative prejudice and hostility was created between two summer camps after sports competitions for small prizes. The hostility was lessened after the two competing camps were forced to cooperate on tasks to achieve a common goal.

Another contemporary theory is the [[integrated threat theory]] (ITT), which was developed by Walter G Stephan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2000.tb01022.x |title=Women's Attitudes Toward Men: an Integrated Threat Theory Approach |year=2000 |last1=Stephan |first1=Cookie White |last2=Stephan |first2=Walter C. |last3=Demitrakis |first3=Katherine M. |last4=Yamada |first4=Ann Marie |last5=Clason |first5=Dennis L. |journal=[[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] |volume=24 |pages=63–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; It draws from and builds upon several other psychological explanations of prejudice and ingroup/outgroup behaviour, such as the realistic conflict theory and [[symbolic racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr1004_4 |title=Intergroup Threat and Outgroup Attitudes: A Meta-Analytic Review |year=2006 |last1=Riek |first1=Blake M. |last2=Mania |first2=Eric W. |last3=Gaertner |first3=Samuel L. |journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]] |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=336–53 |pmid=17201592}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses the [[social identity theory]] perspective as the basis for its validity; that is, it assumes that individuals operate in a group-based context where group memberships form a part of individual identity. ITT posits that outgroup prejudice and discrimination is caused when individuals perceive an outgroup to be threatening in some way. ITT defines four threats: 
* Realistic threats
* Symbolic threats
* Intergroup anxiety
* Negative stereotypes

Realistic threats are tangible, such as competition for a natural resource or a threat to income. Symbolic threats arise from a perceived difference in cultural values between groups or a perceived imbalance of power (for example, an ingroup perceiving an outgroup's religion as incompatible with theirs). Intergroup anxiety is a feeling of uneasiness experienced in the presence of an outgroup or outgroup member, which constitutes a threat because interactions with other groups cause negative feelings (e.g., a threat to comfortable interactions). Negative stereotypes are similarly threats, in that individuals anticipate negative behaviour from outgroup members in line with the perceived stereotype (for example, that the outgroup is violent). Often these stereotypes are associated with emotions such as fear and anger. ITT differs from other threat theories by including intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes as threat types.

Additionally, [[social dominance theory]] states that society can be viewed as group-based hierarchies. In competition for scarce resources such as housing or employment, dominant groups create prejudiced "legitimizing myths" to provide moral and intellectual justification for their dominant position over other groups and validate their claim over the limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.3.476 |title=Racism, conservatism, Affirmative Action, and intellectual sophistication: A matter of principled conservatism or group dominance? |year=1996 |last1=Sidanius |first1=Jim |last2=Pratto |first2=Felicia |last3=Bobo |first3=Lawrence |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=476–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legitimizing myths, such as discriminatory hiring practices or biased merit norms, work to maintain these prejudiced hierarchies.

Prejudice can be a central contributing factor to depression.&lt;ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1745691612455204 |title=Stereotypes, Prejudice, and Depression: The Integrated Perspective |year=2012 |last1=Cox |first1=William T. L. |last2=Abramson |first2=Lyn Y. |last3=Devine |first3=Patricia G. |last4=Hollon |first4=Steven D. |journal=[[Perspectives on Psychological Science]] |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=427–49 |pmid=26168502}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can occur in someone who is a prejudice victim, being the target of someone else's prejudice, or when people have prejudice against themselves that causes their own depression.

Paul Bloom argues that while prejudice can be irrational and have terrible consequences, it is natural and often quite rational. This is because prejudices are based on the human tendency to categorise objects and people based on prior experience. This means people make predictions about things in a category based on prior experience with that category, with the resulting predictions usually being accurate (though not always). Bloom argues that this process of categorisation and prediction is necessary for survival and normal interaction, quoting William Hazlitt, who stated "Without the aid of prejudice and custom, I should not be able to find my way my across the room; nor know how to conduct myself in any circumstances, nor what to feel in any relation of life".&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Paul [https://www.ted.com/talks/paul_bloom_can_prejudice_ever_be_a_good_thing/transcript "Can prejudice ever be a good thing"] January 2014, accessed 02/12/17&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, researchers have argued that the study of prejudice has been traditionally too narrow. It is argued that since prejudice is defined as a negative affect towards members of a group, there are many groups against whom prejudice is acceptable (such as rapists, men who abandon their families, pedophiles, neo-Nazis, drink-drivers, queue jumpers, murderers etc.), yet such prejudices aren't studied. It has been suggested that researchers have focused too much on an evaluative approach to prejudice, rather than a descriptive approach, which looks at the actual psychological mechanisms behind prejudiced attitudes. It is argued that this limits research to targets of prejudice to groups deemed to be receiving unjust treatment, while groups researchers deem treated justly or deservedly of prejudice are overlooked. As a result, the scope of prejudice has begun to expand in research, allowing a more accurate analysis of the relationship between psychological traits and prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Crandell |first1= Christian S. |last2=Ferguson |first2=Mark A. |last3=Bahns |first3=Angela J.|editor-last1=Stangor |editor-first1=Charles |editor-last2=Crendeall |editor-first2=Christian S. |title=Stereotyping and Prejudice |publisher=Psychology Press |date=2013 |chapter=Chapter 3: When We See Prejudice |isbn=978-1848726444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Jarret, and Mark J.

==Controversies and prominent topics==
One can be prejudiced against or have a preconceived notion about someone due to any characteristic they find to be unusual or undesirable. A few commonplace examples of prejudice are those based on someone's race, gender, nationality, social status, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation, and controversies may arise from any given topic.

===Sexism===
{{Main article|Sexism}}
Sexism, also called gender discrimination, is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's [[Sex and gender distinction|sex or gender]]. Sexism can affect either gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.&lt;ref name="Sexism"&gt;There is a clear and broad consensus among academic scholars in multiple fields that sexism refers primarily to discrimination against women, and primarily affects women. See, for example:
*{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Oxford American Dictionary |title=Sexism |access-date= |edition=3 |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199891535}} Defines sexism as "prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica, Online Academic Edition |year=2015}} Defines sexism as "prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Notes that "sexism in a society is most commonly applied against women and girls.  It functions to maintain patriarchy, or male domination, through ideological and material practices of individuals, collectives, and institutions that oppress women and girls on the basis of sex or gender."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Cudd|first1=Ann E.|last2=Jones|first2=Leslie E.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=A Companion to Applied Ethics |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |location=London}} Notes that "'Sexism' refers to a historically and globally pervasive form of oppression against women."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Masequesmay|first=Gina|editor-last=O'Brien|editor-first=Jodi|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Gender and Society |year=2008 |publisher=SAGE}} Notes that "sexism usually refers to prejudice or discrimination based on sex or gender, especially against women and girls." Also states that "sexism is an ideology or practices that maintain patriarchy or male domination." 
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hornsby |first=Jennifer|editor-last=Honderich|editor-first=Ted|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |edition=2 |year=2005|publisher=Oxford}} Defines sexism as "thought or practice which may permeate language and which assume's women's inferiority to men."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Collins Dictionary of Sociology  |year=2006 |publisher=Harper Collins}} Defines sexism as "any devaluation or denigration of women or men, but particularly women, which is embodied in institutions and social relationships."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=Palgrave MacMillan Dictionary of Political Thought |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan}} Notes that "either sex may be the object of sexist attitudes... however, it is commonly held that, in developed societies, women have been the usual victims."
*{{cite encyclopedia |title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Love, Courtship, and Sexuality through History, Volume 6: The Modern World |year=2007 |publisher=Greenwood}} "Sexism is any act, attitude, or institutional configuration that systematically subordinates or devalues women.  Built upon the belief that men and women are constitutionally different, sexism takes these differences as indications that men are inherently superior to women, which then is used to justify the nearly universal dominance of men in social and familial relationships, as well as politics, religion, language, law, and economics."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Foster |first=Carly Hayden |editor-last=Kurlan|editor-first=George Thomas|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Political Science |title=Sexism |year=2011 |publisher=CQ Press|isbn=9781608712434}} Notes that "both men and women can experience sexism, but sexism against women is more pervasive."
*{{cite encyclopedia |last=Johnson|first=Allan G.|title=Sexism |encyclopedia=The Blackwell Dictionary of Sociology |year=2000 |publisher=Blackwell |location= |id= }} Suggests that "the key test of whether something is sexist... lies in its consequences: if it supports male privilege, then it is by definition sexist. I specify 'male privilege' because in every known society where gender inequality exists, males are privileged over females."
*{{cite book |last=Lorber |first=Judith |year=2011 |title=Gender Inequality: Feminist Theories and Politics |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=5}} Notes that "although we speak of gender inequality, it is usually women who are disadvantaged relative to similarly situated men."
*{{cite book |last1=Wortman |first1=Camille B. |last2=Loftus |first2=Elizabeth S. |last3=Weaver |first3=Charles A |title=Psychology |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1999}} "As throughout history, today women are the primary victims of sexism, prejudice directed at one sex, even in the United States."
&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of such sentiments, and actual gender differences and stereotypes continue to be controversial topics. Throughout history, women have been thought of as being subordinate to men, often being ignored in areas like the academia or belittled altogether. Traditionally, men were thought of as being more capable than women, mentally and physically.&lt;ref name="Dovidio"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CDSyHPt98E0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Nature of Prejudice]''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 108. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In the field of social psychology, prejudice studies like the "Who Likes Competent Women" study led the way for gender-based research on prejudice.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; This resulted in two broad themes or focuses in the field: the first being a focus on attitudes toward [[gender equality]], and the second focusing on people's beliefs about men and women.&lt;ref name="Dovidio" /&gt; Today, studies based on sexism continue in the field of psychology as researchers try to understand how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors influence and are influenced by others.

===Nationalism===
{{Main article|Nationalism}}
Nationalism is a sentiment based on common cultural characteristics that binds a population and often produces a policy of national independence or [[separatism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nationalism "Nationalism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; It suggests a "shared identity" amongst a nation's people that minimizes differences within the group and emphasizes perceived boundaries between the group and non-members.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Blackwell |first1=Judith |first2=Murray |last2=Smith |first3=John |last3=Sorenson |title=Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science |location=Toronto |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2003 |pages=31–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the assumption that members of the nation have more in common than they actually do, that they are "culturally unified", even if injustices within the nation based on differences like status and race exist.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; During times of conflict between one nation and another, nationalism is controversial since it may function as a buffer for criticism when it comes to the nation's own problems since it makes the nation's own hierarchies and internal conflicts appear to be natural.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; It may also serve a way of rallying the people of the nation in support of a particular political goal.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Nationalism usually involves a push for conformity, obedience, and solidarity amongst the nation's people and can result not only in feelings of public responsibility but also in a narrow sense of community due to the exclusion of those who are considered outsiders.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt; Since the identity of nationalists is linked to their allegiance to the state, the presence of strangers who do not share this allegiance may result in hostility.&lt;ref name="Blackwell, Judith 2003 p31-2"/&gt;

===Classism===
{{Main article|Classism}}
Classism is defined by [[dictionary.com]] as "a biased or discriminatory attitude on distinctions made between social or economic classes."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/classism "Classism"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of separating people based on class is controversial in itself. Some argue that [[economic inequality]] is an unavoidable aspect of society, so there will always be a ruling class.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zUbvP87QKX0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science]''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 145. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some also argue that, even within the most [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] societies in history, some form of ranking based on social status takes place. Therefore, one may believe the existence of social classes is a natural feature of society.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 146. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue the contrary. According to [[Anthropology|anthropological]] evidence, for the majority of the time the human species has been in existence, humans have lived in a manner in which the land and resources were not privately owned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Also, when social ranking did occur, it was not antagonistic or hostile like the current class system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; This evidence has been used to support the idea that the existence of a social class system is unnecessary. Overall, society has neither come to a consensus over the necessity of the class system, nor been able to deal with the hostility and prejudice that occurs because of the class system.

===Sexual discrimination===
{{Main article|Sexual discrimination|Homophobia}}
One's sexual orientation is the "direction of one's sexual interest toward members of the same, opposite, or both sexes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+orientation "Sexual Orientation"], dictionary.com&lt;/ref&gt; Like most minority groups, [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]s and [[Bisexuality|bisexuals]] are not immune to prejudice or stereotypes from the majority group. They may experience hatred from others because of their sexual preferences; a term for such intense hatred based upon one's sexual orientation is ''[[homophobia]]''.

Due to what social psychologists call the vividness effect, a tendency to notice only certain distinctive characteristics, the majority population tends to draw conclusions like gays flaunt their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 198. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Such images may be easily recalled to mind due to their vividness, making it harder to appraise the entire situation.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Kristin 2010"/&gt; The majority population may not only think that homosexuals flaunt their sexuality or are "too gay", but may also erroneously believe that homosexuals are easy to identify and label as being gay or lesbian when compared to others who are not homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Kristin. ''Benign Bigotry: The Psychology of Subtle Prejudice''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010. 200. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of [[heterosexual privilege]] seems to flourish in society. Research and questionnaires are formulated to fit the majority; i.e., [[Heterosexuality|heterosexuals]]. This discussion of whether heterosexuals are the privileged group and whether homosexuals are a minimized group is controversial. Research shows that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a powerful feature of many labor markets. For example, controlling for human capital, studies show that gay men earn 10% - 32% less than heterosexual men in the United States, and that there is significant discrimination in hiring on the basis of sexual orientation in many labor markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tilcsik | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Pride and Prejudice: Employment Discrimination against Openly Gay Men in the United States | url = | journal = [[American Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 117 | issue = 2| pages = 586–626 | pmid = 22268247 | doi=10.1086/661653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racism===
Racism is defined as the belief that physical characteristics determine cultural traits, and that racial characteristics make some groups superior.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37"&gt;Blackwell, Judith, Murray Smith, and John Sorenson. ''Culture of Prejudice: Arguments in Critical Social Science''. Toronto: Broadview Press, 2003. 37–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; By separating people into [[Racial hierarchy|hierarchies]] based upon their race, it has been argued that unequal treatment among the different groups of people is just and fair due to their [[Genetics|genetic]] differences.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Racism can occur amongst any group that can be identified based upon physical features or even characteristics of their culture.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; Though people may be lumped together and called a specific race, everyone does not fit neatly into such categories, making it hard to define and describe a race accurately.&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt;

[[Scientific racism]] began to flourish in the eighteenth century and was greatly influenced by [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[evolution]]ary studies, as well as ideas taken from the writings of philosophers like [[Aristotle]]; for example, Aristotle believed in the concept of "[[Natural slavery|natural slaves]]".&lt;ref name="Blackwell37" /&gt; This concept focuses on the necessity of hierarchies and how some people are bound to be on the bottom of the pyramid. Though racism has been a prominent topic in history, there is still debate over whether race actually exists,{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} making the discussion of race a controversial topic. Even though the concept of race is still being debated, the effects of racism are apparent. Racism and other forms of prejudice can affect a person's behavior, thoughts, and feelings, and social psychologists strive to study these effects.

===Religious discrimination===
{{Main article|Religious discrimination}}

While various religions teach their members to be tolerant of those who are different and to have compassion, throughout history there have been [[Religious war|wars]], [[pogrom]]s and other forms of violence motivated by hatred of religious groups.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 413. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern world, researchers in western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic countries have done various studies exploring the relationship between religion and prejudice; thus far, they have received mixed results. A study done with US college students found that those who reported religion to be very influential in their lives seem to have a higher rate of prejudice than those who reported not being religious.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; Other studies found that religion has a positive effect on people as far as prejudice is concerned.&lt;ref name="Dovidio, John 2005"/&gt; This difference in results may be attributed to the differences in religious practices or religious interpretations amongst the individuals. Those who practice "institutionalized religion", which focuses more on social and political aspects of religious events, are more likely to have an increase in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Dovidio, John, Peter Glick, and Laurie Rudman. ''On the Nature of Prejudice''. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2005. 414. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who practice "interiorized religion", in which believers devote themselves to their beliefs, are most likely to have a decrease in prejudice.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===Linguistic discrimination===
{{Main article|Linguistic discrimination}}

Individuals or groups may be treated unfairly based solely on their use of language. This use of language may include the individual's [[native language]] or other characteristics of the person's speech, such as an [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], the size of [[vocabulary]] (whether the person uses complex and varied words), and [[syntax]]. It may also involve a person's ability or inability to use one language instead of another.
In the mid-1980s, [[linguistics|linguist]] Tove Skutnabb-Kangas captured this idea of discrimination based on language as the concept of linguicism. Kangas defined linguicism as the ideologies and structures used to "legitimate, effectuate, and reproduce unequal division of power and resources (both material and non-material) between groups which are defined on the basis of language."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Skutnabb-Kangas, Tove, and Phillipson, Robert, {{"'}}Mother Tongue': The Theoretical and Sociopolitical Construction of a Concept". In Ammon, Ulrich (ed.) (1989), ''Status and Function of Languages and Language Varieties'', p. 455. Berlin, New York: Walter de Gruyter &amp; Co. {{ISBN|3-11-011299-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological discrimination===
{{Main article|Neurodiversity}}
{{See also|Ableism}}
Broadly speaking, attribution of low social status to those who do not conform to [[neurotypical]] expectations of personality and behaviour. This can manifest through assumption of 'disability' status to those who are high functioning enough to exist outside of diagnostic criteria, yet do not desire to (or are unable to) conform their behaviour to conventional patterns. This is a controversial and somewhat contemporary concept; with various disciplinary approaches promoting conflicting messages what normality constitutes, the degree of acceptable [[Differential psychology|individual difference]] within that category, and the precise criteria for what constitutes medical disorder. This has been most prominent in the case of high-functioning autism,&lt;ref name="Silberman, Steve 2015"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=WRpPDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false NeuroTribes: The legacy of autism and how to think smarter about people who think differently]''.

Discrimination may also extend to other high functioning individuals carrying pathological phenotypes, such as those with [[ADHD|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] and [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar spectrum disorders]]. In these cases, there are indications that perceived (or actual) socially disadvantageous cognitive traits are directly correlated with advantageous cognitive traits in other domains, notably creativity and divergent thinking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet these strengths might become systematically overlooked. The case for "neurological discrimination" as such lies in the expectation that one's professional capacity may be judged by the quality of ones social interaction, which can in such cases be an inaccurate and discriminatory metric for employment suitability.

Since there are moves by some experts to have these higher-functioning extremes reclassified as extensions of human personality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| pages=873–883}}&lt;/ref&gt; any legitimisation of discrimination against these groups would fit the very definition of prejudice, as medical validation for such discrimination becomes redundant. Recent advancements in [[behavioural genetics]] and [[neuroscience]] have made this a very relevant issue of discussion, with existing frameworks requiring significant overhaul to accommodate the strength of findings over the last decade.

==Multiculturalism==
{{Main article|Multiculturalism}}
Humans have an evolved propensity to think categorically about social groups, manifested in cognitive processes with broad implications for public and political endorsement of multicultural policy, according to psychologists [[Richard J. Crisp]] and Rose Meleady.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1219009 |title=Adapting to a Multicultural Future |year=2012 |last1=Crisp |first1=Richard J. |last2=Meleady |first2=Rose |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=336 |issue=6083 |pages=853–5 |pmid=22605761|bibcode=2012Sci...336..853C }}&lt;/ref&gt; They postulated a cognitive-evolutionary account of human adaptation to social diversity that explains general resistance to multiculturalism, and offer a reorienting call for scholars and policy-makers who seek intervention-based solutions to the problem of prejudice.

==Reducing prejudice==

===The contact hypothesis===
The [[contact hypothesis]] predicts that prejudice can only be reduced when in-group and out-group members are brought together.&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. M. (2010). ''Social Psychology'' (7th edition). New York: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there are six conditions that must be met to reduce prejudice, as were cultivated in [[Elliot Aronson]]'s [[jigsaw (teaching technique)|"jigsaw" teaching technique]].&lt;ref name="Aronson, E. 2010"/&gt; First, the in- and out-groups must have a degree of mutual interdependence. Second, both groups need to share a common goal. Third, the two groups must have equal status. Fourth, there must be frequent opportunities for informal and interpersonal contact between groups. Fifth, there should be multiple contacts between the in- and the out-groups. Finally, [[social norm]]s of equality must exist and be present to foster prejudice reduction.

===Empirical research===
Academics Thomas Pettigrew and Linda Tropp conducted a [[meta-analysis]] of 515 studies involving a quarter of a million participants in 38 nations to examine how intergroup contact reduces prejudice. They found that three [[Mediation (statistics)|mediators]] are of particular importance: Intergroup contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing [[empathy]] and perspective-taking. While all three of these mediators had mediational effects, the mediational value of increased knowledge was less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pettigrew |first1= Thomas F. |last2= Tropp |first2= Linda R. |year= 2008 |title= How does intergroup contact reduce prejudice?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3826">In [[mathematics]], '''R-algebroids''' are constructed starting from [[groupoid]]s. These are more abstract concepts than the [[Lie algebroid]]s that play a similar role in the theory of [[Lie groupoid]]s to that of [[Lie algebra]]s in the theory of [[Lie group]]s. (Thus, a Lie algebroid can be thought of as 'a ''[[Lie algebra]] with [[categorification|many objects]]'' ').

==Definition==
An '''R-algebroid''', &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt;, is constructed from a groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; as follows. The object set of &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; is the same as that of &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Free module|free]] [[R-module]] on the set &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt;, with composition given by the usual bilinear rule, extending the composition of &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Mosa: ''Higher dimensional algebroids and Crossed complexes'', PhD Thesis, University of Wales, Bangor, (1986). (supervised by [[Ronald Brown (mathematician)|Ronald Brown]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==R-category==
A groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; can be regarded as a [[category (mathematics)|category]] with invertible morphisms.
Than an '''R-category''' is defined as an extension of the '''R'''-algebroid concept by replacing the groupoid &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}&lt;/math&gt; in this construction with a general category '''C''' that does not have all morphisms invertible.

==R-algebroids ''via'' convolution products==
One can also define the '''R-algebroid''', &lt;math&gt;{\bar R}\mathsf{G}:=R\mathsf{G}(b,c)&lt;/math&gt;, to be the '''set of functions''' &lt;math&gt;\mathsf{G}(b,c){\longrightarrow}R&lt;/math&gt; '''with [[finite support]]''', and with the '''[[convolution]] product''' defined as follows:
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (f*g)(z)= \sum \{(fx)(gy)\mid z=x\circ y \}&lt;/math&gt; .&lt;ref&gt;R. Brown and G. H. Mosa. ''Double algebroids and crossed modules of algebroids'', University of Wales-Bangor, Maths ''Preprint'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Only this second construction is natural for the topological case, when one needs to replace '[[Function (mathematics)|function]]' by '[[continuous function]] with [[compact support]]', and in this case &lt;math&gt;R\cong \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Examples ==
*Every [[Lie algebra]] is a Lie algebroid over the one point [[manifold]].
*The Lie algebroid associated to a [[Lie groupoid]].

'''''R v Thomas''''' was an Australian court case decided in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Victorian Court of Appeal]] on 18 August 2006. It concerned the conviction in February 2006 of [[Joseph Terrence Thomas|Joseph Thomas]] (nicknamed "Jihad Jack" in the media) on [[terrorism]]-related charges, specifically receiving funds from [[Al Qaeda]]. The appeal revolved around the [[admissible evidence|admissibility]] of a [[Confession (law)|confession]] Thomas made during an interrogation in [[Pakistan]] in 2003. The court found that the [[evidence (law)|evidence]], which was crucial to Thomas' convictions, was inadmissible because it had not been given voluntarily. The court accordingly quashed his convictions, but after further hearings ordered on 20 December 2006 that he be retried rather than [[acquittal|acquitted]].

==Background to the case==

Joseph Thomas is an Australian citizen. On 23 March 2001 he left Australia and travelled by air to Pakistan, crossing into [[Afghanistan]] by land. For the next three months, he was alleged to have trained at the [[Al Farouq training camp]] near the city of [[Kandahar]], before travelling to [[Kabul]] in July 2001.&lt;ref name="ruling3"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSC|243|2006|litigants=DPP v Thomas |courtname=auto}} (reasons for Ruling #3, given during the initial trial).&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next eighteen months or so, Thomas stayed in various Al Qaeda safe houses, and is alleged to have made contact with several Al Qaeda officials.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

On 4 January 2003, Thomas was apprehended by Pakistani immigration officials at an airport in the city of [[Karachi]], and taken into [[police custody|custody]]. Thomas had with him items including an Australian-issue [[passport]], an airline ticket for travel to [[Indonesia]], and about [[United States dollar|$]] 3,800 in [[cash]]. The passport, issued on 19 May 1993, had been tampered with, for the intention of concealing the details of Thomas' movements after his departure from Australia in 2001.&lt;ref name="VSCA"/&gt; He was blindfolded, and driven to an unknown location, where he was questioned for about two hours by two Pakistani men and two Americans.&lt;ref name="VSCA"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|166|2006|litigants=R v Thomas |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was questioned several times over the next few days, before being taken to another location, which Thomas described as "some sort of mansion house", where he was kept in a small cell for the next two weeks and questioned on a number of occasions.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Initially he maintained a fabricated story, that he was a student who had been travelling in Pakistan, but he later revealed the truth, that he had been in contact with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. He said that he was motivated to change his story by several incidents, including one in which one of the Pakistani interrogators pulled on the collar of his hood, so as to strangle him, and incidents in which interrogators said that he would be [[electric shock|electrocuted]] and [[execution|executed]]. According to Thomas, he was then told that his cooperation was welcome and that he would be returned home.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

After the two weeks, Thomas was blindfolded and shackled, and flown to [[Islamabad]], where he remained in custody. There he was visited by an Australian [[consul (representative)|consular]] representative, who later gave evidence that Thomas did not appear to have been maltreated, or denied food or water. However, the representative did testify that while Thomas was on the phone to his parents in Australia, he told them "I'm not going to [[Cuba]]" (referring to the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]]), to which a Pakistani official replied, "No, that's not correct."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas was interviewed four times by members of the [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP) and by members of the [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO), accompanied by Pakistani officials. During one of these interviews, a Pakistani official said to Thomas "we told you that you have to prove it... that you are not a terrorist... you have to prove it that you are an innocent man and why you are sitting here."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of [[Lahore]], where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his [[testicle]]s twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.

On 8 March, Thomas was interviewed again by two members of the AFP, who had made special arrangements with the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) to have the interview conducted pursuant to Australian law, particularly the requirements of the federal ''[[Evidence Act 1995]]'' and ''[[Crimes Act 1914]]'', so that admissible evidence could be gathered. ISI allowed the interview, but with a very limited timeframe, and did not allow Thomas to have access to legal advice.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; During this interview, Thomas made several self-incriminatory statements, which were key to his later convictions and the admissibility of which was the central issue in the appeal. In the statements, Thomas admitted that he had tampered with his passport to conceal the amount of time he had been in Pakistan, and also admitted that the money and airline ticket had been given to him by [[Tawfiq bin Attash]], a high ranking [[Al Qaeda]] lieutenant involved with the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] and the [[USS Cole bombing|USS ''Cole'' bombing]].&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; On 10 March, the AFP wrote again to the ISI, reiterating the requirements of the Australian legislation, and saying that "the admissibility of [the record of interview] in Australian Courts has been seriously compromised."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

On 6 June 2003, Thomas was released from Pakistani custody, at which point he was [[deportation|deported]] to Australia. He spent nearly a year and a half subsequently living with his family in the [[Melbourne]] suburb of [[Werribee, Victoria|Werribee]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], before he was arrested by the AFP on 18 November 2004 and charged with several federal offences, including one count of possessing a false passport (an offence under the ''Passports Act 1938''), and one count of receiving funds from a terrorist organisation and two counts of providing resources to a terrorist organisation (offences under the ''[[Criminal Code Act 1995]]'').

===Trial===

Thomas was tried in the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]]. On 26 February, was found guilty of the passport charge and the receiving funds charge (although he was acquitted of the providing funds charges).&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; He was later sentenced on 31 March, to a total of five years' imprisonment with a two-year non-[[parole]] period.&lt;ref name="sentencing"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSC|120|2006|litigants=DPP v Thomas |courtname=auto}} (sentencing remarks).&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to the admissibility of the record of the 8 March interview, the trial judge (Justice [[Philip Cummins|Cummins]]) had instructed the [[jury]] that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Normally, failure to avail an interviewee of [the right to legal access] would be fatal to the admission of a subsequent interview... However, the requirement is not absolute, nor can it be... it is not hollow to say that the suspect had the right to choose whether to proceed without that legal access. He had the right to choose not to answer, and wait for the legal bus which might never arrive, or to answer, in the legitimate aim of ultimate return to Australia. To say such a choice is no choice at all is revisionism."&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his assessment, the judge said that the AFP interviewers had conducted the interview "fairly and properly", and had not attempted to use Thomas' lack of legal representation to their favour.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

The trial judge also concluded that Thomas had been properly informed of his right to silence, and had not been induced by the AFP officers to participate in the interview by offer of repatriation or any other reward. Ultimately he decided that Thomas had participated voluntarily in the interview, and that in the circumstances, Thomas' lack of legal advice should not make the record of the interview inadmissible.&lt;ref name="ruling3" /&gt;

==Arguments==

[[Lex Lasry]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], on behalf of Thomas, argued that the trial judge had made several [[question of law|errors of law]]:
# the trial judge should have found that the 8&amp;nbsp;March interview was not voluntary and hence inadmissible, and
# even if it had been voluntary, the trial judge should have excluded it anyway on grounds of fairness or [[public policy]].
Several other matters were also raised, relating to particular parts of the evidence (specifically, relating to the witness testimony of [[Yahya Goba]], one of the [[Buffalo Six]]), but these matters had little bearing on the final outcome of the case, and were dealt with only briefly by the court. The central argument raised was that, with regard to all the circumstances, Thomas did not actually have a practical choice whether to speak or not.

The other main argument was an alternative argument, that if the court decided that the admissions were in fact voluntary, they should not have been admitted anyway on the basis that to do so would be unfair, because of factors including Thomas' lack of access to legal advice even where he had a right to obtain it, his vulnerability in the circumstances, and "the contamination of the record of interview by the previous joint team interrogations, and their potential or actual use as levers to remind the applicant of his earlier answers."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Two other parties sought to be involved in the case as [[amicus curiae|amici curiae]], [[Amnesty International]] (represented by former [[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court]] Justice [[Ron Merkel]]), and the Victorian human rights advocacy group the Human Rights Law Resource Centre. However both their applications were rejected, because they could not assist the court in a way in which they could not otherwise be assisted, and their submissions were largely subsumed into submissions made by Lasry in any event.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

==Judgment==

In a unanimous decision, the three judges decided that the appeal should be allowed (more specifically, that leave to appeal should be granted and the appeal heard and allowed ''instanter''&amp;nbsp;– at once), on the basis that the 8&amp;nbsp;March 2003 interview was not voluntary and so was inadmissible, and by admitting it the trial judge had made an error of law resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

===Voluntariness of the interview===

The court quoted from a 1948 judgment of future [[Chief Justice of Australia]] [[Owen Dixon]], followed unanimously by the [[High Court of Australia]] in later decisions, in which he said that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At common law a confessional statement made out of court by an accused person may not be admitted in evidence against him upon his trial for the crime to which it relates unless it is shown to have been voluntarily made. This means substantially that it has been made in the exercise of his free choice. If he speaks because he is overborne, his confessional statement cannot be received in evidence and it does not matter by what means he has been overborne. If his statement is the result of [[duress]], [[intimidation]], persistent importunity, or sustained or undue insistence or pressure, it cannot be voluntary. But it is also a definite rule of the common law that a confessional statement cannot be voluntary if it is preceded by an inducement held out by a person in authority and the inducement has not been removed before the statement is made..."&lt;ref name="McDermott"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|23|1948|litigants=McDermott v The King |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1948/23.pdf (1948) 76 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 501] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The court also noted a recent decision of its own, in which it had emphasised that the principles of evidence strike a balance between the rights of the individual and the rights of the state, and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the one hand, there is an obvious need to bring to account those who have committed serious offences if the objectives of the criminal justice system are to be achieved and societal values vindicated, but, on the other, it cannot be forgotten that those values incorporate the rights of the individual and, in part define the nature of the relationship between the citizen and the community in which he or she resides."&lt;ref name="Tofilau"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|40|2006|litigants=R v Tofilau |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The court considered that Thomas had been regularly informed by all those who had interrogated him that the degree to which he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that they would be able to help Thomas.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying "[we] might give you another look at that later", comments which were "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

The court rejected the opinion of the trial judge that Thomas viewed the 8&amp;nbsp;March interview differently to the other interviews, which were concerned only with intelligence gathering. Rather, they emphasised how similar the interviews all were: "same place, same AFP personnel, same topics."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt; They considered that the inducements offered in the previous interviews, and indeed the threats and intimidation in previous interviews by the American "Joe" and others, all "remained operative, their power undiminished" in 8 March interview.&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Lastly, the court rejected the argument that the admissions were voluntary because Thomas knew he had a right to silence, because he did not have any practical opportunity to exercise the right. The court concluded that the trial judge had made an error by separating the interview from the circumstances, and that in the circumstances Thomas had no real choice whether to answer questions: "Even the threat 'Confess or be tortured' can be said to involve a choice, and a chance that torture may not be applied. But it could never be regarded as a free choice in the relevant sense."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

Ultimately, the court found that the admissions were not given voluntarily, and so were not admissible.

===Discretion to exclude evidence===

Although it was unnecessary to decide the alternative argument, the court addressed it briefly anyway. After considering previous cases on the issue, the court considered whether the Australian investigators acted fairly. They concluded that "only one course [was] properly open to the investigating officials in the light of the position taken by the Pakistani authorities. It was to acknowledge that no formal record of interview could be conducted so long as the applicant was in Pakistan since, as the investigating officials appreciated, any such interview would be unlawful, that is, would be contrary to Australian law."&lt;ref name="VSCA" /&gt;

The court also referred to a judgment of Justice [[Michael McHugh (judge)|McHugh]] of the High Court, in which he said that although there is some discretion as to whether evidence obtained where an interviewee does not have access to legal advice should be admitted or not, judges are not free to make the decision "by reference to general notions of fairness."&lt;ref name="pollard"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|69|1992|litigants=Pollard v The Queen |parallelcite=(1992) 176 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 177 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The court concluded that the trial judge had erred in not exercising his discretion to bar the evidence from being admitted, although it was not necessary to decide the point.

==Consequences==

Thomas' original convictions were quashed, however before the final orders were made the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions]] sought to make a submission as to whether there should be a directed acquittal or whether there should be a retrial. The court heard brief arguments, then set aside the issue for a further hearing, to be held after the parties had made written submissions.&lt;ref name="no2 nexthearing"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|166|2006|litigants=R v Thomas (No 2) |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution sought to introduce as evidence statements Thomas made in an interview with the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] for the ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' television program in February  2006.&lt;ref name="AM convictions quashed"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taylor | first = Josie | title = 'Jihad Jack' has convictions quashed | work = AM | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=  19 August 2006 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2006/s1718994.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parties made submissions, and there was an oral hearing on 1 December 2006. All parties accepted that the relevant test to be applied was the test set out in the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] case of ''[[DPP (Nauru) v Fowler]]'', which sets out two preconditions for a retrial; the first requiring that the admissible evidence presented at trial be "sufficiently cogent" to support a conviction, the second requiring consideration of circumstances that would make it unjust to put the accused through a retrial.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial"&gt;{{Cite AustLII|VSCA|300|2006|litigants=R v Thomas (No 3) |courtname=auto}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this case had an unusual feature, namely that the evidence that the prosecution would seek to use at a retrial had not been available at the original trial, through no fault of the prosecution, since although the interviews had been taken at that time they had not been published. Ultimately all parties agreed that all evidence, not just evidence submitted in the original trial, should be considered when applying the first part of the Fowler test.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt;

The court decided that it would be reasonably possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would get a fair trial, and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in [[solitary confinement]], without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt; The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.&lt;ref name="no3 retrial" /&gt;

As such, the court ordered on 20 December 2006 that Thomas be retried. Thomas was then released on [[bail]], with requirements to report three times a week and not to leave Australia.&lt;ref name="Age terror retrial"&gt;{{cite news | author = AAP | title = Thomas to face terror retrial | work = The Age | publisher = Fairfax | date=  2006-12-20 | url = http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/thomas-to-face-terror-retrial/2006/12/20/1166290588729.html | accessdate = 2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas and his family were in court to hear the verdict, his mother crying and Thomas looking "more like a startled rabbit [than a terrorist]."&lt;ref name="Australian rabbit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hedge | first = Mike | title = Thomas 'like a startled rabbit' | work = The Australian | publisher = News Corporation | date=  2006-12-20 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20957911-1702,00.html | accessdate = 2006-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the retrial in 2008 Thomas was found not guilty of the terrorism charges but was found guilty of a passport offence, which carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment. Thomas had already served nine months. [[Elizabeth Curtain|Justice Curtain]] ordered that Thomas be imprisoned for nine months but found he was free to go after taking into account time already served.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|VSC|620|2008|litigants=R v Thomas |date=29 October 2008 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary===

The decision was praised by [[Civil liberties|civil libertarians]]. Former President of the [[Victorial Council of Civil Liberties]], Robert Richter QC, said that the decision was important "because the pressure is to say, 'Well, do anything' if the case is said to be a terrorist case. That is unacceptable, the Court of Appeal has said it's unacceptable."&lt;ref name="lateline libertarians"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hermant | first = Norman | title = Civil libertarians welcome decision to release 'Jihad Jack' | work = Lateline | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=  18 August 2006 | url = http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2006/s1718845.htm | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Melbourne]] evidence law professor Andrew Palmer said that "I think that it was a little bit naive to think that they could interview somebody and gather admissible evidence... when that person was being held in conditions which were possibly oppressive... I don't really know what they were thinking."&lt;ref name="AM convictions quashed" /&gt;

The decision has also attracted criticism. Conservative columnist [[Piers Akerman]] said that the decision "has handed [[Al Qaeda|al-Qaeda]], [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] and all other terrorist organisations a major victory and confirmed the adage the law is an ass."&lt;ref name="akerman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Akerman | first = Piers | title = Why terrorism loves our justice | work = The Daily Telegraph | publisher = News Corporation | date=  22 August 2006 | url = http://www.mail-archive.com/osint@yahoogroups.com/msg25850.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akerman emphasised that information about Thomas (including the ''Four Corners'' interview&lt;ref name="4corners copy"&gt;Available here: {{cite web | title = The Transcript: What Thomas told Four Corners | work = The Australian | publisher = News Corporation | date=  21 August 2006 | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,20867,20199530-601,00.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) was already available in the [[public domain]] for the populace to make its own judgment, despite "judicial commands to juries to ignore material [which] may have some minor relevance in their petty fiefdoms."&lt;ref name="akerman" /&gt;

Conservative Melbourne lawyer [[Peter Faris]] QC called for an appeal to the High Court or changes to the laws of  evidence legislation, saying that "this case is bad law", alternatively suggesting that Thomas be handed over to Pakistan, since he stated that the evidence from the interview would in his opinion be admissible in a Pakistani court.&lt;ref name="hun anger"&gt;{{cite news | last = Healey | first = Kelvin | title = Anger on Joseph Thomas | work = Herald Sun | publisher = News Corporation | date=  20 August 2006 | url = http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20186191-661,00.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faris also argued that there was an issue of apparent bias arising with respect to the presiding judge in the appeal, [[Chris Maxwell|Maxwell]] P, which could afford grounds for invalidating the appeal.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Faris | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Faris | title = Jack Thomas' Appeal and Judicial Bias | journal = Original Law Review | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 53–71  | publisher = Sandstone Academic Press | location = Melbourne | year=  2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that Pakistani law of evidence does not permit a confession made to a police officer to be admitted into evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pakistanconstitution-law.org/category/11-the-qanun-e-shahadat-order-1984/ Article 38 Qanun-e-Shahdat Order (Law of Evidence)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910023538/http://pakistanconstitution-law.org/category/11-the-qanun-e-shahadat-order-1984/ |date=10 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faris argued that the apparent bias arose because of Maxwell's activities before his appointment to the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]], including his membership of organisations including [[Amnesty International]], his past presidency of [[Liberty Victoria]], his past involvement with [[human rights law]] and advocacy against counter-terrorism laws.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias" /&gt; Faris drew a comparison with the [[judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] case which considered the [[Augusto Pinochet's arrest and trial#Arrest in London|extradition of Augusto Pinochet]], which was overturned on appeal because of [[Leonard Hoffmann, Baron Hoffmann|Lord Hoffman]]'s failure to disclose his links to Amnesty International.&lt;ref name="faris judicial bias" /&gt;

Because of the ongoing proceedings relating to whether Thomas should be acquitted or retried, neither the [[Government of Australia]] nor the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] commented immediately after the case, although [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Peter Costello]] later said that anti-terrorism legislation did not need to be strengthened in the wake of the case, and Opposition foreign affairs spokesperson [[Kevin Rudd]] said that "What is plain from the events of yesterday is that the Government has bungled&amp;nbsp;– and bungled badly&amp;nbsp;– the prosecution of this case."&lt;ref name="hun anger" /&gt;

[[Gerard Henderson]] said that the case "highlights an emerging division within democracies" between civil liberties advocates on the one hand and "a democracy defence lobby, which maintains that radical [[Islamism]] poses a real and present danger to Western nations" on the other.&lt;ref name="SMH henderson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Henderson | first = Gerard | title = Unanimous verdict in democracy divided | work = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax | date=  22 August 2006 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/unanimous-verdict-in-democracy-divided/2006/08/21/1156012472041.html | accessdate = 2006-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gati or existences.jpg|right|thumb|In [[Jainism]], a [[soul]] travels to any one of the four states of existence after death depending on its [[karma]]s.]]

'''Reincarnation''' is the [[Philosophy|philosophical]]  or [[Religion|religious]] concept that an aspect of a living [[being]] starts a new [[life]] in a different [[physical body]] or form after each biological [[death]]. It is also called rebirth or transmigration, and is a part of the [[Saṃsāra]] doctrine of cyclic existence.{{Sfn|Norman C. McClelland|2010|pp=24–29, 171}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} It is a central tenet of all major [[Indian religions]], namely [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]].{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J.

McClelland|2010|pp=102–103}} and a belief in rebirth/[[metempsychosis]] was held by Greek historic figures, such as [[Pythagoras]], [[Socrates]], and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;see Charles Taliaferro, Paul Draper, Philip L. Quinn, ''A Companion to Philosophy of Religion''. John Wiley and Sons, 2010, page 640, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SSCx-67Tk6cC&amp;pg=PA640&amp;dq=reincarnation+and+rebirth&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=reincarnation%20and%20rebirth&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a common belief of various ancient and modern religions such as [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and [[Eckankar]], and as an esoteric belief in many streams of [[Orthodox Judaism]]. It is found as well in many tribal societies around the world, in places such as [[Australia]], [[East Asia]], [[Siberia]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;Gananath Obeyesekere, ''Imagining Karma: Ethical Transformation in Amerindian, Buddhist, and Greek Rebirth''. University of California Press, 2002, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the majority of denominations within [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] do not believe that individuals reincarnate, particular groups within these religions do refer to reincarnation; these groups include the mainstream historical and contemporary followers of [[Catharism|Cathars]], [[Alawites]], the [[Druze]],&lt;ref&gt;Hitti, Philip K (2007) [1924].

In recent decades, many [[Europeans]] and [[North Americans]] have developed an interest in reincarnation,&lt;ref name="hi.is"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf |title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(54.8&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Reincarnation in popular culture|many contemporary works]] mention it.

==Conceptual definitions==
The word "reincarnation" derives from [[Latin]], literally meaning, "entering the flesh again". The Greek equivalent ''[[metempsychosis]]'' (μετεμψύχωσις) derives from ''meta'' (change) and ''empsykhoun'' (to put a soul into),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=metempsychosis metempsychosis], Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; a term attributed to [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref&gt;Carl Huffman (2014), [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pythagoras/ Pythagoras, 4.1 The Fate of the Soul—Metempsychosis] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Stanford University&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate term is transmigration implying migration from one life (body) to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transmigration|author=Oxford Dictionaries|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/transmigrate|year=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation refers to the belief that an aspect of every human being (or all living beings in some cultures) continues to exist after death, this aspect may be the soul or mind or consciousness or something transcendent which is reborn in an interconnected cycle of existence; the transmigration belief varies by culture, and is envisioned to be in the form of a newly born human being, or animal, or plant, or spirit, or as a being in some other non-human realm of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/reincarnation |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Concise.britannica.com |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn|Keown|2013|pp=35–40}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher Key Chapple|title=Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=abLZNdYxay8C |year=2006|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2045-6 |pages=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been used by modern philosophers such as [[Kurt Gödel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karl Sigmund |url=http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html |title=Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century |publisher=Goedelexhibition.at |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has entered the English language. Another Greek term sometimes used synonymously is ''[[palingenesis]]'', "being born again".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |title=Heart of Hinduism: Reincarnation and Samsara |publisher=Hinduism.iskcon.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110419232238/http://hinduism.iskcon.com/concepts/102.htm |archivedate=2011-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rebirth is a key concept found in major Indian religions, and discussed with various terms. ''Punarjanman'' (Sanskrit: पुनर्जन्मन्) means "rebirth, transmigration".&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"&gt;{{cite book|author=Monier Monier-Williams|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3NWAAAAcAAJ|year=1872|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Wesley Neufeldt|title=Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iaRWtgXjplQC&amp;pg=PA106|year=1986|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-87395-990-2|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reincarnation is discussed in the ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism, with many alternate terms such as ''punarāvṛtti'' (पुनरावृत्ति), ''punarājāti'' (पुनराजाति), ''punarjīvātu'' (पुनर्जीवातु), ''punarbhava'' (पुनर्भव), ''āgati-gati'' (आगति-गति, common in Buddhist Pali text), ''nibbattin'' (निब्बत्तिन्), ''upapatti'' (उपपत्ति), and ''uppajjana'' (उप्पज्जन).&lt;ref name="Monier-Williams582"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids |author2=William Stede |title=Pali-English Dictionary |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC |year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1144-7 |pages=95, 144, 151, 361, 475 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These religions believe that this reincarnation is cyclic and an endless [[Saṃsāra]], unless one gains spiritual insights that ends this cycle leading to liberation.{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}}{{sfn|Stephen J. Laumakis|2008|pp=90–99}} The reincarnation concept is considered in Indian religions as a step that starts each "cycle of aimless drifting, wandering or mundane existence",{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=271–272}} but one that is an opportunity to seek spiritual liberation through ethical living and a variety of meditative, yogic (''marga''), or other spiritual practices.{{Sfn|John Bowker|2014|pp=84–85}}&lt;ref&gt;Gavin Flood (2010), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism (Editor: Knut Jacobsen), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, pages 881–884&lt;/ref&gt; They consider the release from the cycle of reincarnations as the ultimate spiritual goal, and call the liberation by terms such as [[moksha]], [[nirvana]], ''mukti'' and ''kaivalya''.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Klostermaier, Mokṣa and Critical Theory, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1985), pages 61–71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman E.

Série in-8°, Fasc. 61, Édition-Diffusion de Boccard (Paris), {{ISBN|978-2868030610}}, pages 1–9&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Buddhist, Hindu and Jain traditions have differed, since ancient times, in their assumptions and in their details on what reincarnates, how reincarnation occurs and what leads to liberation.{{Sfn|Obeyesekere|2005|p=1-2, 108, 126–128}}{{Sfn|Mark Juergensmeyer|Wade Clark Roof|2011|pp=272–273}}

''Gilgul'', ''Gilgul neshamot'' or ''Gilgulei Ha Neshamot'' ([[Hebrew language|Heb.]] גלגול הנשמות) is the concept of reincarnation in [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] [[Judaism]], found in much [[Yiddish literature]] among [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. ''Gilgul'' means "cycle" and ''neshamot'' is "souls". Kabbalistic reincarnation says that humans reincarnate only to humans and to the same sex only: men to men, women to women.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==History==

===Origins===

===Early Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism===

The idea of reincarnation has early roots in the [[Vedic period]] (c. 1500 – c. 500 BCE), predating the [[Buddha]] and the [[Mahavira]].&lt;ref name=damienkeown32&gt;{{cite book|author=Damien Keown |title=Buddhism: A Very Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_QXX0Uq29aoC |year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-966383-5 |pages=28, 32–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and liberation partly derive from ascetic traditions that arose in India around the middle of the first millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, Gavin. Olivelle, Patrick. 2003. ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism.'' Malden: Blackwell. pg. 273-4. "The second half of the first millennium BCE was the period that created many of the ideological and institutional elements that characterize later Indian religions. The renouncer tradition played a central role during this formative period of Indian religious history....Some of the fundamental values and beliefs that we generally associate with Indian religions in general and Hinduism in particular were in part the creation of the renouncer tradition. These include the two pillars of Indian theologies: samsara – the belief that life in this world is one of suffering and subject to repeated deaths and births (rebirth); moksa/nirvana – the goal of human existence....."&lt;/ref&gt; Though no direct evidence of this has been found, the tribes of the [[Ganges]] valley or the [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] traditions of [[South India]] have been proposed as another early source of reincarnation beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Gavin D. Flood, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge University Press (1996), UK {{ISBN|0-521-43878-0}}  p. 86 – "A third alternative is that the origin of transmigration theory lies outside of vedic or sramana traditions in the tribal religions of the Ganges valley, or even in Dravidian traditions of south India."&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Buddhist texts#Texts of the Early schools|early Buddhist texts]] discuss rebirth as part of the doctrine of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|Saṃsāra]]''.

In early Buddhist traditions, ''Saṃsāra'' cosmology consisted of five realms through which the wheel of existence cycled.&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt; This included hells (''[[niraya]]''), [[hungry ghosts]] (''[[pretas]]''), animals (''tiryak''), humans (''[[manushya]]''), and gods (''[[Deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s'', heavenly).&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trainor2004p63"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert DeCaroli |title=Haunting the Buddha: Indian Popular Religions and the Formation of Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_2XtkSRyTYC|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-803765-1|pages=94–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In latter Buddhist traditions, this list grew to a list of six realms of rebirth, adding demi-gods (''[[asuras]]'').&lt;ref name=jeffwilsonbudsam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Akira Sadakata|title=Buddhist Cosmology: Philosophy and Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bcYGAAAAYAAJ|year=1997|publisher= Kōsei Publishing 佼成出版社, Tokyo|isbn=978-4-333-01682-2|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest layers of Vedic text incorporate the concept of life, followed by an [[afterlife]] in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[James Hastings]]|author2=John Alexander Selbie|author3=[[Louis Herbert Gray]]|series=[[Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics]]|title=Volume 12: Suffering-Zwingli|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.500005|year=1922|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark|pages=616–618}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ancient Vedic [[Rishi]]s challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, because people do not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert that it would be unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in "either or" and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were.{{Sfn|Jessica Frazier|Gavin Flood|2011|pp=84–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kusum P.

Early Greek discussion of the concept likewise dates to the 6th century BCE. An early Greek thinker known to have considered rebirth is [[Pherecydes of Syros]] (fl. 540 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His younger contemporary Pythagoras (c. 570–c. 495 BCE&lt;ref&gt;"The dates of his life cannot be fixed exactly, but assuming the approximate correctness of the statement of Aristoxenus (ap. Porph. ''V.P.'' 9) that he left Samos to escape the tyranny of Polycrates at the age of forty, we may put his birth round about 570 BCE, or a few years earlier. The length of his life was variously estimated in antiquity, but it is agreed that he lived to a fairly ripe old age, and most probably he died at about seventy-five or eighty." [[William Keith Chambers Guthrie]], (1978), ''A history of Greek philosophy, Volume 1: The earlier Presocratics and the Pythagoreans'', page 173. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;), its first famous exponent, instituted societies for its diffusion. [[Plato]] (428/427–348/347 BCE) presented accounts of reincarnation in his works, particularly the ''[[Myth of Er]]''.

Authorities have not agreed on how the notion arose in Greece: sometimes Pythagoras is said to have been Pherecydes' pupil, sometimes to have introduced it with the doctrine of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]], a [[Thrace|Thracian]] religion that was to be important in the diffusion of reincarnation, or else to have brought the teaching from India. In  ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato makes his teacher [[Socrates]], prior to his death, state: "I am confident that there truly is such a thing as living again, and that the living spring from the dead." However [[Xenophon]] does not mention Socrates as believing in reincarnation and Plato may have systematised Socrates' thought with concepts he took directly from Pythagoreanism or Orphism.

===Classical Antiquity===

{{see also|metempsychosis}}

The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]], which taught reincarnation, about the 6th century BC, organized itself into [[mystery schools]] at [[Eleusis]] and elsewhere, and produced a copious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Linforth, Ivan M. (1941) ''The Arts of Orpheus'' Arno Press, New York, {{OCLC|514515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (1948) ''A Study of the doctrine of metempsychosis in Greece, from Pythagoras to Plato'' (Long's 1942 Ph.D. dissertation) Princeton, New Jersey, {{OCLC|1472399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (16 February 1948) "Plato's Doctrine of Metempsychosis and Its Source" ''The Classical Weekly'' 41(10): pp. 149—155&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orpheus]], its legendary founder, is said to have taught that the immortal soul aspires to freedom while the body holds it prisoner. The wheel of birth revolves, the soul alternates between freedom and captivity round the wide circle of necessity. Orpheus proclaimed the need of the grace of the gods, [[Dionysus]] in particular, and of self-purification until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever.

An association between [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean philosophy]] and reincarnation was routinely accepted throughout antiquity. In the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' Plato makes Socrates tell how Er, the son of Armenius, miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, in the [[Chariot allegory]] of the [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]], in the [[Meno]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Laws]]. The soul, once separated from the body, spends an indeterminate amount of time in "formland" (see The [[Allegory of the Cave]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'') and then assumes another body.

In later Greek literature the doctrine is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]]&lt;ref&gt;Menander, ''The Inspired Woman''&lt;/ref&gt; and satirized by [[Lucian]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian, ''Gallus'', 18 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 25(1/2): pp. 116—118, page 117, FN15&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a lost passage of his ''Annals'', told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in his satires (vi. 9) laughs at this, it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]]&lt;ref&gt;Lucretius, (i. 124)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Horace]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Epistles'', II. i. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]].&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''The Aeneid'', vv. 724 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It persists down to the late classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s. In the [[Hermetica]], a Graeco-Egyptian series of writings on cosmology and spirituality attributed to [[Hermes Trismegistus]]/[[Thoth]], the doctrine of reincarnation is central.

In [[Hellenistic philosophy|Greco-Roman thought]], the concept of metempsychosis disappeared with the rise of [[Early Christianity]], reincarnation being incompatible with the Christian core doctrine of [[salvation]] of the faithful after death. It has been suggested that some of the early Church Fathers, especially [[Origen]], still entertained a belief in the possibility of reincarnation, but evidence is tenuous, and the writings of Origen as they have come down to us speak explicitly against it.&lt;ref&gt;The book ''Reincarnation in Christianity'', by the [[theosophist]] Geddes MacGregor (1978) asserted that Origen believed in reincarnation.  MacGregor is convinced that Origen believed in and taught about reincarnation but that his texts written about the subject have been destroyed. He admits that there is no extant proof for that position. The allegation was also repeated by [[Shirley MacLaine]] in her book ''Out On a Limb''.
Origen does discuss  the concept of transmigration (''metensomatosis'') from Greek philosophy, but it is repeatedly stated that this concept is not a part of the Christian teaching or scripture in his Comment on the [[Gospel of Matthew]] (which survives only in a 6th-century Latin translatio): "In this place [when Jesus said Elijah was come and referred to John the Baptist] it does not appear to me that by Elijah the soul is spoken of, lest I fall into the doctrine of [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]], which is foreign to the Church of God, and not handed down by the apostles, nor anywhere set forth in the scriptures" (13:1:46–53, see [[s:Ante-Nicene Fathers/Volume IX/Origen on Matthew/Origen's Commentary on Matthew/Book XIII|Commentary on Matthew, Book XIII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some early Christian [[Gnostic]] sects professed reincarnation. The [[Sethians]] and followers of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] believed in it.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this is documented in R.E. Slater's book ''Paradise Reconsidered.''&lt;/ref&gt; The followers of [[Bardaisan]] of [[Mesopotamia]], a sect of the 2nd century deemed heretical by the Catholic Church, drew upon [[Babylon|Chaldean]] [[astrology]], to which Bardaisan's son Harmonius, educated in Athens, added Greek ideas including a sort of metempsychosis. Another such teacher was [[Basilides]] (132–? CE/AD), known to us through the criticisms of [[Irenaeus]] and the work of [[Clement of Alexandria]] (see also [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] and [[Buddhism and Gnosticism]]).

In the third Christian century [[Manichaeism]] spread both east and west from [[Babylonia]], then within the [[Sassanid Empire]], where its founder [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] lived about 216–276. Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 AD. Noting Mani's early travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] and other Buddhist influences in Manichaeism, [[Richard Foltz]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; attributes Mani's teaching of reincarnation to Buddhist influence. However the inter-relation of Manicheanism, Orphism, Gnosticism and neo-Platonism is far from clear.

===Celtic paganism===
In the 1st century BCE [[Alexander Cornelius Polyhistor]] wrote:

{{bquote|The Pythagorean doctrine prevails among the Gauls' teaching that the souls of men are immortal, and that after a fixed number of years they will enter into another body.}}

[[Julius Caesar]] recorded that the [[druids]] of Gaul, Britain and Ireland had metempsychosis as one of their core doctrines:&lt;ref&gt;Julius Caesar, "De Bello Gallico", VI&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bquote|The principal point of their doctrine is that the soul does not die and that after death it passes from one body into another... the main object of all education is, in their opinion, to imbue their scholars with a firm belief in the indestructibility of the human soul, which, according to their belief, merely passes at death from one tenement to another; for by such doctrine alone, they say, which robs death of all its terrors, can the highest form of human courage be developed.}}

===Germanic paganism===
{{Main|Rebirth in Germanic paganism}}
[[Image:Ed0027.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sváfa]] holding the dying [[Helgi Hjörvarðsson|Helgi]] in their first incarnation of three, as depicted in an illustration published in 1893]]
Surviving North Germanic texts make several references to beliefs in reincarnation. The ''Poetic Edda'' poem ''[[Helgakviða Hundingsbana II]]'' states that belief in reincarnation was once widespread, but was at the time of the composition restricted to folk belief. In addition, scholars have identified a variety of references to reincarnation among the Germanic peoples outside the North Germanic sphere.

===Judaism===
The belief in reincarnation had first existed amongst Jewish mystics in the Ancient World, among whom differing explanations were given of the after-life, although with a universal belief in an immortal soul.&lt;ref&gt;''Essential Judaism: A Complete Guide to Beliefs, Customs &amp; Rituals'', By George Robinson, Simon and Schuster 2008, page 193&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reincarnation is an [[esoteric]] belief within many streams of modern Judaism.  Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism), teaches a belief in [[gilgul]], transmigration of souls, and hence the belief in reincarnation is universal in [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, and is also held as an esoteric belief within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]. In [[Judaism]], the [[Zohar]], first published in the 13th century, discusses reincarnation at length, especially in the [[Torah]] portion "Balak." The most comprehensive [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] work on reincarnation, ''[[Shaar HaGilgulim]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Mind in the Balance: Meditation in Science, Buddhism, and Christianity", p. 104, by  B. Alan Wallace&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Between Worlds: Dybbuks, Exorcists, and Early Modern Judaism", p. 190, by J. H. Chajes&lt;/ref&gt; was written by [[Hayyim ben Joseph Vital|Chaim Vital]], based on the teachings of his mentor, the 16th century kabbalist [[Isaac Luria]], who was said to know the past lives of each person through his [[Ruach HaKodesh|semi-prophetic]] abilities. The 18th century Lithuanian master scholar and kabbalist, Rabbi Elijah, known as the [[Vilna Gaon]] (Elijah of Vilna), authored a commentary on the biblical [[Book of Jonah]] as an allegory of reincarnation.

The practice of conversion to Judaism is sometimes understood within Orthodox Judaism in terms of reincarnation. According to this school of thought in Judaism, when non-Jews are drawn to Judaism, it is because they had been Jews in a former life. Such souls may "wander among nations" through multiple lives, until they find their way back to Judaism, including through finding themselves born in a gentile family with a "lost" Jewish ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation', By Yonasson Gershom, Yonasson Gershom, Jason Aronson, Incorporated, 31 Jan 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an extensive literature of Jewish folk and traditional stories that refer to reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;Yonasson Gershom (1999), ''Jewish Tales of Reincarnation''. Northvale, NJ: Jason Aronson. {{ISBN|0765760835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
[[Taoist]] documents from as early as the [[Han Dynasty]] claimed that [[Lao Tzu]] appeared on earth as different persons in different times beginning in the legendary era of [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors]]. The (ca. 3rd century BC) ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Chuang Tzu]]'' states: "Birth is not a beginning; death is not an end. There is existence without limitation; there is continuity without a starting-point. Existence without limitation is Space. Continuity without a starting point is Time. There is birth, there is death, there is issuing forth, there is entering in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vMNI-aFtF4UC&amp;dq|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer (translated by Herbert Allen Giles)|year= 1889|page= 304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Middle Ages===
Around the 11–12th century in Europe, several reincarnationist movements were persecuted as heresies, through the establishment of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]] in the Latin west. These included the [[Cathar]], Paterene or Albigensian church of western Europe, the [[Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomils]] in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, ''The Medieval Manichee: A Study of the Christian Dualist Heresy'', 1982, {{ISBN|0-521-28926-2}}, Cambridge University Press, ''The Bogomils'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1LGB7u5iD0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=mediaeval+manichee&amp;cd=1 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian sects such as the Bogomils and the Cathars, who professed reincarnation and other gnostic beliefs, were referred to as "Manichean", and are today sometimes described by scholars as "Neo-Manichean".&lt;ref&gt;For example Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no known Manichaean mythology or terminology in the writings of these groups there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups truly were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=Newadvent.org |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Renaissance and Early Modern period===
While reincarnation has been a matter of faith in some communities from an early date it has also frequently been argued for on principle, as Plato does when he argues that the number of souls must be finite because souls are indestructible,&lt;ref&gt;"the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Franklin]] held a similar view.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to his friend [[George Whatley]] written May 23, 1785: Jennifer T. Kennedy, Death Effects: Revisiting the conceit of Franklin's ''Memoir'', ''Early American Literature'', 2001. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/25057231 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes such convictions, as in Socrates' case, arise from a more general personal faith, at other times from anecdotal evidence such as Plato makes Socrates offer in the ''Myth of Er''.

During the [[Renaissance]] translations of Plato, the [[Hermetica]] and other works fostered new European interest in reincarnation. [[Marsilio Ficino]]&lt;ref&gt;Marsilio Ficino, ''Platonic Theology'', 17.3–4&lt;/ref&gt; argued that Plato's references to reincarnation were intended allegorically, Shakespeare alluded to the doctrine of reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;"Again, Rosalind in "As You Like It" (Act III., Scene 2), says: ''I was never so be-rhimed that I can remember since Pythagoras's time, when I was an Irish rat"'' — alluding to the doctrine of the transmigration of souls." William H. Grattan Flood, quoted at [http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishMusic/XVII-2.php Libraryireland.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Giordano Bruno]] was burned at the stake by authorities after being found guilty of heresy by the [[Roman Inquisition]] for his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;Boulting, 1914. pp. 163–64&lt;/ref&gt; But the Greek philosophical works remained available and, particularly in north Europe, were discussed by groups such as the [[Cambridge Platonists]].

===19th to 20th centuries===
{{See also|#Reincarnation research}}

[[Image:Wm james.jpg|upright|thumb|right|American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]] (1842–1910) was an early psychical researcher.&lt;ref name="Berger"&gt;{{cite book |last=Berger |first=Arthur S. |authorlink= |author2=Berger, Joyce  |title=The Encyclopedia of Parapsychology and Psychical Research |publisher=Paragon House Publishers |year=1991 |pages= |isbn=1-55778-043-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 19th century the philosophers [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nietzsche]]&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'',  Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; could access the Indian scriptures for discussion of the doctrine of reincarnation, which recommended itself to the [[American Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Walt Whitman]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and was adapted by [[Francis Bowen]] into ''Christian Metempsychosis''.&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |title=Shirleymaclaine.com |publisher=Shirleymaclaine.com |accessdate=2011-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106160539/http://www.shirleymaclaine.com/articles/reincarnation/article-318 |archive-date=2011-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, interest in reincarnation had been introduced into the nascent discipline of [[psychology]], largely due to the influence of [[William James]], who raised aspects of the [[philosophy of mind]], [[comparative religion]], the psychology of religious experience and the nature of empiricism.&lt;ref&gt;David Hammerman, Lisa Lenard, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Reincarnation'', Penguin, p.34. For relevant works by James, see; William James, ''Human Immortality: Two Supposed Objections to the Doctrine (the Ingersoll Lecture, 1897)'', ''The Will to Believe, Human Immortality'' (1956) Dover Publications, {{ISBN|0-486-20291-7}}, ''The Varieties of Religious Experience: A Study in Human Nature'' (1902), {{ISBN|0-14-039034-0}}, ''Essays in Radical Empiricism'' (1912) Dover Publications 2003, {{ISBN|0-486-43094-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was influential in the founding of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] (ASPR) in [[New York City]] in 1885, three years after the British [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) was inaugurated in London,&lt;ref name="Berger"/&gt; leading to systematic, critical investigation of paranormal phenomena.

At this time popular awareness of the idea of reincarnation was boosted by the [[Theosophical Society]]'s dissemination of systematised and universalised Indian concepts and also by the influence of magical societies like [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn|The Golden Dawn]]. Notable personalities like [[Annie Besant]], [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Dion Fortune]] made the subject almost as [[Reincarnation in popular culture|familiar an element of the popular culture]] of the west as of the east. By 1924 the subject could be satirised in popular children's books.&lt;ref&gt;Richmal Crompton, ''More William'', George Newnes, London, 1924, XIII. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17125/17125-h/17125-h.htm William and the Ancient Souls]; "The memory usually came in a flash. For instance, you might remember in a flash when you were looking at a box of matches that you had been Guy Fawkes."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Théodore Flournoy]] was among the first to study a claim of past-life recall in the course of his investigation of the medium [[Hélène Smith]], published in 1900, in which he defined the possibility of [[cryptomnesia]] in such accounts.&lt;ref&gt;Théodore Flournoy, [http://www.psychanalyse-paris.com/-Des-Indes-a-la-planete-Mars-.html Des Indes à la planète Mars], Étude sur un cas de somnambulisme avec glossolalie, Éditions Alcan et Eggimann, Paris et Genève, 1900&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carl Gustav Jung]], like Flournoy based in Switzerland, also emulated him in his thesis based on a study of cryptomnesia in psychism. Later Jung would emphasise the importance of the persistence of memory and ego in psychological study of reincarnation: "This concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality... (that) one is able, at least potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own...."&lt;ref name="shirleymaclaine.com"/&gt; [[Hypnosis]], used in [[psychoanalysis]] for retrieving  forgotten memories, was eventually tried as a means of studying the phenomenon of past life recall.

The [[Bhagavad Gita]] states:

{{bquote|
Just as in the body childhood, adulthood and old age happen to an embodied being. So also he (the embodied being) acquires another body. The wise one is not deluded about this. – (2:13){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=98}}

As, after casting away worn out garments, a man later takes new ones. So after casting away worn out bodies, the embodied Self encounters other new ones. – (2:22){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=107}}

When an embodied being transcends, these three qualities which are the source of the body. Released from birth, death, old age and pain, he attains immortality. – (14:20){{Sfn| Chapple|2010|p=582}}
}}

There are internal differences within Hindu traditions on reincarnation and the state of moksha. For example, the dualistic devotional traditions such as [[Madhvacharya]]'s Dvaita Vedanta tradition of Hinduism champion a theistic premise, assert that human soul and Brahman are different, loving devotion to Brahman (god Vishnu in Madhvacharya's theology) is the means to release from Samsara, it is the grace of God which leads to moksha, and spiritual liberation is achievable only in after-life (''videhamukti'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

Within Japanese [[Zen]], reincarnation is accepted by some, but rejected by others. A distinction can be drawn between "folk Zen", as in the Zen practiced by devotional lay people, and "philosophical Zen". Folk Zen generally accepts the various supernatural elements of Buddhism such as rebirth. Philosophical Zen, however, places more emphasis on the present moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McClelland|first=Norman C.|title=Encyclopedia of Reincarnation and Karma|page=281|year=2010|isbn=9780786456758|publisher=McFarland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=warner&gt;{{citation|last=Warner|first=Brad|title=Hardcore Zen|isbn= 9780861719891|publisher=Wisdom Publications|year=2005|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some schools conclude that [[karma]] continues to exist and adhere to the person until it works out its consequences. For the [[Sautrantika]] school, each act "perfumes" the individual or "plants a seed" that later germinates. Tibetan Buddhism stresses the state of mind at the time of death. To die with a peaceful mind will stimulate a virtuous seed and a fortunate rebirth; a disturbed mind will stimulate a non-virtuous seed and an unfortunate rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;''Transform Your Life'': A Blissful Journey, page 52), [[Tharpa Publications]] (2001, US ed. 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9789067-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|200px|17th-century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Naraka (Jainism)|Jain hell]] according to [[Jain cosmology]]. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each hell.]]
In [[Jainism]], the reincarnation doctrine, along with its theories of ''Saṃsāra'' and Karma, are central to its theological foundations, as evidenced by the extensive literature on it in the major sects of Jainism, and their pioneering ideas on these topics from the earliest times of the Jaina tradition.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=217–236}}&lt;ref name=dundasp14/&gt; Reincarnation in contemporary Jainism traditions is the belief that the worldly life is characterized by continuous rebirths and suffering in various realms of existence.{{Sfn|Padmanabh Jaini|1980|pp=226–228}}&lt;ref name="dundasp14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sethia2004p31"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tara Sethia |title=Ahimsā, Anekānta, and Jainism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYdlKv8wBiYC |year=2004|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-2036-4|pages=30–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karma forms a central and fundamental part of Jain faith, being intricately connected to other of its philosophical concepts like transmigration, reincarnation, liberation, non-violence (''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahiṃsā]]'') and non-attachment, among others. Actions are seen to have consequences: some immediate, some delayed, even into future incarnations. So the doctrine of karma is not considered simply in relation to one life-time, but also in relation to both future incarnations and past lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp. 226–230&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' 3.3–4 states: "The ''jīva'' or the soul is sometimes born in [[devaloka|the world of gods]], sometimes in [[Naraka (Jainism)|hell]]. Sometimes it acquires the body of a [[asura|demon]]; all this happens on account of its karma. This ''jīva'' sometimes takes birth as a worm, as an insect or as an ant."&lt;ref name=krishan43&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997): p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The text further states (32.7): "Karma is the root of birth and death. The souls bound by karma go round and round in the cycle of existence."&lt;ref name=krishan43 /&gt;

Actions and emotions in the current lifetime affect future incarnations depending on the nature of the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.70–71&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.64–66&lt;/ref&gt; As a natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.&lt;ref name=Kuhn64/&gt;

There is no retribution, judgment or reward involved but a natural consequences of the choices in life made either knowingly or unknowingly. Hence, whatever suffering or pleasure that a soul may be experiencing in its present life is on account of choices that it has made in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.15&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this doctrine, Jainism attributes supreme importance to pure thinking and moral behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Rankin, Aidan (2006) p.67&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jain texts postulate four ''gatis'', that is states-of-existence or birth-categories, within which the soul transmigrates. The four ''gatis'' are: ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]]'' (demi-gods), ''manuṣya'' (humans), ''[[Naraka (Jainism)|nāraki]]'' (hell beings) and ''tiryañca'' (animals, plants and micro-organisms).&lt;ref name=Jaini108&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.108&lt;/ref&gt; The four ''gatis'' have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered [[Jain cosmology#Jain geography|Jain universe]]: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.&lt;ref name=Jaini108/&gt;

Single-sensed souls, however, called ''[[nigoda]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Jain hierarchy of life classifies living beings on the basis of the senses: five-sensed beings like humans and animals are at the top, and single sensed beings like microbes and plants are at the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and element-bodied souls pervade all tiers of this universe. ''Nigodas'' are souls at the bottom end of the existential hierarchy. They are so tiny and undifferentiated, that they lack even individual bodies, living in colonies. According to Jain texts, this infinity of ''nigodas'' can also be found in plant tissues, root vegetables and animal bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) pp.108–09&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its karma, a soul transmigrates and reincarnates within the scope of this cosmology of destinies. The four main destinies are further divided into sub-categories and still smaller sub-sub-categories. In all, Jain texts speak of a cycle of 8.4 million birth destinies in which souls find themselves again and again as they cycle within ''[[Samsara (Jainism)|samsara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh (2000) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jainism, God has no role to play in an individual's destiny; one's personal destiny is not seen as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather as a result of its own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, ''[[Vyakhyaprajnapti|Bhagvati sūtra]]'' 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood lead to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows lead to rebirth in heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, Yuvraj (1997) p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Each soul is thus responsible for its own predicament, as well as its own salvation. Accumulated karma represent a sum total of all unfulfilled desires, attachments and aspirations of a soul.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the soul to experience the various themes of the lives that it desires to experience.&lt;ref name=Kuhn28 /&gt; Hence a soul may transmigrate from one life form to another for countless of years, taking with it the karma that it has earned, until it finds conditions that bring about the required fruits. In certain philosophies, heavens and hells are often viewed as places for eternal salvation or eternal damnation for good and bad deeds. But according to Jainism, such places, including the earth are simply the places which allow the soul to experience its unfulfilled karma.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Hermann (2001) pp.65–66, 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gilgul}}
{{Kabbalah||collapsed=1}}
Jewish mystical texts (the [[Kabbalah]]), from their classic Medieval canon onward, teach a belief in ''[[Gilgul Neshamot]]'' (Hebrew for metempsychosis of souls: literally "soul cycle", plural ''"gilgulim"''). The [[Zohar]] and the [[Sefer HaBahir]] specifically discuss reincarnation. It is a common belief in contemporary [[Hasidic Judaism]], which regards the Kabbalah as sacred and authoritative, though understood in light of a more [[Deveikut|innate]] psychological mysticism. Kabbalah also teaches that "The soul of Moses is reincarnated in every generation."&lt;ref&gt;Kabbalah for Dummies&lt;/ref&gt; Other, Non-Hasidic, [[Orthodox Jewish]] groups while not placing a heavy emphasis on reincarnation, do acknowledge it as a valid teaching.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/jl-old/kc/48943926.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularization entered modern secular [[Yiddish literature]] and folk motif.

The 16th century mystical renaissance in communal [[Safed]] replaced scholastic [[Jewish philosophy|Rationalism]] as mainstream traditional Jewish theology, both in scholarly circles and in the popular imagination. References to ''gilgul'' in former Kabbalah became systematized as part of the metaphysical purpose of creation. [[Isaac Luria]] (the Ari) brought the issue to the centre of his new mystical articulation, for the first time, and advocated identification of the reincarnations of historic Jewish figures that were compiled by [[Haim Vital]] in his [[Shaar HaGilgulim]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sha'ar Ha'Gilgulim, The Gate of Reincarnations'', Chaim Vital&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gilgul'' is contrasted with the other processes in Kabbalah of [[Ibbur]] ("pregnancy"), the attachment of a second soul to an individual for (or by) good means, and [[Dybuk]] ("possession"), the attachment of a spirit, demon, etc. to an individual for (or by) "bad" means.

In Lurianic Kabbalah, reincarnation is not retributive or fatalistic, but an expression of Divine compassion, the microcosm of the doctrine of cosmic rectification of creation. ''Gilgul'' is a heavenly agreement with the individual soul, conditional upon circumstances. Luria's radical system focused on [[Tohu and Tikkun|rectification]] of the Divine soul, played out through Creation. The true essence of anything is the divine spark within that gives it existence. Even a stone or leaf possesses such a soul that "came into this world to receive a rectification". A human soul may occasionally be exiled into lower inanimate, vegetative or animal creations. The most basic component of the soul, the [[nefesh]], must leave at the cessation of blood production. There are four other soul components and different nations of the world possess different forms of souls with different purposes. Each Jewish soul is reincarnated in order to fulfill each of the [[613 Mitzvot|613 Mosaic commandments]] that elevate a particular spark of holiness associated with each commandment. Once all the Sparks are redeemed to their spiritual source, the [[Mashiach|Messianic Era]] begins. Non-Jewish observance of the [[7 Laws of Noah]] assists the Jewish people, though Biblical adversaries of Israel reincarnate to oppose.

Among the many rabbis who accepted reincarnation are [[Nahmanides]] (the Ramban) and Rabbenu [[Bahya ben Asher]], [[Levi ibn Habib]] (the Ralbah), [[Shelomoh Alkabez]], [[Moses Cordovero]], [[Moses Chaim Luzzatto]]; early Hasidic masters such as the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Schneur Zalman of Liadi]] and [[Nachman of Breslov]], as well as virtually all later Hasidic masters;  contemporary Hasidic teachers such as DovBer Pinson and [[Moshe Weinberger]]; and key Mitnagdic leaders, such as the [[Vilna Gaon]] and [[Chaim Volozhin]] and their school, as well as Rabbi [[Shalom Sharabi]] (known at the RaShaSH), the [[Ben Ish Chai]] of Baghdad, [[Baba Sali]] and Rabbi [[Joel Landau (rabbi)|Joel Landau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://limmudbayarea2016.sched.com/event/7YDY/judaism-and-reincarnation|title=Limmud Bay Area 2016: Judaism and Reincarnation|website=limmudbayarea2016.sched.com|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis who have rejected the idea include [[Saadia Gaon]], [[David Kimhi]], [[Hasdai Crescas]], [[Joseph Albo]], [[Abraham ibn Daud]], [[Leon de Modena]], [[Solomon ben Aderet]], [[Maimonides]] and [[Asher ben Jehiel]].

===Sikhism===
Founded in the 15th century, Sikhism's founder [[Guru Nanak]] had a choice between the cyclical reincarnation concept of ancient Indian religions and the linear concept of early 7th-century Islam, and he chose the cyclical concept of time.&lt;ref name=colesambhi13&gt;{{cite book|author1=W.O.

The doctrines of Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body to another in endless cycles of [[Saṃsāra]], until liberation. Each birth begins with karma (''karam''), and these actions leave a ''karni'' (karmic signature) on one's soul which influences future rebirths, but it is God whose grace that liberates.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt; The way out of the reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote oneself to God and constantly remember God's name.&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arvind-Pal Singh Mandair |title=Sikhism: A Guide for the Perplexed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vdhLAQAAQBAJ  |year=2013|publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4411-0231-7 |pages=145–147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The precepts of Sikhism encourage the [[bhakti]] of One Lord for ''mukti'' (liberation).&lt;ref name="Mandair2013p145"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.

The [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba believe]] in reincarnation within the family. The names Babatunde (Father returns), Yetunde (Mother returns), Babatunji (Father wakes once again) and Sotunde (The wise man returns) all offer vivid evidence of the Ifa concept of familial or lineal rebirth. There is no simple guarantee that your grandfather or great uncle will "come back" in the birth of your child, however.

Whenever the time arrives for a spirit to return to Earth (otherwise known as The Marketplace) through the conception of a new life in the direct bloodline of the family, one of the component entities of a person's being returns, while the other remains in Heaven (Ikole Orun). The spirit that returns does so in the form of a Guardian Ori. One's Guardian Ori, which is represented and contained in the crown of the head, represents not only the spirit and energy of one's previous blood relative, but the accumulated wisdom he or she has acquired through a myriad of lifetimes. This is not to be confused with one’s spiritual Ori, which contains personal destiny, but instead refers to the coming back to The Marketplace of one's personal blood Ori through one's new life and experiences.&lt;!--removed obvious promotional material &amp; link to that website--&gt;

The following is a story of human-to-human reincarnation as told by Thunder Cloud, a Winnebago ([[Ho-Chunk]] tribe) [[Shamanism|shaman]] referred to as T. C. in the narrative. Here T. C. talks about his two previous lives and how he died and came back again to this his third lifetime. He describes his time between lives, when he was “blessed” by Earth Maker and all the abiding spirits and given special powers, including the ability to heal the sick.

T. C.'s Account of His Two Reincarnations:

{{bquote|I ''(my ghost)'' was taken to the place where the sun sets ''(the west)''. ... While at that place, I thought I would come back to earth again, and the old man with whom I was staying said to me, “My son, did you not speak about wanting to go to the earth again?” I had, as a matter of fact, only thought of it, yet he knew what I wanted. Then he said to me, “You can go, but you must ask the chief first.” Then I went and told the chief of the village of my desire, and he said to me, “You may go and obtain your revenge upon the people who killed your relatives and you.” Then I was brought down to earth. ... There I lived until I died of old age. ... As I was lying [in my grave], someone said to me, “Come, let us go away.” So then we went toward the setting of the sun. There we came to a village where we met all the dead. ... From that place I came to this earth again for the third time, and here I am''.&lt;ref name=Jefferson2008 &gt;{{Cite book |last=Jefferson |first=Warren |year=2008 |title=Reincarnation beliefs of North American Indians : soul journeys, metamorphoses, and near-death experiences |publisher=Native Voices |isbn=1-57067-212-1 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/272306114}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Radin, 1923)}}

===Christianity===
In the major Christian denominations, the concept of reincarnation is absent and it is nowhere explicitly referred to in the Bible. However, in a survey by the Pew Forum in 2009, 24% of American Christians expressed a belief in reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ANALYSIS December 9, 2009 |url=http://pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/Many-Americans-Mix-Multiple-Faiths.aspx |title=Pewforum.org |publisher=Pewforum.org |date=2009-12-09 |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1981 survey 31% of regular churchgoing European Catholics expressed a belief in reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spirituale-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010425113340/http://spiritual-wholeness.org/faqs/reinceur/reineuro.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2001-04-25 |title=Spiritual-wholeness.org |publisher=Spiritual-wholeness.org |accessdate=2011-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Christian theologians interpret certain Biblical passages as referring to reincarnation. These passages include the questioning of Jesus as to whether he is Elijah, John the Baptist, Jeremiah, or another prophet (Matthew 16:13-15 and John 1:21-22) and, less clearly (while Elijah was said not to have died, but to have been taken up to heaven), John the Baptist being asked if he is not Elijah (John 1:25).&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Frieling, ''Christianity and Reincarnation'', Floris Books 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Albrecht, ''Reincarnation, a Christian Appraisal'', InterVarsity Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lynn A.

====The idea of reincarnation in the early Church fathers====
There is evidence&lt;ref&gt;"The Big Book of Reincarnation", by Roy Stemman, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; that [[Origen]], a [[Church father]] in early Christian times, taught reincarnation in his lifetime but that when his works were translated into Latin these references were concealed. One of the epistles written by [[St. Jerome]], "To Avitus" (Letter 124 ; Ad Avitum. Epistula CXXIV),&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/text.php?tabelle=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2&amp;rumpfid=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2,%20Epistolae,%20124,%20%20%20%20p0&amp;corpus=2&amp;lang=0&amp;current_title=EPISTOLA%20CXXIV.%20AD%20AVITUM.%20Quid%20cavendum%20in%20Libris%20%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%E1%BD%B6%20%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%87%E1%BF%B6%CE%BD.&amp;links=&amp;inframe=1|title=Hieronymus_Stridonensis_cps2, Epistolae, 124, p0|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which asserts that Origen's ''On First Principles'' (Latin: ''De Principiis''; Greek: Περὶ Ἀρχῶν&lt;ref name=Cross&gt;Cross, F. L., and Elizabeth A. Livingstone. ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church'' (Second Edition). New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. p. 1009.&lt;/ref&gt;) was mistranscribed:

{{Quote| About ten years ago that saintly man [[Saint Pammachius|Pammachius]] sent me a copy of a certain person's [ [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]'s&lt;ref name="mlat.uzh.ch"/&gt; ] rendering, or rather misrendering, of Origen's ''First Principles''; with a request that in a Latin version I should give the true sense of the Greek and should set down the writer's words for good or for evil without bias in either direction. When I did as he wished and sent him the book, he was shocked to read it and locked it up in his desk lest being circulated it might wound the souls of many.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001124.htm|title=Church Fathers: Letter 124 (Jerome)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the impression that Origen was a heretic like [[Arius]], St. Jerome criticizes ideas described in ''On First Principles''. Further in "To Avitus" (Letter 124), St. Jerome writes about "convincing proof" that Origen teaches reincarnation in the original version of the book:

{{Quote|The following passage is a convincing proof that he holds the transmigration of the souls and annihilation of bodies. 'If it can be shown that an incorporeal and reasonable being has life in itself independently of the body and that it is worse off in the body than out of it; then beyond a doubt bodies are only of secondary importance and arise from time to time to meet the varying conditions of reasonable creatures. Those who require bodies are clothed with them, and contrariwise, when fallen souls have lifted themselves up to better things, their bodies are once more annihilated. They are thus ever vanishing and ever reappearing.'&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

The original text of ''On First Principles'' has almost completely disappeared.  It remains extant as ''De Principiis'' in fragments faithfully translated into Latin by St. Jerome and in "the not very reliable Latin translation of [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]]."&lt;ref name=Cross /&gt;

Reincarnation was also accepted by some streams of Sufism.

===Druze===
{{Druze|collapsed=1}}
{{See also|Druze#Beliefs}}
Reincarnation is a paramount tenet in the [[Druze]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Seabrook, W. B., ''Adventures in Arabia'', Harrap and Sons 1928, (chapters on Druze religion)&lt;/ref&gt; There is an eternal [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|duality]] of the body and the soul and it is impossible for the soul to exist without the body. Therefore, reincarnations occur instantly at one's death. While in the Hindu and Buddhist belief system a soul can be transmitted to any living creature, in the Druze belief system this is not possible and a human soul will only transfer to a human body. Furthermore, a male Druze can only be reincarnated as another male Druze and a female Druze can only be reincarnated as another female Druze. Additionally, souls cannot be divided and the number of souls existing is finite.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Dwairy, Marwan (2006) "The Psychosocial Function Of Reincarnation Among Druze In Israel" ''Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry,'' page 29 – 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Very few Druzes are able to recall their past but, if they are able to they are called a ''Nateq''. Typically souls who have died violent deaths in their previous incarnation will be able to recall memories. Since death is seen as a quick transient state, mourning is discouraged.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Unlike other Abrahamic faiths, heaven and hell are spiritual. Heaven is the ultimate happiness received when soul escapes the cycle of rebirths and reunites with the Creator, while hell is conceptualized as the bitterness of being unable to reunite with the Creator and escape from the cycle of rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James |title=The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=2002 |isbn=1615927387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tombe Allan Kardec.JPG|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Allan Kardec]], founder of spiritism. The inscription says in French "To be born, die, again be reborn, and so progress unceasingly, such is the law".]]
[[Spiritism]], a Christian philosophy codified in the 19th century by the French educator [[Allan Kardec]], teaches reincarnation or rebirth into human life after death. According to this doctrine, free will and cause and effect are the corollaries of reincarnation, and reincarnation provides a mechanism for man's spiritual evolution in successive lives.&lt;ref name="Hess2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=David J. Hess|title=Spirits and Scientists: Ideology, Spiritism and Brazilian Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGxsfV-lTtEC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 November 2010|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|isbn=978-0-271-04080-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Theosophy====
The [[Theosophical Society]] draws much of its inspiration from India. The idea is, according to a recent Theosophical writer, "the master-key to modern problems", including heredity.&lt;ref name="Theosophy and reincarnation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blavatskytrust.org.uk/html/wr_reincarnation.htm |title=Theosophy and reincarnation |publisher=Blavatskytrust.org.uk |accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Theosophical world-view reincarnation is the vast rhythmic process by which the soul, the part of a person which belongs to the formless non-material and timeless worlds, unfolds its spiritual powers in the world and comes to know itself. It descends from sublime, free, spiritual realms and gathers experience through its effort to express itself in the world. Afterwards there is a withdrawal from the physical plane to successively higher levels of reality, in death, a purification and assimilation of the past life. Having cast off all instruments of personal experience it stands again in its spiritual and formless nature, ready to begin its next rhythmic manifestation, every lifetime bringing it closer to complete self-knowledge and self-expression. However it may attract old mental, emotional, and energetic ''karma'' patterns to form the new personality.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

====Modern astrology====
Inspired by [[Helena Blavatsky]]'s major works, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'', [[astrology|astrologers]] in the early twentieth-century integrated the concepts of [[karma]] and reincarnation into the practice of [[Western astrology]]. Notable astrologers who advanced this development included [[Alan Leo]], [[Charles E. O. Carter]], [[Marc Edmund Jones]], and [[Dane Rudhyar]]. A new synthesis of East and West resulted as Hindu and Buddhist concepts of reincarnation were fused with Western astrology's deep roots in [[Hermeticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. In the case of Rudhyar, this synthesis was enhanced with the addition of [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] [[depth psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Jutta Woods. "The Theosophical Heritage in Modern Astrology." ''The Mountain Astrologer.'' Aug/Sept 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This dynamic integration of astrology, reincarnation and depth psychology has continued into the modern era with the work of astrologers [[Steven Forrest (astrologer)|Steven Forrest]] and Jeffrey Wolf Green.  Their respective schools of Evolutionary Astrology are based on "an acceptance of the fact that human beings incarnate in a succession of lifetimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forrestastrology.com/about-us/about-evolutionary-astrology|title=About Evolutionary Astrology|author=Steven Forrest and Jeffrey Wolf Green|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anthroposophy====
[[Anthroposophy]] describes reincarnation from the point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The ego is believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). [[Rudolf Steiner]] described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next,&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. ''Reincarnation and Karma'' by Steiner&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of successive lives of various individualities.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Karmic Relationships'', volumes 1–6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientology====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Whole Track]] --&gt;
{{See also|Scientology beliefs and practices}}

Past reincarnation, usually termed "past lives", is a key part of the principles and practices of the [[Church of Scientology]]. Scientologists believe that the human individual is actually a ''[[thetan]]'', an immortal spiritual entity, that has fallen into a degraded state as a result of past-life experiences. Scientology [[Auditing (Scientology)|auditing]] is intended to free the person of these past-life traumas and recover past-life memory, leading to a higher state of spiritual awareness. This idea is echoed in their highest fraternal religious order, the [[Sea Organization]], whose motto is "Revenimus" or "We Come Back", and whose members sign a "billion-year contract" as a sign of commitment to that ideal. [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of Scientology, does not use the word "reincarnation" to describe its beliefs, noting that: "The common definition of reincarnation has been altered from its original meaning. The word has come to mean 'to be born again in different life forms' whereas its actual definition is 'to be born again into the flesh of another body.' Scientology ascribes to this latter, original definition of reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |title=Scientology Church &amp; Religion – What is Scientology? |work=Scientology |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613231607/http://www.scientology.org/html/opencms/cos/scientology/en_US/news-media/faq/pg016.html |archivedate=2006-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first writings in Scientology regarding past lives date from around 1951 and slightly earlier. In 1960, Hubbard published a book on past lives entitled ''[[Have You Lived Before This Life]]''. In 1968 he wrote ''[[Mission into Time]]'', a report on a five-week sailing expedition to Sardinia, Sicily and Carthage to see if specific evidence could be found to substantiate L. Ron Hubbard's recall of incidents in his own past, centuries ago.

====Meher Baba====
The Indian spiritual teacher [[Meher Baba]] stated that reincarnation occurs due to desires and once those desires are extinguished the ego-mind ceases to reincarnate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Meher Baba|Baba, Meher]] (1967), [http://www.discoursesbymeherbaba.org ''Discourses''], Volume III, Sufism Reoriented, 1967, {{ISBN|1-880619-09-1}}, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wicca====

[[Wicca]] is a neo-pagan religion focused on nature, guided by the philosophy of [[Wiccan Rede]] that advocates the tenets "Harm None, Do As Ye Will". Wiccans believe in a form of karmic return where one's deeds are returned, either in the current life or in another life, threefold or multiple times in order to teach one lessons (The Threefold Law).

During recent decades, many people in the West have developed an interest in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="hi.is"/&gt; Recent studies have indicated that some Westerners accept the idea of reincarnation&lt;ref name="hi.is" /&gt; including certain contemporary people who were from Catholic families,&lt;ref&gt;Tony Walter and Helen Waterhouse, "[http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/60/2/187.full.pdf A Very Private Belief: Reincarnation in Contemporary England]". ''Sociology of Religion'', Vol. 60, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagans]], followers of [[Spiritism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]] and students of [[esotericism|esoteric]] philosophies such as [[Kabbalah]], and [[Gnostic]] and [[Esoteric Christianity]] as well as followers of Indian religions. Demographic survey data from 1999–2002 shows a significant minority of people from Europe and America, where there is reasonable freedom of thought and access to ideas but no outstanding recent reincarnationist tradition, believe we had a life before we were born, will survive death and be born again physically. The mean for the Nordic countries is 22%.&lt;ref name="surv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hi.is/~erlendur/english/Nordic_Psychology_erlhar06.pdf|title=Popular psychology, belief in life after death and reincarnation in the Nordic countries, Western and Eastern Europe|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief in reincarnation is particularly high in the Baltic countries, with [[Lithuania]] having the highest figure for the whole of [[Europe]], 44%. The lowest figure is in East Germany, 12%. In [[Russia]], about one-third believes in reincarnation. The effect of communist anti-religious ideas on the beliefs of the populations of [[Eastern Europe]] seems to have been rather slight, if any, except apparently in East Germany.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; Overall, 22% of respondents in [[Western Europe]] believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name="surv" /&gt; According to a 2005 Gallup poll 20 percent of U.S. adults believe in reincarnation. Recent surveys by the Barna Group, a Christian research nonprofit organization, have found that a quarter of U.S. Christians, including 10 percent of all [[born again]] Christians, embrace the idea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmonitor.wordpress.com/2007/08/25/buddhism-china/]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dalailama1_20121014_4639.jpg|thumb|The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated his belief that it would be difficult for science to disprove reincarnation.]]
Skeptic [[Carl Sagan]] asked the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] what he would do if a fundamental tenet of his religion (reincarnation) were definitively disproved by science. The Dalai Lama answered, "If science can disprove reincarnation, Tibetan Buddhism would abandon reincarnation… but it's going to be mighty hard to disprove reincarnation."&lt;ref&gt;"The Boundaries of Knowledge in Buddhism, Christianity, and Science", by Paul David Numrich, p. 13, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, {{ISBN|9783525569870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ian Stevenson reported that belief in reincarnation is held (with variations in details) by adherents of almost all major religions except [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]].  In addition, between 20 and 30 percent of persons in western countries who may be nominal Christians also believe in reincarnation.&lt;ref name=jh&gt;Jane Henry (2005).

One 1999 study by Walter and Waterhouse reviewed the previous data on the level of reincarnation belief and performed a set of thirty in-depth interviews in Britain among people who did not belong to a religion advocating reincarnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors reported that surveys have found about one fifth to one quarter of Europeans have some level of belief in reincarnation, with similar results found in the USA. In the interviewed group, the belief in the existence of this phenomenon appeared independent of their age, or the type of religion that these people belonged to, with most being Christians. The beliefs of this group also did not appear to contain any more than usual of "new age" ideas (broadly defined) and the authors interpreted their ideas on reincarnation as "one way of tackling issues of suffering", but noted that this seemed to have little effect on their private lives.

Waterhouse also published a detailed discussion of beliefs expressed in the interviews.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse1999&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that although most people "hold their belief in reincarnation quite lightly" and were unclear on the details of their ideas, personal experiences such as past-life memories and [[near-death experience]]s had influenced most believers, although only a few had direct experience of these phenomena. Waterhouse analyzed the influences of second-hand accounts of reincarnation, writing that most of the people in the survey had heard other people's accounts of past-lives from regression hypnosis and dreams and found these fascinating, feeling that there "must be something in it" if other people were having such experiences.

=={{Anchor|Reincarnation research}}Academic research into claims of reincarnation==
Psychiatrist [[Ian Stevenson]], from the [[University of Virginia]], having grown up with a mother who was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]],&lt;ref name="Stevenson2006p13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|title=Stevenson 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721165720/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/personalitystudies/Stevenson.pdf|archive-date=July 21, 2006|dead-url=yes|access-date=September 1, 2016|df=}}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; dedicated his latter career to investigating claims of reincarnation in hopes of providing evidence that reincarnation happens. Other people who have undertaken similar pursuits include [[Jim B. Tucker]], [[Antonia Mills]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jamesgmatlock.net/resources/researchers/mills/|title=Mills|work=Signs of Reincarnation}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satwant Pasricha]], [[Godwin Samararatne]], and [[Erlendur Haraldsson]], but Stevenson's publications remain the most well-known.

Stevenson conducted more than 2,500 [[case study|case studies]] of young children who claimed to remember past lives over a period of 40 years and published twelve books, including ''[[Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation]]'', [[Reincarnation_and_Biology|Reincarnation and Biology: A Contribution to the Etiology of Birthmarks and Birth Defects, a two-part monograph]] and ''[[Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect]]''. He documented the family's and child's statements along with correlates to a [[deceased]] person he believed matched the child's memory. Stevenson also claimed that some [[birthmark]]s and [[birth defects]] matched wounds and scars on the deceased, sometimes providing [[medical records]] like [[autopsy]] photographs to make his case.&lt;ref&gt;Cadoret, Remi. [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=177497 Book Review: European Cases of the Reincarnation Type] ''The American Journal of Psychiatry'', April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Expecting controversy and [[skepticism]], Stevenson also searched for disconfirming evidence and alternative explanations for the reports, but he argued (not without criticism) that his methods ruled out all possible "normal" explanations for the child’s memories.&lt;ref name="document"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Shroder | first = T | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule | title = Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 2007-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's work in this regard was impressive enough to [[Carl Sagan]] that he referred to what was apparently Stevenson's investigations in his book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' as an example of carefully collected empirical data, though he rejected reincarnation as a parsimonious explanation for the stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Demon Haunted World|author=Sagan, Carl|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=1996|isbn=978-0-394-53512-8|location=|page=300|authorlink=Carl Sagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] cited Stevenson's works in his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'' as part of a body of data that seems to attest to the reality of psychic phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The End of Faith|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|date=September 17, 2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|isbn=0393327655|edition=Reprint|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critical reviews of these claims include work by [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Paul Edwards]] who criticized the accounts of reincarnation as being purely [[anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] and [[Cherry picking|cherry-picked]].&lt;ref name="skepticreport.com"&gt;Rockley, Richard. (2002). [http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=482 "Book Review: Children who Remember Previous Lives"]. SkepticReport. Retrieved 2014-10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Edwards says such stories are attributable to [[selective thinking]], [[suggestion]], and [[false memory syndrome|false memories]] that can result from the family's or researcher's belief systems, and thus cannot be counted as [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher Keith Augustine wrote in critique that the fact that "the vast majority of Stevenson's cases come from countries where a religious belief in reincarnation is strong, and rarely elsewhere, seems to indicate that cultural conditioning (rather than reincarnation) generates claims of spontaneous past-life memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infidels.org/library/modern/keith_augustine/immortality.html|title=The Case Against Immortality|publisher=Infidels.org|accessdate=2014-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, [[Ian Wilson (author)|Ian Wilson]] pointed out that a large number of Stevenson’s cases consisted of poor children remembering wealthy lives or belonging to a [[Caste system in India|higher caste]]. In these societies, claims of reincarnation are sometimes used as schemes to obtain money from the richer families of alleged former incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian Wilson (author)|Wilson, Ian]]. (1981). ''Mind Out of Time: Reincarnation Investigated''. Gollancz. {{ISBN|0-575-02968-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following these types of criticism, Stevenson published a book on ''[[European Cases of the Reincarnation Type]]'' in attempt to show the reports were cross-cultural. Even still, [[Robert A. Baker|Robert Baker]] explained that all the past-life experiences investigated by Stevenson and other parapsychologists are understandable in terms of known psychological factors including a mixture of [[cryptomnesia]] and [[confabulation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert A. Baker|Baker, Robert A]]. (1996). ''Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|0-87975-576-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edwards also noted that reincarnation invokes assumptions that are inconsistent with modern science.&lt;ref&gt;Cogan, Robert. (1998). ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step''. University Press of America. pp. 202–203. {{ISBN|0-7618-1067-6}} "Edwards catalogs common sense objections which have been made against reincarnation. 1) How does a soul exist between bodies? 2) Tertullian's objection: If there is reincarnation, why are not babies born with the mental abilities of adults? 3) Reincarnation claims an infinite series of prior incarnations. Evolution teaches that there was a time when humans did not yet exist. So reincarnation is inconsistent with modern science. 4) If there is reincarnation, then what is happening when the population increases? 5) If there is reincarnation, then why do so few, if any people, remember past lives?... To answer these objections believers in reincarnation must accept additional assumptions... Acceptance of these silly assumptions, Edwards says, amounts to a crucifixion of one's intellect."

* [[Paul Edwards (philosopher)|Edwards, Paul]]. (1996, reprinted in 2001). ''Reincarnation: A Critical Examination''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the vast majority of people do not remember previous lives and there is no empirically documented mechanism known that allows personality to survive death and travel to another body, positing the existence of reincarnation is subject to the principle that "[[extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence]]". Researchers such as Stevenson acknowledged these limitations.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/10/AR2007021001393.html?nav=hcmodule|title=Ian Stevenson; Sought To Document Memories Of Past Lives in Children|last=Shroder|first=Tom|date=2007-02-11|accessdate=2011-12-06|publisher=Washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson also claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of [[xenoglossy]], including two where a subject under hypnosis allegedly conversed with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. [[Sarah Thomason]], a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that "the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sarah Thomason|Thomason, Sarah G.]]. [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~thomason/papers/xenogl.pdf "Xenoglossy"]. In [[Gordon Stein]]. (1996). ''The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sensory processing disorder''' ('''SPD'''; also known as [[Sensory Integration Dysfunction|'''sensory integration dysfunction''')]] describes a condition in which [[multisensory integration]] is not adequately processed in order to provide appropriate responses to the demands of the environment.

[[Sensory integration]] was defined by occupational therapist [[Anna Jean Ayres]] in 1972 as "the neurological process that organizes sensation from one's own body and from the environment and makes it possible to use the body effectively within the environment".&lt;ref name="Ayres 1972"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayres, A.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Symptoms may vary according to the disorder's type and subtype present. SPD can affect one sense or multiple senses. While many people can present one or two symptoms, sensory processing disorder has to have a clear functional impact on the person's life:

''Signs of over-responsivity'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hulle|first=Carol Van|last2=Lemery-Chalfant|first2=Kathryn|last3=Goldsmith|first3=H.

''Signs of under-responsivity'', including sluggishness and lack of responsiveness; and 
''Sensory cravings,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Sarika U.|last2=Horowitz|first2=Lucia|last3=Barbieri-Welge|first3=Rene|last4=Taylor|first4=Julie Lounds|last5=Hundley|first5=Rachel J.|date=2012-02-01|title=Longitudinal follow-up of autism spectrum features and sensory behaviors in Angelman syndrome by deletion class|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02455.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry|language=en|volume=53|issue=2|pages=152–159|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2011.02455.x|issn=1469-7610}}&lt;/ref&gt; including, for example, fidgeting, impulsiveness, and/or seeking or making loud, disturbing noises; ''Sensorimotor-based problems'', including slow and uncoordinated movements or poor handwriting.

''Sensory discrimination problems'', that might manifest themselves in behaviors such as things constantly dropped.

Critics have noted that what proponents claim are symptoms of SPD are both broad and, in some cases, represent very common, and not necessarily abnormal or atypical, childhood characteristics.  The checklist of symptoms on the website of the [https://www.spdstar.org/ SPD Foundation], for example, includes such warning signs as “My infant/toddler has problems eating,” “My child has difficulty being toilet trained,” “My child is in constant motion,” and “My child gets in everyone else's space and/or touches everything around him.” -- "symptoms" which read much like the day-to-day complaints of an average parent.&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Palmer |first1=Brian |title=Get Ready for the Next Big Medical Fight Is sensory processing disorder a real disease? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/02/sensory_processing_disorder_the_debate_over_whether_spd_is_a_real_disease.html |website=Slate |publisher=Slate |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Catherine Lord, a leading autism expert and the director of the [https://www.nyp.org/psychiatry/services/center-for-autism-and-the-developing-brain Center for Autism and the Developing Brain] at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, argues that sensory issues are an important concern, but not a diagnosis in themselves. “I do think there’s a value in attending to how a child is perceiving sensations, thinking about whether he could be uncomfortable. Where I get concerned is labeling that as a separate disorder.”&lt;ref name="Child Mind" /&gt;

Two studies have provided preliminary evidence suggesting that there may be measurable neurological differences between children diagnosed with SPD and control children classified as neurotypical &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Julia|last2=Marco|first2=Elysa|last3=Desai|first3=Shivani|last4=Fourie|first4=Emily|last5=Harris|first5=Julia|last6=Hill|first6=Susanna|last7=Arnett|first7=Anne|last8=Mukherjee|first8=Pratik|title=Abnormal white matter microstructure in children with sensory processing disorders|journal=NeuroImage: Clinical|date=June 17, 2013|volume=2|pages=844–853|doi=10.1016/j.nicl.2013.06.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000776|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or children diagnosed with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chang|first1=Yi-Shin|last2=Owen|first2=Julia|last3=Desai|first3=Shivani|last4=Hill|first4=Susanna|last5=Arnett|first5=Anne|last6=Harris|first6=Julia|last7=Marco|first7=Elysa|last8=Mukherjee|first8=Pratik|title=Autism and Sensory Processing Disorders: Shared White Matter Disruption in Sensory Pathways but Divergent Connectivity in Social-Emotional Pathways|journal=PLOS ONE|date=July 2014|volume=9|issue=7|pages=1–17|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103038|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0103038|accessdate=11 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this evidence, the fact that SPD researchers have yet to agree on a proven, standardized diagnostic tool undermines researchers’ ability to define the boundaries of the disease and makes correlational studies, like the ones about structural brain abnormalities, less convincing.&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt;

== Causes ==
The exact cause of SPD is not known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sensory Processing Disorder |url=https://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/childhood-conditions/sensory-processing-disorder1.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |publisher=InfoSpace Holdings LLC |accessdate=27 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is known that the mid-brain and brain stem regions of the central nervous system are early centers in the processing pathway for multisensory integration; these brain regions are involved in processes including coordination, attention, arousal, and autonomic function.&lt;ref name="Stein 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Barry E. Stein|Stein BE]], Stanford TR, Rowland BA |title=The neural basis of multisensory integration in the midbrain: its organization and maturation |journal=Hear. Res. |volume=258 |issue=1–2 |pages=4–15 |date=December 2009 |pmid=19345256 |pmc=2787841 |doi=10.1016/j.heares.2009.03.012 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After sensory information passes through these centers, it is then routed to brain regions responsible for emotions, memory, and higher level cognitive functions. Damage in any part of the brain involved in multisensory processing can cause difficulties in adequately processing stimuli in a functional way.

=== Research ===
Current research in sensory processing is focused on finding the genetic and neurological causes of SPD.  [[EEG]]&lt;ref name="Davies 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Davies PL, Gavin WJ |title=Validating the diagnosis of sensory processing disorders using EEG technology |journal=Am J Occup Ther |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=176–89 |year=2007 |pmid=17436840 |doi=10.5014/ajot.61.2.176  |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and measuring [[event-related potential]] (ERP) are traditionally used to explore the causes behind the behaviors observed in SPD. Some of the proposed underlying causes by current research are:
EEG recording

* Differences in tactile and auditory over responsivity show moderate genetic influences, with tactile over responsivity demonstrating greater heritability. Bivariate genetic analysis suggested different genetic factors for individual differences in auditory and tactile SOR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=H. H.|last2=Van Hulle|first2=C.

* People with sensory over-responsivity might have increased [[Dopamine receptor D2|D2 receptor]] in the [[striatum]], related to aversion to tactile stimuli and reduced habituation.

* Studies using event-related potentials (ERPs) in children with the sensory over responsivity subtype found atypical neural integration of sensory input. Different neural generators could be activated at an earlier stage of sensory information processing in people with SOR than in typically developing individuals. The automatic association of causally related sensory inputs that occurs at this early sensory-perceptual stage may not function properly in children with SOR. One hypothesis is that multisensory stimulation may activate a higher-level system in frontal cortex that involves attention and cognitive processing, rather than the automatic integration of multisensory stimuli observed in typically developing adults in auditory cortex.&lt;ref name="Brett-Green 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brett-Green BA, Miller LJ, Schoen SA, Nielsen DM |title=An exploratory event-related potential study of multisensory integration in sensory over-responsive children |journal=Brain Res |volume=1321 |issue= |pages=393–407 |date=June 2010 |pmid= |pmc= |doi=10.1016/j.brainres.2010.01.043 |url=http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Brett-Green_et_al%20article_2010.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024223121/http://spdfoundation.net/pdf/Brett-Green_et_al%20article_2010.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Although sensory processing disorder is accepted in the [[Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood]] (DC:0-3R), it is not recognized as a [[mental disorder]] in medical manuals such as the [[ICD-10]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://priory.com/psych/ICD.htm ICD 10]&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[DSM-5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spdfoundation.net/sensory-processing-blog/2012/12/05/final-decision-for-dsm-v/ | title=Final Decision for DSM-V | publisher=Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation | access-date=3 October 2013 | author=Lucy Jane Miller | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214132/http://spdfoundation.net/sensory-processing-blog/2012/12/05/final-decision-for-dsm-v/ | archivedate=4 October 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis is primarily arrived at by the use of standardized tests, standardized questionnaires, expert observational scales, and free play observation at an [[occupational therapy]] gym. Observation of functional activities might be carried at school and home as well.

Depending on the country, diagnosis is made by different professionals, such as [[occupational therapist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, learning specialists, [[Physical therapy|physiotherapists]] and/or [[Speech-language pathology|speech and language therapists]].&lt;ref name="Sensory Integration Network Course"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sensoryintegration.org.uk/course-information-and-booking |title=Course information and booking |work=Sensory Integration Network |access-date=23 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610111334/http://www.sensoryintegration.org.uk/course-information-and-booking |archivedate=10 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries it is recommended to have a full psychological and neurological evaluation if symptoms are too severe.

SMD consists of three subtypes: 

# Sensory over-responsivity.
# Sensory under-responsivity
# Sensory craving/seeking.

''Sensory-based motor disorder (SBMD)''
According to proponents, sensory-based motor disorder shows motor output that is disorganized as a result of incorrect processing of sensory information affecting [[Fear of falling#Postural control|postural control]] challenges, resulting in postural disorder, or [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bair 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bair WN, Kiemel T, Jeka JJ, Clark JE |title=Development of multisensory reweighting is impaired for quiet stance control in children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=e40932 |year=2012 |pmid=22815872 |pmc=3399799 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0040932 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SBMD subtypes are:

# Dyspraxia
# Postural disorder

''Sensory discrimination disorder (SDD)''

Sensory discrimination disorder involves the incorrect processing of sensory information.&lt;ref name="Miller 2007" /&gt;  The SDD subtypes are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3437&amp;context=honors_theses|title=An overview of sensory processing disorder|last1=Lonkar|first1=Heather|website=ScholarWorks at Western Michigan University|publisher=Western Michigan University|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tire Swing.JPG|thumb|Vestibular system is stimulated through hanging equipment such as tire swings]]
The main form of sensory integration therapy is a type of occupational therapy that places a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the [[sense]]s.

During the session, the therapist works closely with the child to provide a level of sensory stimulation that the child can cope with, and encourage movement within the room. Sensory integration therapy is driven by four main principles:

* Just right challenge (the child must be able to successfully meet the challenges that are presented through playful activities)
* Adaptive response (the child adapts his behavior with new and useful strategies in response to the challenges presented)
* Active engagement (the child will want to participate because the activities are fun)
* Child directed (the child's preferences are used to initiate therapeutic experiences within the session)

''Sensory processing therapy''
This therapy retains all of the above-mentioned four principles and adds:&lt;ref name="spdfoundation jan 2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spdfoundation.net/files/2714/2430/1254/Jan-Feb2013_sensorysolutions.pdf|title=The "So What?" of Sensory Integration Therapy: Joie de Vivre|format=pdf|work=Sensory Solutions|date=2013|author1-last=Miller|author1-first=Lucy Jane|author2-last=Collins|author2-first=Britt|accessdate=11 January 2016|publisher=[[Sensory Processing Disorder Foundation]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081554/http://spdfoundation.net/files/2714/2430/1254/Jan-Feb2013_sensorysolutions.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intensity (person attends therapy daily for a prolonged period of time)
* Developmental approach (therapist adapts to the developmental age of the person, against actual age)
* Test-retest systematic evaluation (all clients are evaluated before and after)
* Process driven vs. activity driven (therapist focuses on the "Just right" emotional connection and the process that reinforces the relationship)
* Parent education (parent education sessions are scheduled into the therapy process)
* "joie de vivre" (happiness of life is therapy's main goal, attained through social participation, self-regulation, and self-esteem)
* Combination of best practice interventions (is often accompanied by integrated listening system therapy, floor time, and electronic media such as Xbox Kinect, Nintendo Wii, Makoto II machine training and others)

The treatments themselves may involve a variety of activities and interventions (for example, [[Corrective lenses|prism lenses]]). Children with hypo-reactivity may be exposed to strong sensations such as stroking with a brush, vibrations or rubbing. Play may involve a range of materials to stimulate the senses such as play dough or finger painting.  Children with hyper-reactivity, on the other hand, may be exposed to peaceful activities including quiet music and gentle rocking in a softly lit room. Treats and rewards may be used to encourage children to tolerate activities they would normally avoid.  While occupational therapists using a sensory integration frame of reference work on increasing a child's ability to adequately process sensory input, other OTs may focus on environmental accommodations that parents and school staff can use to enhance the child's function at home, school, and in the community.&lt;ref name="Peske 2005"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nancy Peske |author2=Lindsey Biel |title=Raising a sensory smart child: the definitive handbook for helping your child with sensory integration issues |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-14-303488-X |oclc=     56420392 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sensorysmarts.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sensorysmarts.com/sensory-checklist.pdf |title=Sensory Checklist |format= |work=Raising a Sensory Smart Child |accessdate=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These may include selecting soft, tag-free clothing, avoiding fluorescent lighting, and providing ear plugs for "emergency" use (such as for fire drills).

''Evaluation of treatment effectiveness''

Some of these treatments (for example, sensorimotor handling) have a questionable rationale and no empirical evidence. Other treatments (for example, [[Corrective lenses|prism lenses]], [[Physical therapy|physical exercise]], and [[auditory integration training]]) have had studies with small positive outcomes, but few conclusions can be made about them due to methodological problems with the studies.&lt;ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==

It has been estimated by proponents that up to 16.5% of elementary school aged children present elevated SOR behaviors in the tactile or auditory modalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carter|first=A.

Proponents have also claimed that adults may also show signs of sensory processing difficulties and would benefit for sensory processing therapies,&lt;ref name="Urwin 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urwin R, Ballinger C |title= The Effectiveness of Sensory Integration Therapy to Improve Functional Behaviour in Adults with Learning Disabilities: Five Single-Case Experimental Designs |journal= Brit.

== Controversy ==
There are concerns regarding the validity of the diagnosis. SPD is not included in the [[DSM-5]] or [[ICD-10]], the most widely used diagnostic sources in healthcare. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) states that there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis and recommends caution against using any "sensory" type therapies unless as a part of a comprehensive treatment plan. In fact, in a 2012 statement, the AAP states that "Because there is no universally accepted framework for diagnosis, sensory processing disorder generally should not be diagnosed." When an occupational therapist does recommend sensory integration therapy, the AAP instructs that the therapist is aware that, "parents should be informed that the amount of research regarding the effectiveness of sensory integration therapy is limited and inconclusive." As such, most health insurance considers sensory integration therapy to be "investigational" and will not cover it. In the United States and UK, sensory processing disorder is not likely to qualify an individual for disability benefits, so the supporters of sensory processing disorder recommend having a child diagnosed for a related disorder that will qualify them for disability insurance.  As was noted above, a 2015 review of research on Sensory Integration Therapy (SIT) concluded that SIT is "ineffective and that its theoretical underpinnings and assessment practices are unvalidated", that SIT techniques exist "outside the bounds of established evidence-based practice", and that SIT is "quite possibly a misuse of limited resources".&lt;ref name="Fads" /&gt;

=== Manuals ===
SPD is in [[Stanley Greenspan]]'s ''Diagnostic Manual for Infancy and Early Childhood'' and as '''Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing''' part of ''The Zero to Three's Diagnostic Classification''. but is not recognized in the manuals [[ICD-10]] or in the recently updated [[DSM-5]]. However, unusual reactivity to sensory input or unusual interest in sensory aspects is included as a possible but not necessary criterion for the diagnosis of autism.

=== Misdiagnosis ===
Some state that sensory processing disorder is a distinct diagnosis, while others argue that differences in sensory responsiveness are features of other diagnoses and it is not a standalone diagnosis. The neuroscientist [[David Eagleman]] has proposed that SPD may be a form of [[synesthesia]], a perceptual condition in which the [[Sense|senses]] are blended.Specifically, Eagleman suggests that instead of a sensory input "connecting to [a person's] color area [in the brain], it's connecting to an area involving pain or aversion or nausea".

Researchers have described a treatable inherited [[Hypokalemic sensory overstimulation|sensory overstimulation disorder]] that meets diagnostic criteria for both attention deficit disorder and sensory integration dysfunction.

=== Distinguishing SPD from Autism ===
Recent studies have helped to physiologically differentiate typically developing children from children with SPD, and from children with autism. Approximately 1% of the United States child population has been diagnosed with autism, while approximately 5-16% of children have been found to have difficulty processing sensory input. In a recent study performed by Owen et al., diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to exam white matter tracts in a group of children with sensory processing disorder compared to a group of typically developing children. Results of the study showed less white matter microstructure, particularly in the posterior cerebrum, in the children with SPD compared to the typically developing children. This finding illustrates a physiological variation in an area of the brain that involves sensory processing and integration, which may help to explain some of the challenges children with SPD have. This particular study suggested that DTI may be used in the diagnosis and differentiation of SPD and autism.

In a follow-up study pertaining to differentiation of SPD from autism, Chang et al. examined white matter tract differences in a group of children with SPD compared to a group of children with autism, and also in relation to a group of typically developing children. The results of this study showed significantly less white matter connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes in the children with SPD and ASD compared to the typically developing children. As stated above, these connections play a large part in sensory perception and integration. However, the study only found reduced connectivity in the temporal lobe of the group of children with ASD. This area of the brain contributes to social-emotional processing. These findings reveal a significant association between white matter circuitry and cognitive progressing, particularly in the areas of auditory integration, social skills, memory, and attention. These findings may help guide treatment and provide more personalized interventions for children with SPD, ASD, and other diagnoses. However, more research needs to be done with larger groups and more attention to other neural circuitry changes. 

== Society ==
The American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) supports the use of a variety of methods of sensory integration for those with sensory processing disorder. The organization has supported the need for further research to increase insurance coverage for related therapies. They have also made efforts to educate the public about sensory integration therapy. The AOTA's practice guidelines currently support the use of sensory integration therapy and interprofessional education and collaboration in order to optimize treatment for those with sensory processing disorder. The AOTA provides several resources pertaining to sensory integration therapy, some of which includes a fact sheet, new research, and continuing education opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sensory Integration|url=https://www.aota.org/practice/children-youth/si.aspx|website=The American Occupational Therapy Association, Inc.|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sensory processing disorder as a specific form of atypical functioning was first described by occupational therapist [[Anna Jean Ayres]] (1920–1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensory integration and the child : understanding hidden sensory challenge 25th Anniversary Edition|last1=Ayres|first1=A. Jean.|last2=Robbins|first2=Jeff|publisher=WPS|year=2005|isbn=978-0-87424-437-3|location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=63189804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Original model''

Ayres's theoretical framework for what she called Sensory Integration Dysfunction was developed after six factor analytic studies of populations of children with learning disabilities, perceptual motor disabilities and normal developing children.&lt;ref name="Bundy Lane 2002"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sensory integration, Theory and practice|last1=Bundy|first1=Anita. C.|last2=Lane|first2=J. Shelly|last3=Murray|first3=Elizabeth A.|publisher=FA Davis Company|year=2002|isbn=0-8036-0545-5|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayres created the following [[nosology]] based on the patterns that appeared on her factor analysis: 
*Dyspraxia: poor [[motor planning]] (more related to the vestibular system and proprioception)
*Poor bilateral integration: inadequate use of both sides of the body simultaneously 
*Tactile defensiveness: negative reaction to tactile stimuli
*Visual perceptual deficits: poor form and space perception and visual motor functions
*Somatodyspraxia: poor motor planning (related to poor information coming from the tactile and proprioceptive systems)
*Auditory-language problems

Both visual perceptual and auditory language deficits were thought to possess a strong cognitive component and a weak relationship to underlying sensory processing deficits, so they are not considered central deficits in many models of sensory processing.

In 1998, Mulligan found a similar pattern of deficits in a confirmatory factor analytic study.&lt;ref name="Mulligan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mulligan|first1=Shelley|date=1998|title=Patterns of Sensory Integration Dysfunction: A Confirmatory Factor Analysis|url=https://ajot.aota.org/article.aspx?articleid=1862615|journal=American Journal of Occupational Therapy|volume=52|issue=November/December|pages=819–828|accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith Roley|first=Susanne|author2=Zoe Mailloux|author3=Heather Miller-Kuhaneck|author4=Tara Glennon|date=September 2007|title=Understanding Ayres Sensory Integration|url=http://www.pediatrictherapy.com/images/content/208.pdf|deadurl=yes|journal=OT PRACTICE|series=17|volume=12|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824070724/http://www.pediatrictherapy.com/images/content/208.pdf|archivedate=24 August 2014|accessdate=19 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#Sensation avoiding: low threshold and active response. Individuals actively limit their exposure to sensations and are therefore high self regulators.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

''Sensory processing model''

In Miller's nosology  "sensory integration dysfunction" was renamed into "Sensory processing disorder" to facilitate coordinated research work with other fields such as  neurology since "the use of the term sensory integration often applies to a neurophysiologic cellular process rather than a behavioral response to sensory input as connoted by Ayres."&lt;ref name="Miller 2007"/&gt;

'''''Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior''''' is a book concerning the [[Shambhala Buddhist]] vision of founder [[Chögyam Trungpa]].  The book discusses addressing personal and societal problems through the application of secular concepts such as [[basic goodness]], warriorship, bravery, and egolessness as a means toward the creation of what he calls "enlightened society". Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society.

The government should be able to receive and process this [[information]] without imposing undue constraints on how businesses administer their finances.

The method used to achieve this goal is to define a "common language" (or [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]]) using appropriate standards such as [[XBRL]], [[XML]] and [[JSON]], then provide systems to process information classified under the taxonomy.

== History ==

The '''Dutch Taxonomy Project''' ('''Nederlandse Taxonomie Project''') or '''NTP''' began in 2004 as part of the Dutch [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]’s objectives to reduce the administrative burdens on businesses. The project was sponsored jointly by the Dutch Ministries of Finance and Justice. The NTP created an XBRL taxonomy that "enables businesses to generate the required reporting information directly from their own records and the government to then process this information efficiently and effectively".&lt;ref name="NTP"&gt;van Burg et al, Foreword, p iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dutch approach was adopted by the [[Australian government]] in 2006, which established the '''Standard Business Reporting''' (SBR) Program. In addition to Australia, other countries (including New Zealand) are also planning to apply this approach. This approach has since been internationally designated as ''Standard Business Reporting''.

In December 2008, the Dutch government decided to rename the NTP to the Standard Business Reporting (SBR) Programme, thus adopting the name introduced by Australia. The Dutch SBR programme has been tasked with deepening and embedding the results obtained so far and broadening the scope to other domains and applications.&lt;ref&gt;van Burg et al, p 1&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2017, the [http://www.datafoundation.org/ Data Foundation] and [https://www.pwc.com/us/en.html PwC] published a research report explaining how the adoption of '''Standard Business Reporting''' (SBR) in the United States would reduce costs for both companies and agencies. The report, "Standard Business Reporting: Open Data to Cut Compliance Costs", defines SBR as multiple regulatory agencies adopting a common open data structure for the information they collect. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.datafoundation.org/standard-business-reporting-2017/  “Standard Business Reporting 2017.” Data Foundation.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementations ==

=== Dutch Implementation ===

As of the first of January 2007, businesses and intermediaries can report their financial data to the government using the Dutch XBRL taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Dutch Taxonomy Project, home page&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australian Implementation ===

The 2006 report of the ''Taskforce on Reducing Regulatory Burdens on Business'', "Rethinking Regulation" (the Banks report), recognised that government reporting requirements impose a significant burden on Australian business.

The objective of the SBR Program in Australia is to reduce the cost of reporting for business by A$800&amp;nbsp;million over six years at a cost of A$320&amp;nbsp;million over the same period.&lt;ref name="Hodgson"&gt;Hodgson, p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The key activity of the SBR Program is to work across agencies and jurisdictions to standardise the reporting approach and language – developing the taxonomy. As well as the reporting language,  SBR is developing a new e-channel for business which will include a single sign-on to on-line services across the agencies that are in scope.

==== Scope ====

The agencies in scope are:
* [[Australian Tax Office]] (ATO)
* [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] (ABS)
* [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC)
* [[Australian Prudential Regulation Authority]] (APRA)
* State and Territory Revenue Offices (8 of them)

More than 75 government forms are in scope to be rationalised and replaced by electronic lodgments.

==== Planned Solution ====

The Australian SBR solution is planned to be developed as follows:
* Rationalise and harmonise the reporting terms and definitions in use
* Develop a Reporting Taxonomy
* Map the Reporting Taxonomy to a [[chart of accounts]] (provided via a software package)
* Develop IT capabilities and infrastructure, including:
** Whole of Government authentication/single sign on process; and
** System for secure on-line interactions
* Connect government systems to the IT capabilities and infrastructure
* Connect businesses to government systems via third-party software

==== Business Advisory Forum ====

The SBR program also created the SBR Business Advisory Forum as a way to provide ongoing consultation to the project. It is made up of 18 representatives drawn from [[Trade association|industry groups]] (e.g. [[Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosboa.org/ Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional associations]] (e.g. [[CPA Australia]]) and the SBR program itself.

=== NZ implementation ===

In May 2008 the New Zealand [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]] published a [[business case]] for adopting an SBR program. The business case states that success relies on a high take-up rate by intermediaries such as accountants and lawyers. This is because many owner-operators and small businesses (68% and 21% of businesses, respectively) conduct their reporting via these third parties.&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt;

The business case states that "SBR will deliver [[compliance cost]] reductions to business by reducing the need for them to submit information to multiple agencies, standardising data definitions and implementing a standard communication language.".&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3124">The '''subjective character of experience''' is a term in psychology and the [[philosophy of mind]] denoting that all [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[phenomena]] are associated with a single [[perspective (cognitive)|point of view]] ("[[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]]"). The term was coined and illuminated by [[Thomas Nagel]] in his famous paper "[[What Is it Like to Be a Bat?]]"&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas (1974) '''What is It Like to Be a Bat?''' ''The Philosophical Review'' LXXXIII, 4 (October): 435–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nagel argues that, because bats are apparently [[conscious]] [[mammals]] with a way of perceiving their environment entirely different from that of [[human beings]], it is impossible to speak of "what is it like to ''be'' a bat ''for'' the bat" or, while the example of the bat is particularly illustrative, any conscious species, as each organism has a unique point of view from which no other organism can gather [[experience]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} To Nagel, the subjective character of experience implies the [[Cognitive closure (philosophy)|cognitive closure]] of the human [[mind]] to some facts, specifically the [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]]s that [[Human body|physical states]] create.

==Subjective reality==
{{Section OR|date=May 2014}}
Subjective character of experience implies that the perception of all things, concepts, and "truths" in the universe differs between individuals: we all live in different worlds, each of which may have things in common, because of our unique perspectives on our worlds. The only thing to which one can hold oneself is something one has experienced or perceived. Until someone has had an experience of something the object or concept within itself is not "real." Someone in Africa is aware of the existence of fire and sees it but for an Inuit who has never seen fire before the fire does not exist in the same way. The idea of the subjectivity of one's "reality" also hints at an aspect of [[moral relativism]], that each person's opinions are the only things they can hold themselves to.

==Dual-subjective reality==
{{Section OR|date=May 2014}}
A dual-subjective reality arises when an individual's mind interprets information and, instead of creating only one interpretation that the conscious mind can make sense of, creates several. These differing "realities" then cause conflict in that individual who may confuse what is actually happening around them with alternative realities formulated in their mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10227">In [[mathematics]], a '''symmetric tensor''' is a [[tensor]] that is invariant under a [[permutation]] of its vector arguments:
:&lt;math&gt;T(v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_r) = T(v_{\sigma 1},v_{\sigma 2},\ldots,v_{\sigma r})&lt;/math&gt;
for every permutation ''&amp;sigma;'' of the symbols {{nowrap|{1, 2, ..., ''r''}.}}
Alternatively, a symmetric tensor of order ''r'' represented in coordinates as a quantity with ''r'' indices satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_r} = T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma r}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The space of symmetric tensors of order ''r'' on a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] is [[natural isomorphism|naturally isomorphic]] to the dual of the space of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree ''r'' on ''V''.  Over [[field (mathematics)|fields]] of [[characteristic zero]], the [[graded vector space]] of all symmetric tensors can be naturally identified with the [[symmetric algebra]] on ''V''. A related concept is that of the [[antisymmetric tensor]] or [[alternating form]]. Symmetric tensors occur widely in [[engineering]], [[physics]] and [[mathematics]].

==Definition==
Let ''V'' be a vector space and
:&lt;math&gt;T\in V^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt;
a tensor of order ''k''.  Then ''T'' is a symmetric tensor if
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_\sigma T = T\,&lt;/math&gt;
for the [[Tensor product#Tensor powers and braiding|braiding maps]] associated to every permutation &amp;sigma; on the symbols {1,2,...,''k''} (or equivalently for every [[Transposition (mathematics)|transposition]] on these symbols).

Given a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] {''e''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} of ''V'', any symmetric tensor ''T'' of rank ''k'' can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i_1,\ldots,i_k=1}^N T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k} e^{i_1} \otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for some unique list of coefficients &lt;math&gt;T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}&lt;/math&gt; (the ''components'' of the tensor in the basis) that are symmetric on the indices.  That is to say

:&lt;math&gt;T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}} = T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}&lt;/math&gt;

for every [[permutation]] &amp;sigma;.

The space of all symmetric tensors of order ''k'' defined on ''V'' is often denoted by ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') or Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'').  It is itself a vector space, and if ''V'' has dimension ''N'' then  the dimension of Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') is the [[binomial coefficient]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dim\operatorname{Sym}^k(V) = {N + k - 1 \choose k}.&lt;/math&gt;

We then construct Sym(''V'') as the [[direct sum of vector spaces|direct sum]] of Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'') for ''k'' = 0,1,2,…
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}(V)= \bigoplus_{k=0}^\infty \operatorname{Sym}^k(V).&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
There are many examples of symmetric tensors. Some include, the [[metric tensor]], &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, the [[Einstein tensor]], &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;.

Many [[material properties]] and [[field (physics)|fields]] used in physics and engineering can be represented as symmetric tensor fields; for example: [[stress (physics)|stress]], [[strain tensor|strain]], and [[anisotropic]] [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]. Also, in [[diffusion MRI]] one often uses symmetric tensors to describe diffusion in the brain or other parts of the body.

Ellipsoids are examples of [[algebraic varieties]]; and so, for general rank,  symmetric tensors, in the guise of [[homogeneous polynomial]]s, are used to define [[projective varieties]], and are often studied as such.

==Symmetric part of a tensor==
Suppose &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a vector space over a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0.  If {{nowrap|''T'' &amp;isin; ''V''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;otimes;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a tensor of order &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then the symmetric part of &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetric tensor defined by
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}\, T = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_k} \tau_\sigma T,&lt;/math&gt;
the summation extending over the [[symmetric group]] on ''k'' symbols.  In terms of a basis, and employing the [[Einstein summation convention]], if
:&lt;math&gt;T = T_{i_1i_2\cdots i_k}e^{i_1}\otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k},&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Sym}\, T = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}} e^{i_1}\otimes e^{i_2}\otimes\cdots \otimes e^{i_k}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the tensor appearing on the right are often denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;T_{(i_1i_2\cdots i_k)} = \frac{1}{k!}\sum_{\sigma\in \mathfrak{S}_k} T_{i_{\sigma 1}i_{\sigma 2}\cdots i_{\sigma k}}&lt;/math&gt;

with parentheses () around the indices being symmetrized. Square brackets [] are used to indicate anti-symmetrization.

==Symmetric product==
If ''T'' is a simple tensor, given as a pure tensor product
:&lt;math&gt;T=v_1\otimes v_2\otimes\cdots \otimes v_r&lt;/math&gt;
then the symmetric part of ''T'' is the symmetric product of the factors:
:&lt;math&gt;v_1\odot v_2\odot\cdots\odot v_r := \frac{1}{r!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}_r} v_{\sigma 1}\otimes v_{\sigma 2}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma r}.&lt;/math&gt;

In general we can turn Sym(''V'') into an [[algebra]] by defining the commutative and associative product ⊙.&lt;ref name="Kostrikin1997"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given two tensors {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}} and {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;isin; Sym&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;(''V'')}}, we use the symmetrization operator to define:
:&lt;math&gt;T_1\odot T_2 = \operatorname{Sym}(T_1\otimes T_2)\quad\left(\in\operatorname{Sym}^{k_1+k_2}(V)\right).&lt;/math&gt;
It can be verified (as is done by Kostrikin and Manin&lt;ref name="Kostrikin1997" /&gt;) that the resulting product is in fact commutative and associative. In some cases the operator is omitted: {{nowrap|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊙ ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.

In some cases an exponential notation is used:
:&lt;math&gt;v^{\odot k} = \underbrace{v \odot v \odot \cdots \odot v}_{k\text{ times}}=\underbrace{v \otimes v \otimes \cdots \otimes v}_{k\text{ times}}=v^{\otimes k}.&lt;/math&gt;
Where ''v'' is a vector.
Again, in some cases the ⊙ is left out:
:&lt;math&gt;v^k=\underbrace{v\,v\,\cdots\,v}_{k\text{ times}}=\underbrace{v\odot v\odot\cdots\odot v}_{k\text{ times}}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Decomposition==
In analogy with the theory of [[symmetric matrix|symmetric matrices]], a (real) symmetric tensor of order 2 can be "diagonalized".  More precisely, for any tensor ''T''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;Sym&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''V''), there are an integer ''r'', non-zero unit vectors ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''v''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;''V'' and weights ''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''&amp;lambda;''&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i \, v_i\otimes v_i.&lt;/math&gt;
The minimum number ''r'' for which such a decomposition is possible is the (symmetric) rank of ''T''.  The vectors appearing in this minimal expression are the ''[[Principal axis theorem|principal axes]]'' of the tensor, and generally have an important physical meaning. For example, the principal axes of the [[inertia tensor]] define the [[Poinsot's ellipsoid]] representing the moment of inertia. Also see [[Sylvester's law of inertia]].

For symmetric tensors of arbitrary order ''k'', decompositions
:&lt;math&gt;T = \sum_{i=1}^r \lambda_i \, v_i^{\otimes k}&lt;/math&gt;
are also possible. The minimum number ''r'' for which such a decomposition is possible is the ''symmetric'' [[Tensor (intrinsic definition)#Tensor rank|rank]] of ''T''.&lt;ref name="Comon2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Comon | first1 = P. | last2 = Golub | first2 = G. | last3 = Lim | first3 = L.

For second-order tensors this corresponds to the rank of the matrix representing the tensor in any basis, and it is well known that the maximum rank is equal to the dimension of the underlying vector space. However, for higher orders this need not hold: the rank can be higher than the number of dimensions in the underlying vector space. Moreover, the rank and symmetric rank of a symmetric tensor may differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shitov|first=Yaroslav|date=2018|title=A Counterexample to Comon's Conjecture|url=https://epubs.siam.org/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2F10.1137%2F17M1131970|journal=SIAM Journal on Applied Algebra and Geometry|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=3|pages=428–443|doi=10.1137/17m1131970|issn=2470-6566|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about||biological taxonomy|Taxonomy (biology)|other uses|Taxonomy (disambiguation)}}

'''Taxonomy''' is the practice and science of classification. The word is also used as a [[count noun]]: '''a taxonomy''', or '''taxonomic scheme''', is a particular [[categorization|classification]]. The word finds its roots in the [[Greek language]] {{Lang|grc|τάξις}}, ''taxis'' (meaning 'order', 'arrangement') and {{Lang|grc|νόμος}}, ''nomos'' ('law' or 'science'). Originally, ''taxonomy'' referred only to the classification of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification. Taxonomy is different from [[meronomy]] which is dealing with the classification of parts of a whole.

Many taxonomies have a [[hierarchical]] structure, but this is not a requirement. Taxonomy uses taxonomic units, known as '''taxa''' (singular [[taxon]]).

==Applications==
Wikipedia categories illustrate a taxonomy&lt;ref&gt;Zirn, Cäcilia, Vivi Nastase and Michael Strube. 2008. [http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140111074556/http://www.h%2Dits.org/english/research/nlp/papers/zirn08.pdf "Distinguishing Between Instances and Classes in the Wikipedia Taxonomy"] [http://videolectures.net/eswc08_zirn_dbi/ (video lecture).] 5th Annual [[European Semantic Web Conference]] (ESWC 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; and a full taxonomy of Wikipedia categories can be extracted by automatic means.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ponzetto and M. Strube. 2007. [https://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2007/AAAI07-228.pdf "Deriving a large scale taxonomy from Wikipedia"]. Proc. of the 22nd Conference on the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Vancouver, B.C., Canada, pp. 1440-1445.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, it has been shown that a manually-constructed taxonomy, such as that of computational lexicons like [[WordNet]], can be used to improve and restructure the Wikipedia category taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;S. Ponzetto, R. Navigli. 2009. [http://ijcai.org/papers09/Papers/IJCAI09-343.pdf "Large-Scale Taxonomy Mapping for Restructuring and Integrating Wikipedia"]. Proc. of the 21st International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2009), Pasadena, California, pp. 2083-2088.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a broader sense, taxonomy also applies to relationship schemes other than parent-child hierarchies, such as [[Network (mathematics)|network structure]]s. Taxonomies may then include single children with multi-parents, for example, "Car" might appear with both parents "Vehicle" and "Steel Mechanisms"; to some however, this merely means that 'car' is a part of several different taxonomies.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Joab. [http://gcn.com/Articles/2004/02/03/Taxonomys-not-just-design-its-an-art.aspx?Page=1&amp;p=1 "Taxonomy's not just design, it's an art,"] ''Government Computer News'' (Washington, D.C.). September 2, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; A taxonomy might also simply be organization of kinds of things into groups, or an alphabetical list; here, however, the term vocabulary is more appropriate. In current usage within [[knowledge management]], taxonomies are considered narrower than [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]] since ontologies apply a larger variety of relation types.&lt;ref&gt;Suryanto, Hendra and Paul Compton. [http://ol2000.aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de/final/HSuryanto_5.pdf "Learning classification taxonomies from a classification knowledge based system."] [[University of Karlsruhe]]; [http://www.greenchameleon.com/gc/blog_detail/defining_taxonomy/ "Defining 'Taxonomy',"] Straights Knowledge website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematically, a hierarchical taxonomy is a [[tree structure]] of classifications for a given set of objects. It is also named [[containment hierarchy]]. At the top of this structure is a single classification, the root node, that applies to all objects. Nodes below this root are more specific classifications that apply to subsets of the total set of classified objects. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the general to the more specific.

By contrast, in the context of legal terminology, an open-ended contextual taxonomy is employed—a taxonomy holding only with respect to a specific context. In scenarios taken from the legal domain, a formal account of the open-texture of legal terms is modeled, which suggests varying notions of the "core" and "penumbra" of the meanings of a concept. The progress of reasoning proceeds from the specific to the more general.&lt;ref&gt;Grossi, Davide, [[Frank Dignum]] and John-Jules Charles Meyer. (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/9yj2lfa5cy67c78m/fulltext.pdf?page=1 "Contextual Taxonomies" in ''Computational Logic in Multi-Agent Systems,'' pp. 33-51].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[cultural anthropology|Anthropologists]] have observed that taxonomies are generally embedded in local cultural and social systems, and serve various social functions. Perhaps the most well-known and influential study of [[folk taxonomy|folk taxonomies]] is [[Émile Durkheim]]'s ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life''. A more recent treatment of folk taxonomies (including the results of several decades of empirical research) and the discussion of their relation to the scientific taxonomy can be found in [[Scott Atran]]'s ''Cognitive Foundations of Natural History.'' Folk taxonomies of organisms have been found in large part to agree with scientific classification, at least for the larger and more obvious species, which means that it is not the case that folk taxonomies are based purely on utilitarian characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution, Order and Complexity|author1=Kenneth Boulding |author2=Elias Khalil |publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=9780203013151|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N-OUCDi8SS8C&amp;dq=Durkheim+folk+taxonomy}} p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century the German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]], following the work of the thirteenth-century Majorcan philosopher [[Ramon Llull#Ars generalis ultima (Ars Magna)|Ramon Llull]] on his ''Ars generalis ultima'', a system for procedurally generating concepts by combining a fixed set of ideas, sought to develop an [[alphabet of human thought]]. Leibniz intended his ''[[characteristica universalis]]'' to be an "algebra" capable of expressing all conceptual thought. The concept of creating such a "[[universal language]]" was frequently examined in the 17th century, also notably by the English philosopher [[John Wilkins]] in his work ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'' (1668), from which the classification scheme in [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]'s [[Thesaurus]] ultimately derives.

==Use of taxonomies in various disciplines==
=== Taxonomies in software engineering ===
Vegas et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vegas|first1=S.|title=Maturing software engineering knowledge through classifications: A case study on unit testing techniques.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|date=2009|volume=35|issue=4|pages=551–565|doi=10.1109/TSE.2009.13|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4775907/}}&lt;/ref&gt; make a compelling case to advance the knowledge in the field of software engineering through the use of taxonomies. Similarly, Ore et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ore|first1=S.|title=Critical success factors taxonomy for software process deployment|journal=Software quality journal|date=2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=21-48|doi=10.1007/s11219-012-9190-y|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11219-012-9190-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide a systematic methodology to approach taxonomy building in software engineering related topics.

==== Software testing taxonomies ====
Several taxonomies have been proposed in software testing research to classify techniques, tools, concepts and artifacts. The following are some example taxonomies: 
# A taxonomy of model-based testing techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Utting|first1=Mark|title=A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches|journal=Software Testing, Verification &amp; Reliability|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=297-312|doi=10.1002/stvr.456|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2344870}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A taxonomy of static-code analysis tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=Jernej|title=Taxonomy of static code analysis tools|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd international convention MIPRO|pages=418-422|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5512516/5533310/05533417.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engström et al.&lt;ref name="EngstromPAB16"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engström|first1=Emelie|title=SERP-test: a taxonomy for supporting industry–academia communication|journal=Software Quality Journal|date=2016|pages=1-37|doi=10.1007/s11219-016-9322-x|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11219-016-9322-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest and evaluate the use of a taxonomy to bridge the communication between researchers and practitioners engaged in the area of software testing. They have also developed a web-based tool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://serpconnect.cs.lth.se/|title=SERP-connect}}&lt;/ref&gt; to facilitate and encourage the use the taxonomy. The tool and its source code are available for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engstrom|first1=Emelie|url=https://github.com/emenlu/connect|title=SERP-connect backend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taxonomies in research publishing ===
Citing inadequacies with current practices in listing authors of papers in medical research journals, Drummond Rennie and co-authors called in a 1997 article in ''JAMA'', the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' for 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''a radical conceptual and systematic change, to reﬂect the realities of multiple authorship and to buttress accountability. We propose dropping the outmoded notion of author in favor of the more useful and realistic one of contributor.''&lt;ref name="CRediT"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brand |first1=Amy |last2=Allen |first2=Liz |last3=Altman |first3=Micah |last4=Hlava |first4=Marjorie |last5=Scott |first5=Jo |title=Beyond authorship: attribution, contribution, collaboration, and credit |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1087/20150211 |website=Wiley Online Library |publisher=Learned Publishing 28 (2) |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=CRediT |format=online |doi=10.1087/20150211|date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}}  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Since 2012, several major academic and scientific publishing bodies have mounted ''Project CRediT'' to develop a [[controlled vocabulary]] of contributor roles.&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT"&gt;{{cite web |title=CRediT |url=http://docs.casrai.org/CRediT |website=CASRAI |publisher=[[CASRAI]] |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=CASRAI_CRediT |format=online |date=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as ''[[CRediT]] (Contributor Roles Taxonomy)'', this is an example of a flat, non-hierarchical taxonomy; however, it does include an optional, broad classification of the degree of contribution: ''lead'', ''equal'' or ''supporting''.  [[Amy Brand]] and co-authors summarise their intended outcome as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Identifying specific contributions to published research will lead to appropriate credit, fewer author disputes, and fewer disincentives to collaboration and the sharing of data and code. &lt;ref name="CRediT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|151}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As of mid-2018, this taxonomy apparently restricts its scope to ''research outputs'', specifically journal articles; however, it does rather unusually "hope to … support identification of peer reviewers".&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT" /&gt;  (As such, it has not yet defined terms for such roles as editor or author of a chapter in a ''book'' of research results.)  Version 1, established by the first Working Group in the (northern) autumn of 2014, identifies 14 specific contributor roles using the following defined terms:
*Conceptualization 
*Methodology 
*Software 
*Validation 
*Formal Analysis 
*Investigation
*Resources 
*Data curation 
*Writing – Original Draft 
*Writing – Review &amp; Editing 
*Visualization 
*Supervision 
*Project Administration 
*Funding acquisition 

Reception has been mixed, with several major publishers and journals planning to have implemented CRediT by the end of 2018, whilst almost as many aren't persuaded of the need or value of using it.  For example,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The [[National Academy of Sciences]] has created a ''TACS (Transparency in Author Contributions in Science)'' webpage to list the journals that commit to setting authorship standards, defining responsibilities for corresponding authors, requiring ORCID iDs, and adopting the CRediT taxonomy.&lt;ref name="NAS_TACS"&gt;{{cite web |title=Transparency in Author Contributions in Science (TACS) |url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/Transparency_Author_Contributions.html |website=National Academy of Sciences |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |accessdate=13 June 2018 |ref=NAS_TACS |format=online |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same webpage has a table listing 21 journals (or families of journals), of which:
* 5 have, or by end 2018 will have, implemented CRediT,
* 6 require an author contribution statement and suggest using CRediT,
* 8 don't use CRediT, of which 3 give reasons for not doing so, and
* 2 are uninformative.

The taxonomy is an open standard conforming to the [[OpenStand]] principles&lt;ref name="OpenStand"&gt;{{cite web |title=OpenStand |url=https://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/ |website=OpenStand |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and is published under a [[Creative Commons]] licence.&lt;ref name="CASRAI_CRediT" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

=== '''Taxonomy for the web''' ===
Websites with a good designed taxonomy or hierarchy is easily understood by users, due to their possibility to develop a mental model of the site structure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/86110226|title=Information architecture for the World Wide Web|last=Peter.|first=Morville,|date=2007|publisher=O'Reilly|others=Rosenfeld, Louis., Rosenfeld, Louis.|isbn=9780596527341|edition=3rd ed|location=Sebastopol, CA|oclc=86110226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== '''Guidelines for writing taxonomy for the web:''' ====

* Mutually exclusive categories can be beneficial. If categories appear several places, it’s called cross-listing or polyhierarchical. The hierarchy will lose its value if cross-listing appears too often. Cross-listing often appears when working with ambiguous categories that fits more than one place.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
* Having a balance between breadth and depth in the taxonomy is beneficial. Too many options (breadth), will overload the users by giving them too many choices. At the same time having a too narrow structure, with more than two or three levels to click-through, will make users frustrated and might give up.  &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
==Is-a and has-a relationships==
{{expand section|date=April 2013}}
Two of the predominant types of relationships in [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|knowledge-representation]] systems are [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predication]] and the universally quantified [[Indicative conditional|conditional]]. Predication relationships express the notion that an individual entity is an example of a certain type (for example, ''John is a bachelor''), while universally quantified conditionals express the notion that a type is a subtype of another type (for example, ''A dog is a mammal'', which means the same as ''All dogs are mammals'').&lt;ref name=Brachman&gt;[[Ronald J. Brachman]]; [http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bibtex/journals/computer/Brachman83 What IS-A is and isn't. An Analysis of Taxonomic Links in Semantic Networks].

Another way to describe the effect is the aphorism "the appetite grows by what it feeds on".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=Richard |last2= |first2= |date=July 1987 |title= Citizenship and Employment in an Age of High Technology |url= |journal=British Journal of Industrial Relations |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |volume= 25 |issue=02 |pages=201–225  |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8543.1987.tb00709.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, after greater [[social justice]] is achieved, there may be more fervent opposition to even smaller social injustices than before.

The effect suggests a link between [[social equality]] or concessions by the regime and [[unintended consequences]], as social reforms can raise expectations that can't be matched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vernon |first=Ronald |last2= |first2= |date=February 1979 |title= Unintended Consequences |url= |journal=Political Theory |publisher=Sage Publications |volume= 07 |issue=01 |pages=57–73  |jstor=190824 |doi=10.1177/009059177900700104}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Tocqueville effect, a [[revolution]] is likely to occur after an improvement in social conditions in contrast to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s theory of progressive immiseration of the proletariat (deterioration of conditions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Elster |first=Jon |date=2011 |title=Tocqueville: The Ancien Régime and the French Revolution |url= |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=xv |isbn=1139498819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, political scientist [[James Chowning Davies]] has proposed a [[J curve#Political science (model of revolutions)|J curve of revolutions]] which contends that periods of wealth and advancement are followed by periods of worsening conditions, leading to a revolution.

== Origin ==
Alexis de Tocqueville first described the phenomenon in his book ''[[Democracy in America]]'' (1840):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The hatred that men bear to privilege increases in proportion as privileges become fewer and less considerable, so that democratic passions would seem to burn most fiercely just when they have least fuel. I have already given the reason for this phenomenon. When all conditions are unequal, no inequality is so great as to offend the eye, whereas the slightest dissimilarity is odious in the midst of general uniformity; the more complete this uniformity is, the more insupportable the sight of such a difference becomes. Hence it is natural that the love of equality should constantly increase together with equality itself, and that it should grow by what it feeds on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Tocqueville |first= Alexis de |authorlink1= |title= Democracy in America|year= 1840 |publisher= Saunders and Otley |location= London | chapter = Chapter III: That the sentiments of democratic nations accord with their opinions in leading them to concentrate political power | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=0EPSjMel_-kC&amp;pg=PA106 |page= 272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The reform and revolution paradox was explained in his next book, ''[[The Old Regime and the Revolution]]'' (1856):&lt;ref name="Finkel and Gehlbach" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The regime that a revolution destroys is almost always better than the one that immediately preceded it, and experience teaches that the most dangerous time for a bad government is usually when it begins to reform.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

are multivariate distributions with uniform univariate margins. Representing a joint distribution as univariate margins plus copulas allows the separation of the problems of estimating univariate distributions from the problems of estimating dependence. This is handy in as much as univariate distributions in many cases can be adequately estimated from data, whereas dependence information is rough known, involving summary indicators and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the number of parametric multivariate copula families with flexible dependence is limited, there are many parametric families of bivariate copulas. Regular vines owe their increasing popularity to the fact that they leverage from bivariate copulas and enable extensions to arbitrary dimensions.

== Historical origins ==
The first regular vine, avant la lettre, was introduced by Harry Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last1 = Joe |first1 = H.

The motive was to extend parametric bivariate extreme value copula families to higher dimensions. To this end he introduced what would later be called the ''D-vine''. Joe

was interested in a class of n-variate distributions with given one dimensional margins, and ''n''(''n'' − 1) dependence parameters, whereby ''n'' − 1 parameters correspond to bivariate margins, and the others correspond to conditional bivariate margins. In the case of multivariate normal distributions, the parameters would be ''n'' − 1 correlations and (''n'' − 1)(''n'' − 2)/2 [[partial correlation]]s, which were noted to be algebraically independent in (−1,&amp;nbsp;1).

An entirely different motivation underlay the first formal definition of vines in Cooke.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997"&gt;{{cite conference

Dependence information for such studies had been captured with ''Markov trees'',

which are trees constructed with nodes as univariate random variables and edges as bivariate copulas. For ''n'' variables, there are at most ''n'' − 1 edges for which dependence can be specified. New techniques at that time involved obtaining uncertainty distributions on modeling parameters by eliciting experts' uncertainties on other variables which are predicted by the models. These uncertainty distributions are pulled back onto the model's parameters by a process known as probabilistic inversion.
&lt;ref name="Kurowicka&amp;Cooke 2006" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Gossens 2000" /&gt;
The resulting distributions often displayed a dependence structure that could not be captured as a Markov tree.

[[Graphical model]]s called ''vines'' were introduced in
&lt;ref name="Bedford&amp;Cooke 2002" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Kurowicka&amp;Cooke 2006" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997" /&gt; An important feature of vines is that they can add conditional dependencies among variables on top of a Markov tree which is generally too parsimonious to summarize the dependence among variables.

[[File:C-Vine on 4 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|C-vine on 4 variables]]
[[File:D-Vine on 4 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|D-vine on 4 variables]]
[[File:Regular vine on 5 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|R-vine on 5 variables]]
A vine {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''V'''&lt;/var&gt;}} on ''n'' variables is a nested set of connected trees where the edges in the first tree are the nodes of the second tree, the edges of the second tree are the nodes of the third tree, etc. 
A ''regular vine'' or ''R-vine'' on ''n'' variables is a vine in which two edges in tree {{math|&lt;var&gt;j&lt;/var&gt;}} are joined by an edge in tree ''j'' + 1 only if these edges share a common node, ''j'' = 1, &amp;hellip;, ''n'' &amp;minus; 2. The nodes in the first tree are univariate random variables. The edges are constraints or conditional constraints explained as follows.

Recall that an edge in a tree is an unordered set of two nodes.  Each edge in a vine is associated with a ''constraint set'', being the set of variables (nodes in first tree) reachable by the set membership relation. For each edge, the constraint set is the union of  the constraint sets of the edge's two members called its component constraint sets  (for an edge in the first tree, the component  constraint sets are empty).  The constraint associated with each edge is now the symmetric difference of its component constraint sets conditional on the intersection of its constraint sets. One can show that for a regular vine, the symmetric difference of the component constraint sets is always a doubleton and that each pair of variables occurs exactly once as constrained variables. In other words, all constraints are bivariate or conditional bivariate.

The degree of a node is the number of edges attaching to it. The simplest regular vines have the simplest degree structure; the D-Vine assigns every node degree 1 or 2, the C-Vine assigns one node in each tree the maximal degree. For large vines, it is clearer to draw each tree separately.

The number of regular vines on ''n'' variables grows rapidly in ''n'': there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; ways of extending a regular vine with one additional variable, and there are ''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)(''n'' &amp;minus; 2)!2&lt;sup&gt;(''n'' &amp;minus; 2)(''n'' &amp;minus; 3)/2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 labeled regular vines on ''n'' variables

The constraints on a regular vine may be associated with ''partial correlations'' or with ''conditional bivariate copula''.  In the former case, we speak of a ''partial correlation vine'', and in the latter case of a ''vine copula''.

=== Partial correlation vines ===
Bedford and Cooke &lt;ref name="Bedford&amp;Cooke 2002" /&gt; show that any assignment of values in the open interval (−1,&amp;nbsp;1) to the edges in any partial correlation vine is consistent, the assignments are algebraically independent, and there is a one-to-one relation between all such assignments and the set of correlation matrices. In other words, partial correlation vines provide an algebraically independent parametrization of the set of correlation matrices, whose terms have an intuitive interpretation.  Moreover, the determinant of the correlation matrix is the product over the edges of (1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ik'';''D''(''ik'')&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;''ik'';''D''(''ik'')&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial correlation assigned to the edge with conditioned variables ''i'',''k'' and conditioning variables ''D''(''ik''). A similar decomposition characterizes the [[mutual information]], which generalizes the determinant of the correlation matrix.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997" /&gt;  These features have been used in constrained sampling of correlation matrices,&lt;ref name="Lewandowski 2009" /&gt; building non-parametric continuous Bayesian networks &lt;ref name="Hanea 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanea 2010" /&gt; and addressing the problem of extending partially specified matrices to positive definite matrices

=== Vine copulas or pair-copula construction ===
Under suitable differentiability conditions, any multivariate density ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;hellip;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''n'' variables, with univariate densities ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, may be represented in closed form as a product of univariate densities and (conditional) copula densities on any R-vine {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''V'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

When the conditional copulas do not depend on the values of the conditioning variables, one speaks of the ''simplifying assumption'' of constant conditional copulas. Though most applications invoke this assumption, exploring the modelling freedom gained by discharging this assumption has begun

Also factor copulas, where latent variables have been added to the vine, have been proposed (e.g.,

Vine researchers have developed algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation and simulation of vine copulas, finding truncated vines that summarize the dependence in the data, enumerating through vines, etc. Chapter 6 of ''Dependence Modeling with Copulas''&lt;ref name="Joe 2014"&gt;{{cite book

  |publisher = Chapman Hall
  |isbn = 978-1-4665-8322-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes these algorithms in pseudocode.

== Parameter estimation ==
For parametric vine copulas, with a bivariate copula family on each edge of a vine, algorithms and software are available for maximum likelihood estimation of copula parameters, assuming data have been transformed to uniform scores after fitting univariate margins. There are also available algorithms (e.g., 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last1 = Brechmann |first1 = E.C.
  |last2 = Czado |first2 = C.
  |last3 = Aas |first3 = K.
  |title = Truncated regular vines in high dimensions with application to financial data

  |issue = 1
  |pages = 68–85
  |doi=10.1002/cjs.10141
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 
for choosing good truncated regular vines where edges of high-level trees are taken as conditional independence. These algorithms assign variables with strong dependence or strong conditional dependence to low order trees in order that higher order trees have weak conditional dependence or conditional independence. Hence parsimonious truncated vines are obtained for a large number of variables. Software with a user interface in R are available (e.g., 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |last1 = Schepsmeier |first1 = U.
 |last2 = Stoeber |first2 = J.
 |last3 = Brechmann |first3 = E.C.
 |last4 = Graeler |first4 = B.

 |year = 2014
 |url = http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/VineCopula/html/VineCopula-package.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Sampling and conditionalizing ==
A sampling order for {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} variables is a sequence of conditional densities in which the first density is unconditional, and the densities for other variables are conditioned on the preceding variables in the ordering. A sampling order is ''implied by a regular-vine'' representation of the density if each conditional density can be written as a product of copula densities in the vine and one dimensional margins.&lt;ref name="Cooke 2015" /&gt;
 
An implied sampling order is generated by a nested sequence of subvines where each sub-vine in the sequence contains one new variable not present in the preceding sub-vine. For any regular vine on {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} variables there are {{math|&lt;var&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} implied sampling orders. Implied sampling orders are a small
subset of all {{math|&lt;var&gt;n!&lt;/var&gt;}} orders but they greatly facilitate sampling. Conditionalizing a regular vine on values of an arbitrary subset of variables is a complex operation. However, conditionalizing on an initial sequence of an implied sampling order is trivial, one simply plugs in the initial conditional values and proceeds with the sampling. A general theory of conditionalization does not exist at present.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2159">In [[mathematics]], a '''weakly symmetric space''' is a notion introduced by the Norwegian mathematician [[Atle Selberg]] in the 1950s as a generalisation of [[symmetric space]], due to [[Élie Cartan]]. Geometrically the spaces are defined as complete [[Riemannian manifold]]s such that any two points can be exchanged by an [[isometry]], the symmetric case being when the isometry is required to have period two. The classification of weakly symmetric spaces relies on that of periodic automorphisms of complex [[semisimple Lie algebra]]s. They provide examples of [[Gelfand pair]]s, although the corresponding theory of [[Zonal spherical function|spherical functions]] in [[harmonic analysis]], known for symmetric spaces, has not yet been developed.

'''Women's empowerment'' is the procedure in which women elaborate and recreate what is that they can be, do, and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Gender equality and women's empowerment: A critical analysis of the third millennium development goal 1." ''Gender &amp; Development'' 13.1 (2005): 13-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mosedale|first=Sarah|date=2005-03-01|title=Assessing women's empowerment: towards a conceptual framework|journal=Journal of International Development|language=en|volume=17|issue=2|pages=243–257|doi=10.1002/jid.1212|issn=1099-1328}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; There are several principles defining women's empowerment such as, for one to be empowered, they must come from a position of disempowerment. Furthermore, one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party. Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them. Lastly, empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other  at a previous time; therefore, empowerment is a process, not a product.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt;

Women empowerment has become a significant topic of discussion in [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[economics]]. It can also point to the approaches regarding other trivialized [[gender]]s in a particular political or social context.

Women's [[economic empowerment]] refers to the ability for women to enjoy their right to control and benefit from the 
resources, [[asset]]s, [[income]] and their own time, as well as the ability to [[Risk management|manage risk]] and improve their economic status and well being.&lt;ref name="Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&gt;Oxfam (Forthcoming), "Women's Economic Empowerment Conceptual Framework"&lt;/ref&gt;

While often interchangeably used, the more comprehensive concept of [[gender empowerment]] refers to people of any gender, stressing the [[Sex and gender distinction|distinction]] between biological  and [[Gender role|gender as a role]]. It thereby also refers to other marginalized genders in a

== Importance of women's empowerment in societies ==
Entire nations, businesses, communities and groups can benefit from the implementation of programs and policies that adopt the notion of women empowerment.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/bitstream/10625/40248/1/IDL-40248.pdf|title=An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency|year=2009|editor2=Lila Shahani|publisher=Earthscan|location=Sterling, VA|editor1=Deneulin, Séverine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empowerment of women is a necessity for the very development of a society, since it enhances both the quality and the quantity of human resources available for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Kamla|last2=Yesudian|first2=P.

== Methods ==
Scholars have identified two forms of empowerment, economic empowerment and political empowerment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. "Contextualising the Economic Pathways of Women's Empowerment: Findings from a Multi-Country Research Programme." (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/democratic-governance/inclusive-political-institutions/regional-organizations--gender-equality-and-the-political-empowe.html|title=Regional Organizations, Gender Equality and the Political Empowerment of Women|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic empowerment ===
Economic empowerment increases women's agency, access to formal government programs, mobility outside the home, economic independence, and purchasing power. Policy makers are suggested to support job training to aid in entrance in the formal markets.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; One recommendation is to provide more formal education opportunities for women that would allow for higher bargaining power in the home. They would have more access to higher wages outside the home; and as a result, make it easier for women to get a job in the market.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duflo|first=Esther|date=2012|title=Women Empowerment and Economic Development|jstor=23644911|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume=50|issue=4|pages=1051–1079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strengthening women's access to property inheritance and land rights is another method used to economically empower women. This would allow them better means of asset accumulation, capital, and [[bargaining power]] needed to address [[gender inequalities]]. Often, women in developing and underdeveloped nations are legally restricted from their land on the sole basis of gender.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; Having a right to their land gives women a sort of bargaining power that they wouldn't normally have; in turn, they gain more opportunities for economic independence and formal financial institutions.

Another popular methodology for women's economic empowerment also includes [[microcredit]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated22"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microfinance institutions aim to empower women in their community by giving them access to loans that have low interest rates without the requirement of collateral.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Geleta, Esayas Bekele. "Microfinance and the politics of empowerment: a critical cultural perspective." ''Journal of Asian and African Studies'' 49.4 (2014): 413-425.&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, they aim to give microcredit to women who want to be entrepreneurs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The success and efficiency of microcredit and microloans is controversial and constantly debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Parmar, A.|year=2003|title=Microcredit, Empowerment, and Agency: Re-evaluating the Discourse|journal=Canadian Journal of Development Studies|volume=24|issue=3|pages=461–76|doi=10.1080/02255189.2003.9668932}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critiques claim that microcredit alone doesn't guarantee women have control over the way it is used. Microfinance institutions don't address cultural barriers that allow men to still control household finances; as a result, microcredit may simply be transferred to the husband. Microcredit doesn't relieve women of household obligations, and even if women have credit, they don't have the time to be as active in the market as men.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Ellis, Amanda. ''Gender and economic growth in Kenya: Unleashing the power of women''. World Bank Publications, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political empowerment ===
Political empowerment supports creating policies that would best support gender equality and agency for women in both the public and private spheres. Popular methods that have been suggested are to create affirmative action policies that have a quota for the number of women in policy making and parliament positions.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; As of 2017, the global average of women whom hold lower and single house parliament positions is 23.6 percent.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Further recommendations have been to increase women's rights to [[vote]], voice opinions, and the ability to run for office with a fair chance of being elected.&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; Because women are typically associated with child care and domestic responsibilities in the home, they have less time dedicated to entering the labour market and running their business. Policies that increase their [[bargaining power]] in the household would include policies that account for cases of divorce, policies for better welfare for women, and policies that give women control over resources (such as property rights).&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; However, participation is not limited to the realm of politics. It can include participation in the [[household]], in schools, and the ability to make choices for oneself. Some theorists believe that bargaining power and agency in the household must to be achieved before one can move onto broader political participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Human Development: The Capabilities to Approach|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=9781139459358|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=1–33|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement and assessment ==
Women empowerment can be measured through the [[Gender Empowerment Measure]] (GEM), which shows women's participation in a given nation, both politically and economically. GEM is calculated by tracking "the share of seats in [[parliament]] held by women; of female legislators, senior officials and managers; and of female profession and technical workers; and the [[gender disparity]] in earned income, reflecting economic independence".&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt; It then ranks countries given this information. Other measures that take into account the importance of female participation and equality include: the [[Gender Parity Index]] and the [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI).&lt;ref name="Deneulin, Séverine 2009" /&gt;

Some critiques of GEM is that it is not concerned with factors regarding society, such as gender, religion, cultural context, legal context, and violations of women's rights.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Charmes, Jacques, and Saskia Wieringa. "Measuring women's empowerment: an assessment of the gender-related development index and the gender empowerment measure." ''Journal of Human Development'' 4.3 (2003): 419-435.&lt;/ref&gt; Gender empowerment measure attempts to makes a consistent standardized approach to measure women's empowerment; in doing so, it has been critiqued that the GEM doesn't account for variation in historical factors, female autonomy, gender segregation, and women's right to vote.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillarisetti|first=J.|last2=McGillivray|first2=Mark|date=1998-06-01|title=Human Development and Gender Empowerment: Methodological and Measurement Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|language=en|volume=16|issue=2|pages=197–203|doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00059|issn=1467-7679}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gender-related Development Index (GDI) is a way in which the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) measures the inequality between genders within a country. Some critique of this measurement is that, because GDI calculations rely solely on the achievement distribution between males and females of a population, GDI doesn't measure gender inequality; rather, it measures absolute levels on income, education and health&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

A more qualitative form of assessing women's empowerment is to identify constraints to action. This allows for the identification of power relations between genders. Because this is a participatory process, it facilitates conversation on gender discrimination.&lt;ref name=":62"/&gt; Comparing constraints on women at a later time also allows for any changes or expansion to be better identified. The evaluation of the development of women's agency allows for an evaluation of actions taken. These assessments must also be based on the action taken by women, and not external groups. External groups can help facilitate women's empowerment, but cannot bestow it on them.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;

== Barriers ==

Many of the barriers to women's empowerment and equity lie ingrained in cultural norms. Many women feel these pressures, while others have become accustomed to being treated inferior to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities|author=Nussbaum, Martha C.|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=9780198289647|editor1=Martha C. Nussbaum|location=Oxford|pages=1–15|chapter=Introduction|editor2=Jonathan Glover|lastauthoramp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if [[legislators]], [[NGOs]], etc. are aware of the benefits women's empowerment and participation can have, many are scared of disrupting the status of the women and continue to let [[societal norms]] get in the way of development.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/WorldSurvey2009.pdf|title=Women's Control over Economic Resources and Access to Financial Resources, including Microfinance|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|section=World Survey on the Role of Women In Development|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that the increasing access to the internet can also result in an increased exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000" /&gt; Releasing personal information on websites has put some women's personal safety at risk. In 2010, Working to Halt Online Abuse stated that 73% of women were victimized through such sites. Types of victimization include [[cyber stalking]], harassment, [[online pornography]], and [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Morahan-Martin, J.|year=2000|title=Women and the Internet: Promise and Perils|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=683–691|doi=10.1089/10949310050191683}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual harassment]] in particular is a large barrier for women in the workplace. It appears in almost all industries, but is most notable in the following: business, trade, banking and finance, sales and marketing, hospitality, civil service, and education, lecturing and teaching.&lt;ref name="Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aware.org.sg/training/wsh-site/14-statistics/|title=Statistics|date=22 April 2010|work=AWARE RSS|publisher=AWARE|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), sexual harassment is a clear form of gender discrimination based on sex, a manifestation of unequal power relations between men and women. Furthermore, the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is urging for increased measures of protection for women against sexual harassment and violence in the workplace. 54% (272) had experienced some form of workplace sexual harassment. 79% of the victims are women; 21% were men.&lt;ref name="Statistics" /&gt;

Recent studies also show that women face more barriers in the workplace than do men. Gender-related barriers involve sexual harassment, unfair hiring practices, career progression, and unequal pay where women are paid less than men are for performing the same job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stein, A.I.|year=2009|title=Women Lawyers Blog for Workplace Equality: Blogging as a Feminist Legal Method|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287&amp;context=yjlf|journal=Yale Journal of Law and Feminism|volume=20|issue=2|pages=357–408}}&lt;/ref&gt; When taking the median earnings of men and women who worked full-time, year-round, government data from 2014 showed that women made $0.79 for every dollar a man earned. The average earnings for working mothers came out to even less—$0.71 for every dollar a father made, according to a 2014 study conducted by the National Partnership for Women and Children. While much of the public discussion of the "[[Gender pay gap|wage gap]]" has focused around women getting equal pay for the same work as their male peers, many women struggle with what is called the "pregnancy penalty". The main problem is that it is difficult to measure, but some experts say that the possibility of having a baby can be enough for employers to push women back from their line.&lt;ref name="NBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/business/careers/motherhood-penalty-can-affect-women-who-never-even-have-child-n548511|title='Motherhood Penalty' Can Affect Women Who Never Even Have a Child|author=Safia Samee Ali|date=April 11, 2016|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women are put in a position where they need to make the decision of whether to maintain in the workforce or have children. This problem has sparked the debate over maternity leave in the United States.

However, despite the struggle for equal pay in the United States, the tech industry{{clarify|date=June 2017}} has made progress in helping to encourage equal pay across gender. In March 2016, tech career website Dice released a study of more than 16,000 tech professionals that found that when you compare equivalent education, experience and position, there is no pay gap—and hasn't been for the last six years.&lt;ref name="NBC" /&gt; This new industry is paving a way for other companies to do the same. However, this industry also struggles to employ women in executive positions. This is partially due to the barrier of sexual harassment and pregnancy that was aforementioned.

Such barriers make it difficult for women to advance in their workplace or receive fair compensation for the work they provide.

== Role of education ==
It is said that education increases "people's self-confidence and also enables them to find better jobs and they can work shoulder to shoulder with men".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marniemi|first=J.|last2=Parkki|first2=M. G.|date=1975-09-01|title=Radiochemical assay of glutathione S-epoxide transferase and its enhancement by phenobarbital in rat liver in vivo|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=24|issue=17|pages=1569–1572|issn=0006-2952|pmid=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They engage in public debate and make demands on government for health care, social security and other entitlements".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;UNDP. 2013.

Human Progress in a Diverse World; New York, UNDP.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, education empowers women to make choices that improve their children's health, their well-being, and chances of survival.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2014. EFA Global Monitoring Report 2013/2014: Teaching and Learning, Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Education informs others of preventing and containing the disease, and it is an essential element of efforts to reduce malnutrition. Furthermore, it empowers women to make choices that can improve their welfare, including marrying beyond childhood and having fewer children. Crucially, education can increase women's awareness of their rights, boost their self-esteem, and provide them the opportunity to assert their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002343/234325E.pdf|title=Mobile phones and literacy: Empowerment in Women's Hands; A Cross-Case Analysis of Nine Experiences|last=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100123-9|location=33|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite significant improvements in recent decades, education is not universally available and gender inequalities persist. A major concern in many countries is not only the limited numbers of girls going to school but also the limited educational pathways for those that step into the classroom. More specifically, there should be more efforts to address the lower participation and learning achievement of [[Female education in STEM|girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Internet as a tool of empowerment ==

The growing access of the web in the late 20th century has allowed women to empower themselves by using various tools on the Internet. With the introduction of the [[World Wide Web]], women have begun to use social networking sites like [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] for [[online activism]].&lt;ref name="Sutton, J. 2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sutton, J.|author2=Pollock, S.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2000|title=Online Activism for Women's Rights|journal=Cyber Psychology &amp; Behavior|volume=3|issue=5|pages=699–706|doi=10.1089/10949310050191700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through online activism, women are able to empower themselves by organizing campaigns and voicing their opinions for equality rights without feeling oppressed by members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Churchyard, N.|year=2009|title=The Question of Empowerment: Women's Perspective on Their Internet Use|journal=[[Gender, Technology and Development]]|volume=13|issue=3|pages=341–363|doi=10.1177/097185241001300302}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, on May 29, 2013, an online campaign started by 100 female advocates forced the leading social networking website, Facebook, to take down various pages that spread hatred about women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McVeigh, T.|date=June 6, 2013|title=Online Feminist activists of the digital age|work=Taipei Times|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2013/06/06/2003564076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[blogging]] has also become a powerful tool for the educational empowerment of women. According to a study done by the University of California, Los Angeles, medical patients who read and write about their disease are often in a much happier mood and more knowledgeable than those who do not.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stephan, P.|date=August 13, 2013|title=Breast cancer patients blog their blues away|url=http://breastcancer.about.com/b/2013/08/13/blog-the-blues-away.htm|journal=Breastcancer.about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reading others' experiences, patients can better educate themselves and apply strategies that their fellow bloggers suggest.&lt;ref name="breastcancer.about.com"/&gt;

With the easy accessibility and affordability of [[e-learning]] (electronic learning), women can now study from the comfort of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Radovic-Markovic, M.|author2=Nelson-Porter, B.|author3=Omolaja, M.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2012|title=The new alternative women's entrepreneurship education: E-learning and virtual universities|journal=International Women Online Journal of Distance Education|volume=1|issue=2|pages=46–54|url=http://wojde.org/FileUpload/bs295854/File/06a.markovic.pdf|issn=2147-0367}}&lt;/ref&gt; By empowering themselves educationally through new technologies like e-learning, women are also learning new skills that will come in handy in today's advancing globalized world.

Often times, the internet is very useful as source of empowerment for women through its creation, dispersion, and utilization of hashtags on social media. One prime example of hashtags supporting women empowerment was in 2017 when the #AintNoCinderella hashtag came into existence. This hashtag spread like wildfire on social media after Varnika Kundu (a 29-year-old woman in India) was driving home past midnight on August 4 when she was followed and harassed by two men in a SUV{{cn|date=October 2018}}. Kundu was blamed for being out late at night, particularly by the BJP government Vice-President Ramveer Bhatti. This lead to women all across India and the world posting pictures of themselves out late at night with the hashtag "#AintNoCinderella" to show that women do not have a particular curfew to which they have to adhere to (like Cinderella did). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/ain-t-no-cinderella-women-hit-out-bjp-leader-blaming-chandigarh-stalking-victim-66456|title=Ain’t no Cinderella: Women hit out at BJP leader for blaming Chandigarh stalking victim|date=2017-08-08|work=The News Minute|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ongoing projects ==
The UN came out with a set of goals called the Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs, to help make the world a better place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable development goals - United Nations|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 17, the fourth goal works to allow access to education for all people alike. A large effort has been made to include women in schools to better their education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/education/|title=Education - United Nations Sustainable Development|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the fifth goal focuses on empowering women and girls to achieve gender equality through equal access to various types of opportunities (health care, education, work, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also some prominent non-profits that help empower women:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thepowerofpurpose.com/10-amazing-nonprofits-empowering-women-2017/|title=10 Amazing Nonprofits Empowering Women in 2017 - The Power of Purpose|date=2017-01-26|work=The Power of Purpose|access-date=2018-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== U.S. involvement ===
[[File:First Lady Melania Trump and Under Secretary Shannon Pose for a Photo With the 2017 International Women of Courage Awardees (33338548780).jpg|thumb|[[Melania Trump]] with 2017 [[International Women of Courage Award]]ees]]
Domestically, the U.S. empowered women through passings of laws such as allowing women to vote in 1920, banning discrimination based on gender in 1964, banning discrimination against pregnant women in 1978, etc. Additionally, the inclusion of women in politics allowed for more gender equality. The first female speaker of House, the first First Lady to run for president, and first women to serve on the Supreme Court were monumental events that proved socially the acceptance of "subservient" women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nwhp.org/resources/womens-rights-movement/detailed-timeline/|title=Detailed Timeline {{!}} National Women's History Project|website=www.nwhp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. provides foreign aid to third world countries in various forms, one of which is by providing education programs. There are currently bills in Congress that work to ensure education to girls, one of which is the Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act. These are enacted with the belief that proper education will pull them out of poverty and reduce exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/2408|title=H.R.2408 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Protecting Girls' Access to Education Act|last=Steve|first=Chabot|date=2017-10-04|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another action taken on by the U.S is the [[President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief|PEPFAR]] program, initiated by the Bush administration in 2003. The U.S. spent more than $1.4 billion in funding sub-Saharan Africa during the duration of the program. This program was taken into effect in response to the global HIV/AIDS crisis, and it promoted abstinence among young girls and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=June 15, 2007|title=Bush Boosts AIDS Relief: Cause for Applause and Pause|jstor=20036459|journal=Science|volume=316|issue=5831|pages=1552|pmid=17569832|doi=10.1126/science.316.5831.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a partnership with DREAMS, and its main purpose with PEPFAR was to allow both girls and women to develop into Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pepfar.gov/partnerships/ppp/dreams/|title=Working Together for an AIDS-Free Future for Girls and Women|website=www.pepfar.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are criticisms that this program did not really do much to reduce HIV risk behavior, and critics such as John Dietrich worried that the context of aid enforced Western beliefs of choosing abstinence before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bendavid|first=Eran, et al.|date=May 2016|title=Abstinence Funding Was Not Associated With Reductions In HIV Risk Behavior In Sub-Saharan Africa|url=|journal=Health Affairs|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/05/03/476601108/u-s-spent-1-4-billion-to-stop-hiv-by-promoting-abstinence-did-it-work|title=U.S. Spent $1.4 Billion To Stop HIV By Promoting Abstinence. Did It Work?|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was and still is controversy regarding the effectiveness of this program in reducing HIV/AIDS through advocating abstinence and whether this would actually empower women in Africa.

A '''world view'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/world-view|title=world-view noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes - Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com|website=www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''worldview''' is the fundamental [[cognitive]] orientation of an individual or society encompassing the whole of the individual's or society's knowledge and [[Perspective (cognitive)|point of view]]. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gary B. |last=Palmer |title=Toward A Theory of Cultural Linguistics |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=1996 |page=114 |isbn=978-0-292-76569-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is a [[calque]] of the German word '''''[[wikt:Weltanschauung|Weltanschauung]]''''' {{IPA-de|ˈvɛltʔanˌʃaʊ.ʊŋ||De-Weltanschauung.ogg}}, composed of ''[[wikt:Welt|Welt]]'' ('world') and ''[[wikt:Anschauung|Anschauung]]'' ('view' or 'outlook').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=worldview |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German word is also used in English.

It is a concept fundamental to [[German philosophy]] and [[epistemology]] and refers to a ''wide world perception''. Additionally, it refers to the framework of ideas and beliefs forming a global description through which an individual, group or culture watches and interprets the [[world (philosophy)|world]] and interacts with it.

Worldview remains a confused and confusing concept in English, used very differently by [[linguistics|linguists]] and [[sociology|sociologists]]. It is for this reason that James W. Underhill suggests five subcategories: world-perceiving, world-conceiving, cultural mindset, personal world, and perspective&lt;ref name =Underhill_2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Humboldt, Worldview and Language|date=2009|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748638420|edition=Transferred to digital print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Creating worldviews : metaphor, ideology and language|date=2011|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0748679096}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Underhill|first1=James W.|title=Ethnolinguistics and Cultural Concepts: truth, love, hate &amp; war|date=2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-1107532847}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Worldviews are often taken to operate at a conscious level, directly accessible to  articulation and discussion, as opposed to existing at a deeper, pre-conscious level, such as the idea of "[[figure and ground (media)|ground]]" in [[Gestalt psychology]] and [[Media (communication)|media analysis]]. However, core worldview beliefs are often deeply rooted, and so are only rarely reflected on by individuals, and are brought to the surface only in moments of crises of faith.

==Origins==

===Linguistics===
The [[Prussia]]n [[philology|philologist]] [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767–1835) originated the idea that language and worldview are inextricable. Humboldt saw language as part of the creative adventure of mankind. Culture, language and linguistic communities developed simultaneously and could not do so without one another. In stark contrast to [[linguistic determinism]], which invites us to consider language as a constraint, a framework or a prison house, Humboldt maintained that speech is inherently and implicitly creative. Human beings take their place in speech and continue to modify language and thought by their creative exchanges. 

[[Edward Sapir]] (1884–1939) also gives an account of the relationship between thinking and speaking in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fadul |first= Jose |date= 2014 |title= Encyclopedia of Theory and Practice in Psychotherapy and Counseling |url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=WRrzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA347&amp;lpg=PA347&amp;dq=Edward+Sapir+also+gives+an+account+of+the+relationship+between+thinking+and+speaking+in+English&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ObjouuV9rd&amp;sig=RdD1S6ILO_XYWERUl0fB48KL5xk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwictcjAoJTRAhVIpI8KHbCdDk4Q6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Edward%20Sapir%20also%20gives%20an%20account%20of%20the%20relationship%20between%20thinking%20and%20speaking%20in%20English&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page= 347 |isbn= 978-1-312-34920-9 |author-link= | quote = Edward Sapir also gives an account of the significant relationship between thinking and speaking in English.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[linguistic relativity]] [[hypothesis]] of [[Benjamin Whorf|Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1897–1941) describes how the syntactic-semantic structure of a language becomes an underlying structure for the world view or ''Weltanschauung'' of a people through the organization of the causal [[perception]] of the world and the linguistic [[categorization]] of entities. As linguistic categorization emerges as a representation of worldview and causality, it further modifies social perception and thereby leads to a continual interaction between [[language]] and perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor= 679389 |pages= 65–79 |last1= Kay |first1= P. |last2= Kempton |first2= W. |title= What is the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis? |volume= 86 |issue= 1 |journal= American Anthropologist |year= 1984 |doi= 10.1525/aa.1984.86.1.02a00050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whorf's hypothesis became influential in the late 1940s, but declined in prominence after a decade. In the 1990s, new research gave further support for the linguistic relativity theory in the works of [[Stephen Levinson]] (1947–) and his team at the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max Planck institute]] for [[psycholinguistics]] at [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The theory has also gained attention through the work of [[Lera Boroditsky]] at Stanford University.

One of the most important concepts in cognitive [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive sciences]] is the German concept of ''Weltanschauung''.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} This expression has often been used to refer to the "wide worldview" or "wide world perception" of a people, family, or person.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The ''Weltanschauung'' of a people originates from the unique world experience of a people, which they experience over several millennia.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}The [[language]] of a people reflects the ''Weltanschauung'' of that people in the form of its [[Syntax|syntactic structures]] and untranslatable [[connotation]]s and its [[denotation]]s.

The term ''Weltanschauung'' is often wrongly attributed to Wilhelm von Humboldt, the founder of German ethnolinguistics. However, as Jürgen Trabant points out, and as James W. Underhill reminds us, Humboldt's key concept was ''Weltansicht''.&lt;ref name=Underhill_2009/&gt; ''Weltansicht'' was used by Humboldt to refer to the overarching conceptual and sensorial apprehension of reality shared by a linguistic community (Nation). On the other hand, ''Weltanschauung'', first used by Kant and later popularized by Hegel, was always used in German and later in English to refer more to philosophies, ideologies and cultural or religious perspectives, than to linguistic communities and their mode of apprehending reality.

A worldview can be expressed as the "fundamental cognitive, affective, and evaluative presuppositions a group of people make about the nature of things, and which they use to order their lives."&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, Paul G. Transforming Worldviews: an anthropological understanding of how people change. Grand Rapids, Mich.: Baker Academic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

If it were possible to draw a [[map]] of the [[world]] on the basis of ''Weltanschauung'',&lt;ref name="Whorf" &gt;{{cite book|author-last=Whorf|author-first=Benjamin Lee|author-link=Benjamin Lee Whorf|editor-last=Carroll|editor-first=John Bissell|editor-link=John Bissell Carroll|origyear=1st pub. 1956 |year=1964|title=Language, Thought, and Reality.

If the [[Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]] is correct, the worldview map of the world would be similar to the linguistic map of the world. However, it would also almost coincide with a map of the world drawn on the basis of [[music]] across people.&lt;ref name="Whorf" /&gt;

===Folk-epics===
{{See also|List of world folk-epics}}

As natural language becomes manifestations of world [[perception]], the [[literature]] of a people with common ''Weltanschauung'' emerges as holistic [[representation (psychology)|representations]] of the wide world perception of the people. Thus the extent and commonality between world folk-epics becomes a manifestation of the commonality and extent of a worldview.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[Epic poems]] are shared often by people across political borders and across generations. Examples of such epics include the [[Nibelungenlied]] of the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] people, the [[Iliad]] for the Ancient Greeks and Hellenized societies, the [[Silappadhikaram]] of the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]] of the Hindus, the [[Gilgamesh]] of the [[Mesopotamia]]n-[[Sumer]]ian [[civilization]] and the people of the [[Fertile Crescent]] at large, [[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]] (Arabian nights) of the [[Arab world]] and the [[Epic of Sundiata|Sundiata]] epic of the [[Mandé]] people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Terror management theory===
{{Main article|Terror management theory}}
A worldview, according to [[terror management theory]] (TMT), serves as a buffer against death anxiety.&lt;ref name="worm"&gt;Schimel, J., Hayes, J., Williams, T., &amp; Jahrig, J. (2007). ''Is Death Really the Worm at the Core? Converging Evidence that Worldview Threat Increases Death-Thought Accessibility''. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 92, No. 5'', pp. 789-803.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorised that living up to the ideals of one's worldview provides a sense of self-esteem which provides a sense of transcending the limits of human life (e.g. literally, as in religious belief in immortality, symbolically, as in art works or children to live on after one's death, or in contributions to one's culture).&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Evidence in support of terror management theory includes a series of experiments by Jeff Schimel and colleagues in which a group of Canadians found to score highly on a measure of patriotism were asked to read an essay attacking the dominant Canadian worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Using a test of [[Terror management theory#Death thought accessibility|death-thought accessibility]] (DTA), involving an ambiguous word completion test (e.g. "COFF__" could either be completed as either "COFFEE" or "COFFIN" or "COFFER"), participants who had read the essay attacking their worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of DTA than the control group, who read a similar essay attacking Australian cultural values. Mood was also measured following the worldview threat, to test whether the increase in death thoughts following worldview threat were due to other causes, for example, anger at the attack on one's cultural worldview.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; No significant changes on mood scales were found immediately following the worldview threat.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

To test the generalisability of these findings to groups and worldviews other than those of nationalistic Canadians, Schimel ''et al'' conducted a similar experiment on a group of religious individuals whose worldview included that of [[creationism]].&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Participants were asked to read an essay which argued in support of the theory of evolution, following which the same measure of DTA was taken as for the Canadian group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt; Religious participants with a creationist worldview were found to have a significantly higher level of death-thought accessibility than those of the control group.&lt;ref name="worm" /&gt;

Goldenberg ''et al'' found that highlighting the similarities between humans and other animals increases death-thought accessibility, as does attention to the physical rather than meaningful qualities of sex.&lt;ref&gt;Goldenberg, J. L., Cox, C. R., Pyszczynski, T., Greenberg, J., &amp; Solomon, S. (2002). ''Understanding human ambivalence about sex: The effects of stripping sex of meaning.'' Journal of Sex Research, 39, 310–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The term World View denotes a comprehensive set of opinions, seen as an [[organic unity]], about the world as the medium and exercise of human existence. World View serves as a framework for generating various dimensions of human perception and experience like [[knowledge]], [[politics]], [[economics]], [[religion]], [[culture]], [[science]] and [[ethics]]. For example, worldview of [[causality]] as ''uni-directional'', ''cyclic'', or ''spiral'' generates a framework of the world that reflects these systems of causality.

===Causality===
An unidirectional view of [[causality]] is present in some monotheistic views of the world with a beginning and an end and a single great force with a single end (e.g., [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]), while a cyclic worldview of causality is present in religious traditions which are cyclic and seasonal and wherein events and experiences recur in systematic patterns (e.g., [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Mithraism]] and [[Hinduism]]). These worldviews of causality not only underlie religious traditions but also other aspects of thought like the purpose of [[history]], [[politics|political]] and [[economics|economic]] theories, and systems like [[democracy]], [[authoritarianism]], [[anarchism]], [[capitalism]], [[socialism]] and [[communism]].

The worldview of a [[linear]] and [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]] causality generates various related/conflicting disciplines and approaches in [[scientific thinking]]. The ''Weltanschauung'' of the temporal contiguity of act and event leads to underlying diversifications like ''determinism'' vs. ''free will''. A worldview of [[free will]] leads to disciplines that are governed by simple laws that remain constant and are static and [[empirical]] in scientific method, while a worldview of [[determinism]] generates disciplines that are governed with [[dynamical systems|generative systems]] and [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] in [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Some forms of [[philosophical naturalism]] and [[materialism]] reject the validity of entities inaccessible to [[natural science]]. They view the [[scientific method]] as the most reliable model for [[model (abstract)|building]] an [[understanding]] of the [[world]].

==Religion==
[[Nishida Kitaro]] wrote extensively on "the Religious Worldview" in exploring the philosophical significance of Eastern religions.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed Kitaro's final book is ''Last Writings: Nothingness and the Religious Worldview''
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Neo-Calvinist]] [[David Naugle]]'s ''World view: The History of a Concept'', "Conceiving of Christianity as a worldview has been one of the most significant developments in the recent history of the church."&lt;ref&gt;David K. Naugle ''Worldview: The History of a Concept'' {{ISBN|0-8028-4761-7}} page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian thinker [[James W. Sire]] defines a worldview as "a commitment, a fundamental orientation of the heart, that can be expressed as a story or in a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be true, partially true, or entirely false) which we hold (consciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently) about the basic construction of reality, and that provides the foundation on which we live and move and have our being." He suggests that "we should all think in terms of worldviews, that is, with a consciousness not only of our own way of thought but also that of other people, so that we can first understand and then genuinely communicate with others in our pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;James W. Sire ''The Universe Next Door: A Basic World view Catalog'' p15–16 (text readable at Amazon.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

The commitment mentioned by James W. Sire can be extended further. The worldview increases the commitment to serve the world. With the change of a person's view towards the world, he/she can be motivated to serve the world. This serving attitude has been illustrated by Tareq M Zayed as the 'Emancipatory Worldview' in his writing "History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/9631989/History_of_emancipatory_worldview_of_Muslim_learners|title=History of emancipatory worldview of Muslim learners|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question mentioned above - on whether the super-smart machines, that is, any ''[[Superintelligence|superintelligences]]'', as expected by some, could have worldviews - is interesting in this context and this would influence human worldviews. 

==Philosophy==
{{Main article|Belief system}}

The philosophical importance of worldviews became increasingly clear during the 20th century for a number of reasons, such as increasing contact between cultures, and the failure of some aspects of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] project, such as the [[rationalist]] project of attaining all truth by reason alone. [[Mathematical logic]] showed that fundamental choices of [[axioms]] were essential in deductive reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Not just in the obvious sense that you need axioms to prove anything, but the fact that for example the [[Axiom of choice]] and [[Axiom S5]], although widely regarded as correct, were in some sense optional.&lt;/ref&gt; and that, even having chosen axioms not everything that was true in a given [[logical system]] could be proven.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Godel's incompleteness theorem]] and discussion in e.g. [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]]'s ''The Freedom of the Will''&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophers believe the problems extend to "the inconsistencies and failures which plagued the Enlightenment attempt to identify universal moral and rational principles";&lt;ref&gt;Thus [[Alister McGrath]] in ''[[The Science of God]]'' p 109 citing in particular [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]'s ''Whose Justice? Which Rationality?'' – he also cites [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]&lt;/ref&gt; although Enlightenment principles such as [[universal suffrage]] and the [[universal declaration of human rights]] are accepted, if not taken for granted, by many.&lt;ref&gt;"Governments in a democracy do not grant the fundamental freedoms enumerated by Jefferson; governments are created to protect those freedoms that every individual possesses by virtue of his or her existence. In their formulation by the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th and 18th centuries, inalienable rights are God-given natural rights. These rights are not destroyed when civil society is created, and neither society nor government can remove or "alienate" them."[http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm US Gov website on democracy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201190718/http://usinfo.state.gov/products/pubs/whatsdem/whatdm3.htm |date=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[theory of relativity]] offers a Weltanschauung that is revolting to [[absolute space and time]], yet provides a context for modern theories of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravity]]. In a book review for a new undergraduate textbook on relativity by [[Wolfgang Rindler]], Kenneth Jacobs&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Jacobs (1970) "Bridging the gap between relativity and the undergraduate", [[Physics Today]] 23(12):48,8 {{doi|10.1063/1.3021868}}&lt;/ref&gt; noted that "during the post-[[Sputnik]] era, [[special relativity]] began to take its rightful place in the undergraduate curriculum". On the adoption of the Weltanschauung, he notes, "The historical impact of any world picture is ... partly attributable to the zeal of the promulgators and to the efficacy of their teachings."

Philosophers also distinguish the manifest image from the scientific image. These phrases are due to the American 20th century philosopher [[Wilfrid Sellars]]. This is one angle on the ancient philosophical distinction between appearance and reality which is particularly pertinent to everyday contemporary living. Indeed, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} believe that the scientific image, with its reductionist methodology, will undermine our sense of individual freedom and responsibility. So, many{{Who|date=January 2017}} worry that as science advances, particularly cognitive neuroscience, we will be dehumanized. This certainly has powerful Nietzschean undertones. When our immediately given, manifest ([[sc.]] obvious) self-conception is shaken, what is lost for the individual and society? And does it have to be that way?&lt;ref&gt;see Owen Flanagan's 'The Problem of the Soul', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some questions well worth working on, then, are those concerning the refinement of the manifest view of such centrally important concepts such as free will,&lt;ref&gt;see especially Daniel Dennett's 'Freedom Evolves', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; the self and individuality, and the possibility of real or lived meaning.

== Characteristics ==
While [[Leo Apostel]] and his followers clearly hold that individuals can construct worldviews, other writers regard worldviews as operating at a [[community]] level, or in an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] way. For instance, if one's worldview is fixed by one's language, as according to a strong version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], one would have to learn or invent a new language in order to construct a new worldview.

According to Apostel,&lt;ref&gt;[[Diederik Aerts]], [[Leo Apostel]], Bart de Moor, Staf Hellemans, Edel Maex, Hubert van Belle &amp; Jan van der Veken (1994) "[http://www.vub.ac.be/CLEA/pub/books/worldviews.pdf "World views. From Fragmentation to Integration]" VUB Press. Translation of (Apostel and Van der Veken 1991) with some additions. – The basic book of World Views, from the Center Leo Apostel.&lt;/ref&gt; a worldview is an [[ontology]], or a descriptive [[Mental model|model]] of the world. It should comprise these six elements:
# An [[explanation]] of the world
# A [[futurology]], answering the question "Where are we heading?"
# Values, answers to [[ethical]] questions: "What should we do?"
# A [[praxeology]], or [[methodology]], or theory of [[Action (philosophy)|action]]: "How should we attain our goals?"
# An [[epistemology]], or theory of [[knowledge]]: "What is [[truth|true]] and false?"
# An [[etiology]]. A constructed world-view should contain an account of its own "building blocks", its origins and construction.

== Classification of cultural worldviews ==
From across the world across all of the cultures, Roland Muller has suggested that cultural world views can be broken down into three separate world views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book
| title = Honor and Shame
| last = Muller
| first = Roland
| publisher = Xlibris; 1st edition
| year = 2001

| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not simple enough to say that each person is one of these three cultures. Instead, each individual is a mix of the three. For example, a person may be raised in a Power–Fear society, in an Honor–Shame family, and go to school under a Guilt–Innocence system.

=== Guilt–Innocence ===
In a Guilt–Innocence focused culture, schools focus on deductive reasoning, cause and effect, good questions, and process. Issues are often seen as black and white. Written contracts are paramount. Communication is direct, and can be blunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| title = Three Colors of Worldview
| website = KnowledgeWorkx
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Honor–Shame ===
Societies with a predominantly Honor–Shame worldview teach children to make honorable choices according to the situations they find themselves in. Communication, interpersonal interaction, and business dealings are very relationship-driven, with every interaction having an effect on the Honor–Shame status of the participants. In an Honor–Shame society the crucial objective is to avoid shame and to be viewed honorably by other people. The Honor–Shame paradigm is especially strong in most regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| location = 
| pages = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power–Fear ===
Some cultures can be seen very clearly in operating under a Power–Fear worldview. In these cultures it is very important to assess the people around you and know where they fall in line according to their level of power. This can be used for good or for bad. A benevolent king rules with power and his citizens fully support him wielding that power. On the converse, a ruthless dictator can use his power to create a [[culture of fear]] where his citizens are oppressed.

==Streams in contemporary American thought==

According to [[Michael Lind]], "a worldview is a more or less coherent understanding of the nature of reality, which permits its holders to interpret new information in light of their preconceptions. Clashes among worldviews cannot be ended by a simple appeal to facts. Even if rival sides agree on the facts, people may disagree on conclusions because of their different premises." This is why politicians often seem to talk past one another, or ascribe different meanings to the same events. Tribal or national wars are often the result of incompatible worldviews. Lind has organized American political worldviews into five categories:
* [[Green politics|Green]] [[Malthusianism]] synthesizes mystical versions of [[environmentalism]] with alarm about population growth in the tradition of the Rev. Thomas Malthus
* [[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] [[Isolationism]] would abandon foreign alliances, dismantle most of its military, and return to a 19th-century pattern of decentralized government and an economy based on small businesses and small farms.
* [[Neoliberal]] [[Globalism]] believes that at home governments should provide only basic public goods like infrastructure and security, and do so by market-friendly methods
* [[populism|Populist]] [[Nationalism]] tends to favor restriction of legal as well as illegal [[immigration]] to protect the core stock of the tribe-state from dilution by different races, ethnic groups or religions. Populist nationalism also tends to favor [[protectionist]] policies that shield workers and businesses, particularly small businesses, from foreign competition.
* [[Social democracy|Social Democracy]] claims an economic safety net, protecting citizens from unemployment, sickness, poverty in old age and other disasters, is necessary if democratic government is to retain popular support.
Lind argues that even though not all people will fit neatly into only one category or the other, their core worldview shape how they frame their arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lind |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Lind |title=The five worldviews that define American politics |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/01/12/lind_five_worldviews/ |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon Magazine]] |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assessment and comparison==
One can think of a worldview as comprising a number of [[basic belief]]s which are philosophically equivalent to the axioms of the worldview considered as a logical theory. These basic beliefs cannot, by definition, be proven (in the logical sense) within the worldview precisely because they are [[axiom]]s, and are typically argued ''from'' rather than argued ''for''.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Daniel Hill and Randal Rauser ''Christian Philosophy A–Z'' [[Edinburgh University Press]] (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-7486-2152-1}} p200&lt;/ref&gt; However their coherence can be explored philosophically and logically.

If two different worldviews have sufficient common beliefs it may be possible to have a constructive dialogue between them.&lt;ref&gt;In the Christian tradition this goes back at least to [[Justin Martyr]]'s ''Dialogues with Trypho, A Jew'', and has roots in the debates recorded in the [[New Testament]] For a discussion of the long history of religious dialogue in India, see [[Amartya Sen]]'s ''The Argumentative Indian''
&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, if different worldviews are held to be basically incommensurate and irreconcilable, then the situation is one of [[cultural relativism]] and would therefore incur the standard criticisms from [[philosophical realist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/c/cog-rel.htm#H5 ''Cognitive Relativism'', Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The problem of self-refutation is quite general. It arises whether truth is relativized to a framework of concepts, of beliefs, of standards, of practices.[http://www.science.uva.nl/~seop/entries/relativism/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friesian.com/relative.htm The Friesian School on Relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, religious believers might not wish to see their beliefs relativized into something that is only "true for them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=49207 Pope Benedict warns against relativism]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/CURIA/RATZRELA.HTM Ratzinger, J. ''Relativism, the Central Problem for Faith Today'']
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Subjective logic]] is a belief-reasoning formalism where beliefs explicitly are subjectively held by individuals but where a consensus between different worldviews can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2001|journal=International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems|volume=9|issue=3|pages=279–311|doi=10.1142/S0218488501000831|last1=Jøsang|first1=Audun|title=A Logic For Uncertain Probabilities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third alternative sees the worldview approach as only a methodological relativism, as a suspension judgment about the truth of various belief systems but not a declaration that there is no global truth. For instance, the religious philosopher [[Ninian Smart]] begins his ''Worldviews: Cross-cultural Explorations of Human Beliefs'' with "Exploring Religions and Analysing Worldviews" and argues for "the neutral, dispassionate study of different religious and secular systems—a process I call worldview analysis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ninian Smart]] ''Worldviews: Crosscultural Explorations of Human Beliefs (3rd Edition)'' {{ISBN|0-13-020980-5}} p14
&lt;/ref&gt;

The comparison of religious, philosophical or scientific worldviews is a delicate endeavor, because such worldviews start from different [[presupposition]]s and cognitive values. Clément Vidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Metaphilosophical Criteria for Worldview Comparison|url=http://homepages.vub.ac.be/%7Eclvidal/writings/Vidal-Metaphilosophical-Criteria.pdf|journal=Metaphilosophy|volume=43|issue=3|pages=306–347|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9973.2012.01749.x|author=Vidal, Clément}}
&lt;/ref&gt; has proposed metaphilosophical criteria for the comparison of worldviews, classifying them in three broad categories:

# ''objective'': objective consistency, scientificity, scope
# ''subjective'': subjective consistency, personal utility, emotionality
# ''intersubjective'': intersubjective consistency, collective utility, narrativity

David Bell&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/962016344|title=SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND WORLD VIEWS.|last=BELL|first=DAVID|date=2016|publisher=GROSVENOR House PUBLISHING|isbn=9781786237668|location=Guildford, Surrey, UK|oclc=962016344}}&lt;/ref&gt; has raised interesting questions on worldviews for the designers of [[Superintelligence|superintelligences]] – machines much smarter than humans. &amp;nbsp;'Would they need worldviews, where would they get their worldviews and what would they be like?'. The answers would have to relate to, for example, Christian worldviews. Some of the people who consider features of superintelligences say they will have characteristics that are often associated with divinity, raising big open questions for Christian believers. For example, very advanced machines could, perhaps, &amp;nbsp; ultimately engender in people a terrified reverence and mystical awe in the light of, say, an artificial agent's impressive understanding of the human condition. And perhaps some humans might even be induced to 'worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator'? On the other hand what would the agent's relationship to God be? Anyone attempting to accommodate concepts such as an omnipotent, personal creator's sacrificial, emotional, spiritual and attitudinal demands being made of any man-made entity, superintelligent or not, could be said to have strayed into ''terra prohibita'' theologically, of course. And how would the worldviews of any superintelligences handle the relationships with what it might regard as its ''human'' 'creator'?
