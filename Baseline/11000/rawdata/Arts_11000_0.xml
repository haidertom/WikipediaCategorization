'''Alexander Kircher''' (Trieste, 26 February 1867 – 16 September 1939, Berlin) was an Austrian-German marine and landscape painter and illustrator. Many of his paintings can be seen in museums in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Croatia]], and [[Slovenia]] while others are held by private owners in those same countries, as well as the [[United States of America]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], and [[Greece]]. 

From time to time Kircher's paintings are presented for sale at such leading auction houses as [[Christie's]] and [[Bonhams]] in London, [[Sotheby's]] in New York, the Burchard Galleries in St. Petersburg, Florida,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burchardgalleries.com/ Burchard Galleries] Antiques and Arts Auctioneer, St. Petersburg/Florida&lt;/ref&gt; Stahl Hamburg,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.auktionshaus-stahl.de/ Auction house Stahl], Hamburg, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Van Ham Cologne,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.van-ham.com/en/van-ham-new-building.html VAN HAM Fine Art Auctioneers], Cologne, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dorotheum]] in Vienna, and several others. 

The artist signed the majority of his paintings "Alex Kircher", sometimes adding the year of their creation. The Bergmann Auction House in Erlangen, Germany, maintains a directory of Kircher's various signature styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auktion-bergmann.de/Katalog.aspx?text=Kircher&amp;KatNo=0&amp;a_id=3&amp;cui=EN Signature Directory Auction House Bergmann, Erlangen, Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kircher was born in [[Trieste]], which belonged at that time to the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] ([[Habsburg Monarchy]]). As a young man he intended to choose the profession of a naval officer in the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]]. Because of a foot injury his application was rejected. In 1888 he opted for studying painting at the [[Prussian Academy of Arts|Berlin Academy]], where he concentrated mainly on marine painting from the start. His teachers were [[Hans Gude]] and [[Hermann Eschke]].

Kircher made numerous study trips throughout Europa, Asia, North America and Egypt. During these travels, he made several important paintings, drawings and illustrations. In 1893 he worked on the picturesque decoration of buildings at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|World Exhibition in Chicago]] as well as panoramas and dioramas of the marine painter [[:de:Hans von Petersen]]. In addition, Kircher worked as an illustrator for popular German and foreign magazines and publishers of which only a few can be mentioned: The Leipziger Illustrierte Zeitung or the modern illustrated weekly Reclams universe (Leipzig), the writings of the Austrian (Vienna) and the [[Navy League (Germany)|German fleet association]] (Berlin) and the Viennese publisher Philipp &amp; Kramer, for which he designed the postcard series "Dalmatia and Istria".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://istriadalmaziacards.com/html/collezioni_pers_dett.php?IDCat=3&amp;IDPers=83 |title=Historical Postcards of Istria, Rijeka, Kvarner and Dalmatia |access-date=2015-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110144454/http://istriadalmaziacards.com/html/collezioni_pers_dett.php?IDCat=3&amp;IDPers=83 |archive-date=2015-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These include Feldpost, postcards which Kircher created for the [[Austrian Red Cross]], the War Welfare Office or the War Aid Office and also for the London Postcard Publisher [[Raphael Tuck &amp; Sons]] and the Swedish Postcards Publisher: "Gothenburg Lithographic AB and Meyer &amp; Köster" etc. For some time Kircher owned a steam yacht, which he named ''Romana'' – this was his wife's name. With this ship he could better motives collect and draw maritime objects from the area. This he did for example in fleet parades.

[[File:Familiengrab der Kirchers auf dem Friedhof von Moritzburg.png|thumb|The Kircher family grave in the cemetery at Moritzburg in Saxony]]
Between 1895 and 1900 he was a professor at the Art Academy in Trieste and married Romana Salmassi&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Document_of_the_Gross-parents_Kircher-Salmassi.jpg Excerpt from the ancestry certificate of Alexander Kircher and Romana Salmassi]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Chiesa di Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Sant’Antonio Taumaturgo|The Church of Sant'Antonio Traumaturgo in Trieste]]&lt;/ref&gt; on 15 October 1898. This marriage produced three sons and three daughters. In 1904, after a short stay in Vienna, Kircher moved from Trieste to [[Dresden]], where he lived until 1906 and where he joined the General German Art Cooperative as a freelance artist. In 1906 the family moved to [[Moritzburg, Saxony|Moritzburg]]. From 1922 the Kirchers occupied a villa at 6 Jagdweg in [[Niederlößnitz]] and from 1933 to about 1935 they lived in [[Kötzschenbroda]]-Niederlößnitz.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radebeul]] - Niederlößnitz is today a part of the city of Radebeul/Meißen in Saxony&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1935, Kircher's wife died. The painter then moved to [[Klotzsche]], where he took up residence in a building belonging to the former [[Air War School Klotzsche|Air War School]] in that town.

Influential members of the nobility and some industrialists – especially from the circles of Maritime Navigation&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anniversary_edition_70_years_North_German_Lloyd_with_the_dedication_of_Alexander_Kircher.jpg Anniversary edition 70 years [[North German Lloyd]] with the dedication to Alexander Kircher]&lt;/ref&gt; – promoted the artist. First of them [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Emperor Franz Joseph I]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]]. On behalf of these two monarchs, Kircher painted numerous images of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and the [[Imperial German Navy]]. His paintings were also found on the large passenger ships of the time, as well as in the offices of well known shipping companies and shipyards and of course also in private ownership. During World War II, several images got lost or disappeared. An example of the many lost images is the large oil painting of the steamship [[SS Columbus (1924)|''Columbus'']] ("The Columbus in the Kaiser lock"). This painting was given by the [[North German Lloyd]] as a gift to the city of [[Bremerhaven]] on the occasion of its 100th anniversary in 1927. The painting has disappeared at the end of World War II (1945). Others of his paintings have been preserved for posterity and can be seen in many museums today; see list of locations excerpt.

Kircher concluded his life's work with a series of one hundred paintings which documented the development of German shipping over a millennium and which hung in the Institute and Museum of Oceanography MfM. of the University of Berlin. The current location of the works is unknown, reproductions have since appeared as an image panel work (1934) and in book form (1939)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abebooks.com/Deutschlands-Seegeltung-Germansichen-Einbaum-Wikingerschiff-deutschen/12378574956/bd Wolfgang Loeff: Deutschlands Seegeltung, Berlin, 1939] in German language&lt;/ref&gt; and recently only in parts on CD-ROM (2010).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historischer-bilderdienst.de/marinebilder/alexander-kircher-marinemaler/index.php Alexander Kircher, marine painter - Historical Image Service]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, 22 images, of which the majority is from the collection of MfM, were rediscovered in the archives of Wehrgeschichtliches Training Centre of the [[Naval Academy Mürwik]] in [[Flensburg]]-[[Mürwik]]. Kircher died on 16 September 1939, in Berlin, the last place where he had worked. The painter was laid to rest in the family grave in Moritzburg, Saxony.

==Awards and decorations==
Kircher received the Spanish [[Order of Isabella the Catholic]] in February 1909 in the Spanish Embassy in Berlin. This award will be given for services to art and science.

'''Angelic Upstarts''' are an English [[punk rock]] band formed in [[South Shields]] in 1977. [[Allmusic]] calls them "one of the period's most politically charged and thought-provoking groups".&lt;ref name="AMGbio"&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12222|pure_url=yes}} Angelic Upstarts Biography]. [[Allmusic]].  URL accessed 3 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The band espoused an [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[working class]] philosophy, and have been associated with the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]]Though they ended up detesting and being detested by most skinheads.

The band released eight studio albums in their first decade.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/artist/148396-Angelic-Upstarts&lt;/ref&gt; After a brief split they reformed in 1988, and a number of times subsequently, with new albums appearing in 1992, 2002, 2011, and 2016. More than two decades after its release, their debut single, "The Murder Of [[Liddle Towers]]", was included in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine’s list of the best punk rock singles of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Mojo (October 2001) - ''100 Punk Scorchers '', Issue 95, London;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lineups==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
The band's original members were Thomas Mensforth (Mensi) on vocals, Ray Cowie (Mond) on [[guitar]], Steve Forsten on [[bass guitar]], and Derek "Decca" Wade on [[Drum kit|drums]]. Keith Bell was the manager until 1980, when he was jailed for four and a half years for arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradbury |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/tm_objectid=16853928&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=50081&amp;headline=still-crazy-after-all-these-years-name_page.html |title=Still crazy after all these years |publisher=ChronicleLive |date=2006-03-23 |accessdate=2012-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430152415/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/tm_objectid%3D16853928%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50081%26headline%3Dstill-crazy-after-all-these-years-name_page.html |archivedate=30 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other former members include Ronnie Rocker and bassists Ronnie Wooden, Glyn Warren and Tony Feedback (now in [[Long Tall Shorty]] and [[Kiria (musician)|Kiria]]'s live band). Drummers have included Sticks Warrington (who later joined [[Cockney Rejects]]), [[Paul Thompson (musician)|Paul Thompson]] (ex-[[Roxy Music]]), Chris White,  Evo (who has also played in [[The Blood]], [[Major Accident]] and Warfare.

Wade rejoined the band for a few years before leaving again. Brian Hayes (also of Blaggers ITA, Long Tall Shorty) originally joined the band as second guitarist until Mond left, leaving Hayes as the only guitarist. Mensi was the only original member still in the band.

In August 2006, Mensi announced he was resigning, but requested that the band continue with Chris Wright (of the band Crashed Out) on vocals. The band's lineup became Wright on vocals, Dickie Hammond on guitar, Neil "Newts" Newton on guitar, Gaz "Geordie" Stoker on bass and Wade on drums. In the latter part of 2007, Mensi rejoined the band and the lineup became Mensi on vocals, Gaz "Geordie" Stoker on bass, Hammond on guitar, Newts on guitar and Brett Mulvaney (and later Jonnie Halling) on drums.

The current lineup is now Mensi on vocals, Newts Newton on guitar, GG Gates on bass and Sgt Wilko on drums.&lt;ref name="officialangelicupstarts.com"&gt;http://officialangelicupstarts.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Automat''''' is a [[1927 in art|1927]] painting by the [[Visual arts of the United States|American]] [[Realism (arts)|realist]] [[painting|painter]] [[Edward Hopper]]. The painting was first displayed on Valentine’s Day 1927 at the opening of Hopper’s second solo show, at the Rehn Galleries in [[New York City]]. By April it had been sold for $1,200.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Troyen, ''Hopper in Gloucester,'' in Carol Troyen, Judith Barter, Janet Comey, [[Elliot Bostwick Davis]] and Ellen Roberts (eds.), ''Edward Hopper''. Boston: MFA Publications (Museum of Fine Arts), 2007, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is today owned by the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa.

==The woman==
The painting portrays a lone woman staring into a cup of coffee in an [[automat]] at night. The reflection of identical rows of light fixtures stretches out through the night-blackened window.

Hopper's wife, [[Josephine Hopper|Jo]], served as the model for the woman.&lt;ref&gt;Gail Levin, ''Edward Hopper: An Intimate Biography.'' New York: Rizzoli, (1995) 2007, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hopper altered her face to make her younger (Jo was 44 in 1927).  He also altered her figure; Jo was a curvy, full-figured woman, while one critic has described the woman in the painting as {{"'}}boyish' (that is, flat-chested)".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Carol Troyen, ''{{'}}The Sacredness of Everyday Fact': Hopper’s Pictures of the City''. In Carol Troyen, Judith Barter, Janet Comey, [[Elliot Bostwick Davis]] and Ellen Roberts (eds.), ''Edward Hopper''. Boston: MFA Publications (Museum of Fine Arts), 2007, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

As is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.

She has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time.

The time of year—late autumn or winter—is evident from the fact that the woman is warmly dressed. But the time of day is unclear, since days are short at this time of year.  It is possible, for example, that it is just after sunset, and early enough in the evening that the automat could be the spot at which she has arranged to rendezvous with a friend. Or it could be late at night, after the woman has completed a shift at work. Or again, it could be early in the morning, before sunrise, as a shift is about to start.

Whatever the hour, the restaurant appears to be largely empty and there are no signs of activity (or of any life at all) on the street outside. This adds to the sense of loneliness, and has caused the painting to be popularly associated with the concept of [[Urban sociology|urban alienation]]. One critic has observed that, in a pose typical of Hopper's melancholic subjects, "the woman's eyes are downcast and her thoughts turned inward."&lt;ref&gt;Iversen, Margaret, ''Edward Hopper''. [[Tate Publishing Ltd|Tate Publishing]], 2004, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic has described her as "gazing at her coffee cup as if it were the last thing in the world she could hold on to."&lt;ref&gt;Schmied, Wieland, ''Edward Hopper: Portraits of America''. Translated by John William Gabriel. Munich: Prestel, 1999, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine used ''Automat'' as the cover image for a story about stress and depression in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, August 28, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art critic Ivo Kranzfelder compares the subject matter of this painting (a young woman nursing a drink alone in a restaurant) to [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[The Plum]]'' and [[Edgar Degas]]'s ''[[L'Absinthe]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ivo Kranzfelder, ''Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 2010, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;—although unlike the subject in Degas's painting, the woman is introspective, rather than dissipated.

==The viewer’s perspective==
The presence of a chairback in the lower right-hand corner of the canvas suggests that the viewer is sitting at a nearby table, from which vantage-point a stranger might be able to glance, uninvited, upon the woman.

In an innovative twist, Hopper made the woman’s legs the brightest spot in the painting, thereby "turning her into an object of desire" and "making the viewer a voyeur."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hobbs, ''Edward Hopper''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; By today’s standards this description seems overstated, but in 1927 the public display of women’s legs was still a relatively novel phenomenon.

Hopper would make the crossed legs of a female subject the brightest spot on an otherwise dark canvas in a number of later paintings, including ''[[Compartment C, Car 293]]'' (1938)[http://artsandletters.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/hopper-compartment-c-car-293-image-geoffrey-clements-corbis.jpg] and ''[[Hotel Lobby]]'' (1943).[http://ayiajavon.com/imd100/g2.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;The comparison between ''Automat'' and ''Hotel Lobby'' is made in Robert Hobbs, ''Edward Hopper.'' New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1987, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; The female subject of his 1931 painting ''[[Barber Shop]]''[http://www.artsfairies.com/Edward_Hopper/Hopper_Edward_The_Barber_Shop.jpg] is also in a pose similar to the woman in ''Automat'', and the viewer's image of her is similarly bisected by a table. But the placing of the subject in a bright, populated place, at midday, makes the woman less isolated and vulnerable, and hence the viewer's gaze seems less intrusive.

==The restaurant==
As critic Carol Troyen notes, "the title, rather than any detail within the picture, is what identifies the restaurant as an automat."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Troyen continues on, however, to note a number of features which would have made the restaurant identifiable to a New Yorker of the 1920s: "They were clean, efficient, well-lit and—typically furnished with round Carrera marble tables and solid oak chairs like those shown here—genteel. By the time Hopper painted his picture, automats had begun to be promoted as safe and proper places for the working woman to dine alone."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; To a New Yorker of the 1920s, Hopper's interior would have been instantly recognizable as an Automat. A 1912 photograph of the Automat in [[Times Square]] reveals every detail of the chairs and the marble-topped tables to correspond with what Hopper has painted.&lt;ref&gt;See photograph in Lorraine B. Diehl and Marianne Hardart, ''The Automat: The History, Recipes, and Allure of Horn and Hardart's Masterpiece.'' New York: Clarkson Potter, 2002, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is not the Times Square Automat; the ceiling lights at that location were significantly more ornate than the ones in the painting.

Automats, which were open at all hours of the day, were also “busy, noisy and anonymous. They served more than ten thousand customers a day."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Moreover, the woman is sitting in the least congenial spot in the entire restaurant for introspection. She has, as Troyen notes, the table nearest the door, and behind her, on her other side, is the staircase to the restaurant’s below-ground level. Even if the restaurant were relatively empty, there would have been constant foot-traffic past her table. Thus, "the figure’s quiet, contemplative air," which is "out of step with the city’s energy, its pace and its mechanized rhythm,"&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; is made even more noteworthy by the particularly busy spot in which she has chosen to sit.

==The window==
Hopper’s paintings are frequently built around a [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]] that unfolds as the viewer gazes into a window, or out through a window. Sometimes, as in ''[[Railroad Sunset]]'' (1929),[http://www.sai.msu.su/cjackson/hopper/hopper12.jpg] ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) and ''[[Office in a Small City]]'' (1953), it is still possible to see details of the scene beyond even after Hopper has guided the viewer’s gaze through two panes of glass. When Hopper wishes to obscure the view, he tends to position the window at a sharp angle to the viewer’s vantage-point, or to block the view with curtains or blinds. Another favourite technique—used, for example, in ''[[Conference at Night]]'' (1949),[http://www.artsfairies.com/Edward_Hopper/Hopper_Edward_Conference_At_Night.jpg]—is to use bright light, flooding in from the exterior at a sharp angle from the sun or from an unseen streetlight, to illuminate a few mundane details within inches of the far side of the window, thereby throwing the deeper reaches of the view into shadow.

By way of comparison, in ''Automat'' the window dominates the painting, and yet "allows nothing of the street, or whatever else is outside, to be seen."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Mark Strand, ''Hopper''. New York: Knopf, 2007, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; The complete blackness outside is a departure both from Hopper’s usual techniques, and from realism, since a New York street at night is full of light from cars and street lamps. This complete emptiness allows the reflections from the interior to stand out more dramatically, and intensifies the viewer’s focus upon the woman.

The window conveys an impressionistic view, rather than one that is realistic, in another way. As [[Mark Strand]] notes, "The window reflects only the twin receding rows of ceiling lights and nothing else of the automat interior." It is possible that Hopper omitted these reflections in order to avoid distractions that might turn the viewer’s away from the woman.  Strand, however, suggests an alternative reason why the woman’s reflection is omitted:

{{cquote|The painting suggests several things, but the most obvious and most resonant is that if what the window reflects is true then the scene takes place in limbo and the seated woman is an illusion. This is a troubling idea. And if the woman thinks of herself in this context, she cannot possibly be happy.  But of course she does not think, she is the product of another will, an illusion, an invention of Hopper’s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}
The focusing effect of the blank window behind the woman can be seen most clearly when it is contrasted with ''[[Sunlight in a Cafeteria]]'' (1958),[http://www.museumsyndicate.com/images/1/9792.jpg]&lt;ref&gt;The comparison between ''Automat'' and ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria'' is made in Ivo Kranzfelder, ''Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 2010, p. 146, and in Lloyd Goodrich, ''Edward Hopper''. New York: Abradale Press / Harry N. Abrams, 1983, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; one of Hopper’s late paintings. In that painting, a female and a male subject sit in an otherwise empty cafeteria in spots reminiscent of the tables occupied, respectively, by the female subject and the viewer in ''Automat''. Even the bowl of fruit on the windowsill in ''Automat'' has its parallel in a small potted plant on the windowsill in ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria''. But in ''Sunlight in a Cafeteria'', the well-illuminated street scene outside the large window seemingly distracts the man's attention from his counterpart, so that the two subjects "do not seem to be acting in the same scene, as it were."&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Gunter Renner, ''Edward Hopper''. Cologne, Germany: Benedikt Taschen, 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, in ''Automat'' the viewer is fully engaged by the presence of the woman.

The Persian journal '''''Baba Shamal''''' was one of the most famous political satire magazines in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; It was published weekly between 1943 and 1945 by Reżā Ganjaʾī (1918–1995). After his return from Europe in 1947, 50 volumes more were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Elwell-Sutton, “Iranian Press 1941-47,” Iran 6, 1968, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baba-samal&lt;/ref&gt;
Ganjaʾī was a cabinet member and a university professor for engineering. Before and after his publishership Ganjaʾī held some important positions in ministries and in the banking and insurance sector.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; He published his articles under the [[pseudonym]] “Donb-al-mohandesīn“.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known Iranian satirists, poets and authors belong to his supporters and co-workers, i.a. Rahī Moʿayyerī („Zāḡča“), Eqteṣād („Shaikh Pašm-al-Dīn“), Fozūnī („Mohandes-al-Šoʿarāʾ“) and Ṣahbā („Shaikh Somā“).
The journal was widespread in Iran and was characterized by its everyday language and colloquial style. The general [[satirical]] opinion of the authors found its expression in current daily politics which was supplemented by partly colored caricatures and drawings. In general the journal's position was nationalistic, independent and moderate. However, its critique led – under the pressure of censorship – to its suspension in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Elwell-Sutton, “Iranian Press 1941-47,” Iran 6, 1968, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1711">'''Cadac-Andreas''', Irish scholar, fl. 798 &amp;ndash; 814.

Cadac-Andreas was an Irish scholar at the court of [[Charlemange]] who roused the ire of Bishop [[Theodulphus]] for lengthy and pedantic approach to [[exegesis]], which he apparently delighted in. A nameless court poet, possibly connected to Theodulphus, wrote further of him, scorning and parodying

* his fascination with etymologies in the three sacred languages
* pondering who was the first person to perform something in the [[Bible]]
* pedantic, long-winded, interest in terminology

Theodulphus grew to detest Cadac-Andreas so much that he strongly urged Charlemagne to have him dismissed from court. Yet much to the frustration of Theodulphus, and no doubt others at court, Cadac was subsequently awarded a bishopric by the king.

Theodulphus, on the other hand, was later sent into exile by [[Louis the Pious]].

'''Darfield Foulstone School of Creative Arts''' was a comprehensive school located in the village of [[Darfield, South Yorkshire|Darfield]], [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]].

It was a specialist creative arts school, with approximately 900 pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 before closure. 

==History==
The Foulstone Modern School was built on land in the centre of Darfield, previously occupied by a children's recreation ground and by well-cultivated allotments, running alongside of Nanny Marr Road. It was built in the late 1930s and officially opened by R. A. (Rab) Butler in the early war years.

The aim of the school was to provide a good standard of secondary education for local children aged 11 to 16. A lot has been written about the standard and quality of secondary education in the 1930s; much appeared to revolve around the "11 plus exam", an examination taken by children aged 10/11 years old.

The school derived its name from Alderman T.H. (Tommy) Foulstone who was Darfield's representative on the West Riding County Council (headquarters at Wakefield); his special interest was education, standards for which he sought to increase at all levels.

The school formally closed in 2012, when it merged with Wombwell High School to form [[Netherwood Advanced Learning Centre]] on a new site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Work on New Dearne Link Bridge Is Finished |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-309605362.html |work=Epworth Bells |date=29 March 2012 |via=[[Highbeam]] |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specialism==
As part of its creative arts specialism, the school was the host of the [http://www.barnsleyyouththeatre.org.uk/index.html Barnsley Youth Theatre]. There was also a dance school, "K.A.D.S", run by one of the school's dance teachers.

Adjoining the school was a [http://www.barnsleyclcs.org/ CLC] which had a subsequent auditorium, a professional recording studio, a cyber cafe, a MAC lab, and computer suites.

&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Elmarbrandt.jpg|thumb|200px|Elmar Brandt with Gerhard Schröder puppet]] --&gt;
'''''Die Gerd-Show''''' ([[English language|en]]: '''''The Gerd Show''''') was a [[Germany|German]] [[satire|satirical]] radio show broadcast by [[Eins Live]] ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]]). Reaching over nine million listeners at its peak,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tax Song hits out|first=Eric|last=Culp|publisher=[[The Business (magazine)|The Business]]|date=17 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; it generated several Top 20 hits in the music charts in Germany, thanks to the [[impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] talents of its creator, [[Elmar Brandt]], as well as enough controversy over the show's good taste for it to receive newspaper coverage around the globe, despite the limited international appeal of German political humour.

==History==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Steuersong.jpg|thumb|200px|Cover of the ''Der Steuersong'' single]] --&gt;
The programme began in 1999, and was broadcast as a short daily comedy on various radio programmes. The most famous segments of these programmes were Elmar Brandt's rewrites of well-known tunes with new, satirical lyrics, which he sang in an imitation of the voice of [[Gerhard Schröder]], who at that time was [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]]. These parodies generated six hits in the Top 20 in Germany, and were also popular in Switzerland and Austria. 

The most successful of these was ''Der Steuersong'' (en: ''The Tax Song''), which reached the number one spot in Germany and Austria in 2002, and went double platinum in 2004, having sold over a million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doppel-Platin für die «Gerd-Show» - «Steuer-Song» über eine Million Mal verkauft|publisher=ddp Landesdienste|date=8 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[Las Ketchup]]'s summer dance hit ''[[Aserejé]]'', the song lampooned Schröder's tax policy, listing a number of perceived absurd [[indirect tax]]es (such as an tax on [[dog]]s) and suggesting new ones on breathing and bad weather, and depicting the Chancellor as a cheat and a promise breaker. The song was accompanied by a video, in which an unflattering ''[[Spitting Image]]'' style puppet of Schröder stole coins from a charity collection tin, and medicine from the sick.&lt;ref name="Mocking"&gt;{{cite news|title=Song mocking Schröder tops German pop charts|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=20 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song generated political controversy. Reports suggested that Schröder might take legal action, as he notoriously did—successfully—to stop a news agency printing claims that he dyed his hair,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder's good hair day in court|first=Toby|last=Helm|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a spokesman for Schröder's Social Democrats saying ''"There are limits even to political satire... We will take a look at the video, and the chancellor will have to examine what steps to take."''&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hit Song Taxes German's Patience; Parody Mocks Schroeder on Economy|first=Peter|last=Finn|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=17 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Schröder did not in the end take legal action, but did call Brandt a ''"parasite"'' and ''"freeloader"'' for building a career on someone else's voice, to which Brandt rebutted ''"Freeloaders usually attach themselves to people who are successful"''.&lt;ref name="Spars"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder spars with comedian over spoof song|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=5 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' voiced indignation, asking ''"Can the chancellor be mocked like this?"'', though most thought that the song reflected genuine discontent with Schröder's tax policies and that Schröder took the song too seriously.&lt;ref name="Mocking"/&gt;

In 2003, Brandt took part in the German auditions for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003]] with the song ''Alles wird gut'' (en: ''Everything's Going To Be Alright''). The act, which featured another puppet of Schröder simulating sex with the four backing singers, the "Gerdnerinnen" (Gerdettes, a word play on the German word for gardener), received 30% of the German vote, taking third place and losing out to [[Lou (singer)|Lou]]'s feel good anthem ''[[Let's Get Happy]]'' with 38%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder's blushes are spared as comic fails at Eurovision|first=Ruth|last=Elkins|publisher=[[The Independent on Sunday]]|date=9 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Vorzeichen sind wieder dieselben|first=Bibiana|last=Holzhey|publisher=General-Anzeiger|date=10 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005, [[Anne Onken]] imitated [[Angela Merkel]] on ''The Gerd Show'', who would later beat Schröder to become chancellor. During the run-up to the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 German federal elections]], a duet was released between Brandt as Schröder and Onken as Merkel, entitled ''Im Wahlkampf vor mir (Zonenmädchen)'' (en: ''Ahead of Me in the Polls (Girl from the East'')) and set to the tune of ''Im Wagen vor mir fährt ein junges Mädchen'' by [[Hans Blum (musician)|Hans Blum]]. Despite speculation that it would reach the top spot as ''Der Steuersong'' did before it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Schröder ballad challenges Crazy Frog for No 1 spot|first=Roger|last=Boyes|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=8 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; it only reached 25th place in the German charts.

In October 2005, ''The Gerd Show'' was cancelled with 1,300 episodes. Its place was taken by the radio serial ''Schicksalsjahre einer Kanzlerin – Angela – eine Frau geht seinen Weg'' (en: ''A Female Chancellor's Years of Destiny – Angela – A Woman Follows His &lt;!-- ***NOTE***: 'Her' in German is 'ihren', 'his' is correct --&gt; Path'', alluding to the [[Sissi_–_Fateful_Years_of_an_Empress|Sissi film trilogy]]), with Angela Merkel played by Anne Onken, and her male colleagues played by Elmar Brandt.

'''''Drowned Land''''' is a 1912 [[oil painting|oil sketch]] by the 20th-century Canadian painter [[Tom Thomson]].

The work was painted in the fall of 1912, possibly on the [[Mississagi River]]. It depicts an area desolate and damaged due to flooding via damming. It was purchased by the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]] in 1937 and has remained in the collection ever since. It was produced near the beginning of Thomson's short art career, just as he was beginning a transition from commercial art into a full-time painting.

==Background==
{{Further|Tom Thomson#Exploring Algonquin Park (1912–13)|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#First ventures to Algonquin Park (1912–13)}}

In 1912 after Thomson's initial experience of visiting [[Algonquin Provincial Park|Algonquin Park]], he and his colleague William Broadhead went on a two month expedition up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today [[Mississagi Provincial Park]]).{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=27}} Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his original style of painting began to be apparent around this time.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}}{{sfnb|Silcox|2006|p=23}} Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, has been lost due to two canoe spills experienced during the trip,{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/biography/#discovering-algonquin-park 10]}} the first spill being on Green Lake in a rain [[squall]] and the second in a series of rapids.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=119}}{{efn|group=note|Thomson would write to his friend M. J. (John) McRuer: {{quote|[...] 

We started in at Bisco and took a long trip on the lakes around there going up the [[Spanish River (Ontario)|Spanish River]] and over into the Mississauga &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Mississagi River|Mississagi]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; water we got a great many good snapshots of game—mostly moose and some sketches, ''but'' we had a dump in the forty-mile rapids which is near the end of our trip and lost most of our stuff—we only saved 2 rolls of film out of about 14 dozen. Outside of that we had a peach of a time as the Mississauga is considered the finest canoe trip in the world.

==Analysis==

{{See also|Tom Thomson#Industry in nature|Artistic development of Tom Thomson#Photography}}

Thomson's art director while at [[Grip Ltd.]], Albert Robson, identified ''Drowned Land'' as being painted on the Mississagi Forest Reserve canoe trip.{{sfnb|Robson|1937|p=6}} [[Art history|Art historian]] David Silcox has suggested that it was perhaps painted on [[Lake Scugog]] or near [[Owen Sound]].{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} It was painted with [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[paper]], which was further embossed with [[canvas]] texture, all mounted on [[plywood]]. A similar support was used for ''View Over a Lake: Shore with Houses''.{{sfnb|Webster-Cook|Ruggles|2002|p=146}}

[[File:Tom Thomson Near Owen Sound.jpg|thumb|''Near Owen Sound'', November 1911. [[National Gallery of Canada]], [[Ottawa]]]]

The painting came right as Thomson was transitioning from commercial art into fine art and indicates his innate talent.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 24]}} It is similar to a sketch from the previous year, ''Near Owen Sound'', in terms of colour, drawing and [[Texture (painting)|texture]].{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}} On display is a "camera-like precision" and his incredible attention to detail in capturing scenes.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} Indeed, David Silcox has speculated that ''Drowned Land'' as well as other paintings may have been completed with a photograph as a memory aid given their "uncanny precision."{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/significance-and-critical-issues/#photography 63]}} The painting is especially notable for its skill of composition and precision, especially when compared with some of Thomson's other work from this period, such as ''The Canoe'' and ''Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park''. These early sketches show how he had not yet established his own form of expression, being particularly dark and dreary compared to his later work.{{sfnb|Silcox|2015|p=[https://www.aci-iac.ca/art-books/tom-thomson/key-works/drowned-land 23]}} The subject of desolation was uncommon for the time, having not been seen in Canadian painting since the works of [[Topography|topographers]] in the early-nineteenth century.{{sfnb|Hill|2002|p=120}}

The painting, like others from this period, depicts ideal fishing territory that Thomson likely would have enjoyed.{{sfnb|Hunter|2002|p=29}} Many of his paintings were overt in their depictions of the lumber industry, including dams, [[Pointer boat|pointers]], [[Alligator boat|alligators]] and [[Log driving|drives]],{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}} the presence of industry being on his mind from early on.{{sfnb|Reid|1971|pp=2–10}} ''Drowned Land'' however is more subtle as it does not directly display any logging equipment. Instead, it presents the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. A hopeful recovering growth is apparent in the distance behind the skeleton of trees in the foreground.{{sfnb|Wadland|2002|p=95}}

{{Primary sources|date=December 2007}}

'''FairShare''' is an idea for a voluntary [[investment]]-based [[patronage]] system to replace [[patents]] and [[copyright]] while still ensuring that artists are fairly compensated.  It was designed by [[Freenet]] creator [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], [[Steven Starr]] and Rob Kramer in 2000, in response to allegations that artists would not receive adequate compensation for their work without enforceable copyrights. Starr came up with the name.

In the FairShare system, the investor/patrons would provide [[venture capital]].  Clarke envisions that 45% of the money invested in a given artist would go directly to that artist, while another 45% would be given to previous investors.  The remaining 10% would be kept by the maintainers of each FairShare service company.

In some ways this model is similar to a [[pyramid scheme]], but Clarke counters that a vital difference is that nobody would be promised a return on their investment.  He argues that regardless of any profits, each patron would have the satisfaction of knowing that they supported an artist whose work they appreciate.  Also, earlier investors would profit more, thus rewarding them for investing in artists before they became more popular.  The early investors would serve a similar role to studios' talent scouts.

A '''film director''' is a person who directs the making of a [[film]]. A film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects and visualizes the [[screenplay]] (or script) while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that [[Goal|vision]]. The director has a key role in choosing the [[cast member]]s, production design, and the creative aspects of [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaylife.globalpost.com/average-film-director-salary-per-movie-7732.html|title=The Average Film Director Salary Per Movie|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[European Union law]], the director is viewed as the [[auteur theory|author]] of the film.&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascal Kamina|title=Film Copyright in the European Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_PqJYG9ihusC&amp;pg=PA153|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43338-9|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized, or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the boundaries of the film's [[budget]].

There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[film editor]]s or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some [[Outline (list)|outline]] a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect, and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films, or compose the music score for their films.&lt;ref name="career"&gt;{{cite web|title=TV or film director|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-director|website=National Careers Service|publisher=British Government|accessdate=May 10, 2017|location=[[United Kingdom]]|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibility==
[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|upright|The film director gives last minute direction to the cast and crew, while filming a [[costume drama]] on location in [[London]].]]
A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a [[screenplay]] into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision.&lt;ref name="Film schools"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career Profile Film Director|url=http://filmschools.com/resources/los-angeles-career-profile-film-directorl|accessdate=March 3, 2013}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production.&lt;ref name="career"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Media College"&gt;{{cite web |title=Employment Film Director|url=http://www.mediacollege.com/employment/film/director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This entails organizing the [[film crew]] in such a way to achieve their vision of the film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"&gt;{{cite web |title=Career snapshot|url=http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/196/career-snapshot-the-film-director-a-human-lens|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=They must work with producers, writers, cast members, crew members, designers and other professionals in order to implement that vision|url=http://www.academicinvest.com/arts-careers/film-studies-careers/film-director-career-guide|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast-paced environment of a film set.&lt;ref name="Career Centre"&gt;{{cite web|title=A film director needs...|url=http://www.careercentre.dtwd.wa.gov.au/occupations/Pages/director-film-television-radio-or-stage.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew,&lt;ref name="Diploma Guide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Director Career|url=http://diplomaguide.com/articles/Film_Director_Career_Summary.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus, excellent communication skills are a must.&lt;ref name="National Career Service"&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Profile|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/tvorfilmdirector.aspx|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict resolution skills in order to mediate whenever necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=You have to be a diplomat. You have to marshal a whole load of creative people, who often don't get on with each other, and your job is to stop things turning into a bun-fight. |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/student/career-planning/getting-job/i-want-your-job-film-director-480500.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013 | location=London |work=The Independent |first=Alex |last=McRae |date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film.&lt;ref name="Studentpulse"/&gt; The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as "a multi-dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref name="Directors UK"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Director?|url=http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117082526/http://www.directors.uk.com/about-us/what-director|archive-date=2013-01-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=directors work under a lot of pressure, and most are under constant stress to find their next job.|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/entertainment-and-sports/producers-and-directors.htm|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the [[Film producer|producer(s)]] and the studio that is financing the film.&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Education Portal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Career as a film director|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The director is bound by financial conditions, which however should not hinder him from developing his own artistic signature.|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510094913/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdjobprofile.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular [[Motion picture rating system|age rating]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Realizing that an NC-17 rating could hurt business (some theaters and newspapers won't show or advertise NC-17 movies), Mr. Verhoeven cut 47 seconds of the most graphic sex and violence|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/16/arts/film-now-starring-on-video-the-director-s-cut.html| work=The New York Times|first=Ann|last=Hornaday|date= May 16, 1993|accessdate =November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors also play an important role in [[post-production]]. While the film is still in production, the director sends "[[dailies]]" to the [[Film editing|film editor]] and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an [[editor's cut]]. In post-production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the  [[director's cut]]. Well-established directors have the "[[final cut privilege]]", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission.[[File:Steven Spielberg with Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|American director [[Steven Spielberg]] with Sri Lankan filmmaker [[Chandran Rutnam]] in Sri Lanka]]

The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{cite web |title=Princeton review|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=65|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that "20-hour days are not unusual".&lt;ref name="Film schools"/&gt; Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing.

Under [[European Union]] law, the film director is considered the "author" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of [[auteur theory]].&lt;ref name="Kamina2002"/&gt; Auteur theory is a [[film criticism]] concept that holds that a film director's [[film]] reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary "auteur" (the [[French language|French]] word for "author").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/auteur-theory|title=auteur theory {{!}} Definition &amp; Directors|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of—and sometimes even because of—the production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process.

==Career pathways==
Some film directors started as [[screenwriter]]s, [[film editor]]s or [[actor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many are experienced actors, editors or writers|url=http://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/Content/RequestAction.asp?aspAction=GetHTMLProfile&amp;format=html&amp;OCCPRO_ID=71011104|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several American cinematographers have become directors, including [[Barry Sonnenfeld]], originally the Coen brothers' DP; [[Jan de Bont]], cinematographer on films as ''[[Die Hard]]'' and ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', directed ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]'' and ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. [[Wally Pfister]], cinematographer on [[Christopher Nolan]]'s three Batman films made his directorial debut with ''[[Transcendence (2014 film)|Transcendence]]''. Other film directors have attended a [[film school]] to "get formal training and education in their craft".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many directors get formal training and education in their craft at a film school.|url=http://education-portal.com/career_as_a_film_director.html|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Fiction Film bachelor studio students learn the basic principles, techniques and procedures of film direction and production|url=http://www.sintlukas.be/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=258&amp;Itemid=1108|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, and reading scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classes supporting this area discuss and rehearse: preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, protocols of dealing with professional actors, reading scripts, the construction of film sequence|url=http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217032729/http://www.lfs.org.uk/courses/ma_film_making/directing.php|archive-date=2013-02-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We operate from a purpose-built studio facility in Harrow, with two sound stages, a set construction workshop, and extensive post-production facilities.|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/courses/subjects/television-film-and-moving-image/undergraduate-courses/full-time/u09fuftp-ba-honours-film-and-television-production|accessdate = March 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An intrinsic element of the education, alongside the transfer of organizational and technical skills, is to provide the students with insights into social contexts and relationships|url=http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|accessdate=March 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510100634/http://www.filmschule.de/en/seiten/fdprogram.aspx|archive-date=2013-05-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The directing studies 5 years of study : a first cycle of 3 years and a second cycle of 2 years.|url= http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|accessdate= March 3, 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130723142025/http://www.iad-arts.be/EN/m2e3b1-realisation.html|archive-date= 2013-07-23|dead-url= yes|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment.&lt;ref name="Princeton"/&gt; [[The National Film School of Denmark]] has the student's final projects presented on national TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''Fragrances of the World''''' is the largest independent [[Reference work|guide]] to [[Perfume|fragrance]] classification. First published in 1984 by [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]] in [[Sydney]], Australia, the guide was originally named ''The Fragrance Manual'' before becoming ''Fragrances of the World'' in 2000. It has since been printed annually in a bilingual English-French edition. An online companion, the ''Fragrances of the World'' database, was launched in 2004 and, as of 2015, profiles over 17,000 perfumes, updated weekly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.fragrancesoftheworld.info/ Fragrances of the World database - Fragrances of the World.Info&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fragrances of the World'' is considered a standard [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] [[Reference work|reference]] within the fragrance industry, colloquially termed the “''Fragrance Bible''” (a registered [[trademark]] since 2011).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.sniffapaloozamagazine.com/MICHAEL-EDWARDS-INTERVIEW-SNIFFAPALOOZA-MAGAZINE.html Michael Edwards, Fragrances Of The World 2010 Edition, rare exclusive Interview with Michael Edwards, , Perfume Legends: French Feminine Fragrances, the cult book and collecto...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.basenotes.net/features/15-interview-with-michael-edwards-creator-of-fragrances-of-the-world Interview with Michael Edwards - creator of Fragrances of the World ~ by Grant Osborne — Basenotes.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Entries==

Some 8,000 perfumes were profiled in the 2015 printed edition of ''Fragrances of the World'', accompanied by brand name, date, fragrance family and gender. The online database, updated weekly, archives profiles of over 17,000 perfumes, listing brand name, corporate group, creative director, gender, perfumer, date, country of origin, bottle designer, fragrance family, an image, an olfactory pyramid and a pronunciation guide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Michael. Fragrances of the World. Sydney, N.S.W.: Fragrances of the World, 2015. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Fragrances of the World'' database attempts to list all perfumes currently on the market, anywhere in the world. Each listing’s profile is written by the guide’s editorial team, who evaluate the perfume in collaboration with the fragrance’s perfumer and house evaluator.

If a mass-market perfume is discontinued, it remains listed in the guide for another two years, excluding fragrances deemed to be of outstanding influence, which are therefore maintained. Over 3,000 discontinued perfumes considered to be of exceptional popularity or historical importance have also been added to the listing.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The guide is independently published by Fragrances of the World, funded by individual subscriptions. In the interest of neutrality, the guide contains no advertising and listings are made free of charge. However, the fragrances houses are not systematically consulted, and the content is often invented.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==History==

===Print edition=== 

In 1984, [[Michael Edwards (fragrance expert)|Michael Edwards]], having left [[Halston]] as international marketing director, was aware of the need for a guide to help retailers suggest perfumes to consumers. Though Edwards had previously tried to re-establish [[Firmenich]]’s defunct classification ''Bouquet de la Parfumerie'', the leading manual remained Haarmann &amp; Reimer’s ''Guide to Fragrance Ingredients'', an essentially technical genealogy unsuited to retail.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; 

That year in Sydney, Edwards independently published ''The Fragrance Manual'', the first retailer’s guide to fragrance classification, profiling three hundred perfumes. The manual proved a success, going through several editions, and was expanded at the request of [[Nordstrom]], first to include American fragrances, followed by men’s fragrances and niche brands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The manual’s original linear, sectional layout, traditional to fragrance classifications, presented certain limitations. Consumer preferences, Edwards felt, did not necessarily fall into a particular [[Perfume#Olfactive families|olfactory group]] (floral, oriental, woody, etc), and could span two or more groups if linked by similar subgroups (i.e. soft florals being akin to floral orientals). This he addressed in the 1992 edition of ''The Fragrance Manual'', the first to feature an annular taxonomy known as the ‘[[fragrance wheel]]’, which organized olfactory groups in relation to one another while showing their interchange. The fragrance wheel proved a major innovation in perfume classification, its design copied widely throughout the fragrance industry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2000, ''The Fragrance Manual'' was renamed ''Fragrances of the World''. The printed guide has since been published annually in a bilingual English-French edition.

===Online database===

The ''Fragrances of the World'' online database was launched in 2004, accessible by paid subscription. Due to its weekly updates and comprehensive scope (profiling over 17,000 perfumes in 2015), the database has largely superseded the guide’s printed edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whatmenshouldsmelllike.com/2014/10/26/an-evening-with-michael-edwards-founder-of-fragrances-of-the-world/ An Evening with Michael Edwards – founder of Fragrances of the World | What Men Should Smell Like&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Fragrance Finder, an application based on ''The Fragrance Manual'' designed to recommend perfumes according to consumer preferences, was originally developed for [[Sephora]] without success. The application was instead sold independently to retailers in 1994 on [[CD-ROM]], before appearing online in 2006.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Criticisms==
While ''Fragrances of the World'' has largely been adopted as a standard reference in the fragrance industry, the guide has also been subject to criticism. As an independent publication, the guide’s fragrance classifications are sometimes discordant with those of the perfume houses, and the creations are sometimes attributed to the wrong perfumer, causing debate. Its simplistic categories, largely devised for retail, differ from the complex subgroups featured in smaller technical manuals such as the ''Classification officielle des parfums et terminologie'' (also created in 1984), published by the French Society of Perfumers.{{how|date=June 2016}} Its content is also limited in comparison with free resources such as [[Basenotes]], Fragrantica or Perfume Intelligence, though it is considerably more accurate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3849">'''The Hebrew Writers Association in Israel''' ({{lang-he|אגודת הסופרים העברים במדינת ישראל}}, previously אגודת הסופרים העבריים בארץ ישראל or אגודת הסופרים העבריים) is a professional association of writers and poets, who write in the [[Hebrew language]] in [[Israel]]. (There are also associations of writers in Israel who write in other languages, including [[Arabic]].)

==History==
The Association was established in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1921 by [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]], to enrich the Hebrew cultural arena in the then [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Ass-Home"&gt;[http://www.hebrew-writers.org/eng-about.asp Website of the Hebrew Writers Association in Israel - "About Us" in English]&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting was attended by some 70 writers and [[Nahum Sokolow]] was elected honorary president.&lt;ref name="Ass-Home"/&gt; Others who have held this position include: Hayim Nahman Bialik, [[Ahad Ha'am]], [[Mordechai ben Hillel]], [[Jacob Fichman]], [[Asher Barash]] and [[Aharon Avraham Kabak]].

The Association currently has approximately 450 members, including authors, poets, directors and dramatists.&lt;ref name="Ass-Home"/&gt;

The Association publishes a literary journal called ''"Moznaim"'' (Scales), founded in 1928 by Hayim Nahman Bialik, the first issue being published on 15 March 1929.&lt;ref name="Ass-Moznaim"&gt;[http://www.hebrew-writers.org/eng-Moznaim.asp Website of the Hebrew Writers Association in Israel - "Moznaim" in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, at the initiative of Asher Barash, the Association established Machon Genazim (Repository Institute), now known as the Asher Barash Bio-Bibliographical Institute, as a central archive for the conservation of works in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnazim.org.il/Eng/Index.asp?CategoryID=29&amp;ArticleID=44 Website of the Asher Barash Bio-Bibliographical Institute - "About Us" in English]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other operations of the Association are designated for the promotion of Israeli writers and their work. The Association operates as a trade union, representing its members to [[Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel|ACUM]], the publishers association of Israel, tax authorities and other institutions.&lt;ref name="Ass-Home"/&gt;

The offices of the Association are at "Beit HaSofer", Tel Aviv, which also houses the archives and editorial staff of the journal.

==Controversy==
In April 2012, the Hebrew Writers Association in Israel launched a blistering attack on "[[What Must Be Said]]" and threatened to call for [[International PEN]] to "publicly distance itself from [[Günter Grass|Grass]]'[sic] remarks and to come out against all expressions of [[Delegitimization of Israel|delegitimization against Israel]] and the Jewish people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Maya|last=Sela|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/israeli-writers-call-on-international-literary-community-to-rebuke-gunter-grass-1.423465|title=Israeli writers call on international literary community to rebuke Gunter Grass|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=9 April 2012|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LondonSmog.jpg|thumb|{{largethumb}}|2004 filming of a 19th-century film scene set in [[London]]]]
The term '''historical period drama''' (also '''historical drama''', '''period drama''', '''costume drama''', and '''period piece''') refers to a work set in a past time period, usually used in the context of [[film]] and [[television]]. It is an informal crossover term that can apply to several [[genre]]s and is often heard in the context of [[historical fiction]] and [[romance film|romance]]s, [[adventure film]]s, and [[swashbuckler]]s. A period piece may be set in a vague or general era such as the [[Middle Ages]] or a specific period such as the [[Roaring Twenties]]. A religious work can qualify as period drama but not as historical drama.

==Historical accuracy==
Some works attempt to accurately portray historical events or persons, to the degree that the available historical research and the length of the work will allow. These types of works are also known as [[docudrama]], examples being ''[[Cinderella Man]]'', ''[[Schindler's List]]'', and ''[[Lincoln (film)|Lincoln]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZcGNAQAAQBAJ|title=Inspired by True Events: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films, 2nd Edition: An Illustrated Guide to More Than 500 History-Based Films|last=Niemi|first=Robert|date=2013-10-17|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610691987|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works are fictionalized stories based on actual people or events, such as ''[[Braveheart]]'' and ''[[Les Misérables (2012 film)|Les Misérables]]''.

==Examples==

His genre was particularly painting working men such as shepherds, crofters, pedlars, cobblers, fishermen and farm labourers. However he also painted Scottish country and coastal scenery.

== Biography ==

Henderson studied at the [[Trustees Academy]] in Edinburgh and  started to work as a portrait painter but having done so for about twenty years he discovered his true vocation which was marine painting. He marveled the painting of the sea in all its different conditions and light. He exhibited his work  at the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] and at the [[Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts]].  
He also exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in London from 1871 to 1886 and in [[Suffolk Street]] Galleries from 1882 to 1884. 
He was the President of the [[Glasgow Art Club]], in which city he settled in 1852.

==Family==
Henderson married three times: in 1855, Helen Cosh; in 1869, Helen Young of [[Strathaven]] (died 1871); and in 1872, Eliza Thomson.{{sfn|Caw|1912}}

Two of his sons [[John Henderson (1860&amp;ndash;1924)]] and J. Morris Henderson also known as [[Joseph Morris Henderson]] RSA (1863&amp;ndash;1936) also became painters in their own right. 

His daughter Marjory Henderson (1856&amp;ndash;1936) married the well known Scottish painter [[William McTaggart]], who painted in 1894 a wonderful portrait of Joseph Henderson which was presented by the family of Joseph Henderson in 1925 to the Glasgow Museums.{{sfn|Cumming|2004}}

== Life ==
Gropius was born in [[Braunschweig]], the son of Wilhelm Ernst Gropius and his wife Lucie (née Graeffer). When he was still a child the family moved to Berlin where his father opened a mask factory and shop.&lt;ref name="db"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wirth |first1=Irmgard |title=Gropius, Carl |url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/pnd11686625X.html |website=www.deutsche-biographie.de |publisher=Deutsche Biographie |accessdate=28 August 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After training under his father in his teens he travelled in Europe to broaden his artistic education. In [[Paris]] he became familiar with the [[Louis Daguerre#Diorama theatres|diorama theatre]] invented by [[Louis Daguerre]] and [[Charles Marie Bouton]].&lt;ref name="Meyerbeer1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=Giacomo Meyerbeer|title=The Diaries of Giacomo Meyerbeer: The years of celebrity, 1850-1856|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NyPsNbLpntEC|accessdate=28 August 2018|year=1999|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=978-0-8386-3844-6|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Berlin he trained under the artist and architect [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]] as a [[landscape painter]]. From 1819 he worked as stage designer, artist and decorator for the ''Hoftheater'' (court theatre) and other Berlin theatres. In this capacity he designed inter alia the stage settings and backdrops for the premiere of ''[[Der Freischütz]]'' by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] which on 18 June 1821 opened the newly-rebuilt [[Schauspielhaus Berlin]], designed by his teacher Schinkel.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A Radice (ed.), 2003: ''Opera in Context: Essays on Historical Staging from the Late Renaissance to the Time of Puccini'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IesGLcf-2DMC&amp;pg=PA344&amp;lpg=PA344&amp;dq=gropius+ansichten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=A-7WzLSo4d&amp;sig=PeiJN3H2AHQeeDotbTJ33j8jkfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjO5JbzrYndAhWaOsAKHaMgBrgQ6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=gropius%20ansichten&amp;f=false (online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--In 1846 he published a collection of views of different places, the fruits of his travels, in 12 parts. A collection of his decorative work in various architectural styles also appeared in 1846. - yet to find any confirmation of this--&gt;

He had many pupils, including [[Eduard Gaertner]] and [[:sv:Emil Roberg|Emil Roberg]].

In 1822 Gropius was elected a member of the [[Prussian Academy of Arts]].&lt;ref name="Meyerbeer1999" /&gt;

In 1836 he opened a factory producing ''[[:de:Steinpappe|Steinpappe]]'' ("stone paper"), which was basically [[papier maché]] strengthened with glue and [[precipitated calcium carbonate]] (or precipitate chalk; ''Schwämmkreide''). This set to a stonelike consistency that took gilding well and was extremely easy to shape and cut, and was thus ideal for Gropius' stage settings and interior decorations.&lt;ref name="etz"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?isbn=3861532611 Arnold Etzold and Wolfgang Türk, 2002: ''Der Dorotheenstädtische Friedhof''. p.124. Ch Links Verlag {{ISBN|3861532611}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gropius died in Berlin on 20 February 1870 and was buried in the [[Neue Dorotheenstädtische Friedhof]].&lt;ref name="etz" /&gt;

==Family==
In 1820 Gropius married Claudine Coste (1801–1827), with whom he had three children:&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; Paul, who was also an artist and took over his father's businesses and succeeded him as the decorator and scenic artist in the ''Hoftheater'';&lt;ref name="db" /&gt; and two daughters, one of whom, Antonie, was the mother of the landscape artist [[:de:Paul Flickel|Paul Flickel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digishelf.de/objekt/733558798/99/ Ludwig Pietsch, ''"Waldlandschaft von Vilm" by Paul Flickel'' in ''Die deutsche Malerei der Gegenwart auf der Jubiläums-Ausstellung der Kgl.

The [[illuminated manuscript]] '''''Khamsa of Nizami'' [[British Library]], Or. 12208''' is a lavishly illustrated manuscript of the ''Khamsa'' or "five poems" of [[Nizami Ganjavi]], a 12th-century Persian poet, which was created for the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] in the early 1590s by a number of artists and a single scribe working at the Mughal court, very probably in Akbar's new capital of [[Lahore]] in  North [[India]], now in [[Pakistan]].  Apart from the fine [[calligraphy]] of the [[Farsi language|Persian text]], the manuscript is celebrated for over forty [[Mughal miniature]]s of the highest quality throughout the text; five of these are detached from the main manuscript and are in the [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]] as '''Walters Art Museum MS W.613'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedigitalwalters.org/Data/WaltersManuscripts/html/W613/description.html Walters database entry]&lt;/ref&gt;  The manuscript has been described as "one of the finest examples of the Indo-Muslim arts of the book",&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel &amp; Waghmar, 264&lt;/ref&gt; and "one of the most perfect of the ''de luxe'' type of manuscripts made for Akbar".&lt;ref name="Losty &amp; Roy, 49"&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nizami Ganjavi#Quinary .28.22Panj Ganj.22 or .22Khamsa.22.29|collection of five works]] by Nizami or Nizami is a classic of [[Persian poetry]] of which many luxury illuminated manuscript versions have been made; in particular this manuscript should not be confused with British Library, Or. 2265, a Persian manuscript of 1539-43 which is even better known.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, 22, 30, 70-97&lt;/ref&gt; The poems are in ''[[masnavi]]'' rhyming couplets.  The first poem is a collection of moral discourses illustrated by stories or [[parable]]s drawn mostly from the lives of historical figures, while the remaining four poems are romances, including many stories found in Persian tradition and earlier works such as the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' of [[Ferdowsi]].&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 7-8, with a fuller account as the miniatures are worked through&lt;/ref&gt;  Akbar had already commissioned a smaller manuscript of the ''Khamsa'', which was made in 1585-90.&lt;ref&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 48&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miniatures==
The miniatures are attributed by inscriptions to at least twenty artists, most of them apparently [[Hindu]]s, though the main artist, Khvaja Abd-al Samad, is Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 66&lt;/ref&gt; One miniature, of Khusraw hunting, is the latest known work of [[Abd al-Samad]], former head of the imperial workshop and one of the artists [[Humayun]] had brought from Persia some forty-five years earlier, at the start of the Mughal tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 193&lt;/ref&gt;  The single scribe was Abd al-Rahim ('Abd al-Rahim 'Ambarin Qalam), a leading calligrapher of the day. Unusually, when the manuscript was inherited by Akbar's son [[Jahangir]], an extra miniature was added by order of the new emperor with a double portrait showing the scribe at work facing Dawlat, the artist of the new miniature, making a drawing of him.  This is dated, with an illegible last digit, between 1611 and 1620.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;  Some miniatures are the work of more than one artist, typically dividing the work between drawing the overall composition, colouring  and faces. This had been a common method in the imperial workshop, but was giving way to having miniatures all painted by a single artist, as the Mughal style became increasingly concerned with fine detail and realistic depiction.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 17-20; [http://www.imagesonline.bl.uk/results.asp?image=006865 Full page image online, from the British Library]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from their main origin in the tradition of [[Persian miniature painting]], the style of the miniatures reflects Indian art and the Western art that was known in Akbar's court from contacts which included material brought by [[Jesuit]] missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 9, 10, 12, 70&lt;/ref&gt; While the landscapes often show European influence, and indeed north European characteristics, the many animals depicted mostly ignore the mythical beasts often seen in Persian painting, and emphasize species native to India, depicted with considerable naturalism.&lt;ref name="Losty &amp; Roy, 49"/&gt;

The choice and emphasis of the miniatures has certain distinctive features; the selection of subjects was probably made by the royal librarian and approved by the emperor, or possibly the emperor himself, possibly also in consultation with some of the artists. One of the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]]s, unusually, mentions that the book was "commissioned for the treasury of books and august library, servants of his majesty...".&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 80&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis on the duties, difficulties and splendour of kingship is to be expected in a royal commission, but another recurring theme, of the difficulties of relationships between fathers and sons, is much more individual to this book (miniatures 5, 14, 16, 18, 20).  There is a particular interest in visual art; apart from the unusual added portrait of the scribe and a painter, both Western-style art works and Hindu sculptures are depicted (miniatures, 25, 36, 44).  Events in the stories are probably also intended to refer to victories of Akbar, and his generosity to the conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Dharm Das - The Death of Darius - Walters W61326B - Full Page.jpg|thumb|''The Death of [[Darius III|Darius]]'', by Dharm Das, another Walters page]]
The manuscript in London has 325 folios of "light-brown polished paper" with a page size of 302 x 198&amp;nbsp;mm.  On text pages the ''[[nastaliq]]'' script is in four columns of 21 lines.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 71&lt;/ref&gt; There is also some text on most of the miniature pages, inside the rectangular frame in compartments of varying size, shape and placing.  The miniatures have somewhat variable rectangular frames of plain lines and bands of colour, outside which there are generous borders filled with very high quality gold ''[[grisaille]]'' decoration of plants, birds and animals, with some rocks and other landscape elements. Outside this are further plain frames, with a final zone of simple pen decoration which is probably recent as the form is different between the pages in London and those in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 8, 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The main London portion of the manuscript has 36 full-page figurative miniatures, one a double page spread.  Baltimore has four miniatures, also including one double page subject (so five pages). Two further miniatures (or one double one) are missing, as shown by a small and apparently early system of numbering the miniatures.  The manuscript therefore originally had 42 pages of miniatures, counting double pages as two.&lt;ref name="bb8"&gt;Brend, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Some miniatures are out of their natural sequence, but the numbering suggests the manuscript was made in this way.&lt;ref name="bb8" /&gt; Apart from the figurative miniatures, there are a number of pages with decorative panels of abstract motifs, plants and animals, especially at the beginning and end of sections of the work. The original painted and [[lacquer]]ed book covers each (front and back) have one side with a gold and brown scene of animals attacking other animals in a landscape and on the other side a scene with muted colour, one of a hunt and the other of an enthroned ruler, no doubt Akbar, being presented with the catch of game.  All four scenes are enclosed in a frame with two borders of elaborate decoration, which like much of the abstract decorative work is similar in style to Persian, or Mughal, carpet decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Brend, 66-69; Losty and Roy, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the manuscript is unknown after its ownership by Jahangir; the Mughal library amounted to some 24,000 manuscripts at its height, though many were taken by the Iranian [[Nadir Shah]] when he overran much of the Mughal empire in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Schimmel &amp; Waghmar, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The known history resumes in 1909, when the London portion was bought by the collector [[Charles William Dyson Perrins|C. W. Dyson Perrins]] (of the [[Worcestershire sauce]] family), who bequeathed it to the [[British Museum]] at his death in 1958.  It came to the British Library when it inherited the British Museum libraries on its foundation in 1973.  The Baltimore leaves had already been separated before 1909.&lt;ref name="bb8"/&gt; In 2013 pages from the manuscript were exhibited in the British Library's exhibition ''Mughal India: Art, Culture and Empire''.&lt;ref&gt;Losty &amp; Roy, 48-55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Layla and Majnun''' ({{lang-ar| مجنون ليلى}}), also '''Leili o Majnun''' ({{lang-fa|ليلى و مجنون}}), is a narrative poem composed in 584/1188 by the Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi|Niẓāmi Ganjavi]] based on a semi-historical [[Arab]] story about the 7th century [[Bedouin]] poet Qays ibn Al-Mulawwah and his ladylove Layla bint Mahdi (or Layla al-Aamiriya).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem|title=LEYLI O MAJNUN – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bruijn|first1=J.

[[Lord Byron]] called it “the [[Romeo and Juliet]] of the [[Middle East|East]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=[[Byron]] | title= The Giaour, a fragment of a Turkish tale | page=61 | publisher= London Printed by T.

Qays and Layla fall in love with each other when they are young, but when they grow up Layla’s father doesn't allow them to be together. Qays becomes obsessed with her, and his tribe Banu Amir and the community gives him the epithet of ''Majnūn'' ({{lang|ar|مجنون}} "crazy", lit. "possessed by [[Jinn]]"). Long before Nizami, the legend circulated in anecdotal forms in Iranian ''akhbar''. The early anecdotes and oral reports about Majnun are documented in ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'' and [[Ibn Qutaybah]]'s ''al-Shi'r wal-Shu'ara'.'' The anecdotes are mostly very short, only loosely connected, and show little or no plot development. [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]] collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers.&lt;ref name="Ghorab"&gt;Layli and Majnun: Love, Madness and Mystic Longing, Dr. Ali Asghar Seyed-Gohrab, Brill Studies in Middle Eastern literature, Jun 2003, {{ISBN|90-04-12942-1}}. excerpt:Although Majnun was to some extent a popular figure before Nizami’s time, his popularity increased dramatically after the appearance of Nizami’s romance. By collecting information from both secular and mystical sources about Majnun, Nizami portrayed such a vivid picture of this legendary lover that all subsequent poets were inspired by him, many of them imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance. As we shall see in the following chapters, the poet uses various characteristics deriving from [[‘Udhrite]] love poetry and weaves them into his own Persian culture&gt;. In other words, Nizami Persianises the poem by adding several techniques borrowed from the Persian epic tradition, such as the portrayal of characters, the relationship between characters, description of time and setting, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many other [[Persian people|Persian]] poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance.&lt;ref name="Ghorab" /&gt; Nizami drew influence from Udhrite love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing.&lt;ref name="Scroggins 1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3042384|title = Review|last = Scroggins|first = Mark|date = 1996|journal = African American Review|doi = 10.2307/3042384|pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many imitations have been contrived of Nizami's work, several of which are original literary works in their own right, including [[Amir Khusrow|Amir Khusrow Dehlavi]]'s ''Majnun o Leyli'' (completed in 1299), and [[Jami]]'s version, completed in 1484, amounts to 3,860 couplets. Other notable reworkings are by [[Maktabi Shirazi]], [[Hatefi]] (d. 1520), and [[Fuzûlî]] (d.1556), which became popular in [[Ottoman Turkey]] and [[India]]. [[Sir William Jones]] published Hatefi's romance in [[Calcutta]] in 1788. The popularity of the romance following Nizami's version is also evident from the references to it in lyrical poetry and mystical [[masnavi (poetic form)|mathnavis]]—before the appearance of Nizami's romance, there are just some allusions to Layla and Majnun in [[diwan (poetry)|divans]]. The number and variety of anecdotes about the lovers also increased considerably from the twelfth century onwards. Mystics contrived many stories about Majnun to illustrate technical mystical concepts such as ''[[Fana (Sufism)|fanaa]]'' (annihilation), ''divānagi'' (love-madness), [[self-sacrifice]], etc. Nizami's work has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Seyed-Gohrab |first= A.

==Story==
Qays ibn al-Mulawwah fell in love with Layla al-Aamiriya. He soon began composing poems about his love for her, mentioning her name often. His unselfconscious efforts to woo the girl caused some locals to call him "Majnun." When he asked for her hand in marriage, her father refused because it would be a scandal for Layla to marry someone considered mentally unbalanced. Soon after, Layla was married to another noble and rich merchant belonging to the [[Thaqif]] tribe in [[Ta'if]]. He was described as a handsome man with reddish complexion whose name was Ward Althaqafi. The [[Arabs]] called him Ward, meaning "rose" in Arabic.

When Majnun heard of her marriage, he fled the tribal camp and began wandering the surrounding desert. His family eventually gave up hope for his return and left food for him in the wilderness. He could sometimes be seen reciting poetry to himself or writing in the sand with a stick.

Layla is generally depicted as having moved to a place in Northern Arabia with her husband, where she became ill and eventually died. In some versions, Layla dies of heartbreak from not being able to see her would-be lover.  Majnun was later found dead in the wilderness in 688 AD, near Layla’s grave. He had carved three verses of poetry on a rock near the grave, which are the last three verses attributed to him.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Ouseley Add. 166 fol 13b.jpg|thumbnail|right|Layla visits Majnun in the wilderness; Indian watercolour held by the [[Bodleian Library]]]]
Many other minor incidents happened between his madness and his death. Most of his recorded poetry was composed before his descent into madness.

{{cquote|I pass by these walls, the walls of Layla&lt;br&gt;And I kiss this wall and that wall&lt;br&gt;It’s not Love of the walls that has enraptured my heart&lt;br&gt;But of the One who dwells within them}}

It is a tragic story of undying love much like the later ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. This type of love is known as "virgin love" because the lovers never marry or consummate their passion. Other famous virgin love stories set in [[Arabia]] are the stories of ''[[Qays and Lubna]]'', ''[[Kuthair and Azza]]'', ''[[Marwa and Al Majnoun Al Faransi]]'', and [[Antarah ibn Shaddad|''Antara and Abla'']]. This literary motif is common throughout the world, notably in the Muslim literature of [[South Asia]], such as [[Urdu]] [[ghazal]]s.

==History and influence==

===Persian adaptation and Persian literature===
[[File:Story of Mejnun - in wilderness.jpg|thumb|right|Majnun in the wilderness]]

The story of Layla and Majnun was known in Persia as early as the 9th century. Two well known Persian poets, [[Rudaki]] and [[Baba Taher]], both mention the lovers.&lt;ref&gt;•Zanjani, Barat. "Layla va Majnun-I Nizami Ganjavi: matn-I Ilmi va intiqadi az ru-yi qadimtari nuskha-hayi khatti-I qarn-I hashtum ba zikr-i ikhtilaf-i nusakh va ma’ani lughat va tarikbat va kashf al-bayat", Tehran, Mu’assasah-I Chap va Intisharat-I Danishgah Tehran, 1369[1990]

مشوش است دلم از کرشمهی سلمی
چنان که خاطره ی مجنون ز طره ی لیلی&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iranica.com"&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/leyli-o-majnun-narrative-poem A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, "LEYLI O MAJNUN" in Encyclopedia Iranica]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the story was known in Arabic literature in the 5th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Waheib |first1=Osama |title=Arabic Literature: The Immortal Love Story of Qays and Layla |url=http://arabicollege.com/arabic-literature-qays-and-layla/ |website=ArabiCollege |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it was the Persian masterpiece of [[Nizami Ganjavi]] that popularized it dramatically in Persian literature. Nizami collected both secular and mystical sources about Majnun and portrayed a vivid picture of the famous lovers.&lt;ref name="Ghorab" /&gt; Subsequently, many other [[Persian people|Persian]] poets imitated him and wrote their own versions of the romance.&lt;ref name="Ghorab" /&gt; Nizami drew influence from [[Udhrite]] love poetry, which is characterized by erotic abandon and attraction to the beloved, often by means of an unfulfillable longing.&lt;ref name="Scroggins 1996"/&gt; Other influences include older Persian epics, such as ''[[Vāmiq u 'Adhrā]]'', written in the 11th century, which covers a similar topic of a virgin and her passionate lover; the latter having to go through many trials to be with his love.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Virgin and Her Lover: Fragments of an Ancient Greek Novel and a Persian Epic Poem|last = T.

In his adaptation, the young lovers become acquainted at school and fell desperately in love. However, they could not see each other due to a family feud, and Layla's family arranged for her to marry another man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/perlm.htm ArtArena: "Layli and Madjnun in Persian Literature"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Rudolf Gelpke, "Many later poets have imitated Nizami's work, even if they could not equal and certainly not surpass it; Persians, Turks, Indians, to name only the most important ones. The Persian scholar Hekmat has listed no less than forty Persians and thirteen Turkish versions of ''Layli and Majnun''."&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Layla and Majnun, by Nizami. Translated Dr. Rudolf. Gelpke in collaboration with E. Mattin and G. Hill, Omega Publications, 1966, {{ISBN|0-930872-52-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vahid Dastgerdi, "If one would search all existing libraries, one would probably find more than 1000 versions of ''Layli and Majnun''."

In his statistical survey of famous Persian romances, Ḥasan Ḏulfaqāri enumerates 59 ‘imitations’ (naẓiras) of ''Layla and Majnun'' as the most popular romance in the Iranian world, followed by 51 versions of ''[[Ḵosrow o Širin]]'', 22 variants of [[Yusuf o Zuleikha]] and 16 versions of ''Vāmiq u ʿAḏhrā''.&lt;ref name="iranica.com"/&gt;

===Azerbaijani adaptation and Azerbaijani literature===
[[File:Keshan 01.jpg|thumb|[[Azerbaijani folk art]] based on the ''Layla and Majnun'' novel by [[Nizami Ganjavi]].]]

The story of Layla and Majnun passed into [[Azerbaijani literature]]. The [[Azerbaijani language]] adaptation of the story, ''Dâstân-ı Leylî vü Mecnûn'' (داستان ليلى و مجنون; "''The Epic of Layla and Majnun''") was written in the 16th century by [[Fuzûlî]] and [[Hagiri Tabrizi]]. Fuzûlî's version was borrowed by the renowned [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] composer [[Uzeyir Hajibeyov]], who used the material to create what became the Middle East's first opera. It premiered in [[Baku]] on 25 January 1908. The story had previously been brought to the stage in the late 19th century, when [[Ahmed Shawqi]] wrote a poetic play about the tragedy, now considered one of the best in modern Arab poetry. Majnun lines from the play are sometimes confused with his actual poems.

A scene of the poem is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Azerbaijani 100 and 50 [[Azerbaijani manat|manat]] [[commemorative coin]]s minted in 1996 for the 500th anniversary of Fuzûlî's life and activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbar.az Central Bank of Azerbaijan].

==Other influences==
The enduring popularity of the legend has influenced Middle Eastern literature, especially [[Sufi]] writers, in whose literature the name ''Layla'' refers to their concept of the Beloved. The original story is featured in [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s mystical writings, the ''[[Seven Valleys]]''. In Arabic language, ''Layla'' name means "night," and is thought to mean "one who works by night" or "worker of the dark." This is an apparent allusion to the fact that the romance of the star-crossed lovers was hidden and kept secret. In the [[Arabic language]], the word ''Majnun'' means "a crazy person." In addition to this creative use of language, the tale has also made at least one linguistic contribution, inspiring a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[colloquialism]]: to "feel like Mecnun" is to feel completely possessed, as might be expected of a person who is literally madly in love.

This epic poem was translated into [[English language|English]] by [[Isaac D'Israeli]] in the early 19th century allowing a wider audience to appreciate it.

Layla has also been mentioned in many works by [[Aleister Crowley]] in many of his religious texts, including [[The Book of Lies (Crowley)|''The Book of Lies'']].

In [[India]], it is believed that Layla and Majnun found refuge in a village in [[Rajasthan]] before they died. [[Laila Majnu Ki Mazar|The graves of Layla and Majnun]] are believed to be located in the Bijnore village near [[Anupgarh]] in the [[Sriganganagar]] district. According to rural legend there, Layla and Majnun escaped to these parts and died there. Hundreds of newlyweds and lovers from [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], despite there being no facilities for an overnight stay, attend the two-day fair in June.

Another variation on the tale tells of Layla and Majnun meeting in school. Majnun fell in love with Layla and was captivated by her. The school master would beat Majnun for paying attention to Layla instead of his school work. However, upon some sort of magic, whenever Majnun was beaten, Layla would bleed for his wounds. The families learnt of this strange magic and began to feud, preventing Layla and Majnun from seeing each other. They meet again later in their youth and Majnun wishes to marry Layla. Layla's brother, Tabrez, would not let her shame the family name by marrying Majnun. Tabrez and Majnun quarreled and, stricken with madness over Layla, Majnun murdered Tabrez. Word reached the village and Majnun was arrested. He was sentenced to be stoned to death by the villagers. Layla could not bear it and agreed to marry another man if Majnun would be kept safe from harm in exile. Her terms were accepted and Layla got married, but her heart still longed for Majnun. Hearing this, Layla's husband rode with his men into the desert to find Majnun. Upon finding him, Layla's husband challenged Majnun to the death. The instant her husband's sword pierced Majnun's heart, Layla collapsed in her home. Layla and Majnun were buried next to each other as her husband and their fathers prayed to their afterlife. Myth has it that Layla and Majnun met again in heaven, where they loved forever.

'''''Les Diaboliques''''' (''The She-Devils'') is a collection of [[short story|short stories]] written by [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly|Barbey d'Aurevilly]] and published in [[France]] in 1874. Each story features a woman who commits an act of violence, or revenge, or some other crime. It is considered d'Aurevilly's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=irwin&gt;Robert Irwin. ''Barbey D'Aurevilly and the Satanism of Appearance'' in &lt;u&gt;Les Diaboliques&lt;/u&gt;, 11-14. (Dedalus: Langford Lodge, St Judith's Lane Sawtry, Cambs, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Aurevilly, due to the boredom induced by [[bourgeois]] life in the [[Second French Republic]], was a [[dandy]]. Similarly, the acts committed by the characters in these stories are induced not only by their extreme passion but also by their boredom. Some of the characters spend hours playing [[whist]] while others take delight in wearing fine clothes. All of the female characters are best at concealing their passions and are strong, independent instigators.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

D'Aurevilly uses ''récit parlé'', a bracketing narrative, as a structural tool for five of the six short stories.

==Content==

*"The Crimson Curtain": An old [[vicomte]] tells a younger friend about his first sexual experience with a woman.
*"The Greatest Love of Don Juan": An aged playboy, surrounded by past lovers, relates the tale of his greatest love affair.
*"Happiness in Crime": A [[Count|comte]] falls in love with a skilled [[fencing|fencer]] and hires her as his wife's maid.
*"Beneath the Cards of a Game of Whist": The secret affair of a lady and an expert whist player leads to an horrific act.
*"At a Dinner of Atheists": A French officer relates a tale of love and lust with the wife of one of his fellow officers.
*"A Woman's Revenge": A wealthy princess spurns her ignoble husband by becoming a cheap prostitute.

==Publication==
D'Aurevilly wrote "The Crimson Curtain" in 1866. "The Greatest Love of Don Juan" followed in 1867. In 1870, d'Aurevilly retired to the [[Contentin Peninsula]] and finished the collection.

When the collection was first published in France in 1874, it caused up an uproar with the [[France|French]] public and the work was declared a danger to [[public morality]] and the Public Prosecutor issued orders for its seizure on the grounds of [[blasphemy]] and [[obscenity]]. D'Aurevilly defended the work, albeit tongue-in-cheek, by saying that he himself was a [[Christianity|Christian]] and the stories demonstrated the battle of good against evil.&lt;ref name=irwin /&gt;

A second edition was published in 1882. [[Dedalus Books]] published an English-language version in 1996.

==Film adaptations==

The dances that make up the '''list of DanceSport dances''' are performed competitively at amateur and professional levels throughout the world. Ten international style [[ballroom dance]]s&amp;mdash;five Standard and five Latin&amp;mdash;are defined by the '''[[World Dance Council]]''' (WDC), which has world-wide membership of all countries taking part in ballroom competitions. 

The WDC incorporates various groupings and former titles, such as  the [[World Dance and DanceSport Council]] (former title). The WDC is the governing body for international professional and amateur DanceSport. The [[World DanceSport Federation]] is, to some extent, a rival body which issues rules for amateur competitions.&lt;ref&gt;See the linked pages for details.&lt;/ref&gt; The list is supplemented by nine American style dances&amp;mdash;four Smooth and five Rhythm&amp;mdash;which are defined by United States dance organizations, such as USA Dance, (formerly USABDA, the United States Amateur Ballroom Dancers Association).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

Besides determining which dances are performed, these organizations specify many other aspects of their competitions, for instance, the [[tempo]] of music allowed and the duration of each competition round.

== WDC International style dances==
Within World Dance Council international competitions are two categories of dances, ''Ballroom'' (also called Standard or Modern) and ''Latin''.&lt;ref&gt;This is the present WDC terminology.&lt;/ref&gt; In England (e.g. at the [[Blackpool Dance Festival]]), the categories are traditionally called Ballroom and Latin American dances respectively. In the Ballroom dances, men typically wear [[Formal wear|evening dress]] (coattails, waistcoats and [[White tie|white bow ties]]), while women wear gowns. Partners remain in [[closed position]] throughout the dance, and movements tend to be elegant and sweeping. The ballroom dances are progressive, moving anti-clockwise round the floor. 

The Latin dances are more overtly sensual, with skimpy costumes for women and tight-fitting ones for men.&lt;ref&gt;Originally, 1930&amp;ndash;1960, clothing for latin dance was similar to ballroom, with at least dinner jackets and black tie for men, and simple dress for women, with skirts shorter than the ballroom gowns.&lt;/ref&gt; More variation in movement is allowed than in the Standard dances. Close, semi-open and open figures are danced. [[Choreography]] is now extremely important. Hip action - Latin technique is required; and athletic and balletic maneuvers are incorporated which makes it into a DanceSport. Two Latin dances are progressive going counter clockwise  (samba and paso doble), but there is no obligation to consistently move round the floor.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 89-90, 92-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==American style==

The Smooth and Rhythm categories of American style DanceSport roughly correspond to the Standard and Latin categories of International style. In Smooth, dancers wear costumes not greatly dissimilar to those worn by their counterparts in Standard---Standard dresses often have prominent floats embellishing the arms and fuller skirts which are typically absent in Smooth, due to the open movement and changing arm positions requiring less restriction on the body; however, the dances themselves are significantly different as a result of influence by dancers like [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Arthur Murray]] in the years following [[World War II]].  While elegance and flow remain the goal, as in International Standard, dancers do not remain in [[closed position]] exclusively, instead breaking away from each other periodically and experimenting with open footwork.  The Rhythm dances were also influenced by American dancers of the post-World War II era, but the differences between it and International Latin are more subtle.  Costumes are similar, and while step patterns are not identical, movements are as free and explicitly sensual as in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Picart, 90-95&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cleanup-reorganize|date=August 2016}}
The music articles in [[Rees's Cyclopaedia|Rees's ''Cyclopaedia'']] were written by [[Charles Burney]] (1726–1814), with additional material by [[John Farey, sr]] (1766–1826), and [[John Farey, Jr]] (1791–1851), and illustrated by 53 plates as well a numerous examples of music typset within the articles.

Charles Burney was well known as the author of a ''General History of Music'', 4 vol 1776–1789 and two travel diaries recording his Musical Tours collecting information in France and Italy, and later Germany, 1+2 vol, 1771 and 1773, as well as the ''Commemoration of Handel'', 1785 and his ''Musical Memoirs of Metastasio'', 1796. John Farey, sr was a polymath, well known today for his work as a geologist and for his investigations of the mathematics of sound, and the schemes of temperamant used in tuning musical instruments then. His son, John Farey, jr, was also polymathic in his interests. He contributed numerous drawings for the illustrations of mostly technological and scientific topics in Rees's Cyclopaedia.

The index to plates in Vol 39 of the work notes that plates XXXIV — XLIV were intended to include selections from the works of Haydn and Mozart, and also various National Airs. Since they were readily accessible elsewhere they were omitted to save expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rees|first1=Abraham|title=Rees's Cyclopaedia|date=1819|publisher=Longmans|location=London|edition=|url=https://archive.org/stream/cyclopaediaorun39rees#page/n697/mode/1up|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plate XLV was also omitted.

[[Wilson Lowry]] engraved a number of the general plates in Miscellany and with [[John Farey Jr]], the draughtsman, those on the Hawkins's Claviole and the set on the Organ.&lt;ref&gt;Woolrich, A. P., "John Farey, Jr., technical author and draughtsman: his contribution to Rees's ''Cyclopædia''". ''Industrial Archaeology Review'', 20, (1998), 49-68 [http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm AIA Abstracts 1998. ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207111214/http://www.industrial-archaeology.org.uk/arev20.htm |date=2006-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The examples of music notation in the Music section must be presumed to have been originally written out by Burney, and were engraved by a Jno [John] Lee.&lt;ref&gt;Lee has not been identified, but there was a wood engraver of that name, who died in 1804.&lt;/ref&gt;  All the plates of musical instruments were also engraved by Lee. A number were drawn by a T. Webster. One was drawn by [[Edward Francis Burney|Edward Francesco Burney]], Charles Burney's nephew, and another by an artist named Strange.

'''''Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13''''' (published in [[paperback]] as '''''Apollo 13'''''), is a non-fiction book first published in 1994 by astronaut [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]] and journalist [[Jeffrey Kluger]], about the failed April 1970 [[Apollo 13]] lunar landing mission which Lovell commanded. The book is the basis of the 1995 film adaptation ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'', directed by [[Ron Howard]].

==Background==
Apollo 13 was the third mission of the [[Apollo program]] intended to land men on the Moon. An explosion of an onboard [[liquid oxygen]] tank in the Service Module, when the craft was close to reaching the Moon, crippled the electrical power generation and propulsion systems for the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] ''Odyssey''. This necessitated the abort of the lunar landing, and placed the lives of astronauts Lovell, [[Jack Swigert]], and [[Fred Haise]] in serious jeopardy. The mission became famous for the safe return of the men, made possible by the [[flight controller]]s' resourceful adaptation of the electrical, propulsion, and life support systems of the [[Apollo Lunar Module|LM (Lunar Module)]] ''Aquarius'' as a "lifeboat".

'''Marcel Moore''' (19 July 1892 – 19 February 1972), born '''Suzanne Alberte Malherbe''', was a French illustrator, designer, and photographer. She, along with her romantic and creative [[domestic partner|partner]] [[Claude Cahun]], was a surrealist writer and photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Early life==
Moore was born Suzanne Alberte Malherbe in [[Nantes]], France on 19 July 1892,&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Downie|first=Louise|date=|year=2005|title=Sans Nom: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=https://www.jerseyheritage.org/media/PDF-Heritage-Mag/Sans%20Nom%20Claude%20Cahun%20%20Marcel%20Moore.pdf|journal=Heritage Magazine|volume=2005|pages=8–9|via=|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied at the Fine Arts Academy in Nantes.  In 1909, at age seventeen, Malherbe met fifteen-year-old Lucie Schwob and began a lifelong artistic collaboration.&lt;ref name="Acting"&gt;{{cite web|last=Latimer|first=Tirza True|title=Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/Tirza/TirzaEssay1.html|website=QueerCulturalCenter.org|publisher=Queer Cultural Center|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malherbe's widowed mother married Schwob's divorced father in 1917.  Curator Tirza True Latimer has theorized that this step-sister relationship not only encouraged the young ladies' creative collaborations but also diverted attention from their lesbian relationship.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  Between 1920 and 1937, they lived in Paris, where they became involved with the [[surrealism]] movement and contributed to avant-garde theater activities.&lt;ref name="Daily"&gt;{{cite web|last=Villareal, ed.|first=Jose|title=Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore|url=http://artdaily.com/news/15056/Acting-Out--Claude-Cahun-and-Marcel-Moore#.VPtJaMYhw-8|website=ArtDaily.com|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They took gender-neutral [[pseudonym]]s: Malherbe became Marcel Moore, and Schwob became [[Claude Cahun]].&lt;ref name="Odysseys"&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon-Godeau|first=Abigail|editor1-last=Rice|editor1-first=Shelley|title=Inverted Odysseys: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Cindy Sherman|year=1999|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0262681064|pages=116|chapter=The Equivocal "I": Claude Cahun as Lesbian Subject}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Cahun described Moore as "''l'autre moi''" (the other me), and they remained together until Cahun's death in 1954.&lt;ref name="Odysseys" /&gt;

==Career==
In her early twenties Moore worked as a graphic designer, producing ornate illustrations influenced by the [[japonism]] trend and the Paris fashion scene of the 1910s.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; Her modern fashion designs were published in the newspaper ''Phare de la Loire'', owned by the Schwob family.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  She also collaborated with the poet [[Marc-Adolphe Guégan]], producing illustrations for two of his books: ''L'Invitation à la fête primitive'' (1921) and ''Oya-Insula ou l'Enfant à la conque'' (1923).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illustration by Marcel Moore for Oya-Insula ou l'Enfant à la Conque by Marc-Adolphe Guégan|url=http://www.connectotel.com/cahun/guegan-moore.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcel Moore is best known as Claude Cahun's collaborator. Cahun's photographic oeuvre, all but forgotten for a few decades, was rediscovered in the 1980s and interpreted as a predecessor of [[Cindy Sherman]]'s theatrical self-portraits.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chadwick|first=Whitney|title=Mirror Images: Women, Surrealism, and Self-Representation|year=1998|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=0262531577|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, recent scholarship suggests that Moore was not only a muse but also had an active hand in the creation of some of Cahun's best-known works.  In an essay for the 2005–2006 exhibition ''Acting Out: Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore'' at the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, curator Tirza True Latimer argues that Claude Cahun's own photographs are not so much "self-portraits" as collaborations with Marcel Moore.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  At times, the women photographed each other posing alternately in the same tableau.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;  Moore's shadow is visible in some photographs of Cahun, making visible her own role behind the camera.&lt;ref name="Acting" /&gt;

Moore illustrated Cahun's creative writing on several occasions.  For Cahun's 1919 poetry volume ''Vues et visions'', Moore created pen-and-ink illustrations similar to the decorative style of Aubrey Beardsley.&lt;ref name="Women"&gt;{{cite book|last=Latimer|first=Tirza True|title=Women Together/Women Apart: Portraits of Lesbian Paris|year=2005|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=0-8135-3594-8|pages=76–80, 137–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore was the subject of Cahun's dedication, "I dedicate this puerile prose to you, so that the entire book will belong to you and in this way your designs may redeem my text in our eyes."&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt; In 1930 Cahun and Moore published a second book of verses and illustrations called ''Aveux non avenus'' (translated as "disavowed confessions").  Moore's illustrations for this work consist of collaged images assembled from her many photographs of Cahun, dealing with many of the same themes of identity that are can be read in Cahun's own photography and poetry.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;

==Activism==
In 1937 Moore and Cahun moved from Paris to [[Jersey]], possibly to escape the increasing [[anti-Semitism]] and political upheavals leading up to World War II.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  They remained on the island of Jersey when German troops invaded in 1940.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;  For several years, the two women risked their lives by distributing anti-Nazi propaganda to the German soldiers.&lt;ref name="Nazi"&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Katherine|title=Claude Cahun as Anti-Nazi Resistance Fighter|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/exhibits/odysseys/Nazi/body_nazi.html|website=NYU.edu|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite having reverted to their original names and introducing themselves as sisters in Jersey, their resistance activities were discovered in 1944, and the women were sentenced to death and imprisoned.  They were saved by the Liberation of Jersey in 1945, but their home and property had been confiscated and much of their art destroyed by the Germans.&lt;ref name="Women" /&gt;

==Later life==
Claude Cahun's health suffered during her wartime imprisonment; she died in 1954, after which Moore relocated to a smaller home.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt;  Moore committed suicide in 1972.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; She was buried with her partner Claude Cahun in [[St Brelade's Church]].

==Legacy==
In 2018, a street of Paris, close to the rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs where Suzanne and Lucie lived, took the name of "Allée Claude Cahun - Marcel Moore&lt;ref&gt; [http://a06.apps.paris.fr/a06/jsp/site/plugins/solr/modules/ods/DoDownload.jsp?id_document=144541&amp;items_per_page=20&amp;sort_name=&amp;sort_order=&amp;terms=cahun&amp;query=cahun Conseil de Paris]&lt;/ref&gt;" in the 6th district of the French capital.

'''''Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company''''' ({{lang-nl|Max Havelaar, of de koffi-veilingen der Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappy}}) is an 1860 novel by [[Multatuli]] (the [[pen name]] of Eduard Douwes Dekker), which played a key role in shaping and modifying [[Dutch Ethical Policy|Dutch colonial policy]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. In the novel, the protagonist, Max Havelaar, tries to battle against a corrupt government system in [[Java]], which was then a Dutch [[colony]].

==Background==
By the mid-nineteenth century, the colonial control of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (present-day [[Indonesia]]) had passed from the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) to the Dutch government due to the economic failure of the VOC.  In order to increase revenue, the Dutch colonial government implemented a series of policies termed the [[Cultivation System]] (Dutch: ''cultuurstelsel''), which mandated Indonesian farmers to grow a quota of commercial crops such as [[sugar]] and [[coffee]], instead of growing [[staple food]]s such as rice.  At the same time, the colonial government also implemented a tax collection system in which the collecting agents were paid by [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]]. The combination of these two strategies caused widespread abuse of colonial power, especially on the islands of Java and [[Sumatra]], resulting in abject poverty and widespread starvation of the farmers. The colony was governed with a minimum of soldiers and Government officials. The former rulers maintained their absolute power and control over the natives. A quite common strategy used by many colonizing countries.
 
In addition, the Dutch state earned a fortune with the sale of opium to the natives, this opium-trade was started centuries before during the VOC-times. At that time opium was the only known effective pain killer, and a considerable percentage of the natives were hooked on it, being kept poor in this way. This was called the "opium-regime". To distinguish between smuggled and legal opium, a simple reagent was added. After discovery the smuggler could count on a severe punishment.

Multatuli wrote ''Max Havelaar'' in protest against these colonial policies, but another goal was to seek rehabilitation for his resignation from governmental service. Despite its terse writing style, it raised the awareness of Europeans living in Europe at the time that the wealth that they enjoyed was the result of suffering in other parts of the world. This awareness eventually formed the motivation for the new [[Dutch Ethical Policy|Ethical Policy]] by which the Dutch colonial government attempted to "repay" their debt to their colonial subjects by providing education to some classes of natives, generally members of the elite loyal to the colonial government.

Indonesian novelist [[Pramoedya Ananta Toer]] argued that by triggering these educational reforms, ''Max Havelaar'' was in turn responsible for the nationalist movement that ended Dutch colonialism in Indonesia after 1945, and which was instrumental in the call for [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonization in Africa]] and elsewhere in the world. Thus, according to Pramoedya, ''Max Havelaar'' is "the book that killed colonialism".&lt;ref name="pramoedya1999"&gt;Pramoedya Ananta Toer (1999). "[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/18/magazine/best-story-the-book-that-killed-colonialism.html The book that killed colonialism]". ''The New York Times Magazine''. April 18: 112–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last chapter the author announces that he will translate the book "into the few languages I know, and into the many languages I can learn." In fact, ''Max Havelaar'' has been translated into thirty-four languages. It was first translated into English in 1868. In Indonesia, the novel was cited as an inspiration by [[Sukarno]] and other early nationalist leaders, such as the author's [[Indo people|Indo]] (Eurasian) descendant [[Ernest Douwes Dekker]], who had read it in its original [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. It was not translated into [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] until 1972.&lt;ref name="feenberg1997"&gt;Feenberg, Anne-Marie (1997). "''Max Havelaar'': an anti-imperialist novel". ''MLN'' 112(5):817–835.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the novel, the story of Max Havelaar, a Dutch colonial administrator, is told by two diametrically opposed characters: the hypocritical coffee merchant Droogstoppel, who intends to use Havelaar's manuscripts to write about the coffee trade, and the romantic German apprentice Stern, who takes over when Droogstoppel loses interest in the story. The opening chapter of the book nicely sets the tone of the [[satire|satirical]] nature of what is to follow, with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At the very end of the novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a vocal denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and a plea to the king of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.

==Film version==
The novel was filmed in 1976 by [[Fons Rademakers]] as part of a Dutch-Indonesian partnership. The film ''[[Max Havelaar (film)|Max Havelaar]]'' was not allowed to be shown in Indonesia until 1987.

==Editions==
The Edition history of the book "Max Havelaar" began in the 1860s with a publication titled "Max Havelaar, of De koffi-veilingen der Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappy". During the life of the author Multatuli published six press-edition of the Max Havelaar in the Netherlands, with three different publishers. In addition, Dekker made a significant contribution to the first translation of the book in English. After Dekkers death, the book many times reprinted. The text in the reprints, now to be found in the bookstores is sometimes based on the version of 1875, sometimes on the handwriting, and, increasingly, on the fifth edition of 1881, the last edition revised by the author.
* 17 May 1860: the first edition : publishing house J. de Ruyter in Amsterdam. Three days earlier, on May 14, the book was already available.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kets-Vree, "Mutatuli, Max Havelaar'', part 2, p. XXV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dik van der Meulen, ''Multatuli, leven en werk van Eduard Douwes Dekker'', Sun, Amsterdam, 2002, {{ISBN|905875202X}}, p. 412&lt;/ref&gt; The edition in 1300 copies

The edition of 1300 copies was on large octavo printed by Munster and sons. [6] There were two parts, by 212 and 185 pages. The books were sold for 4 guilders, a very amount at that time. Many famelies had to life a week or longer to get around.

* 1860: second edition: J. de Ruyter, Amsterdam,

The appearance of the book and typography did not differ from the first edition. The page layout and all lines were identical, so it seemed that it was printed from the same type used for the first edition. Yet the book completely typeset anew. The book appeared again in two parts. The first part on 8 November 1860, the second part on 22 November. The exact size of the edition is unknown, but was probably between 700 and 1200 copies. The price for both parts was again 4 guilders.&lt;ref&gt;A. Kets-Vree, ''Multatuli, Max Havelaar'', part 2, p. XLIX&lt;/ref&gt;

* double edition of the second edition: J. de Ruyter, Amsterdam,

The printing history of this book is complicated: In 1985 Anne Kets-Vree discovered a secret edition of this book. Appearance and typography of the book are identical and the title page still mentions 'Second Edition'. The book, however, was printed for the third time. The double pressure could be identified with a printer's error in rule 5 of the first chapter: "lieve lezer'''s'''" (dear readers) instead of "lieve lezer" (Dear reader)

{{cquote|1=[....] dat gij, lieve lezers, zoo even ter hand hebt genomen, en dat [....]".}}

The reason for this sneaky edition can only be guessed. The number of copies is unknown. Given the investment required in new matter will certainly not have skied the number of copies for the earlier editions.

* February 1868: English translation: ''Max Havelaar or the Coffee auctions of the Dutch Trading Company''. by Multatuli. Translated from the original manuscript by Baron Alphonse Nahuÿs, Edinburgh, Edmonston &amp; Douglas,&lt;ref&gt;A. Kets-Vree, Multatuli, Max Havelaar, deel 2, p. LXXXI&lt;/ref&gt; Price: 12 shillings.

From 12 March 1868 was also the book for sale in Netherlands. This has been the first edition made in cooperation with the author. Nahuys mentioned he used the original manuscript. But this manuscript was still with the editor of the first edition, De Ruyter.

* December 1871 -  20 January 1872: Third edition, Karel Hermanus Schadd, 296 pages, 5000 copies (small octavo 18,5 × 13&amp;nbsp;cm) price ƒ 2.90 + 100 copies of the luxe edition. price: ƒ 7.50 (large octavo 24 × 17&amp;nbsp;cm)  &lt;ref&gt;{{aut|A. Kets-Vree}}, ''Multatuli, Max Havelaar'', deel 2, p. XXXII&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870 De Ruyter sold his copyright for 2000 guilders. The text-source for this edition was the double-edition of the second-edition: The mistake in that edition remains: ''lieve lezer'''s''' '' Both editions ware printed of the same type, only the size of the paper was different.

Now there was a cheap edition of the book, but Douwes Dekker had no part anymore in the sales and did not get income out of it. On top of this, he had no possibility at all to add or change anything inside the text.

Early 1873 Schadd sold his righte for the book ƒ 2500 to the firm V/d Heuvell &amp; Van Santen in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nieuwsblad voor den boekhandel'', 31 januari 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

* 4th edition: G.L.Funke, Amsterdam, 19 October 1875, 388 pages, small octavo, 5000 copies

This is the first edition, done in cooperation with the author. In it many mistakes and alterations in the first edition could be taken away. Dekker added also a lot of comments to the text, to explain his attentions.

* 5th edition: Uitgevers Maatschappij Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1 November 1881, small octavo, ƒ 1,90 bound in paper ƒ 2,40 for copies in a hard cover.

Second (and last) edition in cooperation with the author. Of this edition there have been 4 variants found, in the type at the press some changes were made, on both sides of the leaf. The already printed papers, were not thrown away, but were still used. Combining 2 different leaves makes 4 combinations possible. Copies of all 4 combinations have been identified.

* ''[http://www.textualscholarship.nl/?p=3784 Multatuli, Max Havelaar of De koffiveilingen der Nederlandsche Handelmaatschappy]''. Critical edition, edited by Annemarie Kets-Vree. Monumenta Literaria Neerlandica VI, 1 and VI, 2. Assen/Maastricht, 1992.

'''Non-fiction''' or '''nonfiction''' is [[content (media)|content]] (sometimes, in the form of a [[narrative|story]]) whose creator, in [[good faith]], assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, or information presented.&lt;ref name ="litfiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Farner|first=Geir|year=2014|title=Literary Fiction: The Ways We Read Narrative Literature|chapter=Chapter 2: What is Literary Fiction?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXXHAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as [[fiction]].&lt;ref name ="litfiction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=31|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction|quote=Non-fictional discourse is usually embedded in a context that tells you how to take it: an instruction manual, a newspaper report, a letter from a charity. The context of fiction, though, explicitly leaves open the question of what the fiction is really about. Reference to the world is not so much a property of literary [i.e. fictional] works as a function they are given by interpretation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonfiction, which may be presented either [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]] or [[Subjectivity|subjectively]], is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, [[prose]] writing),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/non-fiction "Non-fiction". ''Oxford Dictionaries''. Oxford University Press, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt; the other traditional division being [[fiction]], which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.

Non-fiction's specific factual assertions and descriptions may or may not be accurate, and can give either a [[Truth|true]] or a [[Lie|false]] account of the subject in question. However, authors of such accounts genuinely believe or claim them to be truthful at the time of their composition or, at least, pose them to a convinced audience as [[history|historical]]ly or [[empirical]]ly factual. Reporting the [[belief]]s of others in a nonfiction format is not necessarily an endorsement of the ultimate veracity of those beliefs, it is simply saying it is true that people believe them (for such topics as [[mythology]]). Nonfiction can also be written about [[fiction]], typically known as [[literary criticism]], giving information and analysis on these other works. Nonfiction need not necessarily be written [[Text (literary theory)|text]], since [[picture]]s and [[film]] can also purport to present a factual account of a subject.

==Distinctions==
The numerous [[literary]] and creative devices used within fiction are generally thought inappropriate for use in nonfiction. They are still present particularly in older works but they are often muted so as not to overshadow the information within the work. Simplicity, clarity and directness are some of the most important considerations when producing nonfiction. Audience is important in any artistic or descriptive endeavor, but it is perhaps most important in nonfiction. In fiction, the writer believes that readers will make an effort to follow and interpret an indirectly or abstractly presented progression of theme, whereas the production of nonfiction has more to do with the direct provision of information. Understanding of the potential readers' use for the work and their existing knowledge of a subject are both fundamental for effective nonfiction. Despite the truth of nonfiction, it is often necessary to persuade the reader to agree with the ideas and so a balanced, coherent and informed argument is vital. However, the boundaries between fiction and nonfiction are continually blurred and argued upon, especially in the field of biography;&lt;ref name="The Art of Life"&gt;{{cite web|last=The Institute of Art and Ideas|title=The Art of Life|url=http://iai.tv/video/the-art-of-life|publisher=IAI|accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  as [[Virginia Woolf]] said: "if we think of truth as something of granite-like solidity and of personality as something of rainbow-like intangibility and reflect that the aim of biography is to weld these two into one seamless whole, we shall admit that the problem is a stiff one and that we need not wonder if biographers, for the most part failed to solve it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolf|first=Virginia|title=Orlando|year=2010|publisher=Aziloth Books|isbn=978-1907523687|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-fiction is fiction implementing a great deal of nonfiction,&lt;ref&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=981296 The Role of Narrative Fiction and Semi-Fiction in Organizational Studies] G. Whiteman. N. Phillips. 13 2006, 12&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a fictional description based on a true story.

==Major types==
Common literary examples of nonfiction include [[expository writing|expository]], [[Rhetorical modes#argument|argumentative]], functional, and [[opinion piece]]s; [[essay]]s on art or literature; [[biography|biographies]]; [[memoir]]s; [[journalism]]; and historical, [[scientific writing|scientific]], [[technical writing|technical]], or economic writings (including electronic ones).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Quality Reading Instruction in the Age of Common Core Standards|editors=Susan B. Neuman and Linda B. Gambrell|page=46|year=2013|publisher=International Reading Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzbNGWVonZIC&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journals, [[photograph]]s, [[textbook]]s, [[travel books]], [[blueprint]]s, and [[diagram]]s are also often considered non-fictional.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Including information that the author knows to be untrue within any of these works is usually regarded as dishonest. Other works can legitimately be either fiction or nonfiction, such as journals of self-expression, [[Letter (message)|letter]]s, [[magazine]] articles, and other expressions of imagination. Though they are mostly either one or the other, it is possible for there to be a blend of both. Some fiction may include nonfictional elements. Some nonfiction may include elements of unverified [[supposition]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], or [[imagination]] for the purpose of smoothing out a [[narrative]], but the inclusion of open falsehoods would discredit it as a work of nonfiction. The publishing and bookselling business sometimes uses the phrase "literary nonfiction" to distinguish works with a more literary or intellectual bent, as opposed to the greater collection of nonfiction subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/publishers/adult/penguinpress.html www.us.penguingroup.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213211558/http://www.us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/publishers/adult/penguinpress.html |date=2014-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!''''' (sometimes '''''Okay Hot-Shot''''') is a 1963 [[pop art]] painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that uses his [[Ben-Day dots]] style and a [[text balloon]]. It is one of several examples of [[military art]] that Lichtenstein created between 1962 and 1964, including several with aeronautical themes like this one. It was inspired by panels from four different comic books that provide the sources for the plane, the pilot, the text balloon and the graphic [[onomatopoeia]], "VOOMP!".

Lichtenstein made several alterations to the source images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works. The narrative content is also said to relate to themes from other works, but instead of Lichtenstein's own works it relates to [[Jackson Pollock]]'s contemporaneous works.

== Background ==
During the late 1950s and early 1960s a number of American painters began to adapt the imagery and motifs of [[comic strip]]s. Lichtenstein made drawings of comic strip characters in 1958. [[Andy Warhol]] produced his earliest paintings using this style in 1960. Lichtenstein, unaware of Warhol's work, produced ''Look Mickey'' and ''Popeye'' in 1961.&lt;ref name="Livingstone 2000"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Soon, Lichtenstein advanced from animated cartoons to more serious themes such as romance and combat depictions.&lt;ref name="Lanchner 2009"&gt;

Lichtenstein said that at the time, "I was very excited about, and very interested in, the highly emotional content yet detached impersonal handling of love, hate, war, etc., in these cartoon images."&lt;ref name="Lanchner 2009"/&gt; The work was inspired by five different comic book panels made by [[Russ Heath]] and [[Irv Novick]].&lt;ref name="Baker 2011-04-06"&gt;

His list of aeronautically themed works is extensive, including several others featuring pilots situated in cockpits during air combat such as ''[[Jet Pilot (Roy Lichtenstein)|Jet Pilot]]'' (1962), ''[[Brattata]]'' (1962), and ''[[Bratatat!]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003 01"&gt;

''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'' is one of several comics-based works, including ''Jet Pilot'' and ''Von Karp'', inspired by the World War II U.S. fighter pilot Johnny Cloud of [[DC Comics]]' ''[[The Losers (comics)|The Losers]]''.&lt;ref name="YaleUP 2012-06-26"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;   The January–February 1962 DC Comics' ''[[All-American Men of War]]'' issue #89 was the inspiration for several Lichtenstein paintings, providing two of the source panels of ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'' as well as sources for ''Brattata'', ''Blam'', ''Whaam!'' and ''Tex!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=4381129|title=High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture: Searching High and Low|author= Armstrong,  Matthew|volume=2|issue=6|date=Autumn 1990|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]]|pages=4–8, 16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The graphite pencil sketch, ''Jet Pilot'' was also from that issue.&lt;ref name="ID 3163"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://image-duplicator.com/main.php?work_id=3163&amp;year=1962&amp;decade=60# | title = Jet Pilot | accessdate = June 24, 2013 | publisher = LichtensteinFoundation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critical appraisal ==

[[File:Roy Lichtenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|Lichtenstein in 1967]]
In the source, the pilot wore traditional World War II headgear, but Lichtenstein altered the headgear to that of a [[cosmonaut]], [[astronaut]] or modern air force pilot of the [[Cold War]] era.&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003 02"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Lichtenstein also shifted the subject so that his left [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is in the frame.&lt;ref name="Baker 2011-04-06"/&gt; The work also is related to Lichtenstein's theme of "machine and embodied vision" as exhibited in works such as ''[[Crak!]]'', ''Bratatat!'', and ''Jet Pilot''.&lt;ref name=RLGB&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|editor=Bader, Graham|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-262-01258-4|chapter=Technology Envisioned: Lichtenstein's Monocularity|author=Lobel, Michael|pages=118–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative content, "Okay, hot-shot, okay! I'm pouring! [ammunition into the enemy]" is said to have a dual meaning that alludes to the style of poured painting being made famous at the time by Pollock.&lt;ref name="Baker 2011-04-06"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pisano 2003 01"/&gt; Melodrama through heightened tension ties this with some of Lichtenstein's most notable works.&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002 03"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While melding the elements and motifs of panels from two artists, Lichtenstein simplified the hatching and use of color.&lt;ref name="Lobel 2002 02"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In Lichtenstein's [[obituary]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' critic Christopher Knight said the use of color in this work harkened back to works by [[Morris Louis]] and the explosion's graphic elements recalled [[Kenneth Noland]]'s target work.&lt;ref name="Knight 1997-09-30"&gt;

In an account published in 1998 after Lichtenstein was famous, Irv Novick said that he met Lichtenstein in the army in 1947 and, as his superior officer, had responded to Lichtenstein's tearful complaints about the menial tasks he was assigned by recommending him for a better job.&lt;ref name="Beaty" /&gt; Jean-Paul Gabilliet has questioned this account, saying that Lichtenstein had left the army a year before the time Novick says the incident took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gabilliet| first = Jean-Paul| title = Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=J1t8g_yX1wcC&amp;pg=PA350| year = 2009| publisher = [[University Press of Mississippi]]| isbn = 1-60473-267-9| page = 350 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart Beaty, noting that Lichtenstein had appropriated Novick for works such as ''Whaam!'' and ''Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!'', says that Novick's story "seems to be an attempt to personally diminish" the more famous artist.&lt;ref name="Beaty"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/crv/summary/v034/34.3beaty.html|title=Roy Lichtenstein's Tears: Art vs. Pop in American Culture|accessdate=June 30, 2013|volume=34|issue=3|year=2004|author=Beaty, Bart|work=Canadian Review of American Studies|pages=249–268}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae.djvu|page=5|thumb|right|Title page]]
'''''On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae''''' is an 1809 paper on the family [[Proteaceae]] of flowering plants. Although nominally written by [[Joseph Knight (gardener)|Joseph Knight]] as a paper on cultivation techniques, all but 13 pages consists of an unattributed taxonomic revision now known to have been written by [[Richard Salisbury]].

Publication of the paper triggered one of the most bitter disputes in 19th century botany, because Salisbury had preempted the publication of numerous plant names that [[Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773)|Robert Brown]] had intended to publish. Brown's paper had already been read to the [[Linnean Society of London]], at meeting which Salisbury had attended, but his paper had not yet made it to print. In publishing this paper before Brown's ''[[On the natural order of plants called Proteaceae]]'' had been printed, Salisbury beat Brown to print, claiming priority for the names that Brown had authored. As a result of this, Salisbury was accused of [[plagiarism]] and ostracised from botanical circles. Contemporary notes and letters indicate widespread condemnation of Salisbury's actions. For example, [[Samuel Goodenough]] wrote "How shocked was I to see Salisbury's surreptitious anticipation of Brown's paper on new Holland plants, under the name and disguise of Mr. Hibbert's gardener! Oh it is too bad!"; and [[James Edward Smith]] wrote that he had a copy of Knight's paper "but shall not keep it — I mean hereafter not to notice it or any other of the author's productions." Brown himself wrote of Salisbury "I scarcely know what to think of him except that he stands between a rogue and a fool."

Initially, Salisbury's names were ignored in favour of Brown's names. When the [[nomen conservandum|conservation]] of generic names was introduced in the 1900s, Brown's genera were formally conserved. However it was not possible to conserve species names until the 1980s, by which time the priority of Salisbury's species names had long been accepted. Thus ''On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae'' is the source of numerous names of Proteaceae taxa.

[[File:Perseo y Andrómeda, por Tiziano.jpg|thumb|370px|''Perseus and Andromeda'' ]] 
'''''Perseus and Andromeda''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Titian]], now in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London. It was painted in 1554–56 as part of a series of mythological paintings called "''poesie''" ("poetry") intended for King [[Philip II of Spain]].  The paintings took subjects from the Roman poet [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', in this case Book IV, lines 663–752,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355-56&lt;/ref&gt; and all featured female nudes.

The painting is in oils on canvas, and measures 175 x 189.5 cm.  It was probably one already described as "damaged" in 1605, and has suffered subsequent damages, as well as apparently being cut down along all the sides. Scientific imaging techniques show an unusually large number of changes as the composition evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the hero [[Perseus]] flying through the air in combat to kill the sea monster who has come to kill [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], who has been chained to a cliff by the sea shore for him.  Perseus has already attacked and wounded the monster on the shoulder.&lt;ref name="I355"&gt;Ingamells, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is well-travelled; painted in [[Venice]], it was delivered in modern [[Belgium]], then went to Spain, Italy, England, and France before returning to England.

==Subject and sources==
[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Andromeda liberata da Perseo.jpg|thumb|''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]], c. 1510, one of the few earlier easel paintings of the topic [[Uffizi]]]]
In Greek mythology, the kingdom of [[Aethiopia|Ethiopia]] was ruled by the beautiful but vain queen, [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiope]]; she maintained that her beauty, and that of her daughter Andromeda, was superior to that of the [[Nereids|sea nymphs]], who were the daughters of [[Poseidon]], the god of the sea. When the nymphs became aware of her claims, they protested to their father, who retaliated by calling up a [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] or sea monster to ravage the coastline of Ethiopia placing Cassiope's kingdom at risk. On the advice of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] Ammon, the Queen, together with her husband [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]], decided to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to the monster.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus, flying back from his killing of the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]], kills the monster and rescues Andromeda, whom he then marries.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;

Titian follows Ovid fairly closely, although it is likely that his Latin was poor, and he mainly relied on somewhat simplified versions in Italian, of which there was a choice. This may explain some of the differences to the Latin original, although Titian may well just have interpreted the story freely.  In Ovid Andromeda's parents are nearby; here they are probably on the shore opposite, by a city. Andromeda stands amid seashells and [[coral]]. Coral is mentioned by Ovid, but as being formed from Medusa's locks at a later stage in the story.  Ovid describes Andromeda as looking like a statue, and having been crying; Titian's depiction matches both.&lt;ref name="I355" /&gt;  Perseus had been given his curved sword by [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], and his shield by [[Minerva]].  Like Mercury, he wears winged boots, and also a winged helmet.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 239&lt;/ref&gt;

Various visual sources have been suggested, both from the rather crude [[woodcut]] illustrations of various editions of Ovid, and specific classical [[relief]]s, as well as a well-known drawing by [[Michelangelo]] of the ''Risen Christ'' (British Museum).  The book illustrations "all show Perseus wearing a winged helmet like Mercury, for which there is no textual justification, and carrying a small baroque parade shield, features which Titian may later have remembered."&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 355; [[:File:BM Wilde 54.jpg|The Michelangelo drawing]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Poesie''==
[[File:After van Dyck Titian.jpg|thumb|Copy in the [[British Museum]] of the drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook, now [[Chatsworth House]], perhaps after a drawing by Titian.]]
The first two of the ''poesie'' series were ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' and ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]'', delivered in 1553 and late 1554 respectively.  Both of these were repetitions with variations of compositions Titian had already painted in the previous decade for the [[Farnese family]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Venus and Adonis'' composition has an uncertain earlier history, for which see the article, or Penny, 280–284.&lt;/ref&gt;  In a letter from Titian to Philip accompanying the ''Venus and Adonis'', he noted that the pair offered contrasting poses, and promised "another different view" in both ''Perseus and Andromeda'' and a ''Jason and Medea'' he intended to produce.  These were to be the first original compositions in the series for Philip, but there is no trace of the ''Jason and Medea'', which was presumably abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356, 359 note 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead ''[[The Rape of Europa (Titian)|The Rape of Europa]]'' is designed as a companion to ''Perseus and Andromeda''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition of Perseus and Andromeda developed through several stages, which can be traced through x-rays and [[infra-red reflectography]], and a surviving drawing.  Some of the earlier elements can still be seen to the naked eye on close examination of the painting.  At first Andromeda was on the right, in a fairly similar pose, but leaning from left to right as in the final picture.  The arm to the left was raised above her head in a similar fashion, but the other arm more or less horizontal, and the head presumably looking to the centre.  There is a drawing by [[Anthony van Dyck]] from his Italian sketchbook (now [[Chatsworth House]]) recording such a figure, probably copying a lost drawing by Titian,&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 349, reproduced 352, 357&lt;/ref&gt; a rarity by this stage in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 204&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Veronese-persée-rennes.jpg|thumb|The painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] now in [[Rennes]], 1576–78, which is similar to the Titian when reversed]]
 
When Andromeda was moved to the left of the painting her pose was different from the final painting, more similar to the original one when she was on the right. There were several different positions, some taken no further than [[underdrawing]], for Perseus' limbs, sword and shield.  The monster originally rose higher out of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 352, 355&lt;/ref&gt;

In a dissident view, Rearick sees the Wallace collection canvas as a second version, the original being the one delivered to Philip in 1556, and now lost, with Andromeda on the right. He sees a painting by [[Paolo Veronese]] in [[Rennes]] as a paraphrase of this version.&lt;ref&gt;Rearick, 44–50, 54&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later, probably by 1558, Titian painted for Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] a ''[[St Margaret and the Dragon (Titian)|St Margaret and the Dragon]]'' (now Prado) which, with the removal of Perseus, more clothes, and a cross carried by [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret]], shows much the same situation, with a cliff, the sea, and a city across a bay.&lt;ref&gt;Hale, 534-535&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Philip received the painting at [[Ghent]] in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] in September 1556.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 356–357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1574 Titian had still not been paid, according to a list he sent Philip's secretary and [[favourite]] [[Antonio Pérez (statesman)|Antonio Pérez]].  It appears to have left the Spanish royal collection before Philip's death in 1598 (the only ''poesie'' to do so), but was replaced by a careful copy, now in [[Gerona, Spain]].  It may have been given to Pérez, as other important paintings were.  This would have been before his drastic fall from favour in 1579.&lt;ref name="I357" &gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively it may have been given to the family of the court sculptors [[Leone Leoni]] and his son Pompeo, also given paintings by Philip.  The Leoni family may have bought it when the collections of Pérez were dispersed.  There are records of paintings of the subject in the collections of Pérez in 1585–86 (described as "grande" or large), of Leon Bautista Leoni on his death in 1605 ("a damaged Andromeda by Titian") and of his father Pompeo Leoni on his death in 1608 (described as large, and by Titian).  All of these may refer to this painting, but this is not certain.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

The painting was certainly in the collection of [[Anthony van Dyck]], who may have acquired it from the Leoni family, who were based in [[Milan]], during his years in Italy from 1621 to 1627.  It was listed among his paintings on his death in London in 1641, and bought in 1646 by one of van Dyck's best customers, [[Algernon Percy, 10th Earl of Northumberland]], together with Titian's ''[[Portrait of the Vendramin Family]]'' (now [[National Gallery]]).  Northumberland paid £200 for the pair, and a further £80 in 1656. However, it does not seem to have been owned by Northumberland for long, and was in France by 1654, and possibly by 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 220; Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1654 it was in the Paris house of the politician [[Louis Phélypeaux, seigneur de La Vrillière]], where it remained until 1717, sold with the house in 1705.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357&lt;/ref&gt;

It then joined the famous [[Orleans Collection]] of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]], Regent of France,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 461–468 for a general account of the collection&lt;/ref&gt; to be re-united with four others of Titian's ''poesie'', and two other versions by Titian of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Titian)|Venus and Adonis]]''.  By this time only Philip's versions of that and ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' remained in the Spanish royal collection, and are now in the [[Prado]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357; in 2013 it emerged that the Prado's ''Danaë'' was not in fact the one sent to Philip, though of very high quality.  See [[Danaë_(Titian_series)#Philip_II.27s_version.2C_and_the_Prado.27s|their article]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Like most of the rest of the Orleans Italian paintings, it moved to London where the collection was dispersed after the [[French Revolution]] in a complicated series of transactions,&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 464–467&lt;/ref&gt; in some of which it was wrongly described as formerly in the collection of [[Charles I of England]].  In 1798 it was valued at 700 [[Guinea (coin)|guineas]] but failed to sell, selling for 310 gn. in 1800, and £362 in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358; see Penny, 341 for the seller in 1815, the son of Sir [[Gregory Page-Turner]], who was possibly the buyer in 1805.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was much less than the £2,500 gn the [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater|Duke of Bridgewater]], one of the syndicate handling the sales, paid for each of [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|''Diana and Actaeon'']] and  ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', other ''poesie''.&lt;ref&gt;Penny, 254&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bertelli Perseus.jpg|thumb|[[Engraving]] by [[Ferrando Bertelli]]]]
The 1815 sale was the last time the painting came to the market. It was bought by the Earl of Yarmouth, from 1822 [[Francis Seymour-Conway, 3rd Marquess of Hertford]], father of the [[Richard Seymour-Conway, 4th Marquess of Hertford|4th Marquess]], the main collector forming the Wallace Collection. The 3rd Marquess contributed relatively few pictures to the Wallace Collection, and those were mostly portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 9, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was initially not regarded as one of the stars of the collection.  Between 1842 and about 1854 it was stored in the [[Pantechnicon van|Pantechnicon repository]] in London, before moving to [[Wallace_Collection#Building|Hertford House]], now home of the Wallace Collection, where it has remained. An 1870 inventory records it in the "Lumber Room" there, described as by [[Domenichino]], and Ingamells notes disapprovingly that "between 1876 and 1897 [it] hung unglazed over a bath in [[Sir Richard Wallace, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Wallace's]] dressing room", before being correctly identified and rescued from the steam.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 358&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copies and prints==
The painting was not copied by Titian or his workshop, as the first two ''poesie'' were, but later copies exist. When Philip II gave the painting away, a copy was made for the Spanish royal collection, which in 1882 was sent to the museum in [[Gerona, Spain]]. The [[Hermitage Museum]] has a copy that probably once belonged to Prince [[Eugene of Savoy]].  The [[Musée Ingres]] in [[Montauban]], France has a 17th-century copy once in the [[Palace of Versailles]], where it was recorded in 1683.&lt;ref name="I357" /&gt;

An [[engraving]] by the Venetian [[Ferrando Bertelli]] probably dates to the 1550s and is a close rendering, though extending the composition on all sides except the left, possibly reflecting the original size of the painting, which has been cut down to an unknown extent. [[Giovanni Battista Fontana (painter)|Giovanni Battista Fontana]] (1524–1587) produced two prints, one dated 1564 and not very similar, the other closer to the Titian and undated.  Neither are exactly reproductions.&lt;ref&gt;Ingamells, 357–358&lt;/ref&gt;  Illustrations to Ovid from the late 16th century on often adopt aspects, or the general layout of the painting, without being copies.  The many paintings of the subject in later centuries tended to follow Titian's reduction of the subject to the two main figures and the monster, although not copying his composition. The subject became especially popular in the 19th century.

:&lt;math&gt;x^3=x+1\, .&lt;/math&gt;

It has the exact value&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld |title=Plastic Constant |id=PlasticConstant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;div style="display: inline-block; width: 300px;"&gt;&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{69}}{18}}+\sqrt[3]{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{69}}{18}}\, .&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Its decimal expansion begins with {{gaps|1.32471|79572|44746|02596|09088|54…}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sequence {{OEIS2C|id=A060006}} in the [[OEIS]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
===Recurrences===
The powers of the plastic number {{math|''A''(''n'') {{=}} ''ρ''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} satisfy the third-order linear recurrence relation {{math|''A''(''n'') {{=}} ''A''(''n'' − 2) + ''A''(''n'' − 3)}} for&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n'' &gt; 2}}. Hence it is the limiting ratio of successive terms of any (non-zero) integer sequence satisfying this recurrence such as the [[Padovan sequence|Cordonnier numbers]] (better known as the Padovan sequence) the [[Perrin number]]s and the [[Van der Laan numbers]], and bears relationships to these sequences akin to the relationships of the [[golden ratio]] to the second-order [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci]] and [[Lucas number|Lucas]] numbers, akin to the relationships between the [[silver ratio]] and the [[Pell number]]s.&lt;ref&gt;;{{harvtxt|Shannon|Anderson|Horadam|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plastic number satisfies the [[nested radical]] recurrence:&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PlasticConstant|title=Plastic Constant|author=Piezas, Tito III; van Lamoen, Floor; and Weisstein, Eric W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt[3]{1 + \sqrt[3]{1 + \cdots}}} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Number theory===
Because the plastic number has the [[Minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]] {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1 {{=}} 0,}} it is also a solution of the polynomial equation {{math|''p''(''x'') {{=}} 0}} for every polynomial {{math|''p''}} that is a multiple of {{math|''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1,}} but not for any other polynomials with integer coefficients. Since the [[discriminant]] of its minimal polynomial is −23, its [[splitting field]] over rationals is {{math|ℚ({{sqrt|−23}}, ''ρ''}}). This field is also a [[Hilbert class field]] of {{math|ℚ({{sqrt|−23}})}}.

The plastic number is the smallest [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]]. Its [[algebraic conjugate]]s are
:&lt;math&gt;\left(-\tfrac12\pm\tfrac{\sqrt3}2i\right)\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{6}\sqrt{\tfrac{23}{3}}}+\left(-\tfrac12\mp\tfrac{\sqrt3}2i\right)\sqrt[3]{\tfrac{1}{2}-\tfrac{1}{6}\sqrt{\tfrac{23}{3}}}\approx -0.662359 \pm 0.56228i ,&lt;/math&gt;
of [[absolute value]]&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;0.868837 {{OEIS|A191909}}. This value is also {{math|{{sfrac|1|{{sqrt|''ρ''}}}}}} because the product of the three roots of the minimal polynomial is 1.

===Trigonometry===
The plastic number can be written using the [[hyperbolic cosine]] ({{math|cosh}}) and its inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho = \tfrac{1}{c} \cosh\left(\tfrac{1}{3} \cosh^{-1} (3 c)\right), \qquad
c = \cos\left(\tfrac{2 \pi}{12}\right) = \sin\left(\tfrac{2 \pi}{6}\right) = \tfrac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \, .&lt;/math&gt;
(See [[Cubic function#Trigonometric (and hyperbolic) method]].)

=== Name ===

Dutch architect &amp; [[Benedictine monk]] Dom [[Hans van der Laan]] gave the name ''plastic number'' (''het plastische getal'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) to this number in 1928. In 1924, four years prior to van der Laan's christening of the number's name, French engineer [[Gérard Cordonnier]] had already discovered the number and referred to it as ''the radiant number'' (''le nombre radiant'' in [[French language|French]]). Unlike the names of the [[golden ratio]] and [[silver ratio]], the word plastic was not intended by van der Laan to refer to a specific substance, but rather in its adjectival sense, meaning something that can be given a three-dimensional shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Padovan|2002}}; {{harvtxt|Shannon|Anderson|Horadam|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, according to Padovan, is because the characteristic ratios of the number, {{sfrac|3|4}} and {{sfrac|1|7}}, relate to the limits of human perception in relating one physical size to another. Van der Laan designed the 1967 [[St. Benedictusberg Abbey]] church to these plastic number proportions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Padovan|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plastic number is also sometimes called the '''silver number''', a name given to it by [[Midhat J. Gazalé]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40298400|title=Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals|last=Gazalé|first=Midhat J.|date=April 19, 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9780691005140|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=135–150|chapter=Chapter VII: The Silver Number|oclc=40298400|author-link=Midhat J. Gazalé}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently used by [[Martin Gardner]]{{Citation needed|reason=It's in Gardner's Workout, Chapter 16, pp. 121–128, just need to add a proper ref.|date=November 2017}}, but that name is more commonly used for the [[silver ratio]] {{math|1 + {{sqrt|2}}}}, one of the ratios from the family of [[metallic means]] first described by [[Vera W. de Spinadel]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Vera W.|last=de Spinadel|title=The Metallic Means and Design|pages=141–157|url=https://www.nexusjournal.com/the-nexus-conferences/nexus-1998/119-n1998-spinadel.html|journal=Nexus II: Architecture and Mathematics|editor-first=Kim|editor-last=Williams|location=Fucecchio (Florence)|publisher=Edizioni dell'Erba|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Donald E. Knuth]] has suggested referring to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt; as "High Phi", along with suggesting a special typographic mark for it.{{Citation needed|reason=Also in Gardner's Workout, Chapter 16, pp. 121–128, but better to cite the 1994 Quantum version at this point in the text, which lacks the postscript from Gardner's book.|date=November 2017}}

'''Radio Lagos 107.5 FM''' (also known as Tiwa n' Tiwa) began operations in 1977 as an offshoot of the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. It is the first [[state-owned]] [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[List of radio stations in Lagos|radio station]] in [[Lagos State]]

The station originally operated on two A.M. Frequencies (990&amp;nbsp;kHz.303mtrs and 918&amp;nbsp;kHz.327mtrs). The need for transformation produced Radio Lagos 107.5 FM (Tiwa n'Tiwa) under the control of the Lagos State Radio Service in 2001.

Radio Lagos is the first predominantly specialized, language station with over 98% of its transmission in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and Egun, and approximately 2% for [[English language|English]] bulletins. The station target audience includes Yoruba speaking listeners in [[Lagos]] and [[Nigerian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=RadioAfrican|title=Radio Lagos 107.5 Online|author=Haris Aslam|date=20 November 2014|url=http://www.radioafrican.com/radio-lagos-107-5-fm-online/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society of Polish Artists "Sztuka"''' ({{lang-pl|Towarzystwo Artystów Polskich "Sztuka"; Sztuka means '''Art''' in [[Polish language|Polish]], '''art'''yzm means artistic abilities}}) founded in 1897 in [[Kraków]], was a gathering of prominent Polish visual artists from around the turn of the century (or [[fin-de-siècle]] era) living under the foreign [[partitions of Poland]]. Its main goal was to reaffirm the importance and unique character of Polish contemporary art at a time, when Poland could not exist as sovereign nation.&lt;ref name="Kossowska" /&gt;

The immediate inspiration for the founding of the new society came from the ground-breaking art exhibit inaugurated on May 27, 1897 at [[Sukiennice Museum|Sukiennice]] in [[Main Square, Kraków]].&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt; It was held by Polish modernist painters,&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt; and called ''A Separate Exhibition of Painting and Sculpture'' (''Wystawa osobna obrazów i rzeźb'').&lt;ref name="Kozakowska" /&gt; The show was visited by approximately 6,000 guests, and proclaimed a success. The first meeting of Sztuka Society took place on October 27, 1897.&lt;ref name="1898-Report" /&gt; Among its founding members were a generation of academics from the [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts|School of Fine Arts]] who also participated in the show, including future Rectors of the Academy: [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Teodor Axentowicz]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Józef Mehoffer]]; as well as artists [[Józef Chełmoński]], [[Julian Fałat]], [[Antoni Piotrowski]], [[Jan Stanisławski (painter)|Jan Stanisławski]], [[Włodzimierz Tetmajer]] and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].&lt;ref name="Brzyski" /&gt;

==Principles==
Sztuka's artistic philosophy was by no means homogeneous – encompassing all facets of the [[Young Poland]] movement including [[neo-romanticism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[art nouveau]]. Sculpture was represented in Sztuka by [[Xawery Dunikowski]], [[Bolesław Biegas]], [[Konstanty Laszczka]], and [[Wacław Szymanowski]]. It was "a happy hour" for Polish modernists, wrote historian Maria Poprzecka, because the prevailing trends in European art of the time ([[Edvard Munch]], [[August Strindberg]]) were perfectly aligned with extreme pessimism of the Poles under the foreign rule.&lt;ref name="Kossowska" /&gt;

The membership of the society was tightly controlled in order to protect its identity. It was especially important considering that the Polish artists were forced to exhibit abroad under the banner of Poland's own occupiers. For example, when the 1892 Munich International Exhibition of Fine Arts chose to create a Polish department, the Tsarist official from the Russian-controlled Warsaw named it a political provocation in his official protest. As a result, at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 World Exposision]] Poles from the [[Russian partition|Russian sector]] of occupied Poland were allowed to exhibit only with the Russians from Russia.&lt;ref name="Facos" /&gt;

Sztuka Society survived two world wars. With time, many other prominent artists joined in such as [[Olga Boznańska]] and [[Józef Pankiewicz]]. Its role began to diminish in the [[Second Polish Republic|interwar period]]. The society was also criticized for being too exclusive and accused of having nationalistic ideals. However, it was discontinued only under the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Stalinist system]], in 1950.&lt;ref name="Bartelik" /&gt;

The '''tea house''' was a public building in the city of [[Agdam]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The tea house was based on the idea of the academician Khudu Mammadov during Sadig Murtuzayev’s  post as first Secretary of the Agdam District Party Committee of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan SSR. Naik Samadov was chief architect of the Tea House project. In the project, masonry was only used on the first floor. The remainder consisted of metal construction. It was decided to place the tea house near the mosque after discussion with Khudu Mammadov. [[Penal labor]] was used to reduce construction costs.&lt;ref name="cayevi"&gt;{{cite web|title= Ağdamın simvolu - Çay evi |url= http://modern.az/articles/63623/1/#gsc.tab=0|publisher= modern.az|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The tea house was inaugurated on 26 July 1986. In addition to the regional officials, [[Vafa Guluzade]], the head of the Culture Department of the CP CC of Azerbaijan SSR, also participated in the opening ceremony.&lt;ref name="cayevi"/&gt; The article published in the July 31, 1986, issue of “The Lenin Path”, on the occasion of the opening of the tea house, reads:
{{cquote|''"After the decision of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the "Drunkenness and Alcoholization Measures", our district has a lot of activities. The Tea House, which is being used today, is of great importance in this respect. Role of the Tea House is indispensable for the workers to spend their leisure time effectively."'' &lt;ref&gt;" The Lenin Path" newspaper (Aghdam). 31 July 1986&lt;/ref&gt; }}
In 1993, the Tea House was burned down by the [[Armenian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="cayevied"&gt;{{cite web|title= Quzanlıda Ağdam şəhərindəki məşhur çay evinin bənzəri tikilib|url= https://azertag.az/xeber/Quzanlida_Agdam_seherindeki_meshur_chay_evinin_benzeri_tikilib-855145|publisher= azertag.az|accessdate=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
A large diameter pipe was placed in the middle of the tea house. On each side, small volumes of tubes were merged with structures. Floors were wooden. Pipes were embellished with wood and decorated with various ornaments. Each floor had four doors. The dome of the tea house was roofed with galvanized iron.&lt;ref name="cayevi"/&gt;

===Tea house in Kuzanly ===
On May 10, 2015, a copy of the tea house was built in [[Kuzanly|Guzanli]] settlement of Aghdam region.&lt;ref name="cayevied"/&gt;

'''''The [[proscription|Proscribed]] Royalist, 1651''''' (1852–53) is a painting by [[John Everett Millais]] which depicts a young [[Puritan]] woman protecting a fleeing [[Royalist]] after the [[Battle of Worcester]] in 1651, the decisive defeat of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by [[Oliver Cromwell]]. The Royalist is hiding in a hollow tree, a reference to a famous incident in which Charles himself hid in a tree to escape from his pursuers. Millais was also influenced by [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[I Puritani]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Rosenfeld, ''John Everett Millais'', Phaidon Press Ltd., 2012, pp. 70–1, 73–4, 88, 102, 111–12, 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Millais painted the picture in [[Hayes, Kent]], from a local oak tree that became known as the Millais Oak.&lt;ref&gt;Millais, J.G., ''Life and Letters of Sir John Everett Millais'', vol. 1, p.166; See also [http://www.arborecology.co.uk/article_ancient_tree.htm Arborecology, containing a photograph of the Millais oak]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6617">'''''The Three Dead Kings''''', also known by its [[Latin]] title '''''De Tribus Regibus Mortuis''''' or as '''''The Three Living and the Three Dead''''', is a 15th-century [[Middle English]] [[poem]]. It is found in the [[manuscript]] [[MS. Douce 302]], and its authorship is sometimes attributed to a [[Shropshire]] [[priest]], [[John Audelay]]. It is an extremely rare survival from a late genre of [[alliterative verse]], also significant as the only English poetic retelling of a well-known ''[[memento mori]]'' current in mediaeval European church art.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:La ferte dict.JPG|thumb|right|A [[France|French]] church wall painting depicting the Three Living and the Three Dead, from the Église Saint-Germain de La Ferté-Loupière]]
The theme of the 'Three Living and the Three Dead' is a relatively common form of ''memento mori'' in mediaeval art.&lt;ref name=ross245&gt;Ross, L. ''Medieval Art: A Topical Dictionary'', Greenwood, 1996, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Dit des trois morts et des trois vifs'' by Baudoin de Condé has been traced back to 1280.

In the poem, an unnamed narrator describes seeing a [[wild boar|boar]] [[boar hunting|hunt]], a typical opening of the genre of the ''[[chanson d'aventure]]''. Three kings are following the hunt; they lose their way in mist and are separated from their retainers. Suddenly, "schokyn out of a schawe" (42) ('Starting out of a wood') three walking corpses appear, described in graphically hideous terms. The kings are terrified, but show a range of reactions to the three Dead, ranging from a desire to flee to a resolve to face them. The three corpses, in response, state that they are not demons, but the three kings' forefathers, and criticise their heirs for neglecting their memory and not saying masses for their souls: "Bot we haue made ȝoue mastyrs amys/ Þat now nyl not mynn us with a mas" (103-104). Once, the three Dead were materialistic and pleasure-loving: "Wyle I was mon apon mold merþis þai were myne" (121) ('While I was a man upon earth, pleasures were mine'), and they now suffer for it. Eventually, the Dead leave, the red daylight comes, and the kings ride home. The final message of the Dead is that the living should always be mindful of them - "Makis your merour be me" (120) - and of the transient nature of life. Afterwards the kings raise a church "with masse" (139) and have the story written on its walls.

Apart from its complex structure, the poem is distinguished for its vividly descriptive and imaginative language.

==Poetic form==
Along with other poems in MS. Douce 302, ''The Three Dead Kings'' is written in a dialect of Middle English local to the area of [[Shropshire]] and west [[Staffordshire]].

The poem has an extremely unusual structure, combining a four-stress alliterative line, a tight [[rhyme scheme]], and regular use of [[assonance]]. The structure of the rhymes, ''ABABABAB'' in the first eight lines of each [[stanza]] and ''CDCCD'' in the final five, combines with the alliteration, and the use of the same final consonant on the fourth stress throughout the entire stanza, to produce an additional [[pararhyme]] between pairs of lines:

:Þen speke þe henmest kyng, in þe hillis he beholdis,
:He lokis vnder his hondis and his hed heldis;
:Bot soche a carful k[ny]l to his hert coldis,
:So doþ þe knyf ore þe kye, þat þe knoc kelddus.
:Hit bene warlaws þre þat walkyn on þis woldis.
:Oure Lord wyss us þe rede-way þat al þe word weldus!
:My hert fare[s] fore freȝt as flagge when hit foldus,
:Vche fyngyr of my hond fore ferdchip hit feldus.
:Fers am I ferd of oure fare;
:Fle we ful fast þer-fore.
:Can Y no cownsel bot care.
:Þese dewyls wil do vs to dare,
:Fore drede lest þai duttyn vche a dore.

(79-91)&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Text in Turville-Petre, T. (ed.) ''Alliterative Poetry of the Later Middle Ages: An Anthology'', London: Routledge, 1989, pp. 148 – 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

(Roughly translated: 'Then speaks the last king, he looks in the hills / He looks under his hands and holds his head; / But a dreadful blow goes cold to his heart / Like the knife or the key, that chills the knuckle. / "These are three demons that walk on these hills / May our Lord, who rules all the world, show us the quickest way out! / My heart bends with fright like a reed, / Each finger of my hand grows weak with fear. / I'm forcefully afraid of our fate; / Let us quickly flee, therefore. / I can give no counsel but worry. / These devils will make us cower / For dread lest they shut each escape."')

A few other Middle English poems use a similar thirteen-line stanza, but ''The Three Dead Kings'' has the most elaborate structure: medievalist Thorlac Turville-Petre refers to it as "the most highly patterned and technically complex poem in the language".&lt;ref name=ttp64&gt;Turville-Petre, T. ''The Alliterative Revival'', Boydell &amp; Brewer, 1977, p.64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
MS. Douce 302, now held at the [[Bodleian Library]], is a manuscript of work by [[John Audelay]], a chantry priest at [[Haughmond Abbey]], [[Shropshire]], who is known to have been alive in 1426, when the manuscript may have been compiled.&lt;ref name=audelay&gt;[http://www.marginalia.co.uk/shared/john_audelay.php John Audelay], ''Marginalia'', accessed 03-10-2008&lt;/ref&gt; By this point he stated that he was old, [[deaf]], and [[Blindness|blind]], although this complicates the question of how he could have authored the poetry in the manuscript. Some scholars have argued that Audelay's other poetry lacks the great technical skill shown in ''The Three Dead Kings'', and that he is therefore unlikely to have written it, especially as it shows signs of a more northerly dialect. Others, however, have defended his authorship, noting that he favours both alliteration and thirteen-line stanza forms elsewhere in the manuscript.&lt;ref name=stanley114&gt;Stanley, E. ''The Verse Forms of Jon the Blynde Awdelay'' in Cooper &amp; Mapstone (eds.) ''The Long Fifteenth Century'', Oxford: OUP, 1997, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Veejay''' is a [[Free software|free]] visual instrument and realtime video sampler for [[Linux]] released under the [[GNU General Public License]] version 2 or later.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://code.dyne.org/veejay/tree/veaejay-current/veejay-server/COPYING]'',License Information page&lt;/ref&gt;

Veejay functions as a video tracker and editing tool, as well as a realtime video sequencer and effects generator that allows for live interaction. Additionally, the generated content can be recorded to disk for future use.

== Development ==

The project was started in June 2002 by Niels Elburg, Matthijs van Henten and Dursun Koca with the objective to provide a tool that would allow the user to play the video like a piano (a visual instrument) and record the resulting video directly to disk (video sampling).

Veejay is not a traditional video editing application; The application aims for a high level of [[interoperability]] with other Audio/video applications through the use of [[Shared resource]]s, [[Loop device]]s, various messaging protocols such as [[MIDI|Midi]], [[Open Sound Control|OSC]] and veejay's internal message system VIMS, but also through supporting third party modules such as [[Frei0r|Frei0r plugins]] and frameworks like [[Pure Data]]. It offers a wide range of video effects, a Video Keyboard for the video artist and it offers scripting capabilities for use in (automated) video installations.

Veejay has separated the video processing core from the user interface, allowing the user(s) to control (multiple instances of) the application over the network.

== Features ==

* Support for MJPEG and other [[Intra-frame|Intra-frame Editing Codecs]]  
* [[Client–server model|Client/server]] architecture
* Live editing
* Live recording 
* Frame accurate
* Loop-based editing ([[Video sampling]]).
* [[Trick mode|Trick play]]
* [[Non-destructive editing]]

* Dynamic [[Frame rate]]
* Support for audio through [[JACK Audio Connection Kit]]
* Support for Multitrack
* Remote control via [[Open Sound Control]], [[MIDI]] and Veejay's own protocol VIMS
* Support for Vloopback
* Almost all functions can be controlled with the keyboard or [[MIDI]] controller
* Configurable video window placement
* Support for realtime [[audio time-scale/pitch modification]]
* Macro recording and playback
* MIDI learning
* Crash recovery

A '''vernacular''', or '''vernacular language''', is the [[language]] or [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a language used in everyday life by the common people of a specific population. It is distinguished from a [[standard language|standard]], [[National language|national]] or [[Literary language|literary]] language or a ''[[lingua franca]]'', used to facilitate communication across a large area. It is usually [[Native language|native]], mostly [[Spoken language|spoken]] rather than written and usually [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|seen as of lower status]] than more standardized forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8L-SDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT559&amp;dq=vernacular+language&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiV1Ly707jbAhVpLcAKHZmuA4IQ6AEIWzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=vernacular%20language&amp;f=false|title=The Study of Language 6th Edition|last=Yule|first=George|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781316776780|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be a language, [[dialect]] or [[sociolect]].

Some linguists use "vernacular" and "[[nonstandard dialect]]" as [[synonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Wolfram" /&gt;

== Etymology ==
Usage of the word "vernacular" is not recent. In 1688, James Howell wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Concerning Italy, doubtless there were divers before the Latin did spread all over that Country; the [[Calabria|Calabrian]], and [[Apulia|Apulian]] spoke Greek, whereof some Relicks are [[Griko dialect|to be found to this day]]; but it was an adventitious, no Mother-Language to them: 'tis confess'd that [[Latium]] it self, and all the Territories about Rome, had the Latin for its maternal and common first '''vernacular''' Tongue; but [[Tuscany]] and [[Liguria]] had others quite discrepant, [[viz.]] the [[Etruscan language|Hetruscane]] and [[Messapian language|Mesapian]], whereof though there be some Records yet extant; yet there are none alive that can understand them: The [[Oscan language|Oscan]], the [[Sabine language|Sabin]] and Tusculan, are thought to be but Dialects to these.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, vernacular, mother language and dialect are already in use in a modern sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Epistolæ Ho-Elianæ: Familiar letters, domestic and forren |first=James |last=Howell |location=London |publisher=Thomas Grey |year=1688 |edition=6th |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Merriam-Webster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernacular |encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/VERNACULAR |accessdate=8 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "vernacular" was brought into the English language as early as 1601 from the Latin ''vernaculus'' ("native") which had been in figurative use in [[Classical Latin]] as "national" and "domestic", having originally been derived from ''vernus'' and ''verna'', a male or female slave respectively born in the house rather than abroad. The figurative meaning was broadened from the diminutive extended words ''vernaculus, vernacula''. [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], the classical Latin grammarian, used the term ''vocabula vernacula'', "termes de la langue nationale" or "vocabulary of the national language" as opposed to foreign words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=vernaculus |encyclopedia=Dictionnaire Illustré Latin Français |first=Felix |last=Gaffiot |publisher=Librairie Hachette |location=Paris |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts of the vernacular ==

===General linguistics===

====In contrast with lingua franca====

In [[Linguistics|general linguistics]], a vernacular is contrasted with a ''[[lingua franca]]'', a third-party language in which persons speaking different vernaculars not understood by each other may communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to sociolinguistics |first=Ronald |last=Wardhaugh |location=Malden, Mass.; Oxford |publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |year=2006 |page=59 |quote=In 1953, UNESCO defined a lingua franca as 'a language which is used habitually by people whose mother tongues are different in order to facilitate communication between them.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Western Europe]] until the 17th century, most scholarly works had been written in [[Latin]], which was serving as a lingua franca. Works written in [[Romance language]]s are said to be in the vernacular. The ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]'', the ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', and [[The Song of Roland]] are examples of early vernacular literature in Italian, Spanish, and French, respectively.

In Europe, Latin was used widely instead of vernacular languages in varying forms until c. 1701, in its latter stage as [[New Latin]].

In religion, [[Protestantism]] was a driving force in the use of the vernacular in Christian Europe, the [[Bible]] being translated from Latin into vernacular languages with such works as the Bible in Dutch: published in 1526 by [[Jacob van Liesvelt]]; Bible in French: published in 1528 by Jacques Lefevre d’Étaples (or Faber Stapulensis); German [[Luther Bible]] in 1534 ([[New Testament]] 1522); Bible in Spanish: published in Basel in 1569 by Casiodoro de Reina (Biblia del Oso); Bible in Czech: Bible of Kralice, printed between 1579 and 1593; Bible in English: [[King James Bible]], published in 1611; Bible in Slovene, published in 1584 by Jurij Dalmatin. In Catholicism, vernacular bibles were later provided, but Latin was used at [[Tridentine Mass]] until the [[Second Vatican Council]] of 1965. Certain groups, notably [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, continue to practice [[Latin Mass]].

In India, the 12th century [[Bhakti movement]] led to the translation of Sanskrit texts to the vernacular.

In science, an early user of the vernacular was [[Galileo]], writing in Italian c. 1600, though some of his works remained in Latin. A later example is [[Isaac Newton]], whose 1687 ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'' was in Latin, but whose 1704 ''[[Opticks]]'' was in English. Latin continues to be used in certain fields of science, notably [[binomial nomenclature]] in biology, while other fields such as mathematics use vernacular; see [[scientific nomenclature]] for details.

In diplomacy, French displaced Latin in Europe in the 1710s, due to the military power of [[Louis XIV of France]].

Certain languages have both a classical form and various vernacular forms, with two widely used examples being Arabic and Chinese: see [[Varieties of Arabic]] and [[Chinese language]]. In the 1920s, due to the [[May Fourth Movement]], [[Classical Chinese]] was replaced by [[written vernacular Chinese]].

{{details|Vernacular literature}}

====As a low variant in diglossia====
The vernacular is also often contrasted with a [[liturgical language]], a specialized use of a former ''lingua franca''. For example, until the 1960s, [[Roman Rite]] Catholics held [[Mass (liturgy)|Masses]] in [[Latin]] rather than in vernaculars; to this day the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] holds [[liturgy|liturgies]] in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], not Arabic; the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] holds liturgies in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]] though parts of Mass are read in [[Amharic]].

Similarly, in [[Hindu]] culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in [[Sanskrit]] (long after its use as a spoken language) or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] in Tamil country. Sanskrit was a lingua franca among the non-Indo-European languages of the Indian subcontinent and became more of one as the spoken language, or [[prakrit]]s, began to diverge from it in different regions. With the rise of the [[bhakti movement]] from the 12th century onwards, religious works were created in the other languages: [[Hindi]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and many others. For example, the [[Ramayana]], one of Hinduism's sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as ''[[Ranganadha Ramayanam]]'' composed in Telugu by [[Reddy dynasty|Gona Buddha Reddy]] in the 15th century; and ''[[Ramacharitamanasa]]'', a Hindi version of the Ramayana by the 16th-century poet [[Tulsidas]].

These circumstances are a contrast between a vernacular and language variant used by the same speakers. According to one school of linguistic thought, all such variants are examples of a linguistic phenomenon termed [[diglossia]] ("split tongue", on the model of the genetic anomaly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=diglossia |encyclopedia=Stedman's Medical Dictionary |year=1918 |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In it, the language is bifurcated, i.e. the speaker learns two forms of the language and ordinarily uses one but under special circumstances the other. The one most frequently used is the low (L) variant, equivalent to the vernacular, while the special variant is the high (H). The concept was introduced to linguistics by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] (1959), but Ferguson explicitly excluded variants as divergent as dialects or different languages or as similar as styles or registers. H must not be a conversational form; Ferguson had in mind a literary language. For example, a lecture is delivered in a different variety than ordinary conversation. Ferguson's own example was classical and spoken Arabic, but the analogy between [[Vulgar Latin]] and [[Classical Latin]] is of the same type. Excluding the upper-class and lower-class register aspects of the two variants, Classical Latin was a literary language; the people spoke Vulgar Latin as a vernacular.

[[Joshua Fishman]] redefined the concept in 1964 to include everything Fergusen had excluded. Fishman allowed both different languages and dialects and also different styles and registers as the H variants. The essential contrast between them was that they be "functionally differentiated"; that is, H must be used for special purposes, such as a liturgical or sacred language. Fasold expanded the concept still further by proposing that multiple H exist in society from which the users can select for various purposes. The definition of an H is intermediate between Ferguson's and Fishman's. Realizing the inappropriateness of the term diglossia (only two) to his concept, he proposes the term broad diglossia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fasold|1984|pp=34–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociolinguistics===
Within [[sociolinguistics]], the term "vernacular" has been applied to several concepts. Context, therefore, is crucial to determining its intended sense.

====As an informal register====
In variation theory, pioneered by [[William Labov]], language is a large set of styles or [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] from which the speaker selects according to the social setting of the moment. The vernacular is "the least self-conscious style of people in a relaxed conversation", or "the most basic style"; that is, casual varieties used spontaneously rather than self-consciously, informal talk used in intimate situations. In other contexts the speaker does conscious work to select the appropriate variations. The one he can use without this effort is the first form of speech acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mesthrie|1999|pp=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As a non-standard dialect====
In another theory, the vernacular is opposed to the standard. The non-standard varieties thus defined are dialects, which are to be identified as complexes of factors: "social class, region, ethnicity, situation, and so forth." Both the standard and the non-standard language have dialects, but in contrast to the standard, the non-standard have "socially disfavored" structures. The standard are primarily written (in traditional print media) but the non-standard are spoken. An example of a vernacular dialect is [[African American Vernacular English]].&lt;ref name="Wolfram"&gt;{{cite book |title=American English: dialects and variation |first=Walt |last=Wolfram |first2=Natalie |last2=Schilling-Estes |pages=13–16 |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====As an idealisation====
A vernacular is not a real language but is "an abstract set of norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lodge|2005|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular grammar ==
Vernaculars acquired the status of [[official language]]s through [[Metalinguistics|metalinguistic]] publications. Between 1437 and 1586, the first [[grammar]] of [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]] and [[English language|English]] were written, though not always immediately published. It is to be understood that the first vestiges of those languages preceded their standardization by up to several hundred years.

=== Dutch ===
In the 16th century, the "[[Chamber of rhetoric|rederijkerskamers]]", learned literary societies founded throughout [[Flanders]] and [[Holland]] from the 1420s onward, attempted to impose a Latin structure on Dutch, on the presumption that Latin grammar had a "universal character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Noordegraaf|2000|p=894}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1559 [[John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst]] published his grammar ''Den schat der Duytsscher Talen'' in Dutch and so did [[Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert]] (''Eenen nieuwen ABC of Materi-boeck'') in 1564. The Latinizing tendency changed course with the joint publication in 1584 by De Eglantier, the rhetoric society of Amsterdam, of the first comprehensive Dutch grammar, ''Twe-spraack vande Nederduitsche letterkunst/ ófte Vant spellen ende eyghenscap des Nederduitschen taals''. [[Hendrick Laurenszoon Spieghel]] was a major contributor but others contributed as well.

=== English ===
{{details|History of English}}
[[Modern English]] is considered to have begun at a conventional date of about 1550, most notably at the end of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (for example, "bot", the footwear, more as in "boat" to "boot"){{clarify|date=April 2011}}. It was created by the infusion of [[Old French]] into [[Old English]] after the [[Norman conquest]] of 1066 AD and of Latin at the instigation of the clerical administration. While present-day English-speaking students may be able to read [[Middle English]] authors such as [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] with some schooling, [[Old English]] is much more difficult.

[[Middle English]] is known for its alternative spellings and pronunciations. The British Isles, although geographically limited, have always supported populations of widely variant dialects (as well as a few different languages). Being the language of a maritime power, English was of necessity formed from elements of many different languages. Standardization has been an ongoing issue. Even in the age of modern communications and mass media, according to one study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Authority in language: investigating language prescription and standardisation |first=James |last=Milroy|first2=Lesley |last2=Milroy |page=29 |year=1985 |publisher=[[Routledge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "… although the Received Pronunciation of Standard English has been heard constantly on radio and then television for over 60 years, only 3 to 5% of the population of Britain actually speaks RP … new brands of English have been springing up even in recent times ...." What the vernacular would be in this case is a moot point: "… the standardisation of English has been in progress for many centuries."

Modern English came into being as the standard Middle English, i.e. as the preferred dialect of the monarch, court and administration. That dialect was East Midland, which had spread to [[London]] where the king resided and from which he ruled. It contained Danish forms not often used in the north or south, as the Danes had settled heavily in the midlands. Chaucer wrote in an early East Midland style, [[John Wycliffe]] translated the [[New Testament]] into it, and [[William Caxton]], the first English printer, wrote in it. Caxton is considered the first modern English author.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Champneys|1893|pp=269, 285–286, 301, 314}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed book in England was Chaucer's ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'', published by Caxton in 1476.

The first English grammars were written in [[Latin]], with some in [[French language|French]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a general plea for mother-tongue education in England: ''The first part of the elementary'', published in 1582 by [[Richard Mulcaster]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Bullokar]] wrote the first English grammar to be written in English: ''Pamphlet for Grammar'', followed by ''Bref Grammar'', both in 1586. Previously he had written ''Booke at Large for the Amendment of Orthography for English Speech'' (1580) but his orthography was not generally accepted and was soon supplanted, and his grammar shared a similar fate. Other grammars in English followed rapidly: Paul Greaves' ''Grammatica Anglicana'', 1594; [[Alexander Hume]]'s ''Orthographie and Congruitie of the Britain Tongue'', 1617, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dons|2004|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the succeeding decades many literary figures turned a hand to grammar in English: [[Alexander Gill]], [[Ben Jonson]], Joshua Poole, [[John Wallis]], Jeremiah Wharton, [[James Howell]], Thomas Lye, [[Christopher Cooper (grammarian)|Christopher Cooper]], [[William Lily (grammarian)|William Lily]], [[John Colet]] and so on, all leading to the massive dictionary of [[Samuel Johnson]].

=== French ===
{{details|Old French}}
French (as [[Old French]]) emerged as a [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] from [[Vulgar Latin]] during [[late antiquity]]. The written language is known from at least as early as the 9th century. That language contained many forms still identifiable as Latin. Interest in standardizing French began in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the [[Norman conquest of England]] and the Anglo-Norman domains in both northwestern France and Britain, English scholars retained an interest in the fate of French as well as of English. Some of the numerous 16th-century surviving grammars are:

* [[John Palsgrave]], ''L'esclarcissement de la langue francoyse'' (1530; in English).
* Louis Meigret, ''Tretté de la grammaire françoeze'' (1550).
* Robert Stephanus: ''Traicté de la grammaire françoise'' (1557).

=== German ===
{{details|History of German}}
The development of a standard German was impeded by political disunity and strong local traditions until the invention of printing made possible a "[[High German]]-based book language."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[literary language]] was not identical to any specific variety of German. The first grammar evolved from pedagogical works that also tried to create a uniform standard from the many regional dialects for various reasons. Religious leaders wished to create a sacred language for [[Protestantism]] that would be parallel to the use of Latin for the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Various administrations wished to create a civil service, or chancery, language that would be useful in more than one locality. And finally, nationalists wished to counter the spread of the French national language into German-speaking territories assisted by the efforts of the French Academy.

With so many linguists moving in the same direction a standard German (''hochdeutsche Schriftsprache'') did evolve without the assistance of a language academy. Its precise origin, the major constituents of its features, remains uncertainly known and debatable. Latin prevailed as a [[lingua franca]] until the 17th century, when grammarians began to debate the creation of an ideal language. Before 1550 as a conventional date "supraregional compromises" were used in printed works, such as the one published by Valentin Ickelsamer (''Ein Teutsche Grammatica'') 1534. Books published in one of these artificial variants began to increase in frequency replacing the Latin then in use. After 1550 the supraregional ideal broadened to a universal intent to create a national language from [[Early New High German]] by deliberately ignoring regional forms of speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Nils |last=Langer |contribution=On the Importance of Foreign Language Grammars for a History of Standard German |title=Standardization: studies from the Germanic languages |editor-first=Andrew Robert |editor-last=Linn |editor2-first=Nicola |editor2-last=McLelland |series=Current Issues in Linguistic Theory 235 |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |year=2002 |pages=69–70 |location=Amsterdam}}&lt;/ref&gt; which practice was considered to be a form of purification parallel to the ideal of purifying religion in [[Protestantism]].

In 1617, the [[Fruitbearing Society]], a language club, was formed in [[Weimar]] in imitation of the [[Accademia della Crusca]] in Italy. It was one of many such clubs; however, none became a national academy. In 1618–1619 Johannes Kromayer wrote the first all-German grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1641 Justin Georg Schottel in ''teutsche Sprachkunst'' presented the standard language as an artificial one. By the time of his work of 1663, ''ausführliche Arbeit von der teutschen Haubt-Sprache'', the standard language was well established.

=== Irish ===
''[[Auraicept na n-Éces]]'' is a grammar of the [[Irish language]] which is thought to date back as far as the 7th century: the earliest surviving manuscripts are 12th-century.

=== Italian ===
{{details|Italian language}}
Italian appears before standardization as the ''lingua Italica'' of [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore]] and the ''lingua vulgaris'' of subsequent medieval writers. Documents of mixed Latin and Italian are known from the 12th century, which appears to be the start of writing in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known grammar of a Romance language was a book written in manuscript form by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1437 and 1441 and entitled ''Grammatica della lingua toscana'', "Grammar of the Tuscan Language." In it Alberti sought to demonstrate that the vernacular – here Tuscan, known today as modern Italian – was every bit as structured as Latin. He did so by mapping vernacular structures onto Latin.

The book was never printed until 1908. It was not generally known, but it was known, as an inventory of the library of [[Lorenzo de'Medici]] lists it under the title ''Regule lingue florentine'' ("Rules of the Florentine language"). The only known manuscript copy, however, is included in the [[codex]], Reginense Latino 1370, located at Rome in the [[Vatican library]]. It is therefore called the ''Grammatichetta vaticana.''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of the Language Sciences / Histoire des sciences du langage / Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften,  Part 1 |editor-first=Sylvain |editor-last=Auroux |editor2-first=E.

More influential perhaps were the 1516 ''Regole grammaticali della volgar lingua'' of Giovanni Francesco Fortunio and the 1525 ''Prose della vulgar lingua'' of [[Pietro Bembo]]. In those works the authors strove to establish a dialect that would qualify for becoming the Italian national language.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Occitan ===
The very first grammar in a vernacular language in western Europe was published in [[Toulouse]] in 1327. Known as the ''[[Leys d'amor]]'' and written by Guilhèm Molinièr, an [[advocate]] of Toulouse, it was published in order to codify the use of the [[Occitan]] language in poetry competitions organized by the company of the [[Acadèmia dels Jòcs Florals|Gai Saber]] in both grammar and rherotical ways.

=== Spanish ===
{{details|History of Spanish}}
Spanish (more accurately, ''la lengua castellana'') has a development chronologically similar to that of Italian: some vocabulary in Isidore of Seville, traces afterward, writing from about the 12th century, standardization beginning in the 15th century, coincident with the rise of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] as an international power.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diez|1863|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Spanish grammar by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] (''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana|Tratado de gramática sobre la lengua Castellana]]'', 1492) was divided into parts for native and nonnative speakers, pursuing a different purpose in each:  Books 1–4 describe the [[Spanish language]] grammatically in order to facilitate the study of Latin for its Spanish speaking readers. Book 5 contains a phonetical and morphological overview of Spanish for nonnative speakers.

=== Welsh ===
The ''Grammar Books of the Master-poets'' ({{lang-cy|Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid}}) are considered to have been composed in the early fourteenth century, and are present in manuscripts from soon after. These tractates draw on the traditions of the Latin grammars of Donatus and Priscianus and also on the teaching of the professional Welsh poets. The tradition of grammars of the [[Welsh Language]] developed from these through the Middle Ages and to the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia |editor-first=John |editor-last=Koch |contribution=Gramadegau'r Penceirddiaid |first=R. Geraint |last=Gruffudd |location=Santa Barbara |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2006 |pages=843–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== First vernacular dictionaries ==
A dictionary is to be distinguished from a [[glossary]]. Although numerous glossaries publishing vernacular words had long been in existence, such as the [[Etymologiae]] of [[Isidore of Seville]], which listed many Spanish words, the first vernacular [[dictionaries]] emerged together with vernacular grammars.

=== Dutch ===
Glossaries in Dutch began about 1470 AD leading eventually to two [[Dutch dictionaries]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christophe Plantin]]: ''Thesaurus Theutonicae Linguae'', 1573
* [[Cornelis Kiliaan]]: ''Dictionarium Teutonico-Latinum'', 1574 (becoming ''Etymologicum'' with the 1599 3rd edition)

Shortly after (1579) the [[Southern Netherlands]] came under the dominion of Spain, then of Austria (1713) and of France (1794). The [[Congress of Vienna]] created the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] in 1815 from which southern Netherlands (being Catholic) seceded in 1830 to form the [[Kingdom of Belgium]], which was confirmed in 1839 by the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brachin|1985|pp=26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this political instability no standard Dutch was defined (even though much in demand and recommended as an ideal) until after [[World War II]]. Currently the [[Dutch Language Union]], an international treaty organization founded in 1980, supports a standard Dutch in the Netherlands, while [[Afrikaans]] is regulated by [[Die Taalkommissie]] founded in 1909.

=== English ===
[[Standard English]] remains a quasi-fictional ideal, despite the numerous private organizations publishing prescriptive rules for it. No language academy was ever established or espoused by any government past or present in the English-speaking world. In practice the British monarchy and its administrations established an ideal of what good English should be considered to be, and this in turn was based on the teachings of the major universities, such as [[Cambridge University]] and [[Oxford University]], which relied on the scholars whom they hired. There is a general but far from uniform consensus among the leading scholars about what should or should not be said in standard English, but for every rule examples from famous English writers can be found that break it. Uniformity of spoken English never existed and does not exist now, but usages do exist, which must be learnt by the speakers, and do not conform to prescriptive rules.

Usages have been documented not by prescriptive grammars, which on the whole are less comprehensible to the general public, but by comprehensive dictionaries, often termed unabridged, which attempt to list all usages of words and the phrases in which they occur as well as the date of first use and the etymology where possible. These typically require many volumes, and yet not more so than the unabridged dictionaries of many languages.

Bilingual dictionaries and glossaries precede modern English and were in use in the earliest written English. The first monolingual dictionary was&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Cawdrey]]'s ''Table Alphabeticall'' (1604) which was followed by [[Edward Phillips]]'s ''A New World of English Words'' (1658) and [[Nathaniel Bailey]]'s ''[[An Universal Etymological English Dictionary]]'' (1721). These dictionaries whetted the interest of the English-speaking public in greater and more prescriptive dictionaries until [[Samuel Johnson]] published ''Plan of a Dictionary of the English Language'' (1747), which would imitate the dictionary being produced by the French Academy. He had no problem acquiring the funding, but not as a prescriptive dictionary. This was to be a grand comprehensive dictionary of all English words at any period, ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' (1755).

By 1858, the need for an update resulted in the first planning for a new comprehensive dictionary to document standard English, a term coined at that time by the planning committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bex|1999|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dictionary, known as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', published its first fascicle in 1884. It attracted significant contributions from some singular minds, such as [[William Chester Minor]], a former army surgeon who had become criminally insane and made most of his contributions while incarcerated. Whether the OED is the long-desired standard English Dictionary is debatable, but its authority is taken seriously by the entire English-speaking world. Its staff is currently working on a third edition.

Surviving dictionaries are a century earlier than their grammars. The [[Académie française]] founded in 1635 was given the obligation of producing a standard dictionary. Some early dictionaries are:
* Louis Cruse, alias Garbin: ''Dictionaire latin-françois'', 1487
* [[Robert Estienne]], alias Robertus Stephanus: ''Dictionnaire françois–latin'', 1539
* Maurice de la Porte: ''Epitheta'', 1571
* [[Jean Nicot]]: ''Thresor de la langue fracoyse, tant ancienne que moderne'', 1606
* Pierre Richelet: ''Dictionnaire françois contenant les mots et les choses'', 1680
* [[Académie française]]: ''[[Dictionnaire de l’Académie française]]'', 1694 ''annis''.

=== German ===
[[High German]] dictionaries began in the 16th century and were at first multi-lingual. They were preceded by glossaries of German words and phrases on various specialized topics. Finally interest in developing a vernacular German grew to the point where Maaler could publish a work called by [[Jacob Grimm]] "the first truly German dictionary",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|pp=214–215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua Maaler's ''Die Teutsche Spraach: Dictionarium Germanico-latinum novum'' (1561).

It was followed along similar lines by Georg Heinisch: ''Teütsche Sprache und Weißheit'' (1616). After numerous dictionaries and glossaries of a less-than-comprehensive nature came a [[thesaurus]] that attempted to include all German, Kaspar Stieler's ''Der Teutschen Sprache Stammbaum und Fortwachs oder Teutschen Sprachschatz'' (1691), and finally the first codification of written German,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|1985|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Christoph Adelung]]'s ''Versuch eines vollständigen grammatisch-kritischen Wörterbuches Der Hochdeutschen Mundart'' (1774–1786).[[Schiller]] called Adelung an ''Orakel'' and [[Christoph Martin Wieland|Wieland]] is said to have nailed a copy to his desk.

=== Italian ===
In the early 15th century a number of glossaries appeared, such as that of Lucillo Minerbi on [[Boccaccio]] in 1535, and those of Fabrizio Luna on [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]], [[Petrarch|Petrarca]], Boccaccio and [[Dante]] in 1536. In the mid-16th the dictionaries began, as listed below. In 1582 the first language academy was formed, called Accademia della Crusca, "bran academy", which sifted language like grain. Once formed, its publications were standard-setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Renaissance and reform: the Italian contribution|first=Frances Amelia |last=Yates| page=18|volume=Volume 2|year=1983|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Voice Piece for Soprano''''' is a 1961 vocal composition by the Japanese artist and musician [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The score for the piece consists of the word '[[Scream (sound)|scream]]' with three options for screaming given to the performer; to scream 'against the wind', 'against the wall' and 'against the sky'.&lt;ref name="Barrett2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=G Douglas Barrett|title=After Sound: Toward a Critical Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x4HNDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA126|date=11 August 2016|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-5013-0809-3|pages=126–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist G Douglas Barrett in his 2016 book ''After Sound: Toward a Critical Music'' described the repetition of the word 'against' in the score for ''Vocal Piece for Soprano'' as redoubling "the screams singularly confrontational, antagonistic, and contrarian quality".&lt;ref name="Barrett2016"/&gt;

==History==
The piece was part of Ono's 2015 retrospective at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Ono performed the piece herself several times during the duration of the exhibition, and visitors were encouraged via an "instruction piece" to scream into an amplified microphone. The sound of visitors screaming could be heard throughout the [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] of the museum for he duration of the exhibition from July to November, with the screams being heard as high as the museum's fifth floor.&lt;ref name="VernallisHerzog2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carol Vernallis|author2=Amy Herzog|author3=John Richardson|title=The Oxford Handbook of Sound and Image in Digital Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXQRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159|date=August 2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-025817-7|pages=159–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
