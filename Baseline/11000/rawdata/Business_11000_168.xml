'''Behavioral analytics''' is a recent advancement in [[business analytics]] that reveals new insights into the behavior of consumers on [[eCommerce]] platforms, online games, web and mobile applications, and [[Internet of things|IoT]]. The rapid increase in the volume of raw event data generated by the digital world enables methods that go beyond typical analysis{{advert inline|date=May 2017}} by demographics and other traditional metrics that tell us what kind of people took what actions in the past. Behavioral analysis focuses on understanding how consumers act and why, enabling accurate predictions about how they are likely to act in the future. It enables marketers to make the right offers to the right consumer segments at the right time.

Behavioral analytics utilizes the massive volumes of raw user event data captured during sessions in which consumers use application, game, or website, including traffic data like navigation path, clicks, social media interactions, purchasing decisions and marketing responsiveness. Also, the event-data can include advertising metrics like click-to-conversion time, as well as comparisons between other metrics like the monetary value of an order and the amount of time spent on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamaguchi|first=Kohki|title=Leveraging Advertising Data For Behavioral Insights|url=http://marketingland.com/leveraging-advertising-data-for-behavioral-insights-46467|work=Analytics &amp; Marketing Column|publisher=Marketing Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These data points are then compiled and analyzed, whether by looking at session progression from when a user first entered the platform until a sale was made, or what other products a user bought or looked at before this purchase. Behavioral analysis allows future actions and trends to be predicted based on the collection of such data.

While business analytics has a more broad focus on the who, what, where and when of [[business intelligence]], behavioral analytics narrows that scope, allowing one to take seemingly unrelated [[data]] points in order to extrapolate, predict and determine errors and future trends. It takes a more holistic and human view of data, connecting individual data points to tell us not only what is happening, but also how and why it is happening.

==Examples and real world applications==
[[File:Visual Representation of Events that Make Up Behavioral Analysis.png|thumb|right|Visual Representation of Events that Make Up Behavioral Analysis]]
Data shows that a large percentage of users using a certain eCommerce platform found it by searching for “Thai food” on Google. After landing on the homepage, most people spent some time on the “Asian Food” page and then logged off without placing an order. Looking at each of these events as separate data points does not represent what is really going on and why people did not make a purchase. However, viewing these data points as a representation of overall user behavior enables one to interpolate how and why users acted in this particular case.
 
Behavioral analytics looks at all site traffic and page views as a timeline of connected events that did not lead to orders. 
Since most users left after viewing the “Asian Food” page, there could be a disconnect between what they are searching for on Google and what the “Asian Food” page displays. Knowing this, a quick look at the “Asian Food” page reveals that it does not display Thai food prominently and thus people do not think it is actually offered, even though it is.

Behavioral analytics is becoming increasingly popular in commercial environments. [[Amazon.com]] is a leader in using behavioral analytics to recommend additional products that customers are likely to buy based on their previous purchasing patterns on the site.&lt;ref name=IBM&gt;{{cite web|title=Oh behave! How behavioral analytics fuels more personalized marketing |url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/zzw03004usen/ZZW03004USEN.PDF |publisher=IBM Software |accessdate=3 July 2013 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral analytics is also used by [[Target Corporation|Target]] to suggest products to customers in their retail stores, while political campaigns use it to determine how potential voters should be approached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Homa|first=Ken|title=Behavioral analytics … bad when Target does it … OK for political campaigns?|url=http://kenhoma.wordpress.com/2012/09/19/behavioral-analytics-bad-when-target-does-it-ok-for-political-campaigns/|work=The Homa Files}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to retail and political applications, behavioral analytics is also used by banks and manufacturing firms to prioritize leads generated by their websites. Behavioral analytics also allow developers to manage users in online-gaming and web applications.&lt;ref name="IBM"/&gt;

IBM and Intel are creating ecosystems of connected solutions and advanced analytics. In retail, this is the Internet of Things (IoT) for tracking shopping behaviors.

==Types==
* Ecommerce and retail – Product recommendations and predicting future sales trends
* Online gaming – Predicting usage trends, load, and user preferences in future releases
* Application development – Determining how users use an application to predict future usage and preferences.
* [[Cohort analysis]] – Breaking users down into similar groups to gain a more focused understanding of their behavior.
* Security – Detecting compromised credentials and insider threats by locating anomalous behavior.
* Suggestions – People who liked this also liked...
* Presentation of relevant content based on user behavior.

== Components ==
An ideal behavioral analytics solution would include:
* Real-time capture of vast volumes of raw event data across all relevant digital devices and applications used during sessions
* Automatic aggregation of raw event data into relevant data sets for rapid access, filtering and analysis
* Ability to query data in an unlimited number of ways, enabling users to ask any business question
* Extensive library of built-in analysis functions such as cohort, path and funnel analysis
* A visualization component

===Sports===

==Assault==
Eurlings was prosecuted for assaulting his former girlfriend Tessa Rolink.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nltimes.nl/2016/09/22/ex-cda-minister-prosecuted-assaulting-model-girlfriend|title=Ex CDA minister to be prosecuted for assaulting model girlfriend|date=22 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutch newspaper ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ad.nl/&lt;/ref&gt; Rolink sustained injuries including concussion and a broken elbow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/om-schikt-met-camiel-eurlings-in-zaak-mishandeling-van-ex-vriendin~a515ab0f/|title=OM schikt met Camiel Eurlings|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ad.nl|language=nl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was not brought before the court because a settlement was reached between Eurlings and the [[Openbaar Ministerie|Dutch public prosecution service]], but details of the settlement have not been officially released. The transaction formally constituted an act of prosecution and hence Eurlings now has a criminal record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2017/03/17/eurlings-schikt-met-justitie-bekent-hij-daarmee-schuld-7431304-a1550863|date=17 March 2017|publisher=NRC Handelsblad|title=Eurlings schikt met justitie, bekent hij daarmee ook schuld?|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caselex''' is a unique legal information service opening up national case law and other important decisions (like those of competition authorities) with a European connotation to legal professions. As such it contributes to the [[Europeanisation of law]].

== Caselex: a unique gateway to the interpretation of European law ==
Relying on a network of editors throughout Europe Caselex systematically summarizes in English case law and other decisions that have a cross border value to legal professionals. The service consists of the Caselex Market Definitions Module and several Case Law Modules. 

== Caselex Market Definitions Module ==
Defining relevant markets is crucial in concentration control and antitrust cases. The ''Caselex Market Definitions Module'' gives user friendly access to English summaries of relevant markets definitions of concentration control decisions rendered by ''all'' 34 national and European competition authorities (29 [[EU member states|EU Member States]], 4 [[EFTA and the European Union|EFTA]] countries and  [[Directorate-General for Competition|DG COMP]] of the [[European Commission]]) since 2000 up to today.

Accordingly, by giving an instant synoptic European-wide overview of all relevant markets defined it provides support to lawyers submitting notifications and to competition authorities responsible for concentration control under the [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/legislation/regulations.html EU 2004 Merger Control Regulation] as well as national rules thereon. Each product market is searchable on the basis of names of products and NACE codes and each definition backed up by the line of reasoning of the competition authority. Full texts of original decision are also available and downloadable in PDF.

Currently (October 2015), the database holds over 3.500 national and 900 DG COMP decisions holding more than 10.000 market definitions. The launch of this Module is foreseen in January 2016.

== Caselex Case Law Modules ==
Next to that Caselex covers important national case law from all EU Member States Caselex (next to case law from the [[European Court of Justice]]). Well structured English summaries allow for instant access to and full understanding of case law that would otherwise not travel across Europe. Currently (October 2015) the Modules hold almost 5.000 summaries covering the following areas of law:
* [[EU competition law|Competition Law]]
* [[Employment law|Employment Law]]
* [[Public procurement law|Public procurement Law]]
* [[Media law|ICT and Media Law]]
* [[Social Law Library|Social Security Law]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13591">The '''Certified Public Manager₢''' (CPM) is a [[United States]] [[Professional certification|professional designation]] established in 1979 for the purpose of improving performance and advancing [[best practice]] standards for [[public sector]] managers. The CPM is a comprehensive [[management]] development program based upon a selected set of [https://web.archive.org/web/20121002043339/http://www.aspaonline.org/scpm/competencies.html competencies]. The CPM is awarded upon completion of a CPM program accredited by the National Certified Public Manager Consortium. CPM graduates come from public, private, and non-profit career fields.
The words "certified public manager" are registered service marks by the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Patent and Trademark Office]].

== Requirements ==

Requirements for the CPM vary by program, but all require at least 300&amp;nbsp;hours of training, including classes, application projects, structured readings, and examinations. Each CPM candidate is required to pass a series of courses centering on various management principles. The courses are designed around a set of core competencies and each CPM program requires an evaluation of all major [[curriculum|curricular]] competencies.

=== Curriculum competencies ===

The following competencies are present in all CPM curriculum:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CPM Curriculum)|url=http://www.cpmconsortium.org/Curriculum|publisher=National CPM Consortium|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of CPM competencies arise from a [[holistic]] approach to management. Communication, organizational management, and ethical principles are emphasized as well as financial responsibility and effective [[change management]]. [[System thinking]] is introduced within the CPM program to emphasize the importance of broad open system management within organization. The program also places importance on personal development and change leadership.

== History ==

The idea for the CPM began in the early 1970s at the [[University Of Georgia|University of Georgia]] with the realization that the state was experiencing explosive growth in information and knowledge, significant new social legislation, and rapidly altering social values. During this time the [[Carl Vinson Institute of Government]] and the Georgia [[Merit system|Merit System]] were offering management training to public employees. It was recognized that these two organizations were offering duplications of training in some areas of management and were failing to meet the needs of other management areas. In 1974 University of Georgia’s Institute of Government, the Georgia Center for Continuing Education, and the Georgia State Merit System for Personnel Administration convened to discuss ways to broaden and refine Georgia state management training programs to meet the challenges of rapid change in the state and society. A consensus was reached that management in the state government needed to become more professional.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=Thomas H.|title=The History of the Certified Public Manager|date=8 April 2003|publisher=American Academy of Certified Public Managers|pages=1–38|url=http://www.cpmacademy.org/publications/AACPM_History_20030329.pdf|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken Henning is considered the father of the CPM. He observed that most state training programs consisted of separate courses in which content was varied and lacked consistent focus. Henning felt that an integrated program would achieve a more organized approach to competencies needed by management. The CPM&amp;nbsp;program was modeled after the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA&amp;nbsp;program]], consisting of the creation of a coordinated program addressing specific and various training needs relevant to management as well as with content involving study and preparation, practice and application of learning, examination, and prestigious recognition. The CPM would also involve the eventual creation of the American Academy of Certified Public Managers similar to the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] as a central capstone organization.

Planners believed that awarding certificates of attendance were insufficient in the creation of a program based on quality. Early planners for the CPM determined that an innovative and rigorous program of study, application of knowledge, examination, and certification should be developed.  University courses and the Georgia Merit System collaborated to reduce training duplication, and maximize efforts. Initially a program was developed in which six courses would be taught, three by the Georgia Merit System and three by the University of Georgia.  
After a series of meetings, two long-term goals for the CPM were created:

* To achieve and subsequently to maintain a level of national recognition for the CPM&amp;nbsp;designation similar to that accorded the Certified Public Accountant&amp;nbsp;(CPA) designation; and
* To foster and encourage the highest possible levels of competence and ethical practice by managers in state and other levels of government through a national body of professionally trained and oriented Certified Public Managers.

After gathering strong support for the CPM program from the governor, legislative leadership, top management of state agencies, [http://www.uga.edu/ University of Georgia], regional intergovernmental personnel assistance (IPA) offices of the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Civil Service Commission]], the [http://www.cviog.uga.edu/ University of Georgia’s Institute for Government and Center for Continuing Education] and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20110708103007/http://gms.georgia.gov/00/article/0%2C2086%2C683909_6170_11788934%2C00.html Georgia State Merit System of Personnel Administration] co-authored a detailed proposal.

February&amp;nbsp;9,&amp;nbsp;1976 the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] passed Resolution Act No.&amp;nbsp;97 in response to [[George Busbee|Governor Busbee]]’s request authorizing and directing the State Personnel Board and the State Merit System of Personnel Administration to implement the Certified Public Manager Program in the State Government of Georgia. On February&amp;nbsp;19,&amp;nbsp;1976 the Senate adopted the resolution and the legislature unanimously passed the resolution on February&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;1976. On March&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1976 the CPM was formally established.

In 1977 the Georgia Society of Public Managers was created affiliated with a national organization to be known as the American Academy of Certified Public Managers. In 1980 the National CPM Consortium was developed with the completion of its constitution. The National CPM Consortium included [[Arizona]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. State)|Georgia]], [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Vermont]]. The role of the CPM Consortium is to direct the general nature in which each program should operate, but it is not designed to dictate curriculum or administrative specifics for each program. Since then, the CPM program has expanded across the United States.

== National Certified Public Manager® Consortium ==

On October 6, 1980 the Certified Public Manager Board ratified the constitution of the [http://cpmconsoritum.org National Certified Public Manager® Consortium]. The Consortium is designed to monitor [[accreditation]] standards and facilitate program development of CPM programs around the nation.

== Program linkages ==

The CPM is linked with several professional organizations, including the [http://www.cpmacademy.org/ American Academy of Certified Public Managers], an organization for individuals with CPM accreditation and the [[American Society for Public Administration|American Society for Public Administration&amp;nbsp;(ASPA)]], which provides free membership for CPM graduates. Annually, the [[Texas]] CPM and ASPA host a CPM/ASPA conference. In 2007 a new ASPA section called the Section on Certified Public Management was created to promote professional development and training regarding ethical values and technical competencies associated with outstanding public service. In addition, the SCPM holds conferences, forums, seminars, and discussion events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The William P.

The contract for the CPM program at the Swedish National Defense College was signed along with the [[William&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Hobby]] Center for Public Service which is affiliated with [[Texas State University - San Marcos]] and the National CPM Consortium. The program in Sweden is viewed as the first step toward more international expansion of the CPM.

In 2015, [http://professionallearning.nl/en Leiden University Centre for Professional Learning] in the Netherlands was the first international program to become a member of the National Certified Public Manager Consortium and be granted Associate status.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4095">{{Merge to |Consultant|date=January 2018 }}
A '''consulting or consultancy firm''' is a [[business]] of one or more experts ([[consultant]]s) that provides professional advice to an individual or an [[organization]] for a [[fee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/consulting+firm |title=Consultancy Firm definition |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consultancy firms target company executives and provide them with consultants, also known as industry-specific specialists and [[subject-matter experts]], usually trained in management or business schools. The deliverable of a consultant is usually advice or a recipe to follow to achieve a company objective, leading to a company project.

More and more consulting firms are complementing the strategic deliverables by providing the means to implement the recommendations, either with the consultants themselves or by providing technicians and/or experts. This has opened up new markets for these companies. This is called [[outsourcing]].

Consulting services are part of the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] and account for several hundred billion dollars in annual revenues. Between 2010 and 2015, the 10 largest consulting firms alone made 170 billion dollars growth revenue and the average annual growth rate is around 4%.

== Segments ==
The segmentation of advisory services varies widely across organizations and countries. Categorization is unclear, in part because of the upheavals that have occurred in this industry in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2013/10/consulting-on-the-cusp-of-disruption|title=Consulting on the Cusp of Disruption|date=2013-10-01|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One approach is to separate services into four broad service delivery families, considering the managers they are targeting:
* Services related to the company's overall strategy, which are addressed to the CEO,
* Services related to marketing, communication, sales and public relations, which are addressed to the CMO,
* Services related to management, financial management, taxation, accounting, compliance with regulations, for the CFO,
* Services related to the company's operations, including information technology, intended for operational management, which may be different depending on the industrial sector (technology director, plant managers, operations directors, Research and Development managers), for instance COO and CTO.

== Types ==
There are different types of Consulting Firms serving different sectors. They mainly fall under the following fields:

* [[Financial services|Financial]]
* [[Information technology consulting|Information technology]]
* [[Management consulting|Management]]
* [[Human resource consulting|Human resources]]
* Legal
* [[Hotel]] and [[hospitality industry]]
* [[Health care]]

In addition to the above-mentioned fields, there are consulting firms that serve niche sectors such as [[advertising]]/[[marketing]]/[[public relations]] consulting,  [[environmental consulting]], [[energy]] consulting, [[Entertainment industry|entertainment]]/[[Mass media|media]] consulting, [[Political consulting|consulting in politics]] and the [[Public sector consulting|public sector]], [[real estate]] consulting, etc.

Cortex states that once their master plan is completed, there will be $2.3 billion of construction and more than 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use development, including 13,000 jobs in technology.&lt;ref name="cortex-thedistrict" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stlpublicradio-aloft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

The current initiative for Cortex is called Cortex 3.0, $170 million expansion of Cortex to be completed in fall 2018.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex’s Evolution From A Life Science District To A Magnet For St. Louis Innovators: A Feature Series | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=27 February 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution4"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex Looks Ahead: Cortex Special Feature, Chapter 4, 2017 And Beyond | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=2 March 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

In 1998, [[William Henry Danforth]], whom 3 years prior had retired as chancellor of [[Washington University]] in St. Louis, recognized that the region was not building upon its core strengths in medicine and plant sciences. He formed the Coalition for Plant and Life Sciences, now known as [[BioSTL]].&lt;ref name="ninenet-oral" /&gt;

This eventually led to the creation of the [[Donald Danforth Plant Science Center]].

Coming off that successful project, [[William Henry Danforth]] and [[John Dubinsky]], CEO of financial consulting firm [[Westmoreland Associates]] and the eventual chairman of the Cortex board, went to Cambridge to study [[Kendall Square]], the most notable [[innovation district]] to see how the concept could be used in St. Louis.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

The idea for Cortex came from the idea to create a district where companies could have a presence with access to talent, new technology, labs and intellectual property in order to innovate.  The reason the [[Midtown St. Louis|Midtown neighborhood]] was selected for the location of Cortex is because the founding institutions are nearby and the Millenial Generation showed desire to live and work in the nearby urban areas.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="curbed-millenials"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.curbed.com/2018/8/7/17658662/university-real-estate-development-startup| accessdate=18 September 2018 | title=Universities, chasing the startup economy, reshape urban real estate | first= Patrick | last=Sisson | date=7 Aug 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

Cortex as an organization was founded in 2002 by [[Washington University]] (WashU), [[BJC HealthCare]] (BJC), [[University of Missouri – St. Louis]] (UMSL), [[St. Louis University]] (SLU), and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

Cortex is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization.&lt;ref name="cortex-whoweare"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://cortexstl.com/who-we-are/ | accessdate=18 September 2018 | title=Cortex Official Who We Are }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

To start the initial nonprofit to purchase land, members contributed $29 million USD as collateral for loans and purchasing of land. Washington University provided $15 million, BJC and SLU gave $5 million each, and UMSL gave $4 million USD.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;

The Cortex West Redevelopment Corporation was classified by the city under Missouri statute Chapter 353, as a master developer of the district. St. Louis Mayar [[Francis Slay]] gave Cortex the ability to redevelop the area broadly in the "public interest" with the tools of issuing tax abatements and using [[eminent domain]] if necessary, as has been documented as least two times.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brookings-stl" /&gt;

The first hire by Cortex was CEO, Dennis Lower. Lower executed a plan called Cortex 2.0 and converted Cortex from a bioscience district to an open mixed-used district. Also part of Cortex 2.0 was a shift to startup technology companies.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://eqstl.com/cortexs-evolution-life-science-district-magnet-st-louis-innovators-feature-series/ | title=Cortex Shifts Focus: Cortex Special Feature, Chapter 3, 2010-2016 | first=Mary | last=Mack | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=1 March 2017 | work=EQSTL }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer of 2014, [[Square, Inc.|Square]], the payments company setup by St. Louis natives [[Jim McKelvey]] and [[Jack Dorsey]] opened offices at Cortex 4240.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3" /&gt;

In 2015, [[Ikea]] opened in Cortex.&lt;ref name="eqstl-cortex-evolution3" /&gt;

In 2018, [[Microsoft]] opened its first midwest headquarters in Cortex building 4220.&lt;ref name="curbed-millenials" /&gt;

In Fall 2018, once [[Venture Cafe|Venture Cafe Innovation Hall]] opens at the 4220 Building in Cortex, 23 City Blocks Hospitality Group's restaurant and cafe, The Chocolate Pig will open.&lt;ref name="feast-chocopig"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.feastmagazine.com/the-feed/st_louis_news/article_e7ee9272-3d93-11e8-b775-b773792b4624.html | title=The Chocolate Pig to Open at Cortex Innovation Hall This Fall | first=Nancy | last=Stiles | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=11 April 2018 | work=Feast Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, [[Aon (company)|AON]] announced it was relocating 200 of its employees to the Cortex new 4220 building.&lt;ref name="stltoday-aon"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/aon-relocating-employees-from-clayton-to-st-louis-cortex-district/article_04bcae19-7754-5009-8ed4-0836c00cca0f.html | title=Aon relocating 200 employees from Clayton to St. Louis' Cortex district | first=Brian | last=Feldt | accessdate=18 September 2018 | date=8 June 2018 | work=[[St. Louis Post Dispatch]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==

The Cortex Innovation Community is located in the [[Midtown St. Louis|Midtown neighborhood]]. It is over 200 acres of land and is situated nearby St. Louis’ [[Central West End]] and [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]] neighborhoods. It is next to internationally known [[Washington University]], its medical campus, [[St. Louis University]], and [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]]. Cortex is near cultural institutions including the [[Grand Center Arts District, St. Louis|Grand Center Arts District]] and the [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]. Cortex is next to [[Forest Park (St. Louis)|Forest Park]], which is home to the [[St. Louis Zoo]], the [[St. Louis Art Museum]], the [[St. Louis Science Center]], the [[Missouri History Museum]].

'''Customer Acquisition Cost''' is the cost associated in convincing a customer to buy a product/service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://five23.io/blog/knowing-your-customer-acquisition-cost/|title=Knowing Your Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)|last=Cook|first=Andrew|date=2017-06-29|work=Five23|access-date=2017-06-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cost is incurred by the organization to convince a potential customer. This is an important business metric. It plays a major role in calculating the value of the customer to the company and the resulting return on investment (ROI) of acquisition. The calculation of customer valuation helps a company decide how much of its resources can be profitably spent on a particular customer. In general terms, it helps to decide the worth of the customer to the company.

'''Customer Acquisition Cost''' (abbreviated to CAC) refers to the resources that a [[business]] must allocate (financial or otherwise) in order to acquire an additional [[customer]].

Numerically, ''customer acquisition cost'' is typically expressed as a [[ratio]] — dividing the sum total of ''CAC'' by the number of additional patrons acquired by the business as a result of the customer acquisition strategy.

==Relevance==

''Customer Acquisition Cost'' will typically increase as a business matures. It is also typical to see a diminishing return on ''CAC'' as a business grows in size and possibly geographical distribution. At some point, a given customer acquisition strategy will no longer be beneficial - this means that the financial [[rate of return]] that can be expected to accompany new customers is surpassed by the cost of acquiring those customers in the first place. Most businesses wisely choose to adopt a different strategy for customer acquisition before this point is reached.

Customer acquisition cost can be used in conjunction with [[SaaS]], [[Business-to-business|B2B]] [[software]] sales and [[Startup company|startups]]. The metric is mentioned in the publications of [[venture capital]] firms such as [[Accel Partners]], [[Bessemer Venture Partners]] or [[Matrix Partners]]. The CAC ratio also appears in business oriented magazines such as Forbes and Inc.com.

===Government service===
Belin served in the United States Army in Korea and in Japan.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt;

Belin was assistant counsel to the [[Warren Commission]], which investigated President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[JFK assassination|assassination]]. Belin concluded that [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] had worked entirely on his own as Kennedy's assassin, which the commission affirmed in its final report. Belin stood by the findings of the Warren report until his death, and was known to become incensed at any mention of an assassination conspiracy.&lt;ref name="Pace"/&gt; As he lay in a coma in his final days, his friends would whisper conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination into his ear to confirm his unconsciousness by his unprecedented lack of response.&lt;ref name="The New York Times Magazine; January 2, 2000"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Sullivan |date=January 2, 2000 |title=The Lives They Lived: David W.

Belin wrote two books on the JFK Assassination: ''November 22, 1963: You Are the Jury'' (1973) and ''Final Disclosure: The Full Truth About the Assassination of President Kennedy'' (1988).

Belin's former Warren Commission member and then-president [[Gerald Ford]] appointed him executive director to the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]], which investigated [[CIA]] activities within the [[United States]].

===Belin Lectureship===
In 1991, Belin established the David W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1977">'''Delivery schedule adherence''' (DSA) is a business metric used to calculate the timeliness of deliveries from suppliers.  It is a commonly used supply chain metric and forms part of the [[Quality, Cost, Delivery]] group of performance indicators.

==Calculation==

Delivery schedule adherence is calculated by dividing the number of “on time” deliveries in a period by the total number of deliveries made.  The result is then multiplied by 100 and expressed as a [[percentage]]. 

It is common for businesses to delineate the delivery schedule adherence results by supplier - this facilitates ranking and stratification &lt;ref&gt;Lean Supply Chain Management: A Handbook for Strategic Procurement
 By Jeffrey P. Wincel&lt;/ref&gt;  in accordance with a suppliers performance.

==Relevance==

Poor DSA can  result in enhanced [[buffer stock]] being carried  to compensate for suppliers that fail to deliver on time.&lt;ref&gt;The IOMA Handbook of Logistics and Inventory Management
 By Bob Donath, Institute of Management and Administration (Ioma), Institute of Management &amp; Administration&lt;/ref&gt;  This has an associated business cost whilst the potential for stock outs can impact on customer service levels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supplychaingroups.co.uk/docs/CAT_Logistics.pdf Supply Chain Case Studies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Targets for DSA are therefore usually set quite high and the calculation and review of the metric important.  Some organizations experience problems in producing delivery schedule adherence information this can be caused by a failure of systems to record delivery forecast information, unreliable processes and poor communication between buyer and seller.&lt;ref&gt;Concerns with DSA http://www.supplychainmechanic.com/?p=33&lt;/ref&gt;  Ensuring that DSA can be correctly calculated and then improved often forms part of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weaf.co.uk/competitiveness/case_studies/Bowmill.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has highlighted differences among founder and non-founder CEOs that influence [[Return on investment|firm performance]]. These differences include: [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[Equity stake|equity stake in the firm]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]], and outlook towards [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, founder CEOs outperform their non-founder CEO counterparts in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]]. They tend to take a long-term view and consider their firm their lifetime achievement, resulting in them holding a larger [[equity stake]] in their firm than non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Darius Palia, S. Abraham Ravid, and Chia-Jane Wang developed this idea further and concluded that founder CEOs become less influenced by managerial incentives as they continue to devote resources to their firm whereas the opposite is true for non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs are less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performance according to managerial incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Scholars such as Joon Mahn Mahn Lee, Jongsoo Jays Kim, and Joonhyung Bae, concluded that founder CEOs continually invest in new projects and explore new knowledge that will benefit the firm in the long-term, suggesting that the existence of a founder CEO is correlated with a greater [[Research and development|innovation investment]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In terms of [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]], Fahlenbrach, along with other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs partake in a greater number of acquisitions within their [[core business]] line each year as they have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|tolerance for risk]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This additional risk taken on by founder CEOs stems from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level which some scholars have measured through their tone in tweets, regarding both [[Earnings call|earnings announcements]] and personal statements, and their [[Option (finance)|option exercise behavior]] relative to non-founder CEOs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Founder [[CEO succession]] can occur through both voluntary and involuntary means. Noam Wasserman found in majority of founder CEO successions, the founder is forced to step down by investors. Founder CEOs who successfully execute [[New product development|product development]] or enter into negotiations with potential outside investors for additional capital have a higher likelihood of being replaced than those who are not as successful with product development and/or do not to raise additional capital. Indicated by several scholars, like Wasserman, as the CEO becomes successful in product development the needs of the firm expand and a mismatch between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward is likely to occur, increasing the probability of succession.  Founder CEOs are generally succeeded by someone from outside the firm.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Founder CEO comebacks have occurred when the founder CEO was replaced and later returned to their role as CEO.

A person or several people can be founders of the firm. The founders earn the founder title once the firm becomes [[Operational definition|operational]] at which point their founder role ends. Founders do not have a particular role post founding, but their influence continues as they designed the firm's blueprint impacting structures and decision-making going forward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== US firms ==
Eleven percent of US [[Market capitalization|large cap firms]] are led by founder CEOs, including well-known companies such as [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]],  [[FedEx|Fedex]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Negative and positive contributions to firm performance  ==
Several differences identified in research exist between firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs. Identified differences include [[Return on investment|stock performance]], [[equity stake]], managerial incentives, [[Research and development|innovation investment]] and participation in [[mergers and acquisitions]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In November 2009, [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]] named [[Steve Jobs]], founder of [[Apple Inc.]], CEO of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/23/decade-steve-jobs-apple/|title=The Decade of Steve Jobs (Fortune, 2009)|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The six runners-up, all founder CEOs, were: [[Bill Gates]], [[Warren Buffett]], [[Martha Stewart]], [[Bernard Madoff]], [[Sergey Brin]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2009/11/05/fortune-magazine-names-apples-steve-jobs-ceo-of-the-decade/|title=Fortune magazine names Apple’s Steve Jobs CEO of the decade|website=Fortune|access-date=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stock performance  ===
According to some scholars such as Rudiger Fahlenbrach, firms led by founder CEOs outperform those led by non-founder CEOs, in both [[Return on investment|stock performance]] and [[Market value|market valuation]].  Between the time period of 1993 and 2002 an [[Portfolio (finance)|equally weighted portfolio]], consisting of companies led by founder CEOs, would have earned an annual benchmark-adjusted return of 8.3%. In other words, an [[Abnormal return|excess abnormal return]] of 4.4% annually.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahlenbrach|first=Rüdiger|date=2009-01-01|title=Founder-CEOs, Investment Decisions, and Stock Market Performance|jstor=40505931|journal=The Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis|volume=44|issue=2|pages=439–466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2016, 16 companies in the [[S&amp;P 500 Index|S&amp;P 500]] still have founder CEOs, who have been with the company for at least 5 years. In aggregate, these companies have generated a 5-year average [[Rate of return|return]] of 170%, significantly greater than the 56% 5-year S&amp;P 500 gain.  Of these companies, 14 have outperformed the market over the past three years. These companies include: [[Facebook]], [[Netflix]], [[Under Armour]], [[Nvidia]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Starbucks]], [[Regeneron|Regeneron Pharmaceuticals]], [[L Brands]], [[Verisign|VeriSign]], [[FedEx]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[Akamai Technologies]], [[Intercontinental Exchange]], and [[SanDisk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2016/03/28/19-companies-excel-founders-charge/82343660/|title=Founders make great CEOs. Here's why|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Equity stake  ===
Fahlenbrach, like many other scholars, concluded that founder CEOs have a larger [[equity stake]] in the firm, potentially reducing the [[Principal–agent problem|principal agent problem]].  Founder CEOs consider their firm their lifetime achievement and therefore take a long-term view. This approach results in the [[Shareholder value|optimal shareholder-value maximizing strategy]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Managerial incentives  ===
Incentive structures do differ for firms led by founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs as a result of different pay performance sensitivity as concluded by several scholars including Palia, Ravid, and Wang. A statistically significant relationship is present between these two variables for firms led by non-founder CEOs. Non-founder CEOs tend to be less invested in their company and are more likely to tailor their performances according to their pay incentives.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Meanwhile, this relationship is insignificant for founder CEOs, who become less influenced to pay incentives as they devote more time and energy to their firm.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palia|first=Darius|last2=Ravid|first2=S. Abraham|last3=Wang|first3=Chia-Jane|date=2008-02-01|title=Founders versus non-founders in large companies: financial incentives and the call for regulation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|journal=Journal of Regulatory Economics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=55–86|doi=10.1007/s11149-007-9042-z|issn=0922-680X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This founder CEO attachment to their firm results in lower salaries, which can be seen in a study completed by Noam Wasserman on 528 ventures between the years 1996 and 2002. This results of this study concluded that more than half, 51%, of founder CEOs make either the same salary or one that is lower than someone who reports to them. Additionally, the results showed that founder CEOs receive 20% less in cash compensation than their non-founder CEO counterparts with similar experience.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hbr.org/2008/02/the-founders-dilemma|title=The Founder’s Dilemma|work=Harvard Business Review|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation investment ===
Scholars have indicated that founder CEOs experience greater [[innovation]] performance than non-founder CEOs, who tend to be [[Risk-averse|risk averse]]. Extant research attributes these differences in [[Research and development|innovation investment]]  to founder CEOs taking a long-term approach, continually investing in new projects, and exploring new knowledge. Thus suggesting that founder CEOs are not as concerned with [[job security]] or impacted by short term performance, therefore, resources are dedicated to long-term resources. Lee, Kim, and Bae found that the existence of a founder CEO is [[Correlation and dependence|correlated]] with a 31 percent increase in the citation-weighted [[patent]] count before controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]] and a 23 percent increase after controlling for [[Research and development|research and development spending]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn Mahn|last2=Kim|first2=Jongsoo Jays|last3=Bae|first3=Joonhyung|date=2016-01-01|title=Are Founder CEOs Better Innovators? Evidence from S&amp;P 500 Firms|url=http://proceedings.aom.org/content/2016/1/13311|journal=Academy of Management Proceedings|language=en|volume=2016|issue=1|page=13311|doi=10.5465/AMBPP.2016.13311abstract|issn=0065-0668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mergers and acquisitions  ===
Fahlenbrach, along with others concluded founder-CEOs have a greater [[Risk Tolerance|risk tolerance]] and partake in a greater number of [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] per year than non-founder CEOs.  The [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]] that founder-CEOs make do not diversify their portfolio as the acquisitions tend to be within their [[core business]]es.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Joon Mahn Lee, Byoung-Hyoun Hwang, and Hailiang Chen suggested that the additional risks taken on by founder-led firms stem from [[overconfidence]] at the CEO level.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Founder CEO overconfidence ====
Founder-CEOs overconfidence may have negative or positive effect on their firms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Stephen X.|last2=Cueto|first2=Javier|date=2015-11-09|title=The Study of Bias in Entrepreneurship|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/etap.12212|journal=Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice|language=en|volume=41|issue=3|pages=419–454|doi=10.1111/etap.12212|issn=1042-2587}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a study completed on the [[S&amp;P 1500|S&amp;P 1500 firms]] by Lee, Hwang, and Chen, it was concluded that founder CEOs use fewer negative words in both personal tweets and statements regarding [[Earnings call|earnings]]. This optimism was observed to exist at the executive level as well. Founder CEOs also provide more optimistic earnings estimates than their non-founder counterparts. Investors are unaware of this [[overconfidence bias]] among founder CEOs and take them at face value indicating no discount taken into consideration in the [[financial market]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Joon Mahn|last2=Hwang|first2=Byoung-Hyoun|last3=Chen|first3=Hailiang|date=2017-03-01|title=Are founder CEOs more overconfident than professional CEOs? Evidence from S&amp;P 1500 companies|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.2519/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=38|issue=3|pages=751–769|doi=10.1002/smj.2519|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 study completed by researchers at Purdue University, this overconfidence was seen when 3,000 entrepreneurs, founders, claimed there was an 81% chance of success for them and only a 59% chance for peers. One in three of these entrepreneurs believed they had a 100% success rate going forward.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Option (finance)|options]], which are tied to firm performance, were taken into account in Lee, Hwang, and Chen's study to measure overconfidence as most CEOs, founders or non-founders, are compensated in [[Option (finance)|options]] to an extent. When analyzing option-exercise behavior using the value of [[Vesting|vested in-the-money]] options to the total compensation, they concluded that founder CEOs had a significantly greater ratio. By comparison, they concluded that non-founder CEOs generally exercise their [[Option (finance)|options]] immediately when they become exercisable in-the-money to receive cash and remove their compensation linkage to future performance. Founder CEOs, however, hold off on exercising their in-the-money options as they are overly optimistic about the firm's future performance.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Founder CEO succession  ==

=== Occurrence ===
In the three years subsequent to the firm being founded, Wasserman concluded 50% of founder CEOs step down. The following year, another 10% step down and by the time the firm has an [[initial public offering]] less than 25% of founders still hold the CEO position.  This being said, the decision to step down is not always voluntary, four out of five founder CEOs are forced to relinquish their role as CEO by investors.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Events affecting replacement likelihood ===
As indicated in Wasserman's study and others, founder CEOs experience higher turnover when they:
# Successfully execute [[New product development|product development]]. Thus, the quicker the founder CEO leads the firm to success in product development, the quicker they will be replaced. As the needs of the firm expand with product development, a mismatch is likely to occur between the current skills of the founder CEO and the new skills needed for the firm's success going forward.
# Enter negotiations with potential investors for additional capital. As [[Investor|personal investors]] (family and friends), [[angel investor]]s, and [[venture capitalists]] invest in the firm, founder CEOs must often give up some control. It is also possible that potential investors will make their investment in the firm contingent upon the appointment of a new CEO. This occurs when the investors do not trust the founder CEO's ability to lead the company longer term. The likelihood of this happening is higher when the amount of capital needed is higher and outsiders have a larger equity stake in the firm, giving them more control in these decisions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wasserman|first=Noam|date=2003-03-01|title=Founder-CEO Succession and the Paradox of Entrepreneurial Success|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|journal=Organization Science|volume=14|issue=2|pages=149–172|doi=10.1287/orsc.14.2.149.14995|issn=1526-5455}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Founder CEO successor origin ===
Wasserman concluded that founder CEOs are almost always replaced by someone outside the organization (outside successor) opposed to someone inside (inside successor). Smaller and younger firms turn tend to turn to outsiders whereas in larger firms the [[board of directors]] is disinclined to appoint an outsider successor CEO unless the firm has experienced poor past performance. Relative to inside successors, outside successors are known to make more changes within the firm altering the firms overall business strategy, earn higher compensation, and achieve higher inter-organizational status.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Founder CEO comeback ===
A founder CEO comeback can be defined as a founder CEO who relinquished their role as CEO and later returns to the position. A study completed by Ryan Krause, Abhijith G. Acharya, and Jeffrey G. Covin, on fourteen high-profile [[Fortune 1000]] comeback firms, including [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Starbucks]], [[Gateway, Inc.|Gateway]], [[Dell]], [[Charles Schwab Corporation|Charles Schwab]], [[PeopleSoft|Peoplesoft]] and [[Google]], identified five key conditions attributable to a founder-CEO comeback. The conditions include: poor performance, unplanned succession, founder on board, founder ownership, and interdependent board.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krause|first=Ryan|last2=Acharya|first2=Abhijith G.|last3=Covin|first3=Jeffrey G.|date=2014-12-01|title=Here I come to save the day: Proposing necessary and sufficient conditions for founder-CEO comeback|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352673414000055|journal=Journal of Business Venturing Insights|volume=1–2|pages=26–30|doi=10.1016/j.jbvi.2014.09.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Security Challenge''' runs international [[business plan]] competitions to find and select the most promising security technology [[startup company|startup]]s in the world. The GSC holds regional selection events and a Security Summit in London to bring together innovators with government, industry and investors. The GSC belongs to [[InnoCentive]], which acquired the original owner [[OmniCompete]] in 2012. OmniCompete also launched the [[Energy Storage Challenge]] in 2010.

==History==
The GSC was founded by [[MBA]] students of [[London Business School]] in spring 2006; the first  [[competition]] took place in summer 2006. By 2007, the [[Technical Support Working Group]], an interagency group of the US Government, sponsored the annual grant award of $500,000 Dollar for the winning security startup. The GSC runs regional finals in [[Singapore]] at the [[National University of Singapore]], in [[Washington DC]] at [[The University of Maryland]] and [[Brussels]] at the [[Brussels School of International Studies]] ahead of the GSC [[London]] Security Summit in autumn, hosted by [[London Business School]].

==Past Competitions' Winners &amp; Finalists==
GSC finalists and winners from the last three annual competitions have subsequently raised over '''$117 million''' in new [[venture funding]] and grants. The top-selected startups also have secured large contracts with government clients, such as the [[US Department of Energy]], the [[US Navy]] and the [[US Department of Defense]], and with industry behemoths, such as [[Siemens]] and [[Bayer AG]] from Germany. One regional finalist in 2007, [http://www.tencube.com TenCube], recently got acquired by '''McAfee''' and the cyber 2009 winner [[Ksplice]] was acquired in July 2011 by [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4513">{{short description|food considered beneficial to health beyond normal nutrition}}
'''Health food''' is food marketed to provide [[human health]] effects beyond a normal [[healthy diet]] required for [[human nutrition]]. Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as [[natural foods]], [[organic food]]s, [[whole food]]s,  [[Vegetarian food|vegetarian foods]] or [[dietary supplement]]s. These products may be sold in [[health food store]]s or in the health food or organic sections of [[grocery store]]s.

==Health claims== 
{{Main|Health claims on food labels}}
In the United States, [[health claim]]s on [[Nutrition facts label#United States|nutrition facts label]]s are regulated by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), while advertising is regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Several other countries provide regulations on food labeling to address the quality of possible health foods, such as Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canada's food guides|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/canada-food-guides.html|publisher=Health Canada, Government of Canada|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Food Safety Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition and health claims|url=https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/nutrition-and-health-claims|publisher=European Food Safety Authority|accessdate=15 April 2018|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the FDA, "Health claims describe a relationship between a food, food component, or dietary supplement ingredient, and reducing risk of a disease or health-related condition".&lt;ref name ="FDA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/LabelingNutrition/LabelClaims/ucm111447.htm|title=Claims That Can Be Made for Conventional Foods and Dietary Supplements|author= |date=September 2003|work= |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=7 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, claims of health benefits for specific foodstuffs are not supported by scientific evidence and are not evaluated by national regulatory agencies. Additionally, research funded by manufacturers or marketers has been criticized to result in more favorable results than those from independently funded research.&lt;ref name ="Slop"&gt;{{cite journal | url= http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040005

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3803">'''Herbert Felix''' (1908 - 1973) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[entrepreneur]] of [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] descent and the founder of the food companies [[AB Felix]] and [[Felix Austria]].

Herbert Felix was born in an [[History of the Jews in Austria|Austrian-Jewish]] business family in the town of [[Znojmo]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] (after [[World War I]] a part of [[Czechoslovakia]] and since 1992 of the [[Czech Republic]]). He started working for the family company Löw &amp; Felix, which was known for its type of ''Znaimer Gurken'' [[cucumber]]s, and Herbert Felix was trained to become his father's successor as the company's CEO. He was responsible for the company's export and as such got the opportunity to travel around in [[Europe]]. During a visit to [[Sweden]], he met his first wife.

In 1938, Herbert Felix decided to leave Czechoslovakia following the annexation of [[Sudetenland]] by [[Nazi Germany]]. He came as a refugee to Sweden and in 1939 he started working for the company [[AB P. Håkansson]] in [[Eslöv]]. The activity was first run as a part of AB P. Håkansson, which through its cooperation with Felix could find an outlet for its surplus of [[vinegar]] in the factory. The success came in the early 1940s and the name "Felix" was started to be used by AB P. Håkansson as its trademark.

During [[World War II]], Herbert Felix fought as a volunteer in the Czech exiled forces and made unsuccessful efforts to save his family from the [[Holocaust]]. He joined as an officer in the Czech forces in Britain and participated in the [[Military history of France during World War II|Allies' war in France]]. In the end of the war, he came with the U.S. forces to Czechoslovakia where he became ultimately aware of his family's fate. His parents and brother had already in the autumn of 1944 been deported from [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]] to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] where they had been murdered. On his way back to Sweden, Herbert Felix was however able to rescue one of his best friends from a prison camp controlled by the Soviet forces.

After the war, Herbert Felix returned to Eslöv to continue to develop the company, which he purchased together with the chairman of the board in 1948. Under his leadership, the company introduced classical Swedish food products such as ''[[bostongurka]]'', [[cucumber]] for sandwiches and [[ketchup]] in plastic bottles. The [[canned food]] department of the company was named Felix in 1955. In 1959, he started business in Austria after a request from his cousin, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic]] politician (and later [[Chancellor of Austria]]) [[Bruno Kreisky]]. The new company became known as [[Felix Austria]].

Due to economic difficulties, in 1961 Herbert Felix sold 80% of his holdings in the company to [[Svenska Sockerfabriks AB]] (SSA, Sockerbolaget) and the rest in 1964.

Herbert Felix died in [[Torekov]], [[Sweden]] in 1973.

'''Inboekstelsel''' was a system of [[Indentured servant|indentured]] child labour in Southern Africa during the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2005p53"&gt;{{cite book|author=C. H. Feinstein|title=An Economic History of South Africa: Conquest, Discrimination, and Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEDe6FwZhk0C&amp;pg=PA53|date=2005-06-23|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-85091-9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] verb "inboeken" (register; literally "in-book"), referring to the requirement of entering the names and details of the "inboekeling", or apprentices, in the [[Landdros]]'s register.&lt;ref name=pwk/&gt;

The system had its origin in the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape]] Northern Frontier during the second half of the 18th century, when settlers would capture [[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] children, who became indentured labourers.&lt;ref name="Campbell2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gwyn Campbell|title=Abolition and Its Aftermath in the Indian Ocean, Africa and Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmU2Dr_-WxsC&amp;pg=PT43|date=2013-01-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-77078-5|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Boer trekkers migrated into the [[Transvaal Republic|Transvaal]] during the 1840s, they brought the inboekstelsel system with them.&lt;ref name="CampbellMiers2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gwyn Campbell|author2=Suzanne Miers|author3=Joseph Calder Miller|title=Women and Slavery: Africa, the Indian Ocean world, and the medieval north Atlantic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jgm69dJt4DcC&amp;pg=PA196|year=2007|publisher=Ohio University Press|isbn=978-0-8214-1723-2|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inboekelinge children were captured during raids, or handed over by their parents in return for land or goods.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2005p53"/&gt; In some cases they were sold to other burghers, in what became known as the trade in 'black ivory'.&lt;ref name="Giliomee2003p184"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hermann Giliomee|title=The Afrikaners: Biography of a People|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blgjhkGD0vgC&amp;pg=PA184|date=January 2003|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-714-9|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Transvaal, the inboekelings numbered about 4,000 in 1866, nearly one for every ten settlers.&lt;ref name=pwk&gt;{{cite web|last=Breckenridge|first=Keith|title=Power Without Knowledge: Three 19th Century Colonialisms In South Africa|url=http://researchspace.ukzn.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10413/8356/Breckenridge_Keith_2008.pdf?sequence=2|publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal|accessdate=26 January 2014|pages=22–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869 the synod of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] adopted a resolution condemning the practice, but rescinded it two years later on the grounds that the system no longer existed.&lt;ref name="Giliomee2003p184"/&gt; In the Transvaal, legislation required that males be released from indenture at the age of 25, while females were released at 21, but the law was not always observed in remote frontier districts.&lt;ref name="Feinstein2005p53"/&gt;

British attitudes towards the Inboekstelsel system were ambivalent, and the British administration of Transvaal between 1877 and 1881 did not affect it.&lt;ref name="Laband2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Laband|title=The Transvaal Rebellion: The First Boer War, 1880-1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ho6GHP5ASv4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2005|publisher=Pearson/Longman|isbn=978-0-582-77261-8|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[computer programming]], '''instrumentation''' refers to an ability to monitor or measure the level of a product's performance, to diagnose errors, and to write [[Tracing (software)|trace]] information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/rtrthelp/v8r0m0/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.rational.testrt.doc%2Ftopics%2Fcinstruovw.html Source Code Instrumentation Overview at IBM website]&lt;/ref&gt; Programmers implement instrumentation in the form of code [[Instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that monitor specific components in a system (for example, instructions may output logging information to appear on the screen). When an application contains instrumentation code, it can be managed by using a management tool. Instrumentation is necessary to review the performance of the application. Instrumentation approaches can be of two types: source instrumentation and binary instrumentation.

== Output ==
In programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate:

* Code [[Tracing (software)|tracing]] - receiving informative messages about the execution of an application at run time.
* [[Debugging]] and (structured) [[exception handling]] - tracking down and fixing programming errors in an application under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/commenting-testing-and-instrumenting-cod/229300224|title=Commenting, Testing, and Instrumenting Code|date=January 3, 2011|accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Profiling (computer programming)|Profiling]] - a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input.  This is useful for properties of a program that  cannot be [[static program analysis|analyzed statically]] with sufficient precision, such as [[alias analysis]].
* Performance counters - components that allow the tracking of the performance of the application.
* [[Computer data logging]] - components that allow the logging and tracking of major events in the execution of the application.

== Limitations ==

Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage.  If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data.  For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature.

Some types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time.  This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts.

{{nihongo|'''''Jewelpet'''''|ジュエルペット|Juerupetto|lead=yes}} is a [[Japan]]ese media franchise and toy line created in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/english/characters/detail/jewelpet/index.html|title=Jewelpet|publisher=Sanrio|accessdate=2009-07-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603002515/http://www.sanrio.co.jp/english/characters/detail/jewelpet/index.html#|archive-date=2009-06-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a joint venture between [[Sanrio]] and [[Sega Toys]], produced by the third character designer of [[Hello Kitty]], [[Yuko Yamaguchi]] and illustrated by the character designer of [[Cinnamoroll]], [[Miyuki Okumura]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/15/business/global/15kitty.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise was originally launched on January 15, 2008, focusing on animals named after jewels, birthstones and minerals, who can use magic using their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/detail/82 |title=（株）セガトイズ （株）サンリオが共同開発 新キャラクター 『ジュエルペット』誕生 〜かわいい動物をモチーフにした33種類の"魔法使いのペットたち"〜 |publisher=Sanrio |accessdate=2013-01-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220152828/http://sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/detail/82 |archivedate=2012-12-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its success, Sanrio and Sega Toys expanded the Jewelpet franchise overseas. The franchise is currently being licensed by Italian company [[Giochi Preziosi (company)|Giochi Preziosi]] for its European release.

The official slogan, albeit poorly translated, is ''"Eyes of Jewel that Shine, glittering with Luck and Good Fortune"''.

==Story==
{{See also|Jewelpet Universe}}
In an antique shop, there was a magical Jewel Box which sat there for centuries and shined in very bright colors. A girl accidentally encountered the box and opened it, causing a strange light to shine and the girl was sucked inside. She was now in a strange new world that shined like jewels. A sign read 'Jewel Land'. The girl was amazed, as everything shined in bright colors and was decorated in all kinds of jewels. At the center of the town, there was a strange tower, also decorated with magical jewels. She went to the tower and went inside.

The girl was greeted by a princess and was happy to see her as she offered her a jewel apple. The girl accepted the gift and the jewel in the girl's hand glowed, magically transforming into a cute animal. The princess said the creature was called a Jewelpet, and each of them live in Jewel Land. However, she also told her the crisis that Jewel Land was facing as the magic was starting to vanish. She told the girl that she must raise that Jewelpet she had into a full-fledged magician.

Each Jewelpet differs from their magical Jewel Eyes and depends on the human partner who awakens them and use magic whenever they need to. They all study magic along with their partners in a special school in Jewel Land for them to become master magicians. The pets and their partners must endure a lot of hardships and even trouble. With each care the human partners give to their Jewelpets, the pets love them back.

For a Jewelpet to become a magician, it must go through rigorous training and studying with their human partners to prevent the crisis in Jewel Land. If the Jewelpet becomes a magician, they'll be rewarded with a magical Jewel Cloak, as a symbol of mastery over its magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewelpet.info/story/index.html |title=The official Story of the Jewelpet Franchise (Japanese) |publisher=Sanrio |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925191555/http://jewelpet.info/story/index.html |archivedate=2012-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Jewelpet franchise debuted on January 15, 2008 as the first collaborative project between Sanrio and [[Sega Toys]].&lt;ref name="sanriosegatoys"&gt;{{Cite web|date=2008-01-15|url=http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/2008/0115.html|title=（株）セガトイズ （株）サンリオが共同開発 新キャラクター 『ジュエルペット』誕生 〜かわいい動物をモチーフにした33種類の“魔法使いのペットたち”〜|work=|author=|publisher=[[サンリオ]]|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610051051/http://www.sanrio.co.jp/corporate/release/2008/0115.html|archivedate=2009-06-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The franchise originally started off with 33 characters, each of them being best sellers during the summer of that year with each toy having internet connectivity capabilities using special passwords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=2010-03-19|url=http://journal.mycom.co.jp/news/2010/03/19/091/index.html|title=TVアニメ『ジュエルペット』、2010年4月より新シリーズが放送開始|newspaper=[[マイナビニュース|マイコミジャーナル]]|author=|publisher=[[マイナビ]]|accessdate=2013-06-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825170139/http://journal.mycom.co.jp/news/2010/03/19/091/index.html|archivedate=2010-08-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As ''Jewelpet'' entered its first year in 2009, the first season of the anime series of the same name premiered.

In February 2010, 600 items of merchandise were all made with over 25 licensed companies for its overseas and domestic expansion.&lt;ref name=NMJ100212&gt;「サンリオ『ジュエルペット』品目倍増、セガトイズと開発のキャラ、ライセンス拡大」『[[日経MJ]]』2010年2月12日、9頁。&lt;/ref&gt; On March 11, 2010, the 34th Jewelpet, Labra, officially debuted. The characters made their official debut as meet able characters in [[Sanrio Puroland]] with their first two shows: {{nihongo|'''Throbbing Jewelpet! Magical☆March'''|ジュエルペットのどきどき!マジカル☆マーチ|Juerupetto no dokidoki! Majikaru ☆ māchi}} and {{nihongo|'''Jewelpet and Cinnamon's Future Revolution!'''|ジュエルペットとシナモンのみらいレボリューション!|Juerupetto to shinamon nomi rai reboryūshon!}}. In addition, after the characters debuted in Puroland, visitors increased by 17% during the fourth quarter of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.plala.or.jp/kkato/gm_log/2011u/gm_sanrio.html] BLACK OUT ゲーム株1行情報{{出典無効|date=2015-01-25 |title=個人サイトは検証可能性の確保された出典と認められません。}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, three new Jewelpets officially debuted: Angela, Charotte and Jasper. Charotte and Jasper were both winners of a Jewelpet Design Contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Twinkle. In 2011, the Webgurumi website was closed down and was replaced by a new website: Jewel Land Online. In December of that same year, the character Sakuran made its official debut alongside 11 new characters in a new subline called Sweetspets. Sakuran herself is also a winner of the new character design contest that was held during the airing of Jewelpet Sunshine.

On March 31, 2012, two new male Jewelpets debuted: Coal and Granite. Jewel Land Online ended its service that date as well. In June 2012, the Puroland show {{nihongo|'''Jewelpet Kira☆Deco! Musical'''|ジュエルペット きら☆デコッ!ミュージカル|Juerupetto kira ☆ deko! Myūjikaru}} opened in conjunction with the ''Jewelpet Kira☆Deco!'' TV series. In August 2012, its first official theatrical film was released in Japanese cinemas with the introduction of the 13th Sweetspet, Gumimin. However, the film proved to be a failure at the box office.

In the January 2013 Issue of Pucchigumi magazine, the 40th Jewelpet, Rossa was officially revealed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pucchigumi]]'' Magazine, January 2013 issue, [[Shogakukan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the 41st Jewelpet, Luea, was also revealed and in the November 2014 issue of ''Youchien'', marked the debut of the 42nd character Larimar.&lt;ref&gt;''Youchien'' Magazine, November 2014 issue, [[Shogakukan]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the musicals based on Jewelpet ended its run.

As of July 2017, the characters were  removed in Sanrio Puroland's catalog of meet of greet characters due to rising popularity of the ''[[Rilu Rilu Fairilu]]'' Anime series. Japanese netizens expressed their concerns over the issue as the indoor park's representatives stated that the popularity of the new series has caused for the characters to be removed from the lineup.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.j-cast.com/2017/07/04302413.html?p=all&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

===Toys===
Sega Toys collaborated with Sanrio to release a line of plush toys on January 15, 2008. Each plush Jewelpet contains a password to access the Web-Gurumi website, a special site in which the customer "adopts" this pet in the virtual world. If the user doesn't have the password, the user may not get access to the website. Accounts expire within one year, unless another Jewelpet toy is bought, and that animal is added to the user account. With the expansion of the series, toy replicas of the Jewel Stick, Jewel Charms, Jewel Pocketbook and Jewel Pods from the anime series were made as well.

===Merchandise===
As with other Sanrio character franchises such as [[Hello Kitty]], [[List of Sanrio characters#My Melody|My Melody]], [[Sugarbunnies]] and [[Cinnamoroll]], Jewelpet merchandise mostly consists of stationery, school supplies, bags, raincoats, umbrellas, bento boxes and even toy replicas of the Jewel Stick and Jewel Pocketbook from the anime series. Merchandise was released by Sanrio, Sega and [[Bandai]], among other companies. The popularity of the series then expanded overseas in [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]] and [[Europe]].

A [[Trading Card Game]] spinoff was also released by [[Bushiroad]], the creators of the [[Weiß Schwarz]], ''Alice X Cross'' and [[Cardfight!! Vanguard]] Trading Card Games. Both the starter set and booster packs were released on July 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bushiroad.com/products/jp0001.html|title=Bushiroad's Official Jewelpet TCG Site|publisher=[[Bushiroad]]|accessdate=2012-10-03|language=ja|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903200325/http://bushiroad.com/products/jp0001.html#|archive-date=2011-09-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later discontinued in 2010. Also several Jewelpet characters were also released as stickers for the instant messaging software [[LINE (application)|LINE]].

'''Julien Labrousse''' born October 9, 1977 is a French entrepreneur and architect, particular owner and manager of two mythical Parisian theaters [[Élysée Montmartre|Elysée Montmartre]] and [[Le Trianon (theatre)|Le Trianon]]. He specializes in the creation of cultural venues. In 2005 he bought and heavily reformed [[Hôtel du Nord]], building listed as an historical monument, a place which is known to have inspired the 1938 [[Marcel Carné]]'s feature film of 1938. Then in 2009 he bought with Abel Nahmias, the Theatre Le Trianon. It carries a heavy restoration of the building. Then it was the turn of the Elysee Montmartre he bought in 2014, destroyed after a major fire. He realizes the complete reconstruction of the Theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/regions/infos-paris-10e-arrondissement/20120315.REG0607/restaurationla-seconde-vie-de-l-hotel-du-nord.html|title=RESTAURATION La seconde vie de l'Hôtel du nord|publisher=nouvelobs.com |accessdate = 15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://next.liberation.fr/culture/2006/09/30/marais-de-nouvelles-galeries_52865|title=MARAIS DE NOUVELLES GALERIES|publisher=liberation.fr|accessdate = 30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technikart.com/culture-medias-politique-les-100-qui-tirent-les-ficelles/|title=CULTURE, MEDIAS, POLITIQUE… LES 100 QUI TIRENT LES FICELLES|publisher=technikart.com|accessdate= 30 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sortir.telerama.fr/paris/lieux/theatres/le-trianon,11383.php|title=Le lieu a retrouvé le faste d'antan : le théâtre à l'italienne, la salle de bal, le resto, et bientôt le jardin d'hiver, sont rénovés à l'identique.|publisher=telerama.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/sortir-paris/2011/03/01/03013-20110301ARTFIG00560-au-trianon-le-spectacle-en-majeste.php|title=Au Trianon, le spectacle en majesté|publisher=lefigaro.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telerama.fr/sortir/en-images-on-a-visite-la-nouvelle-salle-de-l-elysee-montmartre,144986.php|title=En images : on a visité la nouvelle salle de l’Elysée-Montmartre|publisher=telerama.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.fr/paris/le-blog/lelysee-montmartre-va-renaitre-de-ses-cendres-entretien-avec-son-nouveau-patron-101315|title=L'Elysée Montmartre va renaître de ses cendres : entretien avec son nouveau patron|publisher=timeout.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/2014/10/29/03004-20141029ARTFIG00172-l-elysee-montmartre-rouvrira-ses-portes-en-2016.php|title=L'Élysée Montmartre rouvrira ses portes en 2016|publisher=lefigaro.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal Life'''

He was born and raised in Paris, France, he began his professional career very young, in different small business, he also directed several short film and music video. Quickly, his professional interests have centered on architecture, this topics has always been an integral part of his life, his father and his mother being architectural book publisher.

'''Architectural approach'''

Julien Labrousse illustrates the implementation of a modern craft; a shape which is sensitized to innovation. His wish is to be able to control his activities and to live in an environment that he likes, perhaps in an illusory, free and independent way. In fact, he consciously or unconsciously manages his development according to his potential resources, while room operators and operators for cultural equipment are evolving more and more in an institutional and normative environment.

'''Philosophy '''

His philosophy on human resource management avoids any coercive approach, and the approach favours decentralisation, even if the term is a little bit ridiculous, he responds to this idea by saying that; centralization in business management focuses on order, while decentralization focuses on freedom. Decisions are taken collectively and he values every point of view.

'''Career'''

Julien Labrousse had traveled and did several jobs. As a result, he has a large opening to the world. He is also a self-made man in the sense that he has developed a personality on his own. He has acquired various professional experiences at all levels.
Endowed with entrepreneurial skills, focusing on his idiosyncratic skills, he strives to do an original design, what seduces “alternative consumers” or “alternative producers” in other words; he builds ‘his’ market, without trying to compete directly with existing activities. With this in mind, he combines the mastery of a craft and the knowhow.

'''Reconstruction of Elysée Montmartre, 2014'''

This is the second time that the French architect and entrepreneur, Julien Labrousse is playing a vital role in the recovery and reconstruction of a theater in Paris, he has been able to bring a soul at his realisation place, something indescribable but that sets apart the Trianon and the Elysée Montmartre from other Parisian halls. Elysée Montmartre is one of the most famous concert venue in Paris where played many famous artist:, [[David Bowie]], [[Daft Punk]], [[Björk]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers|red hot chili peppers]], [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Public Enemy discography|Public Enemy]], [[Cyndi Lauper|Cindy Lauper]].. Elysée Montamartre is a French major cultural venue since 1807. This is where the [[French Cancan]] have been created.The soul Aristote defines as '' cause of the vital movement among the living''. This seems to be the focal point of Julien Labrousse, he defends a musical architecture, for this reason, he can’t find a better subject than concert halls. It combines a little outdated and stylish pace, materials selected with precision. Project after project, we begin to discern a style in these various achievements. The Elysée Montmartre work was more complicated than the previous achievements, this project carried out with the collaboration of Jérôme Friant, necessitated the disbursement of 12,000 m3 of land, the realization of 180 piles and 250 tons of steel, a gigantic site in Paris which lasted for two and a half years.

In [[Mainstream economics|mainstream economic theories]], the '''labour supply''' is the total hours (adjusted for intensity of effort) that workers wish to work at a given real wage rate. It is frequently represented graphically by a labour supply curve, which shows hypothetical wage rates plotted vertically and the amount of labour that an individual or group of individuals is willing to supply at that wage rate plotted horizontally.

[[File:Labour supply.svg|thumb|300px|This [[backward bending supply curve of labour]] shows how the change in [[real wage]] rates affects the number of hours worked by employees.]]
{{See also|Labour economics#Neoclassical microeconomic model - Supply|label 1=Neoclassical microeconomic model of labour supply}}
Labour supply curves derive from the 'labour-leisure' trade-off. More hours worked earn higher incomes, but necessitate a cut in the amount of leisure that workers enjoy. Consequently, there are two effects on the amount of labour desired to be supplied due to a change in the real wage rate. As, for example, the real wage rate rises, the [[opportunity cost]] of leisure increases. This tends to make workers supply more labour (the "substitution effect"). However, also as the real wage rate rises, workers earn a higher income for a given number of hours. If leisure is a [[normal good]]—the demand for it increases as income increases—this increase in income tends to make workers supply less labour so they can "spend" the higher income on leisure (the "income effect"). If the substitution effect is stronger than the income effect then the labour supply slopes upward. If, beyond a certain wage rate, the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect, then the labour supply curve [[backward bending supply curve of labour|bends backward]]. Individual labor supply curves can be aggregated to derive the total labour supply of an economy.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg and Smith, "Modern Labor Economics", HarperCollins, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxist view ==

From a [[Marxist]] perspective, a labour supply is a core requirement in a [[capitalist society]]. To avoid [[labour shortage]] and ensure a labour supply, a large portion of the population must not possess sources of self-provisioning, which would let them be independent—and they must instead, to survive, be compelled to sell their labour for a [[subsistence|subsistence wage]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurice Dobb]] (1947) ''[[Studies in the Development of Capitalism]]''  New York: International Publishers Co. Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Harvey (social theorist)|David Harvey]] (1989) ''[[The Condition of Postmodernity]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In the pre-industrial economies wage labour was generally undertaken only by those with little or no land of their own.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowden]] (1967) chapter ''Agricultural prices, farm profits, and rents'', section "A. The long-term movement of agricultural prices" - "The long-term trend of prices".

'''Lean dynamics''' is a business management practice that emphasizes the same primary outcome as '''lean manufacturing''' or '''lean production''' of eliminating wasteful expenditure of resources.  However, it is distinguished by its different focus of creating a structure for accommodating the dynamic business conditions that cause these wastes to accumulate in the first place.

Like [[lean manufacturing]], lean dynamics is a variation on the theme of creating efficiencies and greater value by optimizing flow rather than by maximizing economies of scale.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, James P. and Jones, Daniel (1997), ''Lean Thinking: Banish Waste and Create Wealth in Your Company'', Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|0-7432-4927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liker, Jeffrey (2003), ''The Toyota Way'', McGraw Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-139231-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, it represents an important chapter in the broader discussion of Taylorism,&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Frederick Winslow (1911), ''The Principles of Scientific Management'', Norton, {{ISBN|0-393-00398-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fordisim,&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Henry (1927), ''Today and Tomorrow'', Productivity Press, {{ISBN|0-915299-36-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Sloan's standard volume methodology,&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, Alfred P.(1965), ''My Years With General Motors'', Macfadden&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Drucker's philosophy on the "theory of the business"&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Peter (1995), Managing for a Time of Great Change, Truman Talley Books/Dutton, {{ISBN|0-525-94053-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Genichi Taguchi's analysis of loss.  Its general philosophy has grown in popularity over recent years, in large part because of the increasingly challenging circumstances faced by the global business world (particularly evident during the 2008–2009 worldwide economic downturn.)&lt;ref&gt;[''Going Lean as a Solution to Navigating Uncertainty and Crisis'', Ivey Business Journal, March, 2009]{{cite web|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/article.asp?intArticle_ID%3D823 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221071958/http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/article.asp?intArticle_id=823 |archivedate=2009-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This need to create greater efficiencies while competing in an environment that demands constant change and innovation seems to be responsible for the emergence of lean dynamics as a recognized business improvement approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sixsig.info/six-sigma/1051.html ''Going Lean Teaches You How to Live with Change''], Six Sigma&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

The term "lean" was first coined by a researcher at MIT and later popularized by the best-selling book, ''The Machine that Changed the World'' (1990).&lt;ref&gt;Womack, James P.,Jones, Daniel T., and Roos, Daniel (1991), ''The Machine That Changed The World: The Story of Lean Production'', Harper Perennial, {{ISBN|978-0-06-097417-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those implementing lean principles generally focus on applying lean tools which have been described in a number of references over the past two decades&lt;ref&gt;Suzaki, Kiyoshi (1987), The New Manufacturing Challenge: Techniques for Continuous Improvement, Free Press, {{ISBN|0-02-932040-2}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shingo, Shigeo, A Study of the Toyota Production System: From an Industrial Engineering Viewpoint (1989), Productivity Press, {{ISBN|0-915299-17-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard (1982), Japanese Manufacturing Techniques, Free Press, {{ISBN|0-02-929100-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of seeking out and directly targeting "[[Muda (Japanese term)|waste]]" (its seven forms described by Taiichi Ohno in Toyota Production System &lt;ref&gt;Taiichi Ohno (1988), ''Toyota Production System'', Productivity Press, {{ISBN|0-915299-14-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; are well known.) This emphasis can result in greater efficiencies that do not necessarily respond well when business conditions shift.

Lean dynamics takes a different approach.  Introduced by the book, ''Going Lean'',&lt;ref&gt;Ruffa, Stephen A. (2008), ''Going Lean: How the Best Companies Apply Lean Manufacturing Principles to Shatter Uncertainty, Drive Innovation, and Maximize Profits'', AMACOM, {{ISBN|0-8144-1057-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not directly target the desired ''outcome'' of waste elimination; instead, it focuses on identifying and addressing sources of "lag", or imbedded disconnects in flowing value through operations, decision-making, information, and innovation that lead to [[workaround]]s and amplify disruption when business conditions change.  It promotes a different way of structuring the business that creates an inherent "dynamic stability" or greater responsiveness for accommodating shifting business conditions.  Companies that are structured in this way show dramatically greater customer value{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} as measured by their quality, innovation, and customer satisfaction; they also sustain greater corporate value as measured by profitability, market capitalization, and growth.

Lean dynamics uses the value curve as a data-driven way of directly comparing companies to distinguish lean firms from other industries.

Implementation of lean dynamics focuses on driving down the impact that variation&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards, (1982), ''Out of the Crisis'', MIT, {{ISBN|0-911379-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; has on loss (based on the loss function from the [[Taguchi methods]] often described by the famous business statistician [[W. Edwards Deming]]&lt;ref&gt;Deming, W. Edwards, (1993), ''The New Economics: For Industry, Government, Education'', MIT, {{ISBN|0-911379-05-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a concept describing the dramatic reduction of value-creating capabilities that traditional management systems display when subjected to sudden shifts in product demand, energy prices, or other conditions that affect operational stability or predictability.

Lean dynamics is particularly versatile in that it can be applied to a wide range of manufacturing and service industries.  Its methods have been studied for Aerospace and Defense (particularly as applied to procuring hard to get spare parts&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IBO/is_1_27/ai_106652013/''Part Grouping: Angioplasty for the Supply Chain]'', (Spring 2003), Air Force Journal of Logistics&lt;/ref&gt;), and medical, and distinguishes the few that stand out during crisis such as airlines, and retail.

== Background ==

Lean dynamics has its roots in a global study of lean manufacturing in the aerospace industry aimed at understanding how to break its cycle of cost escalation that was making new products unaffordable.  These results were described in the [[Shingo Prize]] winning book, ''Breaking the Cost Barrier''.&lt;ref&gt;Ruffa, Stephen A., and Perozziello, Michael (2000), ''Breaking the Cost Barrier: A Proven Approach to Managing and Implementing Lean Manufacturing'', Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-38136-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This study showed that directly targeting “waste” reduction as the focal point for lean programs does not lead to significant cost savings.  Instead, it provided strong evidence that emphasis should be placed on applying lean principles to mitigate the amplification of variation that causes [[workarounds]].  Addressing this variation was critical to overcoming the disruption that often causes waste to accumulate in the first place. Other sources cited this, identifying occurrences across other industries.&lt;ref&gt;Schonberger, Richard J. (2001), ''Let's Fix It!'', Free Press, {{ISBN|0-7432-1551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research of the aerospace industry showed that firms had accepted these findings, describing this approach of Variation Management as "...one of the most prominent approaches to transforming and improving military enterprise performance."&lt;ref&gt;Mathaisel, Dennis F. X., (2007), ''Sustaining the Military Enterprise: An Architecture for a Lean Transformation'', Auerbach&lt;/ref&gt;

This phenomenon was validated by correlating the disruption caused by variation in flow (measured as cycle time variation) with "loss" as described by the Taguchi Loss Function (see [[Taguchi Methods]]).  Sudden changes in business conditions, such as spikes or decreases in production demand, cause increases in variation from forecasted conditions, causing disruption, and causing waste to accumulate.  A lean dynamics approach restructures the way operations, organizations, information, and innovation are structured to overcome this.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q7OGDd61hkC Ruffa, Stephen A. (2008), Going Lean: How the Best Companies Apply Lean Manufacturing Principles to Shatter Uncertainty, Drive Innovation, and Maximize Profits, AMACOM] {{ISBN|0-8144-1057-X}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

One method for companies to deal internally with externally driven variation (such as sudden spikes in demand), a core tenet of lean dynamics, was explored by the Defense Department under the Supplier Utilization through Responsive Grouped Enterprises (SURGE) Program.  The SURGE program was partially sponsored by the Joint Strike Fighter Program (JSF)([[F-35 Lightning II]]) This program aimed to reduce factory disruption due to demand variation by grouping parts together that shared similar manufacturing processes. It succeeded in reducing lead time on a number of critical aerospace items by as much as 60%.  The SURGE program gained notoriety when it was mentioned on the popular TV Show [[JAG (TV series)|JAG]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vids2u.net/2009/04/23/jag-season-6-episode-9-family-secrets/ JAG Episode 9 (Season 6), "Family Secrets"(6:33), first aired December 12, 2000]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lutz Aengevelt along with his brother Wulff make up the third generation of the [[family business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aengevelt.com/index.php?view=presse_detail&amp;noseo=1&amp;year=2003&amp;mnp=37&amp;pid=56&amp;presse_search=|title=Immobilienmakler für Gewerbe, Investoren &amp; Privatkunden - AENGEVELT|website=www.aengevelt.com|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background Information==
Dr. Lutz W. Aengevelt, married and father of two children, was born on 4 June 1943 in [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]]. In 1966, after he has finished his PhD in [[Economic]] [[Sciences]] he entered the real estate company founded by his grandfather Leo Aengevelt in [[Düsseldorf]] in the year 1910.&lt;ref name="prestelandpartner.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.prestelandpartner.com/eventspeakers.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429183929/http://www.prestelandpartner.com/eventspeakers.html# |archive-date=2012-04-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1969 he has been managing partner of Aengevelt Immobilien GmbH &amp; Co.&amp;nbsp;kg. He is responsible for the departments of "[[Commercial letting]]", "[[Investment]]", "Placement of undeveloped land", "[[Project development]] / preparation and management", "[[Land recycling]]", "[[Real estate]] research" and "International real estate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aengevelt.com/unternehmen2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120031526/http://www.aengevelt.com/unternehmen2.html |archivedate=2012-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His theme, in addition to independence from foreign control, his social commitment and the training of qualified young talents: "A property is always part of a [[value chain]], we fully activate their potential." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aengevelt.com/presse/detail/2003/dr.-lutz-aengevelt-wird-60--ndash--ein-zwischen-r--sume.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130116085445/http://www.aengevelt.com/presse/detail/2003/dr.-lutz-aengevelt-wird-60--ndash--ein-zwischen-r--sume.html |archivedate=2013-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with his brother Wulff, Dr. Lutz Aengevelt drives since the late 80's consistently the national and international expansion of the company's progress. He is the initiator and co-founder of the German broker association "DIP - German Real Estate Partners"5, founded in 1988, and the network "IPP - International Property Partners",&lt;ref name="ipp-global.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipp-global.com/markets.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421021102/http://www.ipp-global.com/markets.html |archivedate=2012-04-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which offers customers real estate services throughout [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dip-immobilien.de/1-1-Home.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902002331/http://www.dip-immobilien.de/1-1-Home.html |archivedate=2012-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Dr. Lutz Aengevelt became involved in diverse fields of [[real estate]] research and [[education]]. This counts as his assistance in research projects of the "Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft", the "German Institute for Urbanisitik" DIFU7, various ministries of the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], the federal states North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland Palatinate and [[Berlin]] on such topics as "Construction Law", "[[Industrial development]]", "[[Pollution]] Management" and "[[Real Estate]] [[Marketing]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cimmit.de/index.asp?page=2011referenten&amp;lang=deutsch&amp;sid=&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also lectures and specialist presentations at diverse universities e.g. at the University of [[Applied Sciences]] and Arts HAWK8, and specialized conferences like the real estate conference CIMMIT 20119, [[Frankfurt]], or the Family Office Forum 201210, [[Wiesbaden]].

Beyond that, Dr. Lutz Aengevelt performs numerous volunteer activities, such as the advisory board of [[Deutsche Bank]] AG in [[Düsseldorf]],&lt;ref&gt;https://geschaeftsbericht.deutsche-bank.de/2003/gb/serviceseiten/downloads/files/loacm_25-03-04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; of the Stadtsparkasse [[Düsseldorf]]  &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sskduesseldorf.de/pdf/downloads/Ventura_2011-1.pdf?IFLBSERVERID=IF@@031@@IF&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Munich Trade Fair "EXPO REAL".

He also was a longtime member of the General Assembly of the [[Düsseldorf]] Chamber of Commerce. In Düsseldorf,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rm.hawk-hhg.de/holzminden/157552_175083.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130211031810/http://rm.hawk-hhg.de/holzminden/157552_175083.php |archivedate=2013-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also involved as the first chairman of the "support association monument Rochuskirche e.V.",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.der-immobilienbrief.de/uploads/tx_thpdfarchive/73.pdf,&lt;/ref&gt; which aims the redevelopment and embodiment of the Rochus Church was and which was dissolved after 12 years of successful fulfillment of this task in 2002.&lt;ref name="ipp-global.com"/&gt;

Similarly varied as his professional and community involvement is also the private sector: The family is center of life. In addition, Dr. Lutz Aengevelt is an enthusiastic sportsman (including [[water sports]], [[association football|football]], [[hockey]], [[skiing]]), and Theaterfan and - how could it be otherwise - even in his limited free time interested in [[urban planning]].&lt;ref name="prestelandpartner.com"/&gt;

== Aengevelt Immobilien ==
According to the [[Real Estate]] Finance Intelligence Report Europe (REFIRE) in 2010 Aengevelt was ranked first place ahead of [[Engel &amp; Völkers]] and BW [[Baden]]-Württembergische [[Bank]] and were listed for having the highest level of client support and [[wikt:consultation|consultation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ir.refire-online.com/upload/xyz/REFIRE-Report80.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 at the International Commercial Property Exposition (EXPO REAL) Immo [[News]] quoted Dr. Lutz Aengevelt stated the headline; "More decision makers, more front line visitors." in reference to the improved market and [[real estate]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immo-news.net/EXPO-REAL-2009-Fewer-Participants-More-Intensive-Discussions-Higher-Quality_a6713.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301115949/http://www.immo-news.net/EXPO-REAL-2009-Fewer-Participants-More-Intensive-Discussions-Higher-Quality_a6713.html |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung==
In 2009 Lutz Aengevelt was interviewed by [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] and was posed the following questions;

" Is the competition among [[brokers]] during this difficult time actually just down to the [[price]]?" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/1.827867|title=Lutz und Wulff Aengevelt: "Wir reden den Markt nicht schön"|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|last=GmbH|date=7 August 2009|website=FAZ.NET|accessdate=24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Of course, competition is hard boned, but that does not take place on the commission rates, but on the evidence of achievement. One should also not overlook the fact that part of the competition is no longer there. Some have withdrawn from the sample transaction business, it is now known as the [[Asset Management]] and others are [[insolvent]]." - then going on to reiterate the fact that Aengevelt Immobilien has zero debt which is a pivotal aspect of their success and solidified infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/|title=SPIEGEL ONLINE - Aktuelle Nachrichten|first=Jakob|last=Augstein|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2017|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22875">'''Marriage privatization''' is the concept that the [[state (polity)|state]] should have no authority to define the terms of [[personal relationship]]s such as [[marriage]]. Proponents of marriage privatization, including certain [[minarchism|minarchists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[libertarianism|libertarians]], and opponents of government interventionism, claim that such relationships are best defined by private individuals and not the state. Arguments for the privatization of marriage have been offered by a number of scholars and writers. Proponents of marriage privatization often argue that privatizing marriage is a solution to the social controversy over [[same-sex marriage]]. Arguments for and against the privatization of marriage span both [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political camps.

==Advocacy==

===Libertarian advocacy===
In 1997, [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[David Boaz]] wrote an article for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' titled “Privatize Marriage: A Simple Solution to the Gay-Marriage Debate." In the article, Boaz suggests privatizing marriage in a way that models the nature of standard business contracts. Boaz's idea is to allow two (possibly more) individuals to set the terms of their own private marital contract in a way that is best for the individuals involved. "When children or large sums of money are involved, an enforceable contract spelling out the parties' respective rights and obligations is probably advisable. But the existence and details of such an agreement should be up to the parties."&lt;ref&gt;Boaz (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Boaz the government could be called upon to enforce the contract but may have no other role in developing the contract and setting the terms.

In 2002, [[Anarchism|anarchist]] [[Wendy McElroy]] echoed Boaz's business contract model in an essay for ''Ifeminists'' titled "It's Time to Privatize Marriage."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marriage should be privatized. Let people make their own marriage contracts according to their conscience, religion and common sense. Those contracts could be registered with the state, recognized as legal and arbitrated by the courts, but the terms would be determined by those involved.&lt;ref&gt;McElroy (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McElroy has also said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why is marriage declining? One reason is that it has become a three-way contract between two people and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0702/0702marriage.htm |title=It's time to privatize marriage |publisher=Enterstageright.com |date=2002-07-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2003, political columnist Ryan McMaken, writing on [[LewRockwell.com]], raised the issue of marriage privatization arguing that the rise of state-sanctioned marriage coincides historically with the expansion of government. In his article titled "Married to the State," McMaken wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The question we are then left with today is one of whether the churches and individuals should be looking to privatize marriage yet again and to begin making a distinction between secular contracts between private citizens and religious unions that should be kept beyond the power of the State. Such a move, of course, would bring with it new assumptions about the role of the State in divorce, children, and a variety of other aspects of family life. The State will not give up control over these things easily, for the assertion that the importance of marriage makes it a legitimate interest of the State is only true from the point of view of the State itself, for as the foundation of society, marriage and family cannot be entrusted to governments just to be blown about by the winds of democratic opinion, for the same government that has the power to protect can just as easily destroy.&lt;ref&gt;McMaken (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a similar libertarian vein, the radio talk-show host [[Larry Elder]] endorsed the privatization of marriage. In "The State Should Get Out of the Marriage Business", a 2004 article published in on the website Capitalism Magazine, Elder wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How about government simply getting out of the marriage-license-granting business? (Ditto for government licenses necessary to cut hair, drive a taxi, open a business or enter a profession.) Leave marriage to non-governmental institutions, like churches, synagogues, mosques, and other houses of worship or private institutions. Adultery, although legal, remains a sin subject to societal condemnation. It's tough to legislate away condemnation or legislate in approval. Those who view same-sex marriage as sinful will continue to do so, no matter what the government, the courts or their neighbors say.&lt;ref&gt;Elder (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, law professor Colin P.A. Jones wrote an article appearing in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' titled "Marriage Proposal: Why Not Privatize?" following the business model for privatization Jones writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Subject to certain statutory constraints, businesspeople have long been free to form whatever sort of partnership they felt appropriate to their needs. Why not make the same possible for marriage, which is a partnership based on one of the oldest types of contractual relationships? &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marriage proposal: Why not privatize? / Partnerships could be tailored to fit|url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Marriage-proposal-Why-not-privatize-2523603.php|website=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2009, author and journalist [[Naomi Wolf]] wrote about getting the state out of marriage in ''[[The Times]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let's also get the state out of the marriage union. In spite of the dress and the flowers, marriage is a business contract. Women, generally, don't understand this, until it hits them over the head upon divorce. Let's take a lead from our gay and lesbian friends, who, without state marriage, often create domestic partnerships with financial autonomy and unity spelt out. A heterosexual parallel: celebrate marriage with a religious or emotional ceremony—leave the state out of it—and create a business- or domestic-partner contract aligning the couple legally.&lt;ref&gt;Times (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor [[Gary Becker]], a winner of the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]], has said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;With marriage contracts that set out the couple's commitments, there is little reason why judges should retain their current involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;"Why Every Married Couple Should Sign a Contract". Gary S. Becker. ''Business Week''. New York: December 29, 1997. Iss. 3559; p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As of 2015, the only known members of [[US Congress]] to support privatization of state marriage are Sen. [[Rand Paul]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://time.com/3939374/rand-paul-gay-marriage-supreme-court/?xid=fbshare | work=Time | title=Rand Paul: Privatize Marriage | date=June 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rep. [[Justin Amash]] (R–Michigan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/29/justin-amash-doma-repeal_n_2981622.html|title=Justin Amash Backs DOMA Repeal On Twitter|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rep. [[Gary Palmer (politician)|Gary Palmer]] (R–Alabama).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/10/abortion_marijuana_and_same-se.html|title=Abortion, marijuana, and same-sex marriage: District 6 candidates state their positions|work=AL.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious advocacy===
[[Pepperdine University]] law professor [[Douglas Kmiec]] told the ''[[Catholic News Agency]]'' that churches that do not accept same-sex marriage have a genuine concern that they be subject to penalties such as losing public benefits or receiving lawsuits. He argued that the state should just allot people "civil licenses", with the terminology "marriage" left "as a religious concept" for groups to debate outside the scope of government.&lt;ref name=Kmiec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/kmiec_proposes_end_of_legally_recognized_marriage/ |title=Kmiec proposes end of legally recognized marriage |publisher=Catholic News Agency |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal advocacy===
Though often introduced from [[conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|commentators]], marriage privatization has received attention from advocates on the left. In 2003 left-leaning political [[columnist]] and [[journalist]] [[Michael Kinsley]] wrote a second essay to appear in ''Slate'' on the topic. Kinsley's essay is titled "Abolish Marriage: Let's Really Get the Government out of Our Bedrooms." Kinsley follows the model set by his libertarian counterparts Boaz and McElroy; like Elder's he emphasizes marriage privatization's potential to end the controversy over same-sex marriage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If marriage were an entirely private affair, all the disputes over gay marriage would become irrelevant. Gay marriage would not have the official sanction of government, but neither would straight marriage. There would be official equality between the two, which is the essence of what gays want and are entitled to. And if the other side is sincere in saying that its concern is not what people do in private, but government endorsement of a gay "lifestyle" or "agenda," that problem goes away, too.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsley (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Marriage privatization received attention from the legal scholar [[Alan Dershowitz]] in 2003 when Dershowitz wrote a ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' editorial titled "To Fix Gay Dilemma, Government Should Quit the Marriage Business." More so than commentators from the right, Dershowitz frames his view on the topic in terms of [[church-state separation]]; unlike libertarian leaning discussions Dershowitz maintains that the state does have an interest in the [[secular]] rights of marriage. Dershowitz proposes that civil-unions as a [[secular]] replacement for state sanctioned marriage, be extended to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Under Dershowitz's conception of privatization, couples have a choice as to whether or not they wish to be married by a [[clergy]] willing to perform a [[Wedding|marriage ceremony]] or to exclusively partake of secular/state-sanctioned civil unions. Dershowitz writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on religious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by placing a sacred institution entirely in the hands of the church while placing a secular institution under state control.&lt;ref&gt;Dershowitz (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Public policy advocacy and academia===
In 2007 the [[Center for Inquiry]], a secular [[think tank]], released a position paper authored by analyst Ruth Mitchell titled "Same-Sex Marriage and Marriage". The paper argues from the separation of church and state that as long as marriage is available to heterosexual couples it ought to be equally available to [[LGBT]] couples. Nevertheless, the position paper claims that state endorsement of civil unions for both types of couples is the most appropriate policy in light of separation of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument for marriage privatization has also been formulated in [[academic]] scholarship. In 2008 an argument for marriage privatization appeared in the [[public policy]] journal ''Public Affairs Quarterly''. In that issue philosopher Lawrence Torcello offers a detailed model of marriage privatization based on the later political writings of the 20th century [[political philosopher]] [[John Rawls]]. The article is titled "Is The State Endorsement of Any Marriage Justifiable? Same-Sex Marriage, Civil Unions, and The Marriage Privatization Model."

In the 1993 book ''[[Political Liberalism]]'', Rawls argues that arguments in a [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[society]] must be hashed out in terms that all members of that society can understand if not endorse. This means that in making public claims one must refrain from religious or otherwise controversial [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] claims that cannot, in principle, be equally endorsed by reasonable persons. In doing this, one is relying on what Rawls refers to as [[public reason]].

In his article, Torcello claims that any state endorsement of marriage represents an inappropriate [[public]] [[Testimonial|endorsement]] of a comprehensive religious or otherwise metaphysical [[doctrine]], which underlies any particular definition of marriage. Accordingly, taking public reason seriously leads to the idea that [[legalization]] of same-sex marriage may be just as neutrally unbalanced as its ban.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"&gt;Torcello 2008 p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; In place of the public institute of marriage, Torcello, like Dershowitz, argues that civil unions providing the full extent of marital benefits under law ought to be instituted for both heterosexual and homosexual couples.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt; According to the argument, such civil unions ought to replace the current legal institute of marriage. Once privatized, marriage is open for individuals to define and embrace or ignore as they see fit, within the scope of their [[Privacy|private]] religious or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[belief system]]s:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No religious model that rejects same-sex marriage would be required to perform same-sex marriages under this privatized model. Under this model a couple, either heterosexual or homosexual, would obtain a civil union in order to have public and legal recognition of their partnership; they would have a private marriage ceremony if they so chose in order to honor their private religious or philosophical concept of marriage.&lt;ref name="Torcello 2008 p.51"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a July 2008 article appearing in ''[[The Monist]]'' titled "Privatizing Marriage" [[Harvard]] Law Professor [[Cass Sunstein]] and [[University of Chicago]] economist [[Richard H. Thaler]] offer arguments for the privatization of marriage. Thaler and Sunstein also take up the topic in their co-authored 2008 book ''Nudge: Improving Decisions about Wealth, Health, and Happiness.'' Sunstein and Thaler argue for marriage privatization among other positions under the heading of what they call "Libertarian Paternalism".

==Arguments opposing the privatization of marriage==
Opposition to marriage privatization, like its endorsement, is equally likely to be found arising from conservative or liberal sources and a wide variety of objections are made.

Conservative [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[baptist]] [[R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]] has stated that he opposes the privatizaton of marriage because "markets do not always encourage or support moral behavior" and he believes the proposal would "[destroy] marriage as a public institution."&lt;ref&gt;Mohler (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Princeton University|Princeton]] professor [[Robert P. George]] has argued that marriage has an important cultural role in helping children develop into "basically honest, decent law-abiding people of goodwill—citizens—who can take their rightful place in society". Thus, he concludes, "Family is built on marriage, and government—the state—has a profound interest in the integrity and well-being of marriage, and to write it off as if it were purely a religiously significant action and not an institution and action that has a profound public significance, would be a terrible mistake".&lt;ref name=Kmiec/&gt;  This position is seconded by Jennifer Morse of the Witherspoon Institute, who argues that if literally anyone can define marriage as whatever they want, the state forfeits the ability to sufficiently secure the best interests of children.  She goes further, arguing that the logic of marriage privatization "at the expense of children, is a concept developed by adults that will benefit only adults."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2012/04/5073 |title=Privatizing marriage is unjust to children |last1=Morse |first1=Jennifer |last2= |first2= |date=4 April 2012 |website= |publisher=The Witherspoon Institute |access-date=11 August 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stanley Kurtz]] of ''[[National Review]]'' has written that privatization would be a "disaster". He argued that government "still has to decide what sort of private unions merit benefits... under this privatization scheme", and then "we also get the same quarrels over social recognition that we got before privatization." He commented that the government will have to deal with [[polygamy|polygamous]], [[polyamory|polyamorous]], and [[incest]]uous relationships attempting to obtain contracts under the new scheme as well as attempts by heterosexual acquaintances to make "marriages of convenience" to obtain things such as spousal medical insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/117239/privatizing-marriage-stanley-kurtz |title=Privatizing Marriage |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2006-01-22 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[National Review]]'' colleague [[Maggie Gallagher]] has also called privatization as a "fantasy" since "[t]here is scarcely a dollar that state and federal government spends on social programs that is not driven in large part by family fragmentation: crime, poverty, drug abuse, teen pregnancy, school failure, mental and physical health problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806085511/http://article.nationalreview.com/269352/the-stakes/maggie-gallagher |archivedate=2010-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues involved with privatizing marriage==
In general, a legal contract signed between two or more people will often include penalties for the severing of the contract by a party or parties. However, this generally does not apply to marriages in the US, which usually fall under the legal standard of [[no-fault divorce]]. It remains an open issue as to whether or not these quasi-marriage partnership contracts will be enforced with penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hotair.com/archives/2010/08/07/why-is-the-state-involved-in-marriage-at-all/ |title=Why is the state involved in marriage at all? |publisher=Hotair.com |date=2010-08-07 |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael “Mike” Amoia''' (born February 5, 1974) is an American [[Television producer|producer]], [[entrepreneur]] and investor. He is the co-founder of Switchblade Entertainment Group, Vidiots, and Mibe Music.

==Career==

Amoia started out as a music producer at the young age of 22 and got his first freelance assistant editing job working nights at VH1 and Sony Studios loading tapes and prepping footage for the day shift. After one year, Amoia worked his way up to a freelance editor, working for MTV, VH1 Sony Studios, and Comedy Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romanello|first1=Linda|title=HOT HOUSE: He Ain’t Heavy…(But He’s a Vidiot)|url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2006/01/hot-house-he-aina%C2%A2aeat-heavy-but-hea%C2%A2aeas-a-vidiot/|website=Studio Daily|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Mike Amoia co-founded Vidiots – a 20,000 square foot postproduction facility in the West Village housing an agency representing editors and directors. Vidiots then expanded into a production company in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whittock|first1=Jesse|title=Reality veteran creates prodco with Vidiots|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2016/02/reality-veteran-creates-prodco-vidiots/542252/|website=TBI Vision|accessdate=21 May 2017|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Amoia created Mibe Music, a publishing company with over 90,000 music cues and 1700 songwriters worldwide, which he still co-owns with his operating partner. Mibe Music credits include [[Beyoncé]] Pepsi commercial, [[Married to Medicine]] theme song, and the NBA Finals opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Jonathan|title=Barrow music producer lands dream Super Bowl job in latest career success|url=http://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/barrow/Barrow-music-producer-lands-dream-Super-Bowl-job-in-latest-career-success-8a8427a8-52aa-4a71-9b7d-8507a39510ac-ds|website=North-West Evening Mail|accessdate=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amoia launched Switchblade Entertainment Group in 2016.

'''MoMiG''' is the acronym for the “Modernisierung des GmbH-Rechts und zur Bekämpfung von Missbräuchen” or “Law for the Modernisation of the German Limited Liability Company Law and the Prevention of Misuse”. '''MoMiG''' came into effect in [[Germany]] on 1 November 2008.

The general purpose of MoMiG is to accelerate establishment of business, modernise the German limited liability ([[GmbH]]) law to make the GmbH structure more competitive internationally, and minimise abuse of company law.

==Main innovations of MoMiG==

'''''Polskie Towarzystwo Turystyczno-Krajoznawcze''''', ''' PTTK''' (Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society) is a Polish non-governmental [[Tourism|tourist]] organization with 312 branches across the country.&lt;ref name=""&gt;[http://oddzialy.pttk.pl/index.php?nazwa=&amp;woj=&amp;mie=&amp;s=1  Oddziały PTTK.] List of PTTK branches across Poland (homepage). Retrieved September 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The PTTK is one of the oldest tourist societies in Europe. Its origins stretch back to the foreign [[Partitions of Poland]]. In August 1873 a group of tourism [[enthusiast]]s including painter and photographer [[Walery Eljasz Radzikowski]] from [[Kraków]] and physician [[Tytus Chałubiński]] founded the Polish cultural [[Tatra Mountains|Tatra]] Society (''Polskie Towarzystwo Tatrzańskie'', originally the "Galician" Tatra Society for the [[Austrian Partition|Austrian censorship]]). A parallel Polish Sightseeing Society (''Polskie Towarzystwo Krajoznawcze'') was founded by ethnographer [[Zygmunt Gloger]] in 1906.  The two organizations merged [[History of Poland (1945–89)|after World War II]] in 1950 to form the PTTK.

== Current Operations ==
The Society aims to promote [[qualified tourism]] and sightseeing.  Its activities include designing and marking [[tourist trail]]s as well as cycling, horse and river trails throughout Poland; maintaining a network of tourist accommodations, including museums and libraries; running several courses and workshops; training and certifying official travel guides, and publishing  maps and guidebooks.

The Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society has approximately 61,000 members, with over 260 branches throughout Poland. It brings together about 2,500 rings and nearly 200 clubs. It runs accommodation facilities of a varying standards with over 20 thousand beds; including, in 60 [[tourist home]]s, 77 mountain chalets, 35 hostels and water sports facilities, 5 inns, and 33 campgrounds; along with a network of 16 museums. The society is organised into several regional authorities each with its own staff. The membership fee and the PTTK membership card provide a discount on all accommodation and courses offered by PTTK. Each member of the Polish Tourist Association is a paying member awarded with one of a system of over a dozen badges, including Climbing, Hiking, Skiing, Cycling, Sailing and even a Diving Badge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pttk.pl/  Polish Tourist and Sightseeing Society]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} [http://pttk.pl/pttk/przepisy/index.php?co=statut/ Statute PTTK registered in Warsaw on February 23, 2006.] 5 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The PTTK Society is a member of international tourist organizations such as the [[Alliance Internationale de Tourisme]], the [[Friends of Nature|Naturfreunde Internationale]], the Federation of Nature and National Parks of Europe, and the [[Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques]].{{clear left}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25209">'''Parts cleaning''' is essential to many [[List of industrial processes|industrial processes]], as a prelude to [[surface finishing]] or to protect sensitive components. [[Electroplating]] is particularly sensitive to part cleanliness, since molecular layers of [[oil]] can prevent [[adhesion]] of the [[coating]]. [[ASTM]] B322 is a standard guide for cleaning [[metal]]s prior to electroplating. Cleaning processes include [[solvent]] cleaning, hot [[alkali]]ne [[detergent]] cleaning, electrocleaning, and [[Industrial etching|acid etch]]. The most common industrial test for cleanliness is the waterbreak test, in which the surface is thoroughly rinsed and held vertical. A quantitative measurement for this parameter is contact angle. [[Hydrophobe|Hydrophobic]] contaminants such as oils cause the [[water]] to bead and break up, allowing the water to drain rapidly. Perfectly clean metal surfaces are [[Hydrophile|hydrophilic]] and will retain an unbroken sheet of water that does not bead up or drain off. ASTM F22 describes a version of this test. This test does not detect hydrophilic contaminants, but the electroplating process can displace these easily since the solutions are water-based. [[Surfactant]]s such as [[soap]] reduce the sensitivity of the test, so these must be thoroughly rinsed off.

== Definitions and classifications ==

For the activities described here the following terms are often found: metal cleaning, metal surface cleaning, component cleaning, degreasing, parts washing, parts cleaning. These are well established in technical language usage but they have their shortcomings. Metal cleaning can easily be mixed up with refinement of unpurified metals. Metal surface cleaning and metal cleaning do not consider the increasing usage of [[plastic]]s and [[composite material]]s in this sector. The term component cleaning leaves out the cleaning of [[steel]] sections and sheets and finally degreasing only describes a part of the topic as in most cases also chips, fines, particles, salts etc. have to be removed.

The terms 'commercial and industrial parts cleaning', 'parts cleaning in craft and industry' or 'commercial parts cleaning' probably best describe this field of activity. There are some specialists who prefer the term 'industrial parts cleaning', because they want to exclude maintenance of buildings, rooms, areas, windows, floors, tanks, machinery, [[hygiene]], hands washing, showers etc.

== Elements and their interactions ==

[[File:metallreinigung wikipedia KK illustration en 1.jpg|thumb|Factors]]
Cleaning activities in this sector can only be characterised sufficiently by a description of a number of different factors. These are outlined in illustration 1.

=== Parts and materials to be cleaned ===
First, consider the parts to be cleaned. They may consist of non- or hardly-processed sections, sheets and wires. But also machined parts or assembled components needing cleaning. Therefore, they may be composed of different metals or different combinations of metals. Plastics and [[composite material]]s can frequently be found and indeed are on the increase because e.g. the [[automobile]] industry as well as others uses more and more lighter materials.

[[Mass]] and size can be very important for the selection of cleaning methods, for example big shafts for [[ship]]s are usually cleaned manually, whereas tiny shafts for electrical appliances are often cleaned in bulk in highly automated plants.

Similarly important is the geometry of the parts. Long, thin, branching, threaded holes,  which could contain jammed chips, feature among the greatest challenges in this technical field. high pressure and the [[parts washer|power wash process]] are one way to remove these chips as well as [[robot]]s, which are programmed to exactly flush the drilled holes under high pressure.

=== Contaminations ===
The parts are usually covered by unwanted substances, the contaminations or soiling. The definition used is quite varied. In certain cases these coverings may be desired: e.g. one may not wish to remove a [[paint]] layer but only the material on top. In another case, where crack proofing is necessary one has to remove the paint layer and it is regarded as an unwanted substance.

The classification of soiling follows the layer structure starting from the base material:
[[File:metallreinigung wikipedia KK illustration en 2.jpg|thumb|Structure of a metallic surface]]
* Deformed boundary layer, &gt; 1&amp;nbsp;µm
* Reaction layer, 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm
* Sorption layer, 1–10&amp;nbsp;nm
* Contamination layer, &gt; 1&amp;nbsp;µm

See illustration 2: Structure of a metallic surface &lt;ref name="Haase"&gt;:''Brigitte Haase: Reinigen oder Vorbehandeln? Oberflächenzustand und Nitrierergebnis, Bauteilreinigung, Prozesskontrolle und –analytik.'' University of Applied Sciences Bremerhaven.&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearer the layers are to the substrate surface, the more [[energy]] is needed to remove them. Correspondingly the cleaning itself can be structured according to the type of energy input:&lt;ref name="Haase" /&gt;

:* mechanical – abrasive: blasting, grinding
:* mechanical – non-abrasive: stirring, mixing, ultrasound, spraying
:* thermal – reactive: heat treatment much above 100 °C in reactive gases
:* thermal – non-reactive: temperature below 100 °C, increased bath temperature, vapour degreasing
:* chemical – abrasive/reactive: pickling in liquids, [[Plasma cleaning|plasma-assisted]], sputter-cleaning, electropolishing
:* chemical – non-reactive: organic solvents, aqueous solutions, supercritical CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The contamination layer may then be further classified according to:
* Origin
* Composition: e.g. cooling [[lubricant]]s may be composed very differently, thereby single components may account for big problems especially for job shop cleaners, who have no control over prior processes and thus don't know the contaminants. For example, [[silicate]]s may obstruct nitriding.
* State of aggregation
* Chemical and physical properties

The American Society for Testing and Materials ([[ASTM International|ASTM]]) presents six groups of contaminations in their manual "Choosing a cleaning process" and relates them to the most common cleaning methods, thereby the suitability of cleaning methods for the removal of a given contaminate is discussed in detail.&lt;ref name="ASM"&gt;ASM International: Choosing a cleaning process. 1996, ASM International, Materials Park, Ohio, USA. {{ISBN|0-87170-572-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition they list exemplary cleaning processes for different typical applications. Since one has to consider very many different aspects when choosing a process, this can only serve as a first orientation. The groups of contaminants are stated as follows:
* Pigmented drawing compounds 
* Unpigmented oil and grease 
* Chips and cutting fluids 
* Polishing and buffing compounds 
* [[Rust]] and scale 
* Others

=== Charging ===
In order to select suitable equipment and media it should be known also which amount and which throughput has to be handled. Small amounts can hardly be cleaned economically in larger plants. Also the type of charging has to be ascertained. Sensitive parts sometimes need to be fixed in boxes. Very economically when dealing with large amounts is bulk charging, but it is quite difficult to achieve a sufficient level of cleanliness with flat pieces clinging together. Also drying can be difficult in these cases.

=== Place of cleaning ===
Another consideration is the place of cleaning. E.g. is the cleaning to be done on site, which can be the case with repair and maintenance work.

Usually the cleaning takes place in a workshop. Several common methods are [[solvent degreasing]], [[vapor degreasing]] and using an aqueous [[parts washer]]. Companies often want the charging, loading and unloading to be integrated into the production line, which is much more demanding as regards size and throughput ability of the cleaning system.

Such cleaning systems often exactly match the requirements regarding parts, contaminants and charging methods (special production). Nonetheless central cleaning equipment, often built as multi task systems, are commonly used. These systems can suit different cleaning requirements. Typical examples are the wash stands or the [[parts washer|small cleaning machines]] which are found in many insdustrial plants.

=== Cleaning equipment and procedure ===
First, one can differentiate between the following techniques:
* Manual
* Mechanical
* Automatic
* Robot supported

The process may be performed in one step, which is especially true for the manual cleaning, but typically it requires several steps. Therefore, it is not uncommon to find 10 to 20 steps in large plants e.g. for the medical and optical industry. This can be especially complex because non-cleaning steps may be integrated in such plants like application of [[corrosion]] protection layers or [[parkerizing|phosphating]]. Cleaning can also be simple, the cleaning processes are integrated into other processes as it is the case with [[electroplating]] or [[galvanising]], where it usually serves as a pre-treatment step.

The following procedure is quite common:

# Pre cleaning
# Main cleaning
# Rinsing
# Rinsing with deionised water
# Rinsing with corrosion protection
# Drying

Each of these steps may take place in its own bath or chamber or in case of spray cleaning in its own zone (line or multi-chamber equipment). But quite often these steps may have a single chamber into which the respective media are pumped in (single chamber plant).

Besides equipment and procedure, cleaning media plays an important role as it removes the contaminants from the substrate.

For liquid media the following cleaners are in use: aqueous agents, semi-aqueous agents (an emulsion of solvents and water), hydrocarbon based solvents and halogenated solvents. Usually the latter are referred to as chlorinated agents, but there are also brominated and fluorated substances in (limited) use, that is why we have chosen the higher level classification. The hazardous traditionally used chlorinated agents [[trichloroethylene|TCE]] and [[tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] are nowadays only applied in airtight plants and the modern volume shift systems limits any emissions.In the group of hydrocarbon based solvents, there are some newly developed agents like fatty acid esters made of natural fats and oils, modified alcohols and [[dibasic esters]].

Aqueous cleaners are mostly a combination of various substances like alkaline builders, surfactants, sequestering agents, etc. In the case of ferrous metal cleaning, rust inibitors are built into the aqueous cleaner to prevent flash rusting after washing. Their use is on the rise as their results have proven to be in many cases as good or better than hydrocarbon cleaners.  Additionally, the wastes generated are less hazardous resulting in less costly disposal.

Aqueous cleaners have advantages as regards to particle and polar contaminants and only require higher inputs of mechanical and thermal energy to be effective, whereas solvents more easily remove oils and greases but have health and environmental risks. In addition most solvents are flammable and create fire and explosion hazards. Nowadays, with the proper industrial [[parts washer]] equipment, it is generally accepted that aqueous cleaners remove oil and grease as easily as solvents.

Another approach is with solid cleaning media (blasting) which consists of the [[dry ice blasting|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dry ice process]]: For tougher requirements pellets are used while for more sensitive materials or components CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in form of snow is applied. One draw back is the high energy consumption required to make dry ice.

Last but not least there are processes without any media like vibration, laser, brushing and blow/exhaust systems.

All cleaning steps are characterised by media and applied temperatures and their individual agitation/application (mechanical impact). There is a wide range of different methods and combinations of these methods:

* Sprinkling
* Spraying
* [[Parts washer|Power Wash Process]] 
* Blasting
* Flooding
* Movement of parts (turning, oscillating, pivoting)
* Circulation of bath
* Gas or air injection into bath
* Boiling under pressure
* Injection flooding
* Pressure flooding
* Hydroson
* Ultrasonic, see [[ultrasonic cleaning]] 
* Megasonic, see [[megasonic cleaning]]
* [[Carbon dioxide cleaning]]

Finally, every cleaning step is described by the time which the parts to be cleaned spends in the respective zone, bath or chamber and thus medium, temperature and agitation can impact on the contamination.

Every cleaning equipment needs a so-called periphery. This term describes measures and equipment on the one hand side to maintain and control baths and on the other hand side to protect human beings and the environment.

In most plants the cleaning agents are circulated until their cleaning power has eventually decreased and reached the maximum tolerable contaminant level. In order to delay the necessary bath exchange as much as possible there are sophisticated treatment attachments in use, removing contaminants and the used up agents from the system. At the same time fresh cleaning agents or parts thereof have to be supplemented, which requires a bath control. The latter is more and more facilitated online and thus allows a computer aided adjustment of the bath. With the help of oil separators, demulsifying agents and evaporators aqueous processes can be conducted 'waste water free'. Complete exchange of baths becomes only necessary every 3 to 12 months.

When using organic solvents the preferred method to achieve a long operating bath life is distillation, an especially effective method to separate contaminants and agents.

The periphery also includes measures to protect the workers like encapsulation, automatic shut off of power supply, automatic refill and sharpening of media (e.g. gas shuttle technique), explosion prevention measures, exhaust ventilation etc., and also measures to protect the environment, e.g. capturing of volatile solvents, impounding basins, extraction, treatment and disposal of resulting wastes. Solvents based cleaning processes have the advantage that the dirt and the cleaning agent can be more easily separated, whereas in aqueous processes is more complex.

In processes without cleaning media like [[laser ablation]] and vibration cleaning, only the removed dirt has to be disposed of as there is no cleaning agent. Quite little waste is generated in processes like CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; blasting and automatic brush cleaning at the expense of higher energy costs.

=== Quality requirements ===
A standardisation of the quality requirements for cleaned surfaces regarding the following process (e.g. coating, heat treatment) or from the point of view of technical functionality is difficult. However it is possible to use general classifications. In Germany it was attempted to define cleaning as a sub category of metal treatment (DIN 8592: Cleaning as sub category of cutting processes), but this does not cope with all the complexities of cleaning.

The rather general rules includes the classification in intermediate cleaning, final cleaning, precision cleaning and critical cleaning (s. table), in practice seen only as a general guideline.

:(1) Related to the total dirt; (2) Only related to Carbon

Thus in practice the rule of thumb is still followed, stating that the quality requirements are met, if the subsequent process (see below) does not cause any problems, for example a paint coating does not flake off before the guarantee period ends.

Where this is not sufficient, especially in case of external orders, because of missing standards there are often specific customer requirements regarding remaining contamination, corrosion protection, spots and gloss level etc.

Measuring methods to ensure quality therefore do not play a bigger role in the workshops, although there exist a broad scale of different methods, from visual control over simple testing methods (among other things water break test, wipe test, measurement of contact angle, test inks, tape test) to complex analysis methods (among others [[Gravimetry|gravimetric]] test, particle counting, infrared [[spectroscopy]], glow discharge spectroscopy, energy dispersive [[X-ray]] analysis, [[scanning electron microscopy]] and electrochemical methods). Nevertheless, there are only few methods, which can be applied directly in the line and which offer reproducible and comparable results. It was not until recently that bigger advancements in this area have been made &lt;ref name="JOT"&gt;:''Doris Schulz: Steigende Anforderungen an die Reinigungsqualität - Kontrollierte Sauberkeit.JOT Journal für Oberflächentechnik Vieweg Verlag/GWV Fachverlage GmbH, No. 6, 2006 pg. 50-53''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The general situation has changed meanwhile, because of dramatically rising cleanliness requirements for certain components in the automotive industry. For example, [[brake]] systems and [[fuel-injection]] systems need to be fitted with increasingly smaller diameters and they have to withstand increasingly higher pressures. Therefore, a very minor particle contamination may lead to big problems. Due to the rising innovation speed, the industry cannot afford to identify possible failures at a relatively late stage. Therefore, the standard VDA 19/ISO 16232 'Road Vehicles – Cleanliness of Components of Fluid Circuits' was developed which describes methods that can control the compliance with the cleanliness requirements.

=== Subsequent process ===
When choosing cleaning techniques, cleaning agents and cleaning processes, the subsequent processes, i.e. the further processing of the cleaned parts is of special interest.

The classification follows basically the metal work theory:
* machining
* cutting
* joining
* coating
* [[heat treatment]]
* assembling
* measuring, testing
* repairing, maintenance.

In the course of time empirical values were established, how efficient the cleaning has to be, to assure the processes for the particular guarantee period and beyond. Choosing the cleaning method often starts from here.

== Challenges and trends ==
The details above illustrate how extremely complex this specific field is. Already small changes in the requirements can necessitate completely different processes. Thus it defies scientific technical determination. On the other hand, it becomes more and more important to receive the required degree of cleanliness as cost-effective as possible and with continuously minimised health and environmental risks, because cleaning has become of central importance for the supply chain in manufacturing.&lt;ref name="Fraunhofer"&gt;:''Fraunhofer Allianz Reinigungstechnik: market and trend analysis in the industrial parts cleaning, 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt; Applying companies usually rely on their suppliers, who—due to a big experience base—suggest adequate equipment and processes, which are then adapted to the detailed requirements in tests stations at the supplier’s premises. However they are limited to their scope of technology. To put practitioners in a position to consider all relevant possibilities meeting their requirements, some institutes have developed different tools:

'''SAGE:''' 
Unfortunately no longer in operation the comprehensive expert system for parts cleaning and degreasing provided a graded list with relatively general processes of possible solvent and process alternatives. Developed by the Surface Cleaning Programme at the [[Research Triangle Institute]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], USA, in cooperation with the U.S. [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] (used to be available under: http://clean.rti.org/).

'''Cleantool:''' 
A ‘Best Practice’ database in seven languages with comprehensive and specific processes, directly recorded in companies. It contains furthermore an integrated evaluation tool, which covers the areas technology, quality, health and safety at work, environmental protection as well as costs. Also included is a comprehensive glossary (seven languages, link see below).

'''Bauteilreinigung:''' 
A selection system for component cleaning developed by the [[Dortmund University of Technology|University of Dortmund]], assisting the users to analyse their cleaning tasks with regard to the suitable cleaning processes and cleaning agents (German only, link see below).

'''TURI, Toxic Use Reduction Institute:''' 
A department of the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell|University of Lowell, Massachusetts]] (USA). TURI's laboratory has been conducting evaluations on alternative cleaning products since 1993. A majority of these products were designed for metal surface cleaning. The results of these tests are available on-line through the Institute’s laboratory database (English only, link see below).

[[File:Decauville paul1626r3.jpg|thumb|right|150px]]
'''Paul Decauville''' (1846–1922) was a [[France|French]] engineer and businessman. He was also [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Evry-Petit Bourg and [[Senate (France)|senator]] from [[Seine-et-Oise]].

He is the founder of a manufacturing company that bears his name ([[Decauville]], established in 1875), producing industrial railways, locomotives, and cars.  By extension, the name is also used for his invention of a narrow gauge track railway system, the Decauville system, through the vast business acumen of its promoter.  His name was also used for a subsidiary, [[Voitures automobiles Decauville]], producing early automobiles. Decauville's name is further associated with the towns of [[Corbeil-Essonnes]] and [[Evry, Essonne]], on whose territories the company Decauville erected its factories, which he directed until 1885.

He founded a construction company in 1910 to exploit the patents it had obtained. This company, ''Comptoir d'outillage et de matériel à air comprimé'' (''Commercial establishmen for tools and compressed air equipment''), survived until the late 1980s. Another of his companies, ''Emidecau'', specializing in hydraulic presses, still exist.

In politics, Paul Decauville was [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of Evry-Petit Bourg from 1881 to 1892. He was also Senator of Seine-et-Oise from 1890 to 1900, member of the Board of Customs, Secretary from 1897 to 1899. After leaving Paris, Paul Decauville served as mayor of the town of Saint-Léger (Manche).

'''Qatar Chamber of Commerce and Industry''' is one of the oldest chambers of commerce in the GCC countries.

==History==

Having been established in 1963 by virtue of Law No (4) of the year 1963 dated on 16 February 1963, it used to operate within the structure of Government agencies until the promulgation of law no. (11) Of 1990 which empowered the Chamber to operate independently. This enabled the Qatar Chamber to exercise a wide range of activities commensurate with national, regional and international developments and serve the commercial, industrial and agricultural interests of its participants in the private sector.

Despite the promulgation of law no (11) of 1990, the QCCI Board Members were still appointed by the Government through an Emiri Decree. The Board Members would, in their first meeting, select a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and a Treasury Secretary. The term of office of the Board was Five years. On 8 July 1996 Qatar witnessed, in its first democratic experience, the promulgation of law no (11) of 1996, which amended some of the provisions of law no (11) of 1990, article (13) in particular, that Board Members shall be directly elected by the QCCI General  Assembly which represents the various economic sectors in Qatar.

The Minister of Finance, Economy and Trade (currently Minister of Business and Trade) shall determine the proportional representation of these sectors following consultations with the concerned Ministers. The Board's term of office is four instead of five years. The QCCI internal regulations shall specify how elections should be held.

Accordingly, the Minister of Finance, Economy &amp; Trade has issued resolution no (10) of 1997, amended by resolution no (83) of the year 2010, determining the sector's proportional representation in the QCCI board as follows:
* The Trading Sector – 5 Members
* The Contracting Sector – 4 Members
* The Manufacturing Sector – 3 Members
* The Services Sector – 1 Member
* The Banking &amp; Investment Sector – 1 Member
* The Insurance Sector – 1 Member
* The Tourism Sector – 1 Member
* The Agricultural Sector – 1 Member
* The Board Members shall, in their first meeting elect a Chairman, a Vice Chairman and an Honorary Treasurer.

'''The chamber’s Competences'''
Article four of law number (11) for 1990 AD amended by law number (11) for 1996 AD defined the Chamber’s competences as follows:

==Corporate Social Responsibility==

QCCI's actions range from environmental and sustainability programs to long-term financing and economic initiatives. Among its long-term plans, QCCI has also allocated a budget for a capacity-building initiative that will bring 50 delegates from countries that the [[United Nations]] categorizes as "Least Developed Countries" to the Eighth World Chambers Congress, should Doha be successful in the bid to host the Congress organized by the World Chambers Federation in 2013. As part of the bid book delivered to the Congress Selection Committee members, QCCI has dedicated an entire chapter for the capacity-building initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ameinfo.com/248923.html Qatar Chamber of Commerce and Industry to implement new Corporate Social Responsibilities initiatives | Qatar Chamber | AMEinfo.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204022013/http://www.ameinfo.com/248923.html |date=December 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that in spite of QCCI's high-profile efforts to showcase Qatar’s economically and technologically progressive initiatives, the country has increasingly found itself on the defensive amidst charges by international NGOs regarding living and working conditions of migrants imported to construct the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 FIFA stadium]] and related infrastructure [4] and the U.S. State Department continually faults Qatar on its human rights record while noting incremental year-to-year improvement.&lt;ref name="humanrights"&gt;"[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/220583.pdf Qatar 2013 Human Rights Report]", United States Department of State.

A '''restriction enzyme''' or '''restriction endonuclease''' is an [[enzyme]] that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within the molecule known as [[restriction sites]].&lt;ref name="pmid795607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = Restriction endonucleases | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Biochemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–64 | date = Nov 1976 | pmid = 795607 | doi = 10.3109/10409237609105456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler C, Manta V | title = Specificity of restriction endonucleases and DNA modification methyltransferases a review (Edition 3) | journal = Gene | volume = 92 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–248 | date = Aug 1990 | pmid = 2172084 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(90)90486-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-89603-234-5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pingoud A, Alves J, Geiger R | editor = Burrell M | title = Enzymes of Molecular Biology | edition = | publisher = Humana Press | location = Totowa, NJ | series= Methods of Molecular Biology | volume= 16 | year = 1993 | pages = 107–200 | chapter = Chapter 8: Restriction Enzymes | quote = | isbn = 0-89603-234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restrictions enzymes are one class of the broader [[endonuclease]] group of enzymes. Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into five types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another. To cut DNA, all restriction enzymes make two incisions, once through each [[backbone chain|sugar-phosphate backbone]] (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix.

These enzymes are found in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]] and provide a defence mechanism against invading [[virus]]es.&lt;ref name="pmid4897066"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arber W, Linn S | title = DNA modification and restriction | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 38 | issue =  | pages = 467–500 | year = 1969 | pmid = 4897066 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.38.070169.002343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6314109"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krüger DH, Bickle TA | title = Bacteriophage survival: multiple mechanisms for avoiding the deoxyribonucleic acid restriction systems of their hosts | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 47 | issue = 3 | pages = 345–60 | date = Sep 1983 | pmid = 6314109 | pmc = 281580 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside a [[prokaryote]], the restriction enzymes selectively cut up ''foreign'' DNA in a process called ''restriction digestion''; meanwhile, host DNA is protected by a modification enzyme (a [[methyltransferase]]) that [[DNA methylation|modifies]] the prokaryotic DNA and blocks cleavage. Together, these two processes form the [[restriction modification system]].&lt;ref name="pmid11557807"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kobayashi I | title = Behavior of restriction-modification systems as selfish mobile elements and their impact on genome evolution | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3742–56 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11557807 | pmc = 55917 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The term restriction enzyme originated from the studies of [[lambda phage|phage λ]], a virus that infects bacteria, and the phenomenon of host-controlled restriction and modification of such bacterial phage or [[bacteriophage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Genes to Clones | author = Winnacker E-L|publisher=VCH |year=1987 |chapter= Chapter 2: Isolation, Identification, and Characterisation of DNA fragments |isbn=0-89573-614-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first identified in work done in the laboratories of [[Salvador Luria]], [[Jean Weigle|Weigle]] and Giuseppe Bertani in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Luria_Human_1952"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luria SE, Human ML | title = A nonhereditary, host-induced variation of bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–69 | date = Oct 1952 | pmid = 12999684 | pmc = 169391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13034700"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertani G, Weigle JJ | title = Host controlled variation in bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–21 | date = Feb 1953 | pmid = 13034700 | pmc = 169650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found that, for a bacteriophage λ that can grow well in one strain of ''Escherichia coli'', for example ''E. coli'' C, when grown in another strain, for example ''E. coli'' K, its yields can drop significantly, by as much as 3-5 orders of magnitude. The host cell, in this example ''E. coli'' K, is known as the restricting host and appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage λ. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also becomes restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of [[Werner Arber]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.&lt;ref name="pmid4897066" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4868368"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Yuan R | title = DNA restriction enzyme from E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5134 | pages = 1110–4 | date = Mar 1968 | pmid = 4868368 | doi = 10.1038/2171110a0 | bibcode = 1968Natur.217.1110M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13888713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dussoix D, Arber W | title = Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli. II. Control over acceptance of DNA from infecting phage lambda | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 37–49 | date = Jul 1962 | pmid = 13888713 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(62)80059-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14187389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederberg S, Meselson M | title = Degradation of non-replicating bacteriophage dna in non-accepting cells | journal = Journal of Molecular Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 623–8 | date = May 1964 | pmid = 14187389 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(64)80112-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restriction enzymes studied by Arber and Meselson were type I restriction enzymes, which cleave DNA randomly away from the recognition site.&lt;ref name="pmid15840723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 5905–8 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15840723 | pmc = 1087929 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500923102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5905R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Hamilton O. Smith]], [[Thomas J. Kelly (scientist)|Thomas Kelly]] and Kent Wilcox isolated and characterized the first type II restriction enzyme, [[HindII|''Hin''dII]], from the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid5312500"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith HO, Wilcox KW | title = A restriction enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae.

== Recognition site ==
[[File:EcoRV Restriction Site.rsh.svg|thumb|right|A palindromic recognition site reads the same on the reverse strand as it does on the forward strand when both are read in the same orientation]]
Restriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"/&gt; and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences can also be classified by the number of bases in its recognition site, usually between 4 and 8 bases, and the number of bases in the sequence will determine how often the site will appear by chance in any given genome, e.g., a 4-base pair sequence would theoretically occur once every 4^4 or 256bp, 6 bases, 4^6 or 4,096bp, and 8 bases would be 4^8 or 65,536bp.&lt;ref name="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/restriction_map/restriction_map.htm"&gt;[http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/restriction_map/restriction_map.htm Restriction Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are [[Palindromic sequence|palindromic]], meaning the base sequence reads the same backwards and forwards.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The ''mirror-like'' palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backward on a single strand of DNA, as in GTAATG. The ''inverted repeat'' palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to CATATG).&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-175551-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Clark DP | title = Molecular biology | publisher = Elsevier Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | year = 2005 | pages = | isbn = 0-12-175551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.

[[EcoRI]] digestion produces [[Sticky and blunt ends|"sticky" ends]],

whereas [[SmaI]] restriction enzyme cleavage produces [[Sticky and blunt ends|"blunt" ends]]:

[[Image:SmaI restriction enzyme recognition site.svg|90px]]

Recognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation ([[5' end]] or [[3' end]]) of a [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky-end]] "overhang" of an enzyme restriction.&lt;ref name="pmid11897876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodsell DS | title = The molecular perspective: restriction endonucleases | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–1 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11897876 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.20-2-190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as [[neoschizomer]]s. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as [[isoschizomer]]s.

== Types ==
Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into four groups (Types I, II III, and IV) based on their composition and [[enzyme cofactor]] requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = Jun 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 | doi =  | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8336674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4949033"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyer HW | title = DNA restriction and modification mechanisms in bacteria | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 25 | issue =  | pages = 153–76 | year = 1971 | pmid = 4949033 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.25.100171.001101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6267988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan R | title = Structure and mechanism of multifunctional restriction endonucleases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue =  | pages = 285–319 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6267988 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.50.070181.001441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA sequence analyses of restriction enzymes however show great variations, indicating that there are more than four types.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt; All types of enzymes recognize specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates.

* Type I enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.3}}) cleave at sites remote from a recognition site; require both ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to function; multifunctional protein with both restriction digestion and methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}) activities.
* Type II enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.4}}) cleave within or at short specific distances from a recognition site; most require magnesium; single function (restriction digestion) enzymes independent of methylase.
* Type III enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.5}}) cleave at sites a short distance from a recognition site; require ATP (but do not hydrolyse it); S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulates the reaction but is not required; exist as part of a complex with a modification methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}).
* Type IV enzymes target modified DNA, e.g. methylated, hydroxymethylated and glucosyl-hydroxymethylated DNA

=== Type l ===
Type I restriction enzymes were the first to be identified and were first identified in two different strains (K-12 and B) of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray NE | title = Type I restriction systems: sophisticated molecular machines (a legacy of Bertani and Weigle) | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 412–34 | date = Jun 2000 | pmid = 10839821 | pmc = 98998 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.2.412-434.2000 | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10839821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions—one containing 3–4 nucleotides, and another containing 4–5 nucleotides—separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6–8 nucleotides. These enzymes are multifunctional and are capable of both restriction digestion and modification activities, depending upon the methylation status of the target DNA. The cofactors [[S-Adenosyl methionine]] (AdoMet), hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[ion]]s, are required for their full activity. Type I restriction enzymes possess three subunits called HsdR, HsdM, and HsdS; HsdR is required for restriction digestion; HsdM is necessary for adding [[methyl]] groups to host DNA (methyltransferase activity), and HsdS is important for specificity of the recognition (DNA-binding) site in addition to both restriction digestion (DNA cleavage) and modification (DNA methyltransferase) activity.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"/&gt;

Typical type II restriction enzymes differ from type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They form [[homodimer]]s, with recognition sites that are usually undivided and palindromic and 4–8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, and they do not use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;  These enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bond of double helix DNA. It can either cleave at the center of both strands to yield a blunt end, or at a staggered position leaving overhangs called sticky ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa J.|first=Alexander|last2=Balou|first2=David P.|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee | name-list-format = vanc |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-08766-4|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily [[nomenclature]] was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.

Type IIB restriction enzymes (e.g., BcgI and BplI) are [[multimer]]s, containing more than one subunit.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; They cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cofactors. Type IIE restriction endonucleases (e.g., NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric effector]] that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF restriction endonucleases (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIG restriction endonucleases (e.g., Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIM restriction endonucleases, such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIS restriction endonucleases (e.g., ''Fok''I) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites;&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; this characteristic is widely used to perform in-vitro cloning techniques such as [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate cloning]]. These enzymes may function as [[protein dimer|dimer]]s. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;

=== Type III ===
Type III restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoP15) recognize two separate non-palindromic sequences that are inversely oriented. They cut DNA about 20–30 base pairs after the recognition site.&lt;ref name="pmid11557806"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden DT, Murray NE, Rao DN | title = Nucleoside triphosphate-dependent restriction enzymes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3728–41 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11557806 | pmc = 55918 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3728 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11557806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes contain more than one subunit and require AdoMet and ATP cofactors for their roles in DNA methylation and restriction digestion , respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid1734285"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meisel A, Bickle TA, Krüger DH, Schroeder C | title = Type III restriction enzymes need two inversely oriented recognition sites for DNA cleavage | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6359 | pages = 467–9 | date = Jan 1992 | pmid = 1734285 | doi = 10.1038/355467a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..467M }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are components of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] DNA restriction-modification [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type III enzymes are hetero-oligomeric, multifunctional [[protein]]s composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognises the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification [[methyltransferase]]; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonuclease. Res is required for restriction digestion , although it has no [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognise short 5–6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25–27 bp [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction digestion to occur. These enzymes [[DNA methylation|methylate]] only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction digestion. Type III enzymes belong to the beta-subfamily of [[DNA methyltransferase|N6 adenine methyltransferases]], containing the nine [[protein motif|motif]]s that characterise this family, including [[sequence motif|motif]] I, the [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine|AdoMet]] binding pocket (FXGXG), and motif IV, the [[catalytic]] region (S/D/N (PP) Y/F).&lt;ref name="pmid15121719"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12595133"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourniquel AA, Bickle TA | title = Complex restriction enzymes: NTP-driven molecular motors | journal = Biochimie | volume = 84 | issue = 11 | pages = 1047–59 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12595133 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(02)00020-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type IV ===
Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the&amp;nbsp;McrBC&amp;nbsp;and Mrr systems of&amp;nbsp;''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="neb"&gt;[https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases/types-of-restriction-endonucleases Types of Restriction Endonucleases | NEB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V===
Type V restriction enzymes (e.g., the cas9-gRNA complex from [[CRISPR]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) utilize guide RNAs to target specific non-palindromic sequences found on invading organisms. They can cut DNA of variable length, provided that a suitable guide RNA is provided.

In 2017 a group in Illinois announced using an [[Argonaute]] protein taken from [[Pyrococcus furiosus]] (PfAgo) along with guide DNA to edit DNA as artificial restriction enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/revolutionizing-biotechnology-with-artificial-restriction-enzymes/81253861 Revolutionizing Biotechnology with Artificial Restriction Enzymes.] (reporting on [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.6b00324 Programmable DNA-Guided Artificial Restriction Enzymes])&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial ribonucleases that act as restriction enzymes for RNA are also being developed. A [[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]-based system, called PNAzymes, has a Cu(II)-[[Neocuproine|2,9-dimethylphenanthroline]] group that mimics ribonucleases for specific RNA sequence and cleaves at a non-base-paired region (RNA bulge) of the targeted RNA formed when the enzyme binds the RNA. This enzyme shows selectivity by cleaving only at one site that either does not have a mismatch or is kinetically preferred out of two possible cleavage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=PNAzymes That Are Artificial RNA Restriction Enzymes|journal=J.

==Applications==
{{main|Restriction digest}}
Isolated restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA for different scientific applications.

They are used to assist insertion of genes into [[plasmid]] [[Plasmid vector|vector]]s during [[gene cloning]] and [[protein production]] experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short ''polylinker'' sequence (called the [[multiple cloning site]], or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a [[DNA ligase]].&lt;ref name="urlCloning using restriction enzymes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/restriction_enzymes/ | title = Cloning using restriction enzymes | author = Geerlof A | publisher = European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Hamburg | accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | edition = | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-576-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene [[allele]]s by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).&lt;ref name="pmid18330346"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Combining allele-specific fluorescent probes and restriction assay in real-time PCR to achieve SNP scoring beyond allele ratios of 1:1000 | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–4, 196, 199 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18330346 | doi = 10.2144/000112719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15980518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang R, Zhu Z, Zhu H, Nguyen T, Yao F, Xia K, Liang D, Liu C | title = SNP Cutter: a comprehensive tool for SNP PCR-RFLP assay design | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W489–92 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 15980518 | pmc = 1160119 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is however only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to [[genotype]] a DNA sample without the need for expensive [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by [[gel electrophoresis]]. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. A [[restriction map|DNA map]] by restriction digest can also be generated that can give the relative positions of the genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/mapping-282 |title=Mapping |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  different lengths of DNA generated by restriction digest also produce a specific pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis, and can be used for [[DNA fingerprinting]].

In a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest [[genomic]] DNA for gene analysis by [[Southern blot]]. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or [[paralogue]]s) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene [[mutation]]s ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism|restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP).&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4684-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = Fifth | publisher = W.H.

Artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the ''Fok''I DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the ''Fok''I domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9–12 base pairs, making for 18–24 for the pair. A 5–7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tebas P, Stein D, Tang WW, Frank I, Wang SQ, Lee G, Spratt SK, Surosky RT, Giedlin MA, Nichol G, Holmes MC, Gregory PD, Ando DG, Kalos M, Collman RG, Binder-Scholl G, Plesa G, Hwang WT, Levine BL, June CH | title = Gene editing of CCR5 in autologous CD4 T cells of persons infected with HIV | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 10 | pages = 901–910 | date = Mar 2014 | pmid = 24597865 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1300662 | pmc=4084652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have proposed using the bacteria R-M system as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism by bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wayengera M |title= HIV and Gene Therapy: The proposed [R-M enzymatic] model for a gene therapy against HIV. |journal=Makerere Med J. |year=2003 |volume=38 |pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is research on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV-2]], high-risk [[HPV]]s and [[HIV-1]], with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wayengera M, Kajumbula H, Byarugaba W |title= Frequency and site mapping of HIV-1/SIVcpz, HIV-2/SIVsmm and Other SIV gene sequence cleavage by various bacteria restriction enzymes: Precursors for a novel HIV inhibitory product |journal= Afr J Biotechnol |year=2007 |volume= 6 |issue=10 |pages=1225–1232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffer JT, Aubert M, Weber ND, Mintzer E, Stone D, Jerome KR | title = Targeted DNA mutagenesis for the cure of chronic viral infections | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 86 | issue = 17 | pages = 8920–36 | date = Sep 2012 | pmid = 22718830 | pmc = 3416169 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00052-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manjunath N, Yi G, Dang Y, Shankar P | title = Newer gene editing technologies toward HIV gene therapy | journal = Viruses | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 2748–66 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24284874 | pmc = 3856413 | doi = 10.3390/v5112748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain.

'''Robert Emmet Brennan''' (born 1944) is an [[United States|America]]n businessman who built the infamous [[penny stock]] brokerage firm, First Jersey Securities. The firm specialized in promoting "[[Pump and dump]]" penny stocks to unsuspecting investors, many of them elderly, who lost their entire investments when the stocks inevitably crashed.

==First Jersey Securities Fraud==

As a result of this penny stock scheme, Brennan became a target of the United States [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. First Jersey itself went bankrupt in 1987 and Brennan was found guilty of securities fraud in 1994. The US Government ordered him to pay $75 million to settle the fraud claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/25/weekinreview/ideas-trends-hubris-and-the-artifice-of-a-dealer.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ideas &amp; Trends; Hubris And the Artifice of A Dealer | first=Matthew | last=Purdy | date=1995-06-25 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan declared bankruptcy in 1995 but committed another fraud when he did not declare all of his assets to the court. Brennan withheld from the bankruptcy court that he held $500,000 in casino chips that he had purchased (and later cashed out of after his bankruptcy) and $4 million in municipal bonds he kept in his basement. He then directed an associate to liquidate the bonds overseas and invest them in stocks, which netted him $16 million in ill-gotten gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/06/sports/sports-of-the-times-greed-and-sheer-gall-catch-up-to-brennan.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sports of The Times; Greed and Sheer Gall Catch Up to Brennan | first=George | last=Vecsey | date=2000-08-06 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/13/nyregion/ex-financier-used-code-names-and-dummy-firms-witness-says.html | work=The New York Times | title=Ex-Financier Used Code Names and Dummy Firms, Witness Says | first=Robert | last=Hanley | date=2001-03-13 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Money Laundering==

In 2001 Brennan was found guilty of [[money-laundering]] and bankruptcy fraud and sentenced to a [[prison]] term of nine years and two months. [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/27/nyregion/jail-term-for-former-penny-stock-tycoon.html] On appeal, in 2003 the sentence was upheld. Brennan served part of his sentence at the US Bureau of Prison's [[Fort Dix#Federal Correctional Institution|Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institution]] in Fort Dix, New Jersey.  He was released on January 14, 2011 from Fort Dix and was sent to another less harsh prison until July which is when he was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.harnessracing.com/news/gspsbobbrennanreleasedfromprison.html  | title=GSP's Bob Brennan is released from prison | work=harnessracing.com | date=2011-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

Brennan grew up in [[Newark, New Jersey]], one of nine children. His first wife, Cecelia, was his childhood sweetheart. He attended St Leo's Roman Catholic School in Irvington, and was taught by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, and [[St. Benedict's Preparatory School]] in Newark and in 1973 donated $10 million to the school which allowed it to significantly upgrade its facilities. [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/21/business/us-ruling-may-undercut-brennan-s-other-projects.html] A major benefactor to [[Seton Hall University]], following his conviction the university's Board of Governors had Brennan's name removed from a recreation center on its campus in [[South Orange, New Jersey]].  Brennan is an alumnus of [[Seton Hall University]] and sat on its Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2002/nf20020920_9297.htm Business Week article 'Seton Hall of Shame']&lt;/ref&gt;

Brennan was also a [[Certified Public Accountant]] but his license was revoked as a result of his criminal  conviction. {{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Thoroughbred racing==
International Thoroughbred Breeders, Inc., a publicly held company founded and chaired by Brennan, financed the reconstruction of [[Garden State Park]] race track in Cherry Hill, New Jersey after it was taken out by a 1977 fire.  The grandstand reopened in 1985, closed in 2001, was demolished, and the property redeveloped. Brennan also owned and raced [[Thoroughbred]]s under the name Due Process Stable. The best known of his horses were [[Eclipse Award]] winners [[Deputy Minister (horse)|Deputy Minister]] and his son [[Dehere]], who was bred by Brennan. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI|DN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB2A0B810A38D15&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM]

Brennan also built and owned the Due Process Stable Golf Club in [[Colts Neck Township, New Jersey]], where he lived until his arrest in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE5D91E30F931A35752C1A9669C8B63 "Metro Business Briefing; Ex-financier Indicted Again"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 2, 2000.

=== 'White Friday' ===

In 2014, he established the White Friday sales event to coincide with [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in the US, explaining that a "black" Friday doesn't make cultural sense in the Arab world, since Friday is the traditional day of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deborah Amos Facebook Twitter |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2014/12/04/368242510/a-syrian-entrepreneur-looks-to-build-the-amazon-of-the-arab-world |title=A Syrian Entrepreneur Looks To Build The Amazon Of The Arab World : Parallels |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sale was widely popular as it raised over $275 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wamda.com/2016/02/souq-raises-menas-largest-round-of-275m |title=Souq raises MENA's largest round of $275M |publisher=Wamda.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Souq.com more than doubled its sales during its second White Friday sale, with 13 million visitors and 600,000 items sold during November 25–28 across the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/souq-com-sales-double-during-white-friday--614475.html |title=Souq.com sales ‘double during White Friday’ |publisher=ArabianBusiness.com |date=2015-12-07 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally it was involved in the exclusive release of the Huawei Honor 6 launch in Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chaaban|first1=Fida|title=Follow The Leader: Ronaldo Mouchawar, Founder And CEO, Souq|url=https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/250860|website=Entrepreneur Middle East}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding and Amazon acquisition ===

In February 2016, Souq.com announced it had received $275m of funding, with a valuation above $1bn, the Arab world's largest ever funding deal, making the e-commerce retailer the region's first [[Unicorn (finance)|unicorn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pr.souq.com/123241-souq-com-raises-more-than-aed-1-billion-usd-275-million-the-largest-e-commerce-funding-in-the-middle-east-history |title=Souq.com raises more than AED 1 Billion (USD 275 million), the largest e-commerce funding in the Middle East history - Souq.com (news) |publisher=Pr.souq.com |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2017, it was made public that Amazon, the American e-commerce site acquired the brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khalil|first1=Ali|title=Amazon buys Middle East’s biggest online retailer|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/amazon-buys-middle-easts-biggest-online-retailer/|website=Times of Israel|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of this deal was not initially disclosed, though an Amazon SEC filing later revealed that the total sum paid was $580m in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khalil|first1=Ali|title=Amazon buys Middle East’s biggest online retailer|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/amazon-buys-middle-easts-biggest-online-retailer/|website=Times of Israel|accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872417000051/amzn-20170331x10q.htm|title=SEC Filing - Amazon.com (Form 10Q; Q1 '17)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sec.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3674">A '''sandwich degree''' is a course specific to the United Kingdom, a four-year [[undergraduate]] course – if it's part of a bachelor's degree – or – if it's part of a master's degree – a five-year [[postgraduate]] course in which students undertake a placement year, or [[internship]] in industry; normally after the second year at university.

==History==
The concept was first articulated in a 1945 report by the Ministry of Education which advocated those attending courses at technical colleges would receive a new kind of education in which theoretical studies and industrial training would be interwoven.&lt;ref name=DAvis1979&gt;{{cite paper|title=The council for national academic awards 1964-74: a study of a validating agency|author=Davis, Martin C.|date=1979|url=https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/7924/3/Thesis-1979-Davis.pdf|publisher=Loughborough University}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|11}} The term "sandwich" was used in a 1950 National Advisory Council on Education for Industry and Commerce report on possible developments within the further education sector.&lt;ref name=DAvis1979/&gt;{{Rp|13}} During the early 1950s, sandwich course proposals were formulated involving the close association of industry and colleges, encouraging movement of students and researchers between academia and industry.&lt;ref name=DAvis1979/&gt;{{Rp|14-15}} Growth of sandwich courses was encouraged by a Ministry of Education [[white paper]] on Technical Education 1956.&lt;ref name="DAvis1979" /&gt;{{Rp|16-17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://technicaleducationmatters.org/2009/08/20/chapter-12-developments-in-the-1950s-and-1960s/|title=Chapter 12 Developments in the 1950s and 1960s|website=technicaleducationmatters.org|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Newcastle Polytechnic]] Bachelor of Arts degree in "Design for Industry" starting in 1953 was an early example of this kind, formerly a three-year "Industrial Design" degree. The new course with two additional terms for industrial placements, extended the degree to four years and popularised the term "sandwich course".

The '''Ukrainian Arbitration Association''' ('''UAA''') ([[:uk:Українська Арбітражна Асоціація|Українська Арбітражна Асоціація]])&amp;nbsp;– is a nonprofit organisation, founded in September 2012 by the initiative group of Ukrainian and foreign experts in international arbitration to unite lawyers (irrespective of their nationality or place of residence) who are professionally engaged or interested in [[international arbitration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalarbitrationreview.com/news/article/30969/ukraines-practitioners-unite/ |title=Ukraine's practitioners unite – News – Arbitration News, Features and Reviews |publisher=Global Arbitration Review |date=2012-11-13 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association is not an arbitration institution. Moreover, it intends to cooperate with arbitration institutions and similar professional associations on the development and promotion of international arbitration. Membership in the Ukrainian Arbitration Association is open to all persons with a law degree, having professional interest in international arbitration and sharing the goals and objectives of the Association. Students can join the Association as associate members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccinstitute.com/?id=23696&amp;newsid=44541 |title=Ukrainian Arbitration Association |publisher=sccinstitute.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key Goals ==
The key goals of the Association include, first of all, the promotion of [[Ukraine]], and [[Kiev]] in particular, as the [[seat of arbitration]], facilitation and support of interest in international arbitration, extension of knowledge and exchange of experience in cross-border dispute resolution, as well as enhancement of cooperation and communication among practitioners in international arbitration around the world.&lt;ref name="cisarbitration1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cisarbitration.com/2012/11/14/ukrainian-arbitration-association-launched-in-kyiv/ |title=Ukrainian Arbitration Association Launched in Kyiv &amp;#124; CIS Arbitration Forum |publisher=Cisarbitration.com |date=2012-11-14 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving these goals requires, ''inter alia'', the improvement of Ukrainian legislation in the field of international arbitration and development of arbitration-friendly court practice. The Association is also planning to carry out a range of educational activities as well as to provide Ukrainian and foreign lawyers with the most rapid and convenient access to information on international arbitration in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boris Cherepaha, boris@cherepaha.org.ua |url=http://www.ujbl.info/news.php?id=181 |title=Ukrainian Arbitration Association: a new step in the development of international arbitration in Ukraine – The Ukrainian Journal of Business Law |publisher=Ujbl.info |date=2012-11-12 |accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
