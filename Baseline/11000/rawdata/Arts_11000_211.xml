'''Albanian comics''', though not well known internationally, were produced mainly by comic-authors from Kosovo. Until recently there was no comic tradition in Albania where comics were seen as junk literature known as ''fumeti'' (literally, little clouds of smoke) supposedly because pop art was prohibited by the dictatorial [[communist]] regime.&lt;ref name="Strip Burek"&gt;[http://www.ljudmila.org/stripcore/burek2/albania.htm Strip Burek]&lt;/ref&gt; Today there is one comic magazine published in Kosovo called ''Leon'', and there is ''Tafë Kusuri'' comic-strip (oldest serial character founded by Agim Qena, and continued by his son Rron Qena) together with ''Garfield'' and ''Calvin and Hobbes''&lt;ref&gt;Trembelat, "...translate and do the lettering for the comic strips (Garfield, Calvin and Hobbes, Baldo and Cleats) published in this daily [Koha Ditore]" [http://www.trembelat.com/work/kd/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709135817/http://www.trembelat.com/work/kd/ |date=2009-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (translated in Albanian) published by ''Koha Ditore'' newspaper.

==Brief history==
In Kosovo comic culture was influenced most notably by the subculture in Yugoslavia, although other countries had influence. The first comic-strip published in Kosovo was ''Tafë Kusuri'' by [[Agim Qena]] (''Rilindja'' newspaper){{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}. There was also an Albanian comic magazine published in [[Pristina]], [[Kosovo]] during the nineties parallel governance, and it was called ''[[Strip Arti]]''. It featured comics created by local and international authors. The magazine was discontinued for the lack of founding. Without "Strip Arti" the comic culture had continued mainly through children and teenager magazines. A magazine dedicated to alternative arts Hapi Alternativ, edited by comics fan [[Petrit Selimi]], published local and foreign comics as well, introducing novel characters such as Hellboy to the Albanian language market. Another mixed content magazine was ''[[Hareja]]'' (published monthly during the nineties by Ibrahim Kadriu) and a weekly children's supplement in ''[[Koha Ditore]]'' called ''[[Vizatori]]'' (published 2000-2005). Printing house "Rrota" published and translated ''Spiderman'', ''Alan Ford'' and ''X-Men'' during 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rrota.com/kush/ |title=Rrota |access-date=2009-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511024730/http://www.rrota.com/kush/ |archive-date=2009-05-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later they published a monthly children's magazine called ''[[Pishpiriku]]'' where a five-page comic (written and illustrated by [[Trembelat]]) was regularly featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.trembelat.com/work/pishpi/ |title=Trembelat |access-date=2009-09-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720130827/http://www.trembelat.com/work/pishpi/ |archive-date=2009-07-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Daily Zeri in 1999 also published original works, and weekly Java in 2003 published ''[[Rrotelat]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianarts.com/aart/artists_preview.php?id=0000000662&amp;ticket=aWQwMDAwMDAwNjYy Albanian Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; (by Edon Muhaxheri), though both have discontinued the practice.

In colloquial Albanian comics are called "[[stripa]]", showing the influence of Yugoslav comic-culture.

Comics are difficult to find to buy in Kosovo. Some of them are found in distribution points of Rilindja newspapers, while fans can also find limited copies in comics-inspired coffeeshop in downtown Prishtina named Stripdepot as well as Dit' e Nat' bookshop-cafe.

==Authors==
Main comic authors in Kosovo: [[Agim Qena]], [[Shpend Kada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albanianarts.com/aart/artists_preview.php?id=0000000744&amp;ticket=aWQwMDAwMDAwNzQ0 Albanian Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binjamen Haxha]], [[Valdet Gashi]], [[Gjon Marku]], [[Gani Sunduri]], [[Gani Jakupi|Gani Jakupi Ramadan Zapluzha]]Fahri Axhanela .&lt;br /&gt;

'''Alicia Florrick''' ([[given name#Name at birth|née]] '''Cavanaugh''')  is the lead character of [[CBS]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[The Good Wife]]'' and is portrayed by [[Julianna Margulies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About The Good Wife - CBS.com|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/about/|website=www.CBS.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Good Wife Cast: Julianna Margulies|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_good_wife/cast/61115/?pg=1|website=www.CBS.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; who has received positive reviews for her performance, winning two [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series|Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Julianna Margulies|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/julianna-margulies#awards|website=www.emmys.com|publisher=Academy of Television Arts and Sciences|accessdate=23 May 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alicia's storyline focuses on her romantic relationships, including the struggle between staying with or divorcing her unfaithful husband, Peter Florrick, or pursuing other relationships with other men, most notably Will Gardner. Other storylines include Alicia's transformation from "the victim" to "the victimizer", her dealing with the negative consequences of her actions, her devotion to her children among political turmoil, her obsession with power, and her growth in confidence.

==Character biography==

=== Background ===
Alicia Cavanaugh was born in 1967 to Veronica Cavanaugh ([[Stockard Channing]]) and an unknown father, from whom Veronica separated from prior to her first appearance in the series in [[The Good Wife (season 4)|Season 4]]. She is the older sister of Owen Cavanaugh ([[Dallas Roberts]]), whom she loves very much, having grown close during their parents' separation, despite his tendency to meddle in her personal life. Her mother, now going by the name of Veronica Loy, makes her first appearance in "A Defense of Marriage" during Season 4, where it is revealed that Alicia had become estranged from her mother due to her various remarriages following her separation from Alicia's father as well as her infidelity. Veronica never afforded Alicia a motherly connection, and her father was never given the opportunity to, leading Alicia to become emotionally withdrawn, a tendency she has demonstrated frequently throughout the series. Ironically, Alicia has engaged in several of the same practices as her mother that she disapproves of, including infidelity, various relationships, and estrangement from her children.

Alicia attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]], where she graduated at the top of her class in 1992, despite her tendency to sleep during lectures she didn’t find interesting. While attending, she met and befriended [[Will Gardner]] ([[Josh Charles]]), who graduated alongside her. During their time in law school, Will and Alicia had an unofficial relationship, but never evolved into a proper relationship due to their "bad timing". Following her graduation from Georgetown, she became a junior litigate at mid-sized Chicago law firm Crozier, Abrams &amp; Abbott, where she clocked the most billable hours of any associate. While working there, she meets Peter Florrick ([[Chris Noth]]), another lawyer with political ambitions, whom she marries a few years later and adopts the Florrick surname. Alicia doesn’t share Peter's political ambition, but accommodates his, resigning from Crozier, Abrams &amp; Abbott to become a political "good wife" where she acts as a political instrument during campaigns and fundraisers. For this role, she receives the moniker of "Saint Alicia", a label she initially finds irritating, but later comes to think of as humorous. The two eventually move to Highland Parks, an upscale neighborhood in the Chicago suburbs where she and Peter raise Zachary "Zach" Florrick ([[Graham Phillips (actor)|Graham Phillips]]), and Grace Florrick ([[Makenzie Vega]]). She befriends her neighbors, but quickly becomes ostracized following a highly publicized sex scandal concerning her husband, the incumbent State's Attorney for [[Cook County, Illinois]].

Months prior to the series, a political rival of Peter's, Glenn Childs ([[Titus Welliver]]), who had his sights set on Peter's job, leaks a sex tape of Peter and Amber Madison ([[Kim Shaw]]), a Chicago escort. The tape raises questions over whether Peter abused his office, with accusations of trading political favors for sexual services and material items being lobbied against him. The story first breaks on CNBC, and Alicia immediately shields her children from all news stations to shield them from the news. Peter resigns in order to avoid impeachment, but is ultimately convicted of charges of corruption, leading Alicia to believed that she, as well as her children, had become collateral damage in a political feud between Peter and Childs. Upon his resignation, Alicia slaps Peter for victimizing her and their children.

Having been out of the workforce for nearly a decade, and left with no income, Alicia assumes the role of breadwinner of the Florrick family. Her, Zach, and Grace move to a condo in inner Chicago while she searches for a new job, which she has trouble doing due to her family's damaged reputation. Eventually, she reconnects with Will, who is now a name partner at Chicago law firm Stern, Lockhart, &amp; Gardner. He offers her a job at his firm, which she accepts, but soon comes to learn that the position offered to her was already filled by a younger, [[Harvard]]-educated lawyer, Cary Agos ([[Matt Czuchry]]). Being a friend of Will's, him and another name partner, [[Diane Lockhart]] ([[Christine Baranski]]), organize an arrangement by which the two will compete for the job and, in six months, one will be laid off.

=== Work Life ===
Alicia is designated the role by Diane of being "the branch between the legal and political", using her husband, who then resides in a county prison, to solicit information on cases she is working, much to the displeasure of judges, who view this practice as unethical. She is shown to be a competent lawyer, which allows her to keep her job at Lockhart/Gardner, resulting in a vindictive Cary being laid off. As a consequence, Alicia becomes the target of attacks by Cary, now working under Glenn at the State's Attorney's office.

Lockhart/Gardner enters financial trouble in the fourth season, finding itself hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. Will and Diane hire an accountant (Clark Hayden) to ensure the firm remains solvent, but he soon becomes overzealous in his efforts and over-invested in the firm's financial survival that he attempts to remove Will and Diane as name partner following their inability to repay debts to their shareholders in a timely manner. In an effort to quickly raise capital for their repayments, Will and Diane offer Alicia a partnership at the firm. Believing this to be a reward for her efforts and success, Alicia is overjoyed to become a partner, but becomes furious when she learned that this had only been an attempt to raise money, as a partnership had been offered to all fourth-year associates, including a newly rehired Cary.

Cary proposed that he and Alicia begin their own firm, and take the other fourth year associates, as well as one of the in-house investigators, with them. While initially rejecting this offer, she begins to grow sympathetic to this idea due to her contempt for other employees at Lockhart/Gardner. Beginning in season five, Alicia and Cary conspire to leave Lockhart/Gardner and poach several big-name clients for themselves. While downloading documents for ongoing cases they intend to continue litigating at Florrick/Agos, Diane discovers her plot, and informs Will, who confiscates her laptop and cellphone. Will promptly fires Alicia and Cary, as well as all others who have been attempting to poach Lockhart/Gardner clients.

Will, betrayed due to the generosity he extended to Alicia, becomes reinvigorated, and initiates an expansion of Lockhart/Gardner into the east and west coast. However, Alicia utilizes Peter, who had been released from prison and subsequently elected governor of Illinois, to continue poaching clients. In one instance, Peter threatens to apply sales tax to the Internet and Internet-based companies in a subtle warning to ChumHum (a spoof of [[Google]]) that, should they not hire Florrick/Agos as their civil litigator firm, he will hurt their business. However, following Will's death, Diane and Alicia and Cary reunite to form Florrick/Agos &amp; Lockhart.

Alicia returns to work at Lockhart, Agos, &amp; Lee following her withdrawal from the state's attorney race, and on her first day back, her former coworkers stall her in a room so that they may poach remaining clients that left the firm when Alicia resigned. When Alicia discovers this, she proposes starting a law firm with Finn Polmar ([[Matthew Goode]]), an unofficial significant other. These plans fall through when Finn leaves town, so Alicia, in search of employment, becomes a bond court lawyer. There, she meets and befriends Lucca Quinn ([[Cush Jumbo]]), a fellow bond court lawyer. The two begin their own law firm, but this is eventually dissolved when both of them are hired by Lockhart, Agos, &amp; Lee. Diane, over the objections of Cary, makes Alicia a name partner in a bid to make a female-led firm. Cary, after a feud with Diane over Alicia's position, resigns to become a guest lecturer at a local college, sick of office politics he has been embroiled in over the past three years. Diane and Alicia eventually remove David Lee ([[Zach Grenier]]) as a name partner, and the two become the name partners of a female-led law firm.

Alicia has made no appearances on ''The Good Fight'', but has been revealed to have resigned from Florrick &amp; Lockhart within a year after the firm's readjustment.

=== Politics ===
The name of the show is a reference to Alicia's position within Peter's life: the political good wife. Her role is solely to bolster Peter's political career, a job she continues to do following Peter's release from prison. However, while she tolerates the political spotlight, she refuses to let her children be exploited so the same purposes, which often leads to conflict between her and Eli Gold ([[Alan Cumming]]), Peter's campaign manager, who sees Zach and Grace as effective political props.

At the end of season five, Eli, now Peter's chief of staff, proposes she run for state's attorney of Cook County, the office her husband previously occupied. While initially rejecting this offer, Alicia acquiesces due to her objections regarding the incumbent states attorney's abuse of power. The incumbent eventually departs from the race, and Alicia, instead, runs opposed to Frank Prady ([[David Hyde Pierce]]), a television legal analyst. Initially, Alicia and Prady form an alliance in which they both agree not to resort to personal attacks. However, both renege of their promises when Prady criticizes Alicia's ethics and accuses her of being open to political favors for her past clients and when Alicia released an ad that accused Prady of being a closeted-Republican, as well as insinuating that he may be [[gay]]. Alicia is also seen lying to influential Cook County figures in order to secure their endorsements. These lies included denying knowledge that Lemond Bishop ([[Mike Colter]]), infamous drug kingpin and [[serial killer]], donated to her campaign, when she had already been made aware of the fact that Bishop had set up her PAC, as well as suggesting that Prady is gay to a [[homophobia|homophobic]] Democratic donor in order to acquire funds.

Alicia eventually wins the election, but is forced to resign by Mike Landau ([[Mike Pniewski]]), head of the Illinois Democratic Party. After reports of voter fraud surface, Landau reveals to Alicia that he rigged the voting machines in order to preserve the Democratic supermajority in the Illinois state legislature. However, in order to maintain the façade of a fair election, Landau forces Alicia to resign.

In the seventh season, Peter runs for president, in hopes of becoming [[Hillary Clinton]]’s vice president, in which Alicia continues to support him. However, Peter comes in third in the [[Iowa caucuses]], diminishing any hope of him being tapped for the nomination, signaling Alicia’s exit from politics.

=== Finale ===
The seventh season follows Peter’s prosecution, once again, for corruption, accused of destroying evidence to secure funds from a wealthy Democratic donor, whose son was on trial, during his tenure as state’s attorney. Alicia agrees not to forestall their divorce until after the trial as to not exude the notion that he may be guilty. However, Alicia intends to pursue a divorce if Peter is acquitted, but any such separation would be jeopardized should Peter be convicted.

Desperate to acquit Peter so she may divorce him in favor of pursuing her relationship with Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), Alicia, Diane, and Lucca pursue the strategy of proving Peter had no reason to discard the evidence because the donor’s son wasn’t guilty. In doing so, Alicia brings Diane’s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole), a ballistics expert, to testify that the bullets likely didn’t come from the donor’s son’s gun. This testimony is immediately undercut by another ballistics expert named Holly. Alicia, seeking to refute this testimony, calls Kurt back to the stand, and pressures him to contradict this testimony. But when Kurt refuses, Lucca accuses (at Alicia's request) him of protecting Holly due to an affair they had while Kurt was married to Diane.

Diane, hurt and betrayed, blames Alicia for destroying her marriage. After attending Peter’s resignation, she confronts Alicia and, without saying anything, slaps Alicia and walks away. This scene was significant to writer Robert and Michelle King, who saw this as symbolizing Alicia’s transition from being the "victimized", having her life ruined by her unfaithful and corrupt husband, to the "victimizer" having destroyed Kurt and Diane's marriage so she may pursue her own relationship. In effect, by the finale, Alicia had become Peter.

== Reception ==
The characterization of Alicia has received critical acclaim, with many favorable comparisons being drawn between her, ''[[The Sopranos]]''{{'}} [[Tony Soprano]], ''[[Breaking Bad]]''{{'}}s [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]], and ''[[Mad Men]]''{{'}}s [[Don Draper]]. Writing for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Joanna Robinson writes, "While Alicia took her final bow in an era when the ice zombies on ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and the sweaty zombies on ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' rule pop-culture, Alicia Florrick belongs to the time of Walter White, Don Draper, and the other stars of the golden age of the TV antihero." However, Robinson highlights the difference between Alicia and other anti-heroes, writing "Alicia ends up more callous than either Walter White (who at least went out apologizing to [[Skyler White|Skyler]] and saving [[Jesse Pinkman|Pinkman]]) or Don Draper (who, hey, bought the world a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]!). Alicia throws Diane right under the bus in a way that the Kings describe as 'collateral damage.' The most charitable interpretation we can come ups with is that at least Alicia was partially thinking of Grace as she did it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Joanna|last=Robinson|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/05/good-wife-recap-series-finale-end|title=Why The Good Wife Creators Think That Finale Was a Tragedy|publisher=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=May 8, 2016|accessdate=November 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Margulies has received critical acclaim for her performance as Alicia Florrick. In his initial review of the series, Rob Owen of ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'' praised Margulies' performance, calling the show "a terrific showcase for actress Julianna Margulies, who elevates the already-good material with her perceptive, open performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rob|last=Owen|title=Verdict: 'Good Wife' best new drama bet of fall season|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv-radio/2009/09/22/Verdict-Good-Wife-best-new-drama-bet-of-fall-season/stories/200909220189|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=September 22, 2009|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daniel Fienberg of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' also praised Margulies' performance, writing that "the excellence of Margulies' performance has rested in her refusal to make Alicia easy to understand, in keeping up a complicated wall and choosing those few moments in which to expose emotional cracks." And later compared her performance to those of [[James Gandolfini]] on ''[[The Sopranos]]'' or [[Bryan Cranston]] on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', writing that "Margulies' performance sometimes put Alicia in that Tony Soprano/Walter White/Don Draper category of cable anti-heroes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel|last=Fienberg|title=Critic's Notebook: 'The Good Wife' Leaves Behind an Imperfect, Admirable Legacy|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/critics-notebook-good-wife-leaves-891008 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=May 5, 2016|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accolades ===
For her performance, Margulies won a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], a [[Golden Globe Award]], two [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]], and a [[Television Critics Association Award]].

'''Bird of Happiness''' ({{lang-rus|пти́ца сча́стья|p=ˈptʲitsə ˈɕːasʲtʲjə}}) is the traditional North [[Russia]]n wooden [[toy]], carved in the shape of a bird. It was invented by [[Pomors]], the inhabitants of the coasts of the [[White Sea|White]] and [[Barents Sea]]s. The Bird of Happiness is made without glue or other fasteners, by carving thin petals for the bird’s wings and tail and then using a special method of spreading and curving them, also found in other products of the North Russian handicraft. The amulet is usually made of pine, fir, spruce, or [[Siberia]]n cedar. It is suspended inside a house, guarding the family hearth and well-being.

Wood chip bird is a carved wooden item with thin wavy plumage of the wings. The plumage and tail of these birds were usually made of split pine, that is why the birds were called "wood chip". The place of the wooden toy origin in the form of a bird is the Arkhangelsk region. It’s also called a "Pomor dove".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305102039/http://ushankarussia.com/wood-chip-bird-bird-of-happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legends wood chip bird brings many benefits to the house. In addition, this bird is the symbol of the sun. The bird was hung in the house as the hearth and well-being keeper. These birds used to hang in almost every home of a farmer in the icon corner, above the dining table, opposite the Russian stove or over a child's cradle. From the movement of warm air they revolved in a circle.

'''The history of the bird''': In the far North in Arkhangelsk province, there lived a hunter. Winter in the North is long and cold: snowstorm, blizzard and freezing cold. This year the winter stayed for a long time and cooled the hunter’s house completely and the hunter's younger son fell ill.  He was ill for a long time, got very thin and pale; neither doctors nor wise men could help him.  The hunter grieved. He felt sorry for the little boy. The hunter asked his son: “What do you want?” The boy whispered quietly: “I want to see the sun...”. And where can you get the sun in the North? The hunter was lost in thoughts, heated the furnace to warm the house. But the fire is not the sun.

Suddenly the hunter noticed a splinter that was glowing in the fire. A smile lit up his face; and he knew how to help his son.
The hunter was working all the night. He carved a wood bird, made wood chips, decorated them with fretwork. He hung the bird above his son’s bed, and the bird suddenly came to life: it began spinning and moving in the hot air that was coming from the furnace.
The boy woke up, smiled and exclaimed: “Well, here is the sun!”
From that day on, the child began to recover rapidly. So, miraculous power was attributed to the wood chip bird and it was called the “Holy spirit”, the guardian of children, the symbol of family happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160305102039/http://ushankarussia.com/wood-chip-bird-bird-of-happiness]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States''''' is an anthropological study of childbirth by [[Brigitte Jordan]] published in 1978.

== Background ==
Throughout the book Jordan explores the birth practices of four different cultures: the [[Yucatán|Yucatan]], [[Holland]], [[Sweden]], and the [[United States]]. In chapter four, she explains in detail why she decided to focus her study on childbirth: "I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=0-88133-717-X|location=|pages=93|quote=I never chose to study birth. In some sense, birth chose me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Jordan's work argues against romanticized perspectives of "early, less complex societies"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burtch|first=Brian E.|date=1981-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures: A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden and the United States|jstor=3340150|journal=The Canadian Journal of Sociology / Cahiers canadiens de sociologie|volume=6|issue=4|pages=547–549|doi=10.2307/3340150}}&lt;/ref&gt; that present childbirth as uncomplicated. Instead, she suggests that childbirth is a life-altering event in all societies, but can be understood differently by using a [[cross-cultural]] perspective.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Four-Cultures-Crosscultural-Investigation/dp/088133717X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1486655147&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=birth+in+four+cultures|title=Birth in Four Cultures : A Crosscultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|last2=Davis-Floyd|first2=Robbie|date=1992-11-01|publisher=Waveland Pr Inc|isbn=9780881337174|edition=4th|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their edited collection, ''Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives'', [[Robbie Davis-Floyd|Robbie E. Davis-Floyd]] and [[Carolyn Sargent|Carolyn F. Sargent]] praised the book for focusing "anthropological attention on childbirth as a subject worthy of in-depth ethnographic fieldwork and cross-cultural comparison, and that inspired many others to enter the field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis-Floyd|first1=Robbie E.|last2=Sargent|first2=Carolyn F.|title=Childbirth and Authoritative Knowledge: Cross-Cultural Perspectives|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520207858|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan argues that birth should be examined utilizing a biosocial approach, which recognizes birth as a biological process that is shaped by social and cultural practices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States|last=Jordan|first=Brigitte|publisher=Waveland Press, Inc.|year=1993|isbn=9780881337174|editor-last=Davis-Floyd|editor-first=Robbie|location=Long Grove, IL|pages=xv-xvi|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a concern for medical safety, Jordan also focuses on "maternal attitudes and participation in birth, the birth setting, and the mother's selection of birth attendants."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Ronald|year=1980|title=Birth in Four Cultures|url=|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=168|pages=386–387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan uses her observations in the field, alongside academic anthropological sources to analyze birth as it occurs in four different societies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Field method ==
As an ethnographer, Jordan and her collaborator Nancy Fuller incorporated qualitative and quantitative approaches to compare health policies and statistical data from the four birthing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=648585|title=Reviewed Work: Birth in Four Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Investigation of Childbirth in Yucatan, Holland, Sweden, and the United States by Brigitte Jordan|last=MacCormack|first=Carol|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan employed formal and informal interviews based on her [[participant observation]]. In particular, she used technological means of data collection, such as videotaping and tape recording devices, to record and review her findings and produce high-quality documentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jordan reflects upon the methodological and ethical responsibility in her research to justify the decision-making process of the biosocial framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZArPH0nFGo0C&amp;pg=PA233&amp;lpg=PA233&amp;dq=brigitte+jordan+and+interviewing+in+birth+of+four+cultures+4th+edition&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kly05PRli-&amp;sig=I0qpb5Z0wky8BCG6cfJYVWd884w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT6-zPwIHSAhUM0oMKHZ2QAQoQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=brigitte%20jordan%20and%20interviewing%20in%20birth%20of%20four%20cultures%204th%20edition&amp;f=false|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception and recognition ==

=== Honors and awards ===
In 1980, Jordan received the [[Margaret Mead Award]] in recognition for ''Birth in Four Cultures''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Academic reviews ===
While much of the reception for ''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been overwhelmingly positive, some anthropologists have criticized Jordan for her exclusive focus on the social aspects of birth without much attention to religious or ideological concerns in her research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Austin|first=Martha A.|date=1979-01-01|title=Review of Birth in Four Cultures|jstor=648398|journal=Medical Anthropology Newsletter|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' was one of the first [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] to study cross-cultural systems of birth. Jordan argued that economics, culture, and politics affect birth as a system, which led to the beginning of the sub-category of anthropology called Anthropology of Birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://surface.syr.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ant|title=Perspectives on the Anthropology of Birth|last=Van Hollen|first=Cecilia|date=1994|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=1994|dead-url=|access-date=February 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Birth in Four Cultures'' has been used to advocate for preserving midwifery care in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.midwiferytoday.com/articles/globalissues.asp|title=Anthropological Perspectives on Global Issues in Midwifery|last=Davis-Floyd|first=Robbie|date=2000|website=Midwifery Today|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Updates and editions ==
There have been four editions of the book in 1978, 1980, 1983, and 1993, including updates to the material from Jordan's continued research on the subject. The 4th edition was revised and expanded by anthropologist Robbie Davis-Floyd.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Logo fill 17.png|thumb|right|CLUI logo]]
'''The Center for Land Use Interpretation''' ('''CLUI''')&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Center for Land Use Interpretation|url = http://clui.org/|website = clui.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-profit research organization, based on [[Venice Boulevard]] in the Westside [[Palms, Los Angeles|Palms]] neighborhood of the [[Los Angeles, California|city of Los Angeles]], in southern [[California]].

== Background ==
The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) was founded in 1994 by Matthew Coolidge, and is a non-profit research and education organization that involves exploring, examining, and understanding land and landscape issues. The Center employs a variety of methods to this end, engaging in research, classification, extrapolation, and exhibition. The mission statement of the CLUI is to "increase and diffuse knowledge about how the nation's lands are apportioned, utilized, and perceived."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clui.org/section/about-center.|title=About the Center|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=The Center for Land Use Interpretation|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization produces exhibitions about land use phenomenology in the USA, and displays them at its exhibit locations and at other museum and non-commercial and educational venues as well. The CLUI produces publications, online resources, tours, lectures, and other public programs across the country. Activities of the Center are summarized and discussed in its annual newsletter, ''The Lay of the Land'', available in print to subscribers as well as online. The CLUI's main office is in Los Angeles, on [[Venice Boulevard]], across from downtown [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], where it operates a display space open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.afterall.org/journal/issue.13/administrative.sublime.or.center.land.use.interpre.|title=The Administrative Sublime, or The Center for Land Use Interpretation|last=|first=|date=2006|website=|publisher=Afterall Journal|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates other facilities and interpretive sites in the USA. CLUI is also the lead agency for the establishment of the [[American Land Museum]], a network of exhibition sites in various interpretive zones across the country, which together form a dynamic portrait of the national landscape. According to Coolidge, the "man made landscape is a cultural inscription that can help us better understand who we are and what we are doing."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowlton.osu.edu/event/matthew-coolidge-center-for-land-use-interpretation.|title=Matthew Coolidge-CLUI|last=|first=|date=October 2011|website=|publisher=Knowlton School, Ohio State University|accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither an [[environmental organization]] nor an [[artist collective]], CLUI resists categorization by maintaining a diverse, eclectic program of activities that invite a closer examination of "humankind's interaction with the Earth's surface." Writer and curator [[Lucy Lippard]] suggests the CLUI occupies “a tantalizing liminal space (that) has opened up between disciplines, between the arts, geography, history, archeology, sociology.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefalmouthconvention.com/keynote-lucy-lippard.|title=Lucy Lippard, Imagine Being Here Now: Towards a Multicentered Exhibition Process|last=|first=|date=May 2010|website=|publisher=The Falmouth Convention|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culture writer Doug Harvey calls the Center, known for its “multidisciplinary examinations of human/landscape interaction, 'uncategorizable'.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-big-nowhere-2131329.|title=Doug Harvey, The Big Nowhere|last=|first=|date=November 1999|website=|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to CLUI programs, such as the 2008 ''Post Consumed'' exhibit and bus tour as “subtly infused with formal beauty and wit…unobtrusively informed by a patchwork of art historical, contemporary theoretical, sociological and geopolitical concerns and brimming with new information you don’t know is here until the ride home.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/wading-in-the-waste-stream-with-the-center-for-land-use-interpretation-2155326.|title=Doug Harvey, Wading in the Waste Stream with the Center for Land Use Interpretation|last=|first=|date=August 2008|website=|publisher=LA Weekly|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Los Angeles Times]] architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne, the CLUI's activities “all tell some version of the same story: how we shape and find meaning in the physical landscape around us, whether it’s through oil exploration, architecture, map-making or freeway building.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/01/architecture-review-centers-of-the-usa-at-the-center-for-land-use-interpretation.html.|title=Christopher Hawthorne, Architecture review: 'Centers of the USA' at the Center for Land Use Interpretation|last=|first=|date=January 2012|website=|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CLUI specializes in what writer Nicola Twilley describes as a “brand of perceptual revelation”–“in which a previously overlooked site is made not only visible, but also legible as a guide to understanding larger, nationwide systems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.good.is/articles/finding-tarzan-at-the-sanitation-department.|title=Nicola Twilley, Finding Tarzan at the Sanitation Department|last=|first=|date=April 2011|website=|publisher=Good Magazine|accessdate=September 27, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and projects ==
The CLUI also executes exhibitions, research projects, and public programs. The Center's programs and projects cover many types of land uses in the USA, including those related to agriculture, energy, industry, mining, communication, waste management, water resources, transportation, commerce, housing, recreation, and defense and preparedness.

== Online resources ==

The CLUI makes a collection of "unusual and exemplary" land use sites in the United States available online, through the [http://www.clui.org/ludb Land Use Database]. Site-specific images in the database are taken by members of the CLUI, and are attributed to the CLUI Photo Archive. Another archive of non-site-specific images taken by members of the CLUI, known as the [http://www.clui.org/mca/index Morgan Cowles Archive], is also available online.

==Works==
Many of Jordan's works are created from photographs of [[waste|garbage]] and mass consumption, a serendipitous technique which started when he visited an industrial yard to look at patterns of color and order. Jordan uses everyday commonalitie such as a plastic cup and defines the blind unawareness involved in American consumerism. His work, while often unsettling, is a message about unconscious behaviors in our everyday lives, leaving it to the viewer to draw conclusions about the inevitable consequences which will arise from our habits.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/arts/story.html?id=3e093270-22f3-4c17-851b-8d86da709455 Beautifully ugly photography]".

[[Image:Village2.JPG|thumb|250px|A [[Department 56]] ''New England Series'' village display.]]
A '''Christmas village''' (or '''putz''') is a decorative, miniature-scale [[village]] often set up during the [[Christmas]] season. These villages are rooted in the elaborate Christmas traditions of the [[Moravian church]], a Protestant denomination. Mass-produced cardboard Christmas villages became popular in the [[United States]] during the early and mid-20th century, while porcelain versions became popular in the later part of the century.

==Origins==
[[File:Decorative Christmas village 2.JPG|thumb|200px|A Christmas village set atop a table]]
The tradition of decorative Christmas villages is rooted in the holiday traditions of the [[Moravian church]], a Protestant denomination with early settlements in [[Salem, North Carolina]] and [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]].  In American [[Moravian church|Moravian]] homes, the construction of a [[nativity scene]], or putz, at the base of a [[Christmas tree]] was a very common holiday activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://lancasteronline.com/features/faith_values/the-putz-at-lititz-moravian-church-is-much-more-than/article_8f7124b2-a505-11e5-abca-d3bba1f6c3f1.html |title=The putz at Lititz Moravian Church is much more than a Nativity scene |newspaper=LancasterOnline |publisher=[[LNP Media Group]] |date=December 15, 2015 |first=Laura |last=Knowles |access-date=November 14, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was derived from the German verb ''[[wikt:putzen|putzen]]'', which means "to clean" or "to decorate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/putz |title=Definition of Putz |website=Merriam-Webster |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These nativity scenes soon became very elaborate, and often included sawdust or fine dirt spread to represent roads leading to the manger; stones and fresh moss to represent grottos or caves; and sticks and branches to represent miniature trees. These details were in addition to the carved wooden figures that represented the [[Holy Family]], animals, shepherds, and other traditional nativity figures. 

Although initially placed beneath the Christmas tree, by the early 19th century a family's "putz" might have also been found on the fireplace mantel, side tables, and other prominent places within the home. These expanded scenes might include other stories from the [[Bible]]. The story of [[Noah's Ark]], an especially popular subject for a putz, could result in the arranging of several hundred carved animals wending their way towards the ark.

By the mid-19th century, more secular figures and scene elements were being added to the putz. In many homes, the putz took more time and energy than the decoration of the family Christmas tree. Separate areas were developed with different themes; spreading outward from the Nativity scene were other farms or village scenes, which had a way of growing larger and more elaborate every year. Eventually, toy trains were added to these miniature worlds.

==Mass ==

After [[World War II]], several Japanese companies started mass-producing cardboard or paper houses, churches, and other buildings. These small buildings usually had holes in the back or the bottom through which Christmas lights were placed to provide illumination. The buildings had tiny colored cellophane windows and were decorated with mica-dusted roofs to give the appearance of snow. Since these buildings were made of inexpensive material and were widely available throughout the [[United States]], they became a very popular Christmas decoration.

==Modern villages==
[[Image:ChristmasVillage2008.jpg|thumb|left|A modern Christmas Village]]
In the 1970s, [[ceramic]] or [[porcelain]] Christmas villages were introduced and started to gain popularity. [[Department 56]] was one of the first companies to make these buildings and remain amongst the most well-known. Other companies, such as [[Lemax]], have also produced similar villages, and there are numerous other brands sold. In Europe, [[Luville]] and [[Dickensville]] are established brands. Drugstores and dollar stores now often carry much smaller buildings, which are typically not as well-painted. Unpainted buildings are also sometimes available at craft stores.

Christmas village buildings are not usually made to consistent relative scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christmasvillages.co.uk/choosing-a-train-set-for-your-christmas-village/ |title=Choosing A Train Set For Your Christmas Village |author=HRBuzz |date=September 20, 2015 |website=Christmas Villages |access-date=November 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A church building might well be ten times the height of an ordinary house in reality but this would make very cumbersome models and look odd within a Christmas village display. It is only necessary for the church building to be noticeably taller than the house, to give it an imposing stature.

Like many other Christmas traditions, the notion of a village to celebrate a holiday has spread to other holidays, with a few companies making [[Halloween]] and [[Easter]] villages.

'''''Conversations with God''''' ('''''CwG''''') is a sequence of books written by [[Neale Donald Walsch]]. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and [[God]] answers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsch|first=Neale Donald|authorlink=Neale Donald Walsch|title=Conversations with God|year=1995|type=Paperback|ISBN=0-399-14278-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first book of the ''Conversations with God'' series, ''Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue'', was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on ''[[The New York Times Best Sellers List]]'' for 137 weeks.  The succeeding volumes in the nine book series also appeared prominently on the List.

In an interview with [[Larry King]], Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn't working.  After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: "Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zechner/cwg/lkl-ndw.html Neale Donald Walsch on CNS's ''Larry King Live''] (April 7th, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though when he turned around he saw no one there, Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down.  The ensuing dialogue became the ''Conversations with God'' books. When asked in a recent interview how does he ‘open up’ to God these days, Neale stated “I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poeticmind.co.uk/creative-thoughts/being-at-one-neale-donald-walsch-interview-with-gil-dekel-phd-part-1-of-3  'Being at One': Neale Donald Walsch Interview with Gil Dekel, PhD (Part 1 of 3), Paragraph 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basis of the dialogue ==
Containing nearly 3,000 pages of material in total, the series presents a large number of ideas.  The second and third books in the original trilogy deal with political and social issues.

=== CwG's basic messages ===
In ''Friendship with God'', Walsch writes that God presents four concepts which are central to the entire dialogue:

# We are all one.
# There's enough.
# There's nothing we have to do.
# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.
# God is a collective, that is, there are many Gods and Goddesses who have been delegated some work each, respectively.

[[Existence]] is essentially [[Nondualism|non-dual]] in nature. At the highest level there is no separation between anything and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God.  The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us.  The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto Itself, has no need of anything and therefore has no requirements of [[World population|humanity]]. The final concept puts an end to our need to always be right. Given that we have and are everything, and there's nothing we ''have'' to do, there are an ''infinite'' number of ways to experience this, not just the ''one'' way we may have chosen so far.

According to the books, God recommends many [[Economy|economic]] and [[social]] changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world, it recommends that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of [[reincarnation]] and the existence of life on other planets.

=== God's motive for creation ===
In Walsch's first dialogue, God notes that "knowing" and "experiencing" oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully, without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love, since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in [[myriad]] ways because everything is one.

This present creation then, in Walsch's viewpoint, is established by and within God, so that [[sentience]] can exist which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than just "know" itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going, for there is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules, because all experience is subjective, and is chosen. But within this, there are ways that (it is stated and implied) people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, actions are either working or they are not working. A thing is either [[wikt:functional|functional]] or [[dysfunctional]], not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over "time" and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.

=== Nature of the dialogue ===

Book 1 (page 4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth, rather words are symbols, and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their own inner knowing or intuition to determine their own truth while reading the book, or any other book. Though the books bear the title ''Conversations with God'' and the author states in book 1 that he is "taking dictation" from God, the 'dialogue' is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to whom does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that really moves you), and not necessarily through words 'spoken' by God to a person. "All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me." (CwG1, page 58). [[Jesus]] is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, "I am the way and the life, follow me". Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God - Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference) - rather than become his followers. Jesus is supposed to have said, "I and the Father (God) are one and you are my brethren". This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter20, pgs. 329-330). Jesus is said to have said, "without the father (God), I am nothing". The father of all is pure thought which is the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter11, pg. 180). In Book 3 of ''Conversations with God'' (1998), by [[Neale Donald Walsch]], it is mentioned that [[Mahavatar Babaji]] may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], Jesus and other humans.&lt;ref&gt;Walsch, Neale Donald, ''Conversations with God: an uncommon dialog (Book #3)'', page 95.&lt;/ref&gt; When Neil asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into a patriarchy. It was through fear that the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday, not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church. One had to attend one particular church - if you went to a church of a different denomination that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control, pure and simple, using fear. The amazing thing is it worked. People will always believe in hell and in a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man &amp;mdash; ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving and vengeful. In the past, most people could not imagine a God who might rise above all of that so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the terrible vengeance of the Lord. It was as if people could not trust themselves to be good and act appropriately, on their own by their own built in reasons. So they had to create a religion that taught the doctrine of an angry, retributive God in order to keep themselves in line. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else&amp;mdash;and along came the reincarnationists saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don't worry. Do the best you can. Don't become so paralysed with fear that you can't budge. Promise yourself to do better and get on with it. Naturally, the early Church couldn't hear of such a thing that did two things. First, it denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical, then it created the sacrament of confession. Confession could do for the Church goer what reincarnation promised. That is, give him another chance. There was a catch however - this absolution could not come directly from God, it had to flow through the church whose priests pronounced penances which had to be performed. These were usually prayers which were required of the sinner. So now you had two reasons to keep up church membership. The church found confession to be such a good drawing card that soon it declared to be a sin not to go to confession. Everybody had to do it at least once a year. If they didn't, God would have another reason to be angry. More and more rules - many of them arbitrary and capricious - began to be promulgated by the church, each rule having the power of God's eternal condemnation behind it, unless, of course, failure was confessed and then the person was forgiven by God and condemnation avoided. That lead to another problem. People figured out that this must mean they could do anything as long as they confessed it. The church was in a quandary. Fear had left the hearts of the people. Church attendance and membership dropped. People came to confess once a year, said their penances, were absolved of their sins and went on with their lives. There was no question about it. A way had to be found to strike fear into the heart again, so purgatory was invented. Purgatory was described as a place something like hell, but not eternal. This new doctrine declared that God would make you suffer for your sins even if you confessed them. Under the doctrine, a certain amount of suffering was decreed by God for each nonperfect soul, based on the number and type of sins committed. There were mortal sins and venial sins. Mortal sins would send you right to hell if not confessed before death. Once more, Church attendance shot up, collections were up, too and especially contributions&amp;mdash;for the doctrine of purgatory could buy one's way out of the suffering. According to the church's teaching, one could receive a special indulgence but not directly from God - only from an official of the church. These special indulgences freed one from the suffering in purgatory which they had earned with their sins or at least part of it. These reprieves were granted to very few like those who made a  huge contribution to the church. For a really huge sum, one could obtain a plenary indulgence. This meant no time in purgatory at all - it was a non-stop ticket straight to heaven. This special favor from God was available for even fewer. Royalty, perhaps and the super rich. The amount of money, jewels and land given to the church in exchange for these plenary indulgences was enormous. The exclusivity of this brought great frustration and resentment to the masses. The poorest peasant had no hope of gaining a bishop's indulgence and so the rank and file lost faith in the system with attendance threatening to drop once again. Then they brought in the novena candles. People could come to the church and light a novena candle for the poor souls in purgatory and by saying a novena (a series of prayers in a particular order that took some time to complete), they could reduce by many years the sentence of the dearly departed, extricating them from purgatory sooner than God would otherwise have allowed. They couldn't do anything for themselves but at least they could pray for mercy for the departed. Of course, it would be helpful if a coin or two were dropped through the slot for each candle lit. A lot of little candles were flickering behind a lot of red glass and a lot of pesos and pennies were being dropped into a lot of tin boxes in an attempt to get God to ease up on the suffering being inflicted on the souls in purgatory (Book 3, Chapter7, pgs. 126-130).

== Parallels in other belief systems ==
In the dialogue many philosophical ideas are presented that had already been advanced earlier by major Eastern and Western thinkers, but Walsch presents the information in language for modern readers and does not specifically cite any of these philosophers. In fact, Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the latter volumes, Walsch and "God" acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity, but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly, and put into this cohesive unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch's writings are also mirrored within other well known spiritual writings and traditions:

* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. ([[The Law of One]]/[[Advaita]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization ([[Hinduism]]/' '[[Bhagavad-Gita]]/[[Sikhism]]'' ).
* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect ([[Rousseau]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know ([[Hinduism]]/[[Plato]]/[[Sikhism]]).
* Physical reality is an illusion ([[Hinduism]]/ [[Buddhism]]'s concept of ''[[Maya (illusion)|maya]]''/[[Sikhism]]).
* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (''[[Tao Te Ching]]'').
* God is everything. ([[Hinduism]] / [[Spinoza]] / [[Brahman]]/[[Sikhism]])
* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. ([[Hinduism]]/[[Hegel]]/[[Sikhism]], and process theology as first outlined by [[Alfred North Whitehead]])
* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental [[Psychological projection|projections]] onto God are. ([[Sikhism]])
* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insight.poeticmind.co.uk/12-application/12-2-space-pt-4-of-6/  'Inspiration: a functional approach to creative practice', Paragraph 2]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Drewermann]])
* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). ([[Nietzsche]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Reality is a representation created by will. ([[Schopenhauer]]/[[Sikhism]])
* Nobody knowingly desires evil. ([[Socrates]]/[[Sikhism]])

''Home With God'', we are told, is the final book in this series of two-way written communication&lt;ref&gt;''Home with God: In a Life That Never Ends'' (2006) {{ISBN|978-0-74326-716-8}}, pp. 308&lt;/ref&gt; {see HwG page 308, "Our final conversation in public."}. In August 2016, however, Neale stumbled upon a "new and unexpected dialogue" continuing the original trilogy with a fourth installment released on March 27, 2017.

The first three books in the series are often called the CwG trilogy. In 2005, the trilogy was re-released as one combined 'Gift Edition' book. This edition contains the entire text of the first three books with 'God's words in blue ink and Neale's in black ink, and features a combined 3-in-1 index at the back.

== Plot ==
On July 23, 1967, the [[Detroit Police Department]] staged a raid on an [[Blind pig|unlicensed club]] during a celebration for returning black veterans from the [[Vietnam War]]. While suspects are being arrested, a mob forms and starts throwing rocks at the officers before looting nearby stores and starting fires, beginning the [[12th Street Riot]]. With state authorities, elected representatives, and even emergency services unable to maintain any semblance of order, Governor [[George W. Romney]] authorizes the [[Michigan Army National Guard]] and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] authorizes [[paratroopers#United States|Army paratroopers]] to enter Detroit in order to provide assistance. On the second day of rioting, two cops pursue a fleeing looter. One of them, Philip Krauss, kills the man with a shotgun against orders, but is allowed to remain on duty until his superiors can decide whether to file murder charges.

[[The Dramatics]], a professional black [[R&amp;B]] group, arrive in Detroit hoping to score a recording contract. Seconds before their scheduled performance at a music hall, the police shut down the venue and order them to leave the city. En route, their bus is attacked by rioters and the group subsequently splits up, with lead singer Larry Reed and his friend Fred Temple renting a room at the local Algiers Motel for the night. They meet two white girls, Julie Ann and Karen, who introduce them to their friends Carl Cooper and Aubrey Pollard. Carl and another friend stage a prank using a [[Starting pistol|starter pistol]], upsetting Julie and Karen, who move to the room of Greene, a Vietnam War veteran, while Larry and Fred return to their own room.

Melvin Dismukes, a private [[security guard]], is assigned to protect a grocery store from looters and ingratiates himself with the Guardsmen. Carl decides to fire several blanks from his pistol in the direction of the troops to frighten them, but they mistake it for a [[sniper]] attack and pinpoint it coming from the Algiers due to the pistol's [[muzzle flash]]. The [[Michigan State Police]], National Guard, and Detroit Police arrive at the motel to investigate, led by Detroit police officer Krauss. Entering the building, they gun down Carl when he tries to escape, and Krauss plants a knife next to his body as he bleeds out and dies.

They round up everyone in the hotel and line them against the wall, demanding to know who the sniper was. Despite not finding any weapon during a search of the room, Krauss terrorizes and interrogates the occupants of the hotel. Dismukes arrives to try to help. Unwilling to get involved, most of the state police and National Guard leave without informing anyone of Krauss's abuse.

Krauss orders several suspects to be moved to different rooms and subjected to [[mock execution]]s in order to terrify the others into confessing. One police officer actually kills Aubrey, as he didn't understand the executions were supposed to be faked. Julie and Karen are taken to an upstairs room when they begin screaming, and Julie's clothes are torn off. Disgusted, a Guardsman returns, and manages to get them released from custody. Fearing arrest, Krauss permits the remaining suspects to leave, but only if they swear to keep silent. Greene and Larry agree, but Fred is killed when he refuses.

As the riots die down, Dismukes, while working his other job in a factory, is arrested and charged with murder after Julie identifies him as being present at the Algiers that night. Krauss and his fellow officers are questioned as well, and when everyone except Krauss confesses, they are also charged. Larry, whose singing career has stalled due to the trauma he experienced, is summoned as a witness to testify. The judge ultimately refuses to accept any of the confessions as evidence, and without a solid case, the all-white jury acquits Dismukes, Krauss, and their co-defendants of all charges. Dismukes confronts Krauss with the truth, but finds himself powerless to get any justice for the victims.

The film ends by explaining what became of the participants: Dismukes moved to the suburbs to escape death threats and resumed work as a security guard, Krauss and his men never returned to active duty, Julie rebuilt her life and started a family, and Larry became a choir singer and still lives in Detroit to the present day.

===Critical response===
''Detroit'' received praise for its direction, screenplay, and acting, especially Boyega, Poulter, and Smith's performances.&lt;ref name=reviews/&gt;&lt;ref name=reviews2/&gt; On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 83% based on 260 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Detroit'' delivers a gut-wrenching – and essential – dramatisation of a tragic chapter from America's past that draws distressing parallels to the present."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/detroit_2017 |title=Detroit (2017) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/detroit |title=Detroit Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=July 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A−" on an A+ to F scale, while [[PostTrak]] reported filmgoers gave it an 86% overall positive score and a 63% "definite recommend".&lt;ref name=opening/&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 4 out of 4 stars and called it one of 2017's best, saying: "Journalist-screenwriter Mark Boal (Bigelow's collaborator on ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'' and ''[[Zero Dark Thirty]]'') does a magnificent job of juggling the multiple storylines and creating fully authentic characters—some flawed, some basically decent, some evil."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/roeper-tight-focus-intensifies-the-drama-of-riot-recap-detroit/ |title=Tight focus intensifies the drama of riot recap 'Detroit'|website=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] praised the cast and script, giving the film 3.5/4 stars and saying, "... ''Detroit'' is far more than a liberal howl against the escalating toxicity of racism in America. Bigelow, with the same immersive intensity that [[Christopher Nolan]] brings to ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'', smacks us down in the middle of a brutal historical event so we can see it – and feel it – for ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/peter-travers-detroit-will-leave-you-moved-scarred-w493733|title='Detroit' Review: Kathryn Bigelow's Recreation of Riots, Racism Is Cry of Rage |last=Travers |first=Peter |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 25, 2017 |accessdate=July 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Alexander Nazaryan of ''[[Newsweek]]'' said, "[Bigelow's] characters never come alive, moving through the film less as people than entries in a sociology textbook ... If Bigelow could get inside the minds of soldiers suffocated by post-traumatic stress disorder, as she did so capably in ''The Hurt Locker'', she can get into the mind of anyone. In ''Zero Dark Thirty'', she made even CIA interrogators likeable. The characters in ''Detroit'', though, black and white, are as flat as the plains of the Upper Midwest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsweek.com/2017/07/28/kathryn-bigelow-detroit-race-riots-movie-review-642376.html |title=Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' Is A Well-intentioned Misfire|website=[[Newsweek]] |date=July 26, 2016|accessdate=July 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several critics noted the film's questionable take on a predominantly African American-based story. [[A. O. Scott]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "It is curious that a movie set against a backdrop of black resistance and rebellion—however inchoate and self-destructive its expression may have been—should become a tale of black helplessness and passivity. The white men, the decent ones as much as the brutes, have the answers, the power, the agency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Scott|first1=A.O. |title=In Detroit, Black Lives Caught in the Pre-History of the Alt-Right |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/26/movies/detroit-review.html|work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; K. Austin Collins of ''[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]]'' wrote, "This movie isn't really about black people as people, nor history as a lived experience, but is instead invested in a dutiful, 'just the facts, ma'am' reenactment that pretends those other things are already a given. Boal, and Bigelow beside him, refuse to speculate about — or imagine — the rest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Collins |first1=K.

''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s Richard Brody called the film "a moral failure", saying: "[Bigelow's] intentions come through clearly: to depict an incident—and a climate—of racism, to show that the cruelty of these deeds was multiplied by their ultimate impunity, and to suggest that, in the intervening half-century since the events depicted in the film took place, little has changed. Movies aren’t made with intentions, though; they’re made with people and with equipment, and what Bigelow has her actors do for the benefit of the camera is repellent to imagine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brody |first1=Richard |date=August 27, 2017 |title=The Immoral Artistry of Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-immoral-artistry-of-kathryn-bigelows-detroit |publisher=[[The New Yorker (website)|The New Yorker]] |access-date=August 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical accuracy==
According to Melvin Dismukes, who is depicted prominently in the film, ''Detroit'' "is 99.5% accurate as to what went down at the Algiers and in the city at the time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/detroit-melvin-dismukes-interview-1202511170/|title=‘Detroit’ Subject Melvin Dismukes on What Kathryn Bigelow Film Gets Right|first=Brent|last=Lang|date=August 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote that "Bigelow does say there are moments of fiction, and Boal notes instances of 'pure screenwriting.' Some facts are contested within accounts; others were changed for the screen" and then raised the question "Does a disclaimer at the end sufficiently cover fictional manipulations in an ostensibly true story?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-detroit-bigelow-20170727-story.html|title=Kathryn Bigelow's 'Detroit' takes on a tragedy then — and now - Los Angeles Times|first=Steven|last=Zeitchik|website=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] went so far as to state that Bigelow and Boal "changed names [of characters] so as to enjoy other creative liberties in the storytelling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/does-detroit-risk-a-lawsuit-real-life-cops-1026426|title=Does 'Detroit' Risk a Lawsuit From Real-Life Cops?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such subject whose name was dropped in favor of a fictional one is lawyer Norman Lippitt (played in the film by actor [[John Krasinski]] under the name Auerbach).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20170722/news/634586/lawyer-who-earned-fame-defending-detroit-police-in-algiers-motel-case|title=Lawyer who earned fame defending Detroit police in Algiers Motel case recalls legacy|website=Crain's Detroit Business}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the historical criticism, Boal said, "I employed poetic license, under a self-imposed rule to never stray from what I understood to be the underlying truth of a scene or an event. This script is built on a sturdy base of journalism and history, but it is not the same as journalism or history, nor does it aspire to be. As a screenwriter, I take the responsibility of being the creator of a tale, of transforming these raw materials into a drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/detroit/|title=Detroit Movie vs. the True Story of the Algiers Motel Killings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5611">'''Ecovention''' was a term invented by Amy Lipton and [[Sue Spaid]] in 1999 to refer to an [[ecological art]] intervention in environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eyebeam.org/ecovention-current-art-to-transform-ecologies Eyebeam "Current Art to Transform Ecologies."&lt;/ref&gt; The Ecovention movement in art is associated with [[land art]], earthworks, and [[environmental art]], and [[landscape architecture]], but remains its own distinct category. Many ecoventions bear tendencies similar to public works projects such as sewage and waste-water treatment plants, public gardens, landfills, mines, and sustainable building projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect1.html#landart Greenmuseum.org Ecoventions&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ‘Ecovention’ appears by the composition of the terms 'ecology' and 'innovation' or 'intervention'. The intention was to concrete a kind of art that alludes to the interventions that artists were made in degraded natural territories, pretending to generate a public consciousness, showing the existence of solutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The fact of restoring make the artists enter in a collaboration process with the nature in a social way. They help to generate a new paradigm teaching how art could help the society not only in a social or political criticism, but getting directly involved in the world. They are responsible for extending the various environmental principles and practices to the community. 

Artists will focus on various aspects like: biological, cultural, political or historical. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecovention: current art to transform ecologies.|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/sect11.html|website=Greenmuseum}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, different professionals work that are fundamental; architects, botanists, zoologists, engineers, ecologists... all based on the imaginative idea of an artist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=MARÍN RUIZ|first1=Carmen|title=‘Arte medioambiental y ecología. Elementos para una reflexión crítica.’|date=2014|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; 4.
Activism, the re-evaluation of territories, the study of diversity and the recovery of spaces will be some of its main characteristics. To carry them out, they use new techniques in order to transform that local ecology in order to reestablish natural resources and stabilize environments. His works have as a common goal to motivate the viewer to visit these spaces generating awareness and in turn encourage more interventions. 


Artists associated with ecovention include: [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Mel Chin]], [[Agnes Denes]], Helen and Newton Harrison, Ocean Earth, [[Robert Smithson]], Alan Sonfist, and [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], among others.

==Exhibitions==
''Ecovention'' is also the title of a 2002 exhibition at the ''Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]]'' in [[Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ground works : environmental collaboration in contemporary art.|date=2005|publisher=Carnegie Mellon University|location=Pittsburgh, PA|isbn=978-0-9772053-1-8|page=21|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffYQeG4MrRAC&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22Ecovention%22%20lipton&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title of exhibition catalog, joint published with the Greenmuseum.&lt;ref&gt;http://greenmuseum.org/c/ecovention/intro_frame.html Greenmuseum.org.

There is a new exhibition, Ecovention Europe, planned to open in the Fall of 2017. The show is also curated by Sue Spaid, and will feature a new text furthering the conversation around what an "Ecovention" is.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9097">'''FedEx furniture''' is the artistic creation of computer programmer and [[creative consumer]] Jose Avila, III.  In June, 2005, Avila created a website, Fedexfurniture.com,  to display photographs of a couch, bed, dining room table, and desk that he had constructed out of cartons obtained from overnight shipping giant [[FedEx Corporation]] (FedEx). FedEx attorneys used the [[Notice and take down|takedown]] provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) to force Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]] to take the site offline, accusing Avila of infringing on FedEx's [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s, breaching his [[contract]] with FedEx by using the cartons for purposes other than shipping, and potentially misleading consumers into believing that FedEx approved or endorsed Avila's actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|issn=0008-1256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among attorneys and activist organizations concerned with the exercise of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights on the [[Internet]], FedEx's actions raised questions about the [[constitutionality]] of using the DMCA to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  The Fedexfurniture.com website is down as of July 8th, 2017.

==The story==

In 2005, Avila moved to Tempe, Arizona with nothing more than clothes and work essentials.  He was still stuck in a lease on his California apartment, and could barely afford his new apartment in Arizona.

After a bit of frustration over not having furniture, Avila remembered that a former roommate had solved a similar problem by constructing furniture using FedEx cartons.  Using hundreds of FedEx boxes and materials that he "already had lying around" for shipping various items, Avila constructed every piece of furniture in his apartment. Avila's designs were sturdy and attractive. Friends urged Avila to put pictures of the furniture on a Web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland|last3=Kietzmann|first3=Jan|last4=McCarthy|first4=Ian P.|date=2015-08-01|title=CGIP: Managing Consumer-Generated Intellectual Property|url=https://doi.org/10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43|journal=California Management Review|language=en|volume=57|issue=4|pages=43–62|doi=10.1525/cmr.2015.57.4.43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berthon|first=Pierre R.|last2=Pitt|first2=Leyland F.|last3=McCarthy|first3=Ian|last4=Kates|first4=Steven M.|date=2007-01-01|title=When customers get clever: Managerial approaches to dealing with creative consumers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681306000796|journal=Business Horizons|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2006.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avila, he did so in order to show that trying financial circumstances need not lead to despair; one can respond creatively, even artistically, by using "found" materials.{{ref|ffstory}} The site's message was "It's OK to be ghetto".{{ref|counterthink}}

The site subsequently attracted widespread attention, both from Web surfers and the press.  Because the site was getting so much traffic, Avila placed a PayPal donation link on the page and asked for help to pay for the bandwidth charges. He also announced a plan to sell Fedexfurniture.com T-shirts, although Avila says that no T-shirts were ever sold.{{ref|ffstory}}

On June 27, 2005, FedEx attorneys wrote to Avila's [[Internet service provider|ISP]]. Citing the takedown provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), they demanded that the ISP remove Avila's materials from the Web.{{ref|takedownnotice}} They justified their request on two grounds:
*Infringement of FedEx's [[intellectual property]] (specifically, [[copyright]]s and [[trademark]]s.)
*Violation of FedEx's [[terms of use]] for packaging supplies.

In order to take advantage of the [[Safe harbor (law)|safe harbor]] provisions of the DMCA, Avila's ISP complied with the request and removed Avila's materials from the Web. Had the ISP not done so, it could have been held liable for [[contributory copyright infringement|contributory infringement]] (aiding and abetting the infringer) if Avila's materials were subsequently found to be infringing in a court of law.

FedEx's actions concerned Internet free speech activist organizations, such as [[Stanford University|Stanford University's]] [[Stanford Center for Internet and Society|Center for Internet and Society]],  which are concerned about the use of the DMCA's takedown provisions to [[censorship|censor]] unwanted speech.  According to these organizations, the DMCA's purpose is to prevent Internet copyright infringement; it was never Congress's intent that the DMCA's takedown provisions should be used when the real issue is [[trademark infringement]] or [[breach of contract]].{{ref|fairuse}}

A Stanford attorney, [[Jennifer Granick]], assisted Avila on a [[pro bono]] basis. In her letter to FedEx, she disputed the use of the DMCA to remove Avila's site from the Web; she argued that the company's claim of [[copyright infringement]] had no merit; therefore, FedEx should not have used the DMCA to silence Avila's speech. The company's underlying motivations, she argued, were to protect its [[trademark]] and ability to place restrictions on public use of its cartons.{{ref|stanford}} Avila restored his site briefly. The dispute attracted widespread press attention, and Avila was frequently interviewed to tell his side of the story. In response to Granick's letter, FedEx attorneys reiterated their claims. Subsequently, Avila removed his site from the Web, citing technical difficulties.  By January 2006, Avila's site had returned, however, by June 30, 2006 the site had again disappeared. This was caused by a server crash, and as of July 27, 2006 it was back online, but as of August 16, 2007 the site is gone.  It popped up again in October 2007, but is currently down (July 8, 2017).

'''Fine Art Photography''' is [[photography]] created in accordance with the vision of the artist as a photographer. Using photography as a medium to bring something to life that only lives in the artist's mind. Simply capturing what you see in an artistic way is the art of photography and not creating fine art. The goal is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. Fine art photography stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services.

Among the definitions that can be found in scholarly articles are:
* In 1961, [[S. D. Jouhar|Dr S. D.Jouhar]] founded the Photographic Fine Art Association, and he was its chairman. Their definition of Fine Art was “Creating images that evoke emotion by a photographic process in which one's mind and imagination are freely but competently exercised.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jouhar |first=Sultan |date=October 1964 |title=The Work of Dr. Jouhar |url=https://archive.rps.org/archive/volume-104/742322 |journal=The Royal Photographic Society Journal |volume=104 |issue=10 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two studies by Christopherson in 1974 defined "fine art photographers" as "those persons who create and distribute photographs specifically as 'art.'"&lt;ref&gt;Christopherson, Richard W.

===On the World Wide Web===
Among the definitions that can be found on the [[World Wide Web]] are:
* The [[Library of Congress]] [[Library of Congress Subject Headings|Subject Headings]] use "art photography" as "photography of art," and "artistic photography" (i.e., "Photography, artistic") as "photography as a fine art, including aesthetic theory".&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress.

* The [[Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus]] states that "fine art photography" (preferred term) or "art photography" or "artistic photography" is "the movement in England and the United States, from around 1890 into the early 20th century, which promoted various aesthetic approaches. Historically, has sometimes been applied to any photography whose intention is aesthetic, as distinguished from scientific, commercial, or journalistic; for this meaning, use 'photography'".&lt;ref&gt;Getty Research Institute.

==History==
[[File:Aktikompositsioon 19 (J. Künnap).jpg|thumb|Depiction of [[nudity]] has been one of the dominating themes in fine-art photography. ''Nude composition 19'' from 1988 by [[Jaan Künnap]].]]
One photography historian claimed that "the earliest exponent of 'Fine Art' or composition photography was [[John Jabez Edwin Mayall|John Edwin Mayall]], "who exhibited [[daguerrotype]]s illustrating the [[Lord's Prayer]] in 1851".&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, Helmut. ''Creative photography: aesthetic trends 1839-1960''. New York: Dover, 1991. {{ISBN|0-486-26750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Successful attempts to make fine art photography can be traced to [[Victorian era]] practitioners such as [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]], and [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and others.  In the U.S. [[F. Holland Day]], [[Alfred Stieglitz]] and [[Edward Steichen]] were instrumental in making photography a fine art, and Stieglitz was especially notable in introducing it into museum collections.

In the UK as recently as 1960, photography was not really recognised as a Fine Art. Dr [[S.D.Jouhar]] said, when he formed the Photographic Fine Art Association at that time  - ''"At the moment photography is not generally recognized as anything more than a craft. In the USA photography has been openly accepted as Fine Art in certain official quarters. It is shown in galleries and exhibitions as an Art. There is not corresponding recognition in this country. The London Salon shows pictorial photography, but it is not generally understood as an art. Whether a work shows aesthetic qualities or not it is designated 'Pictorial Photography' which is a very ambiguous term. The photographer himself must have confidence in his work and in its dignity and aesthetic value, to force recognition as an Art rather than a Craft"''

Until the late 1970s several genres predominated, such as nudes, portraits, and natural landscapes (exemplified by [[Ansel Adams]]). Breakthrough 'star' artists in the 1970s and 80s, such as [[Sally Mann]], [[Robert Mapplethorpe]], [[Robert Farber (photographer)|Robert Farber]] and [[Cindy Sherman]], still relied heavily on such [[genre]]s, although seeing them with fresh eyes. Others investigated a [[snapshot aesthetic]] approach.

American organizations, such as the [[Aperture (magazine)|Aperture Foundation]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]], have done much to keep photography at the forefront of the fine arts. MOMA's establishment of a department of photography in 1940 and appointment of [[Beaumont Newhall]] as its first curator are often cited as institutional confirmation of photography's status as an art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips |first1=Christopher |title=The Judgment Seat of Photography |journal=October |date=Autumn 1982 |volume=22 |doi=10.2307/778362 |jstor=778362 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Framing and print size==
Until the mid-1950s it was widely considered vulgar and pretentious to frame a photograph for a gallery exhibition. Prints were usually simply pasted onto blockboard or plywood, or given a white border in the darkroom and then pinned at the corners onto display boards. Prints were thus shown without any glass reflections obscuring them.  Steichen's famous [[The Family of Man]] exhibition was unframed, the pictures pasted to panels. Even as late as 1966 [[Bill Brandt]]'s MoMA show was unframed, with simple prints pasted to thin plywood. From the mid-1950s to about 2000 most gallery exhibitions had prints behind glass. Since about 2000 there has been a noticeable move toward once again showing contemporary gallery prints on boards and without glass. In addition, throughout the twentieth century, there was a noticeable increase in the size of prints.

[[File:Adams The Tetons and the Snake River.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ansel Adams]]' ''The Tetons and the Snake River'' (1942).]]

==Politics==
Fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist’s vision, but as a byproduct it has also been important in advancing certain causes. The work of [[Ansel Adams]] in [[Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone]] provides an example. Adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers of the 20th century, and was an avid promoter of conservation. While his primary focus was on photography as art, some of his work raised public awareness of the beauty of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] and helped to build political support for their protection.

Such photography has also had effects in the area of censorship law and free expression, due to its concern with the nude body.

==Current trends==
[[File:Gursky Shanghai.jpg|thumb|left|Andreas Gursky, ''Shanghai'', 2000, C-print mounted to plexiglass, 119 x 81 inches]]
There is now a trend toward a careful staging and lighting of the picture, rather than hoping to "discover" it ready-made.  Photographers such as [[Gregory Crewdson]], and [[Jeff Wall]] are noted for the quality of their [[Tableaux Vivant|staged]] pictures.  Additionally, new technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in [[full spectrum photography]], where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.

As printing technologies have improved since around 1980, a photographer's art prints reproduced in a finely-printed limited-edition book have now become an area of strong interest to collectors.  This is because books usually have high production values, a short print run, and their limited market means they are almost never reprinted. The collector's market in photography books by individual photographers is developing rapidly.

According to [http://press.artprice.com/pdf/Trends2004.pdf ''Art Market Trends 2004''] (PDF link) 7,000 photographs were sold in auction rooms in 2004, and photographs averaged a 7.6 [[percent]] annual price rise from 1994 and 2004.{{Failed verification|date=October 2008}} Around 80 percent were sold in the United States. Of course, auction sales only record a fraction of total private sales. There is now a thriving collectors' market for which the most sought-after art photographers will produce high quality archival prints in strictly limited editions. Attempts by online art retailers to sell fine photography to the general public alongside prints of paintings have had mixed results, with strong sales coming only from the traditional "big names" of photography such as Ansel Adams.

In addition to the "digital movement" towards manipulation, filtering, or resolution changes, some fine artists deliberately seek a "naturalistic," including "natural lighting" as a value in itself. Sometimes the art work as in the case of [[Gerhard Richter]] consists of a photographic image that has been subsequently painted over with oil paints and/or contains some political or historical significance beyond the image itself. The existence of "photographically-projected painting" now blurs the line between painting and photography which traditionally was absolute.

==Overlap with other genres==
Although fine art photography may overlap with many other genres of photography, the overlaps with [[fashion photography]] and [[photojournalism]] merit special attention.

In 1996 it was stated that there had been a "recent blurring of lines between commercial illustrative photography and fine art photography," especially in the area of fashion.&lt;ref name=Bryant&gt;Bryant, Eric. Review of ''Fashion: Photography in the Nineties''. ''Library Journal'', February 15, 1997, p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the overlap of fine art photography and fashion photography includes lectures,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/catherine-atherton-the-fine-art-of-fashion-photography-673645.html Catherine Atherton: The fine art of fashion photography.

Photojournalism and fine art photography overlapped beginning in the "late 1960s and 1970s, when... news photographers struck up liaisons with art photography and painting".&lt;ref name=Goldberg&gt;Goldberg, Vicki. Picture this - magazine photography, in just a few decades, has changed the way life itself is regarded.  ''Life'' magazine, April 15, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 the [[International Center of Photography]] opened, with emphases on both "humanitarian photojournalism" and "art photography".&lt;ref name=Goldberg/&gt;  By 1987, "pictures that were taken on assignments for magazines and newspapers now regularly reappear[ed] - in frames - on the walls of museums and galleries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Grundberg |first=Andy |date=April 12, 1987 |title=Art; photojournalism lays claim to the realm of esthetics |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D9133EF931A25757C0A961948260 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=August 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New smartphone apps such as [[Snapchat]] sometimes are used for fine-art photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stevegiovinco.com/while-i-watch-my-father-die-photography-exhibition-on-snapchat-explores-memory-emotional-vanishing/|title=While I Watch My Father Die: Photography Exhibition on Snapchat Explores Memory, Emotional Vanishing {{!}} Fine Art Photography, Commissions, NYC Teaching Tutorials Steve Giovinco|website=stevegiovinco.com|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes of artists in other fields==
The reactions of artists and writers have contributed significantly to perceptions of photography as fine art. Prominent painters, such as [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Pablo Picasso]], have asserted their interest in the medium:

{{quote|I have discovered photography. Now I can kill myself. I have nothing else to learn.|Pablo Picasso}}

{{quote|I have always been very interested in photography. I have looked at far more photographs than I have paintings. Because their reality is stronger than reality itself.|Francis Bacon.}}

Noted authors, similarly, have responded to the artistic potential of photography:

{{quote|...it does seem to me that [[Robert Capa|Capa]] has proved beyond all doubt that the camera need not be a cold mechanical device. Like the pen, it is as good as the man who uses it. It can be the extension of mind and heart...|[[John Steinbeck]]}}

'''The Friends of Dorothy Society''' (commonly abbreviated "'''fods'''") is a [[bell ringing]] society for [[LGBT]] people and their friends. The society is based in the United Kingdom but has members throughout the world; particularly in the United States of America and Australia.

The Society takes its name from the euphemism [[Friend of Dorothy]], meaning [[gay]] man.

== History ==

The society started following a notice placed in ''[[The Ringing World]]'' (a weekly publication for bell ringers) in May 1991. The notice aimed to assemble a band to ring for the [[Pride London|London Pride Festival]] that year.

A number of people responded to the notice and the bells of [[St. Martin in the Fields]], [[Trafalgar Square]] were rung for that year’s parade.

== Tours ==

The society holds a spring tour and an autumn tour each year. The first tour was to [[Bristol]] in October 1991. Since then, members of the society have toured many cities throughout the United Kingdom. The first international tour was held in May 2006 when members visited [[Washington DC]].

The '''Gabriel Prize''' is an award given annually by the Western European Architectural Foundation, through a three-stage national competition, to one American candidate working in the field of [[architecture]] or [[landscape architecture]]. Results are announced in March of each year.

Award winners spend three months in residence in [[France]], focusing on a particular aspect of [[French architecture]] they have chosen to research. They spend much of their [[sabbatical]] traveling, sketching and measuring, and in the course of three months, produce three large [[Architectural rendering|rendering]]s. The laureates work closely with the foundation's European representative, a [[Paris]]ian architect who serves to assist their progress.

The Prize was founded in 1991 by George Parker, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gabrielprize.org/ |title=Gabriel Prize |publisher=Gabriel Prize |date= |accessdate=2011-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ghana Open Data Initiative''' ('''GODI''') was started in January 2012 by the [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA) in partnership with the [[Web Foundation]] (WF), to make [[Ghana|Government of Ghana]] data available to the public for re-use. The establishment of GODI is meant to promote [[efficiency]], [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] and [[accountability]] in governance as well as to facilitate economic growth by means of the creation of Mobile and Web applications for the Ghanaian and world markets. The project was scheduled for completion in 2014 and aimed to create a sustainable Open Data ecosystem for Ghana. GODI was launched with a 100 data sets categorized as political, legal, organizational, technical, social or economic. The vision of GODI is to develop an open data community involving the Government of Ghana, civil society organizations, industry, developer communities, academia, media practitioners,  and the citizenry, to interact with one another with the aim of developing an open data portal to bring about transparency, accountability and efficiency in government.&lt;ref name="GODI1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/general-news/17132-open-government-data-portal-ready-by-december-2013 |title=Open Government Data Portal Ready By December 2013 |author=GNA |date=October 24, 2012 |work= |publisher=ghana.gov.gh |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304030605/http://www.ghana.gov.gh/index.php/news/general-news/17132-open-government-data-portal-ready-by-december-2013 |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BIZTECH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biztechafrica.com/article/godi-project-get-us-tech-support/4605/?country=ghana |title= GODI project to get US tech support |author= BiztechAfrica|date= November 3, 2012 |work= |publisher= biztechafrica.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GODIsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.gov.gh/about-us |title=About GODI |author=GODI |date= |work= |publisher=data.gov.gh |accessdate=May 29, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818061103/http://data.gov.gh/about-us |archivedate=August 18, 2013 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="webfoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webfoundation.org/2012/02/ghana-godi-launch/|title= New Project: Ghana Open Data Initiative (GODI)|author= José M.

== History ==
At the close of 2011, the president of the Republic of Ghana, [[John Atta Mills|His Excellency Prof. J.E. Mills]], signed the [[Open Government Partnership]] (OGP), a global initiative started by the [[United States government]].&lt;ref name="theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" BIZTECH " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" vibegh " /&gt;&lt;ref name="BIZGH"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2012/11/22/ghanas-open-data-portal-goes-live/feed/|title= Ghana’s open data portal goes live|author= GNA|date= November 22, 2012 |work= |publisher= ghanabusinessnews.com |accessdate=May 29, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] is a new multilateral initiative that aims to secure concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen governance. In the spirit of multistakeholder collaboration, the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] is overseen by a steering committee of governments, [[civil society]] organizations, [[academia]] and the [[Software developer|developer community]].&lt;ref name="theafricareport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/ghana-sets-up-open-data-platform.html |title= Ghana sets up Open Data platform |author=Lawrence Quartey |date= November 22, 2012 |work= |publisher= theafricareport.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name="vibegh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vibeghana.com/2012/11/01/us-data-team-visits-ghana/ |title= US Data team visits Ghana|author= GNA |date= November 1, 2012 |work= |publisher= vibeghana.com |accessdate=June 2, 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Ghana signing onto the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]], the [[Web Foundation|World Wide Web Foundation]] (WF) had conducted feasibility studies in Ghana and Chile as special case studies for developing countries and published the report in February 2011. On the basis of the feasibility report, the [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA), an agency of the Ministry of Communications, which was created by an Act of Parliament to oversee and implement government policy on [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT), began discussions with the WF in April 2011 on how to develop an open government portal in Ghana.&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" GODIsite " /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISTO"&gt;{{cite web

}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] over the last three years has been deploying a massive government network dubbed the GovNET across the country and data centers which will be repositories of Government data. NITA has also been mandated to engage the citizenry with government by providing  [http://eservices.gov.gh/ e-Services] platforms to serve the citizenry with services like online passport application, business and birth and death registration which NITA is executing with 11 pilot e-service platforms.&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" ISTO " /&gt;

On the initial signing of the [[Open Government Partnership|OGP]] commitment by the embassy of Ghana in the US in September 2011, [[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] intensified its discussions with the WF on developing a national plan to create an open data portal where government could make its data available in a format that [[Civil society|civil society organizations]] (CSOs), the [[International development|developer community]], [[academia]], the [[Mass media|media]] and [[industry]] could re-use.&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt; These discussions culminated in a visit to Ghana by a team from the WF during which a strategic plan was developed at a formal stakeholders’ meeting which took place in Accra, where the initiative was duly launched. The visiting WF team and [[National Information Technology Agency|NITA]] officials paid a courtesy call on the then Vice President [[John Mahama|His Excellency John Dramani Mahama]] to invite him to champion the Ghana Open Data Initiative.

== Relevance of open government data to Ghana ==
Open government data is particularly important to low and middle income countries like Ghana because:
* Transparency and accountability are critical dimensions for foreign aid and investments, which in turn is essential for social and economic development. The potential of ICT in developing countries to provide basic services in health, education, business and governance has been highlighted for more than a decade by the [[World Summit on Information Society|WSIS]].
* Easy access to government-held data reduces risks and transaction costs in the economic sector, thus reducing barriers to growth.
* Citizen inclusion and participation in government agenda have been historically low in developing countries, particularly due to lack of information and infrastructure. Increasing such citizen participation has proven to be essential for the establishment of stable democratic processes.
* Data on government services is capable of attracting groups and organizations to form communities whose activities can improved social capital and economic growth.

== Development of GODI ==

=== Executive level ===
The WF feasibility report indicated that the Government of Ghana has the political will to make information transparently available to its citizens.
In January 2012, then vice president of Ghana, [[John Mahama]], informed a delegation from the WF that he was committed to championing the GODI at the cabinet level.

=== Public administration level ===
The feasibility report of the WF indicated that government departments and agencies are in support of OGD initiatives.  Substantial information is already available in digital format; however end user access still remains on paper which imparts negatively on the access and reuse of information. Since January 2012 when the GODI started, several public administrators have indicated their willingness to provide data in the format required to contribute to the project.

=== Civil society level ===
The WF feasibility report indicated that there is already a movement towards reuse of information driven by organizations like the Population Council as well as universities that are advocating the access to raw data for their studies.

== Organogram ==
[[File:GODI Project Organogram.jpg]]

== Implementation ==
The [[National Information Technology Agency]] (NITA) is the implementing agency for the [http://www.data.gov.gh/ Ghana Open Data Initiative] (GODI).&lt;ref name=" webfoundation " /&gt;&lt;ref name=" theafricareport" /&gt;&lt;ref name=" GODIsite " /&gt; The GODI portal was developed on the fourth thematic area of the [[Open Government Partnership]].

The objectives of the GODI project are to:
* Provide a central platform for access to public government data.
* Bring about the development of the open data community.
* Promote participation between government, civil society organizations, academia, media practitioners, industry, developer community and the citizen.
* Serve as a concrete action plan of the fourth thematic area of the Open Government Partnership (technology and innovation) for the republic of Ghana.
* Promote transparency, accountability and efficiency in government through citizen feedback.

== Benefits ==
Ghana’s decision to create an open data portal was informed by the fact the [[Open Data|Open Government Data]] (OGD) programs around the world have demonstrated multiple benefits. GODI perceives that Ghana can gain all the benefit of open data which are grouped around three main themes:

=== Transparency and accountability ===
* Increased transparency of governments
* Greater accountability of officials by citizens being able to see and challenge individual spending and purchasing decisions
* Behaviour change due to the possibility of greater scrutiny
* Better understanding by civil society of the reasons for government decisions
* Better democracy and increased civic capital
* Better informed and balanced journalism; i.e. [[data journalism]]

=== Improved public services ===
* Increased number of services to people due to an increased base of potential service providers
* New synergies among government, public administration and civil society organizations
* Increased citizen participation and inclusion through extended offers of services closer to people’s needs
* Closer cooperation between central and local government
* Increased internal government efficiency and effectiveness

=== Economic growth ===
* New business opportunities for services to businesses and citizens using government data
* Better functioning of the economy through easy access to core reference information held by the government
* Increased employment for application and service developers
* New innovative uses of [[Open Data|OGD]] that can help spur innovation and development in the IT sector

'''Gorm Henrik Rasmussen''' (born 1955) is a Danish poet who wrote the first biography about the guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Nick Drake]], ''Pink Moon'' (1986). The book is based upon interviews Gorm Henrik Rasmussen made with Nick Drake's parents, Rodney and [[Molly Drake]], in their home in [[Tanworth-in-Arden]], [[Warwickshire]], England, in 1979 and 1980. ''[http://rocket88books.com/2012/01/27/pink-moon/ Pink Moon]'' was re-written and translated into English in 2009. In 2012, it became the launch title for [http://rocket88books.com/ Rocket 88], a new music book imprint of [http://www.essentialworks.co.uk/ Essential Works]. A Spanish version has also appeared in 2012.

Gorm Henrik Rasmussen is known in Denmark for a number of books about eccentrics and strange places in the [[northern part of Jutland]] where he was born and raised. He has received several literary awards from [[The Danish Arts Foundation]] and The Danish Arts Council.

'''Gothic boxwood miniatures''' are very small [[wood carving|carved wood]] [[Christian]] religious sculptures produced during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly in [[Early Netherlandish painting|today's Low Countries]], at the end of the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] of [[Northern Renaissance|northern European art]].&lt;ref name="es"&gt;Sharpe, Emily. "[https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/good-things-come-in-small-packages-at-the-rijksmuseum Good things come in small packages at the Rijksmuseum]". ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 17 June 2017. Retrieved 8 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of highly intricate layers of [[relief]]s often rendered to nearly microscopic level. The miniatures are made of [[Buxus|boxwood]], which has a fine grain and high density suitable for detailed micro carving. There are around 150 surviving examples. The majority are spherical beads ([[prayer nut]]s), statuettes, skulls, or coffins; some 20 are in the form of [[polyptych]]s such as [[triptych]] or [[diptych]] [[altarpieces]], or [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]]s and [[monstrance]]s.&lt;ref name="SuS"&gt;Suda, Sasha; Ellis, Lisa. "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD5M-je1yf4 Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures Introduction]". [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], 28 October 2016. Retrieved 24 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The polyptychs tend to be in the 10–13 cm height range, while most of the beads are 10–15 cm in diameter; the latter were designed so they could be held in the palm of a hand during personal devotion, or hung from necklaces and belts as fashionable accessories.

Boxwood miniatures were highly prized in the early 16th century. Their iconography, form, and utility can be linked to medieval [[ivory diptychs]], as well as contemporary [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illuminated miniatures]], altarpieces, panel paintings, sculpture, [[woodcut]]s, and engravings. They often contain imagery from the life of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], and vistas of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. Each miniature's production required exceptional craftsmanship, and some may have taken decades of [[man-hours|cumulative work]] to complete, suggesting that they were commissioned by high-ranking nobles.

A number of the miniatures appear to have come from a workshop led by Adam Dircksz, who is thought to have produced dozens of miniatures. Almost nothing is known about Dircksz, outside of a Latin signature on a single work now held in Copenhagen, and little is known of the artisans who produced the miniatures. Some of the original owners can be identified from markings, usually initials or coats of arms, placed by the sculptors.&lt;ref name="m162"&gt;Marks (1977), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Important collections are in the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], in the [[British Museum]] as part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (1985), pp. 162–194&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their rarity and the difficulty in discerning their intricacy from reproductions, boxwood miniatures are relatively understudied compared to other forms of Netherlandish visual art.

[[Buxus sempervirens|Boxwood]] is a dense hardwood with fine [[Wood grain|grain]], resistant to splitting and chipping—ideal for wood carving.&lt;ref name="l25"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drake Boehm, Barbara; Suda, Alexandra. "[http://boxwood.ago.ca/publication/what-boxwood What is Boxwood?]". Art Gallery of Ontario. Retrieved 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[woodcut]] blocks used for [[woodblock printing]] were usually made of boxwood. Uses for boxwood were similar to those for ivory in medieval carvings, but with boxwood a far less expensive option than ivory.&lt;ref name="s23"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Designs were overseen by master craftsmen who must have had access to prints and [[woodcuts]] of contemporary works of art, and who were apparently influenced by diptych and triptych panel paintings.&lt;ref name="l23"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxwood grows slowly, so the trunk remains fairly narrow, a fact that impedes the size of any carvings made from any single piece. In addition, the wood assumes an even, soft and tactile surface if polished or, more importantly, frequently handled; especially the prayer nuts were intended to be held in the owner's hand.&lt;ref name="s20"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The wood loses its tactility when painted over, explaining why most of the miniatures are in monochrome. In addition, polychromy would have reduced the legibility of the carvings, "quite 
apart from the difficulty of effectively coloring such tiny and complex scenes" as the art historian [[Frits Scholten]] has noted.&lt;ref&gt;Scholten (2017), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tools used in production were similar to those used in the production of larger [[altarpiece]]s and would have included [[saw]]s, [[Plane (tool)|planes]], [[card scraper]]s, chisels, [[auger (drill)|augers]], braces, and [[gimlet (tool)|gimlets]]. Wood was cut into the required dimensions as blocks, after which the [[joiner|joins]] were carved out. Prayer beads were made on a [[lathe]] used to [[Woodturning|turn]] the wood.&lt;ref name="t162"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  The woodcutters carved a single block of boxwood into a sphere, which was then cut in half, hollowed out and attached to a fastening hinge and carrying loops. The carvings in the interiors were typically made separately from the smaller hemispheres and later fitted onto an outer shell.&lt;ref name="t164" /&gt;

Because of their diminutive scale, the pieces were produced using magnifying glasses.&lt;ref name="s57"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The very small wood pieces were difficult to hold in place (brace) during carving. They were likely positioned on a bench, between two posts, so that they could be turned around. Domed spaces, intended to evoke church architecture, were drilled or carved, and these were divided, using [[compass]]es and a [[straight edge]], into pie-shaped segments. A surface plane was established onto which the [[relief]]s would be added. These would have been created from multiple separate wood sheets, individually produced before being joined in layers.&lt;ref name="l25" /&gt; Major figures, usually saints, were carved from single blocks of wood. Relief components were either glued into prefixed niches,&lt;ref name="l63"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Interior"&gt;Dandridge, Peter; Ellis, Lisa.

The level of detail indicates the use of magnification in their production, probably with the same instruments used by contemporary jewellers.&lt;ref name="l27"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Describing these intricacies, the art historian Eve Kahn writes that the works can be so rich that "individual feathers are visible on angel wings, and dragon skins are textured with thick scales. Crumbling shacks are shown with shingles missing from their gabled roofs. Saints' robes and soldiers' uniforms are trimmed with buttons and embroidery, and there are nearly microscopic representations of jewelry and rosary beads".&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

Most surviving boxwood miniatures are attributed to [[Northern Renaissance]] artisans working in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] and [[Habsburg Netherlands]] during the late 15th and early 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="m132"&gt;Marks (1977), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their quality and stylistic similarities to
the full sized Flemish and [[Brabantine Gothic|Brabantine]] altarpieces, they were for centuries assumed to originate from [[Southern Netherlands]], however more recent research has found that a majority of the early owners came from the northern provinces of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].&lt;ref name="sc31"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples from Italy, although according to Wilhelm Bode, "The broad monumental tendency of Italian art, especially in sculpture, seems to exclude a taste for daintily executed small works".&lt;ref&gt;Bode (1904), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; German examples include a carving encased in a miniature skull, now in the Art Gallery of Ontario, which contains branchwork (''Astwerk'') of a type often found in contemporary German sculpture.&lt;ref name="ws171"&gt;Wetter; Scholten (2017), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

That a majority of the miniatures share technical, stylistic, and thematic similarities, and could be considered as a near homogeneous group was first noted by the art historian Jaap Leeuwenberg.&lt;ref name="s339"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Such stylistic traits include broad and densely populated animated scenes, often placed, in the words of the art historian William Wixom, on "steeply angled ground planes of tiled floors".&lt;ref name="w43"&gt;Wixom (1983), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Other shared features include spatial devices, figures in contemporary dress, and draperies arranged in angular folds. On this basis Leeuwenberg attributed a large number of the objects to Adam Dircksz.&lt;ref name="w43" /&gt;

Regardless of the number of works that Dircksz or his workshop can be attributed with, art historians often debate what the artistic and technical precedents for the miniatures might be. Scholten observes how, to a large extent, it seems "as if this exquisite sculpture was born ex nihilo around 1500", but points out that "giant strides are rarely made in art history", pointing to affinities with silversmith's art, especially the miniature architectural elements often found in ecclesiastical silver and ornaments.&lt;ref name="sc31" /&gt;

The use of tracery used for geometric decoration on the exteriors can be categorised into three different styles. One style super-imposes intersecting circles around the head of the dome. A second uses small circles to punctuate and divide the dome into segments. The style is a combination of the first two, but far more complex, and uses the arcs of the circles to link the first style's looping circles with the second style's repeating patterns.

{{Main|Prayer nut}}
The English term ''Prayer nut'' comes from the equivalent Dutch word ''gebedsnoot'', and took on common usage in the 18th century. The use of the word "nut" may be derived from the fact that some of the beads were actually carved from nuts or pits, and although no such miniatures survive, it was a known practice in medieval southern Germany.&lt;ref name="s20" /&gt; They are mostly the same shape (deliberately to resemble apples),&lt;ref&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with carved Gothic openwork tracery and flower-heads, and of a size suitable for holding in the palm of a hand.&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;Braimbridge, Mark.

''Topiarius'', Volume 14, Summer 2010. pp. 15–17. Retrieved 25 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prayer nuts often contain central scenes depicting episodes from the life of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] or the [[Passion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="l80"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Some are a single bead; more rare are those consisting of up to eleven beads, including the "[[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]] Rosary" gifted by Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon,&lt;ref name="l77" /&gt; which is one of only two surviving boxwood rosaries.&lt;ref name="prayer"&gt;Drake Boehm, Barbara; Suda, Alexandra.

The beads are quite uniform in size and shape, with a diameter ranging from around 30 to 65 millimetres.&lt;ref name="s27" /&gt; They were often made as two half-shells that could be opened to reveal intricate interior detail. According to the art historian Dora Thornton, when the prayer nuts was opened out, it "revealed the representation of the divine hidden inside.&lt;ref name="t162" /&gt; The art historian [[Frits Scholten]] notes that the tracery may have been intended to suggest that the object contained a small [[relic]], "so that the object took on the character of a [[talisman]] and was deemed to have an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] effect".&lt;ref name="f323"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; A number contain a wooden loop in the middle of one half so they could be worn hanging from a belt, or carried in a case.&lt;ref name="l77"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="t187"&gt;Thornton (1985), pp. 167, 187&lt;/ref&gt; A fragrant substance was sometimes placed inside, which diffused when the beads were used, making them comparable to the then fashionable [[pomander]]s.&lt;ref name="f323" /&gt;

The shape of a prayer nut likely carried deep significance; with the outer sheath representing Christ's human flesh; the bead stand, His cross; and the interior reliefs, His divinity.&lt;ref name="t162" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1976), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thornton, "unfolding the nut is in itself an act of prayer, like opening up a personal illuminated prayer book, or watching the leaves of a large scale altarpiece being hinged back in a church service".&lt;ref name="t186"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scholten questions their use for private religious devotion, noting how their microscopic scale made them impractical for meditation, as their imagery was not discernible without a magnifying glass or strong spectacles.&lt;ref name="f338"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyptychs===
Miniature boxwood triptychs, diptychs, and other polyptychs are typically altarpieces, with [[Church tabernacle|tabernacles]] and monstrances more rare. The multi-paneled works exist in both horizontal and landscape formats, and were usually formed from a single block of wood with its components hinged together. Triptychs generally followed the format and style of their larger-scale counterparts, with a central panel with major saints and two ancillary wings.&lt;ref name="l656"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

The polyptychs usually served as portable devices for laypersons, used for private devotion,&lt;ref name="w283"&gt;Wixom (1999), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; and their popularity reflects the growing affluence of merchants living in the major northern European ports. Their iconography often follows contemporary larger scale panel altarpieces,&lt;ref name="l85"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; with depictions of Christ Carrying the Cross, and the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Entry into Jerusalem]] as common subjects.&lt;ref name="ws171" /&gt; The altarpieces typically consist of three major elements; an architectural housing, interior reliefs, and a base or [[predella]], which may be fixed or detachable. In turn, each of these elements may have several components, which were either pinned or bound with glue.&lt;ref name="l65"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; They usually contain folding wings, within which the miniatures are carved in low relief, and often much smaller again figures and scenes around the borders of the central pictorial space.&lt;ref name="ws172"&gt;Wetter, Scholten (2017), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the larger fixed elements were connected with interlocking [[mortise and tenon]] joins cut into the slabs.&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt; 

A triptych altarpiece (MMA 17.190.453) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art has a compartment (receptacle) for holding [[relic]]s which is covered by a hinged disc.&lt;ref name="l85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prayer" /&gt; An especially detailed and complex 25.1 cm high triptych catalogued as WB.232 in the British Museum, credited to the workshop of Adam Dircksz, contains two triptychs on upper and lower registers. The upper, far larger register consists of a central panel with a background Crucifixion and numerous foreground figures; a [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment]] and other scenes are on the right-hand wing, while depictions of [[Christ Carrying the Cross]] and the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] are the main features of the left wing.&lt;ref name="WB232" /&gt;

[[File:Miniature Altarpiece with the Crucifixion (center).jpg|left|200px|thumb|"[[Miniature Altarpiece with the Crucifixion]]" (detail), early 16th century. Full height: 15 cm.

Retrieved 25 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The reliefs are typically positioned on a horizontal plane, and allow a long space between the tops of the figures and the end of the typically rounded overhead arches.&lt;ref name="l656" /&gt; The panels are usually quite shallow, with just enough depth in the [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] to position the figures, which can be either free-standing or carved in high relief. The niches vary in profile, with 
[[dome]] or mushroom shapes being most common.&lt;ref name="l68"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Other features, including architectural or landscape elements, were similarly inserted fully formed; in more elaborate and detailed examples, the reduced scale was too constrained to create all of the elements in relief.&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt; The approach also mirrors the practice employed by contemporary northern European artists working on full-scale altarpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Serck-Dewaide (1998), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the features of the miniatures resemble contemporary northern Gothic style architecture. Only the example, in the British Museum, contains an Italian Renaissance influence, evident in its [[baluster|baluster shafts]] and the [[pilaster]]s containing prophets on either side of the Crucifixion.&lt;ref name="m142" /&gt; The late 15th-century veneration for the [[Passion of Jesus]] and the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Sorrows of Mary]] had a strong bearing on the design and form of many of these types of altarpieces.&lt;ref name="t189"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the appeal of the Passion was the contrast between relatively simple scenes from the Life of Christ, juxtaposed against more complex scenes with detailed vistas, such as the Crucifixion or depictions of Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref name="t179"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Boxwood miniatures seemed to have served three original functions: aids to private devotion, luxury objects of status, and novel playthings. Later they became precious family heirlooms, passed from generation to generation, and as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost.&lt;ref name="es94"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|dukes of Bavaria]], which contain several boxwood miniatures.&lt;ref name="es934"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study and conservation==
Objects of this scale are difficult to view with the naked eye, and, even when held in hand, the true level of intricacy is not easily recognised.&lt;ref name="SuS" /&gt; The difficulty of producing magnified reproductions contributes to the fact that there has been comparatively little research into the format. Even traditional photography can fail to convey the true level of detail. Meaningful reproduction can only be achieved by computer modelling, where a series of photographs at various [[aperture|focal depths]] are [[Focus stacking|stacked]] to attain consistent sharpness.&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt;

Modern imaging technology has greatly improved the study of the objects since the late 20th century, including the use of x-ray.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Ellis, Lisa; Nelson, Andrew.

[[File:Battleofdorking.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Battle of Dorking'' (1871) triggered an explosion of invasion literature. Cover of a 1914 edition.]]

'''Invasion literature''' (or the '''invasion novel''') is a [[literary genre]] most notable between 1871 and the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914) but still practised to this day. The genre first became recognizable starting in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1871 with ''[[The Battle of Dorking]]'', a fictional account of an invasion of [[England]] by [[Germany]]. This short story was so popular it started a literary craze for tales that aroused imaginations and anxieties about hypothetical [[invasion]]s by foreign powers, and by 1914 the genre had amassed a corpus of over 400 books, many best-sellers, and a world-wide audience.&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiss|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics, national policies, and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War, and remains a part of popular culture to this day. Several of the books were written by or ghostwritten for military officers and experts of the day who believed that the nation would be saved if the particular tactic that they favoured was or would be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Echevarria |first=Antonio J. |title=Imagining Future War: The West's Technological Revolution and Visions of Wars to Come 1880–1914 |year=2007 |publisher=Prager Institute |location= |isbn=9780313051104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-"Dorking"==

Nearly a century before the invasion literature genre became a true popular phenomenon after the publication of ''The Battle of Dorking'' in the 1870s, a mini-boom of invasion stories appeared soon after the French developed the [[hot-air balloon]]. Poems and plays that centred on armies of balloons invading England could be found in France, and even America. However, it was not until the Prussians used advanced technologies such as [[rifled breech-loader|breech-loading artillery]] and railroads to defeat the French in the [[1870 War]] that the fear of invasion by a technologically superior enemy became more realistic.

==In Europe==

''The Battle of Dorking'' (1871) by [[George Tomkyns Chesney]] first appeared in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', a respected [[Victorian era|Victorian]] political journal read by important British politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick M Kirkwood, "The Impact of Fiction on Public Debate in Late Victorian Britain: The Battle of Dorking and the 'Lost Career' of Sir George Tomkyns Chesney," The Graduate History Review 4, No. 1 (Fall, 2012), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[short story]] describes the invasion of England by an unnamed enemy (who happen to speak [[German language|German]]), in which the narrator and 1,000 citizens defend the small English town of [[Dorking]], with no supplies or news of outside events. The story then moves forward in time 50 years and England is still devastated.

The author, like many of his countrymen at the time, was alarmed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s [[Franco-Prussian War|successful invasion of France]] in 1870, defeating Europe's largest army in only two months.&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; ''The Battle of Dorking'' was initially meant to shock readers into becoming more aware of the possible dangers of a foreign threat, but unwittingly created a new literary genre appealing to popular anxieties. The story was an immediate success, with one reviewer saying "We do not know that we ever saw anything better in any magazine... it describes exactly what we all feel."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; It was so popular that the magazine was re-printed six times, a new pamphlet version was created, dozens of spoofs were created, and it was for sale throughout the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; One [[running joke]] in England at the time was an injury, such as a bruise or scrape, being attributed to a wound received at the battle of Dorking.

Between the publication of ''The Battle of Dorking'' in 1871 and the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 there were hundreds of authors writing invasion literature, often topping the best seller lists in Germany, [[France]], England and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; During the period it is estimated over 400 invasion works were published. Probably the best known work was [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898), bearing plot similarities to ''The Battle of Dorking'' but with a [[science fiction theme]]. In 1907, Wells wrote ''[[The War in the Air]]'', a cautionary tale depicting purely human invasions: a German invasion of the US triggers off a worldwide chain of attacks and counter-attacks, leading to the destruction of all major cities and centers, the collapse of world economy, disintegration of all the fighting nations and the sinking of the world into new Middle Ages.

''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) also tapped into English fears of foreign forces arriving unopposed on its shores, although between 1870 and 1903 the majority of these works assumed that the enemy would be France, rather than Germany. This changed with the publication of [[Robert Erskine Childers|Erskine Childers]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]''. Often called the first modern [[spy novel]], two men on a sailing holiday thwart a German invasion of England when they discover a secret fleet of invasion barges assembling on the German coast. Of these hundreds of authors, few are in print now. [[Saki]] is one of the exceptions, although his 1913 novel ''[[When William Came]]'' (subtitled "A Story of London Under the [[Hohenzollerns]]") is more [[jingoistic]] than literary. Another is [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]], whose novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', published in 1915 but written just prior to the outbreak of World War I,  is a thriller dealing with German agents in Britain preparing for an invasion.

[[William Le Queux]] was the most prolific author of the genre; his first novel was ''[[The Great War in England in 1897]]'' (1894) and he went on to publish from one to twelve novels a year until his death in 1927. His work was regularly serialised in newspapers, particularly the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', and attracted many readers. It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2018}} [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] character was inspired by Le Queux's agent "Duckworth Drew". In some ways ''The Great War'' can be considered an antithesis to ''The Battle of Dorking'' – with the one ending for Britain in sombre and irrevocable defeat and decline, while in the other the invasion of [[London]] is pushed back in the last moment (with the help of [[Germany]], portrayed as a staunch ally against [[France]] and [[Russia]]), with enormous territorial aggrandizement (Britain gets [[Algeria]] and Russian [[Central Asia]]; "Britannia" becomes "Empress of the World").

Le Queux's most popular invasion novel was ''[[The Invasion of 1910]]'' (1906) which was translated into twenty-seven languages selling more than a million copies world-wide. Le Queux and his publisher changed the ending depending on the language, so in the German print edition the fatherland wins, while in the English edition the Germans lose. Le Queux was said to be [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]'s favorite author.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] parodied the genre in ''[[The Swoop!]]'', in which England is simultaneously invaded by nine different armies, including Switzerland and Germany. English elites appear to be more interested in a cricket tournament, and the country is eventually saved by a boy scout named Clarence.

==In Asia==
Invasion literature had its impact also in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], at the time undergoing a fast process of [[modernization]]. [[Shunrō Oshikawa]], a pioneer of Japanese [[science fiction]] and adventure stories (genres unknown in Japan until a few years earlier), published around the start of the 20th century the [[best-seller]] ''Kaitō Bōken Kidan: Kaitei Gunkan'' ("Undersea Battleship"): the story of an armoured,  [[ramming|ram]]-armed [[submarine]] involved in a [[future history]] of war between Japan and Russia. The novel reflected the [[imperialist]] ambitions of Japan at the time, and foreshadowed the [[Russo-Japanese War]] that followed a few years later, in 1904. When the actual war with Russia broke out, Oshikawa covered it as a journalist while also continuing to publish further volumes of fiction depicting Japanese imperial exploits set in the [[Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]] – which also proved an enormous success with the Japanese public. In a later career as a magazine editor, he also encouraged the writing of more fiction in the same vein by other Japanese authors.

Colonial [[Hong Kong]]'s earliest work of invasion literature is believed to have been the  1897 ''[[The Back Door (fiction)|The Back Door]]''. Published in serial form in a local English-language newspaper, it described a fictional French and Russian naval landing at [[Hong Kong Island]]'s [[Deep Water Bay]]; the story was intended to criticise the lack of [[British Empire|British]] funding for [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|the defence of Hong Kong]], and it is speculated that members of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] may have read the book in preparation for the 1941 [[Battle of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickley|first=Gillian| isbn = 962-209-526-7 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong, China|title=Hong Kong Invaded! A 97 Nightmare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the U.S.==
[[Image:Liberty-shall-not-perish-Pennell.jpeg|thumb|190px|[[Joseph Pennell]]'s 1918 [[Liberty bond]] poster calls up the pictorial image of an invaded, burning [[New York City]].]]
One of the earliest stories to appear in print in the U.S. was "The Stricken Nation" by [[Henry Grattan Donnelly]] published in 1890 in New York. It tells of a successful British invasion of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tales of the next great war |editor1-first=I. F. |editor1-last=Clarke |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=1995 |isbn=081562672X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move of American public opinion towards participation in [[World War I]] was reflected in ''Uncle Sam's Boys at The Invasion of the United States'' by [[H. Irving Hancock]]. This four-book series, published by the [[Henry Altemus Company]] in 1916, depicts a German invasion of the U.S. in 1920–1921. The plot seems to transfer the main story line of Le Queux's ''The Great War'' (with which the writer may have been familiar) to an American theatre: the Germans launch a surprise attack, capture [[Boston]] despite heroic resistance by "Uncle Sam's boys", overrun all of [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] and reach as far as [[Pittsburgh]] – but at last are gloriously crushed by fresh American forces.

==In Australia==

Australia's contribution to invasion literature was set against the background of pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] colonial fears of the "[[Yellow Peril]]" and the foundations of the [[White Australia policy]]. From the late 1880s through to the beginning of World War I, this fear was expressed in Australia through cartoons, poems, plays and novels. Three of the most well known of these novels were ''White or Yellow? A Story of the Race War of AD 1908'' (1888) by journalist [[William Lane]], ''The Yellow Wave'' (1895) by Kenneth Mackay and ''The Australian Crisis'' (1909) by Charles H. Kirmess (possibly a pseudonym for another Australian author Frank Fox). Each of these novels contained two major common themes which were a reflection of the fears and concerns within a contemporary Australian context; the Australian continent was at risk of major invasion from a strong Asian power (ie. China or Japan, sometimes with the assistance of the Russian Empire) and that the United Kingdom was apathetic towards the protection of its faraway colonies, and would not come to Australia's aid when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia and the Wider World: Selected Essays of Neville Meaney |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Curran |editor2-first=Stuart |editor2-last=Ward |publisher=Sydney University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9781743320259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War I==

The "[[First Red Scare]]" following [[World War I]] produced [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s ''[[The Moon Maid|The Moon Men]]'' (1925), a depiction of Earth (and specifically, the United States) under the rule of cruel invaders from the [[Moon]]. This book is known to have been originally written as ''Under the Red Flag'', an explicit [[anti-Communist]] novel, and when rejected by the publishers in that form it was successfully "recycled" by Burroughs as science fiction.

[[Ivan Petrushevich]]'s "[[The Flying Submarine]]" (1922), depicted an invasion of The United Kingdom by Soviet forces after most of Europe and Asia had fallen to communism. The story features the British fleet being destroyed by a swarm of insect-like single pilot submarines which can emerge from the water to attack their foes.  

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (1941) told the story of the invasion and conquest of the United States by the technologically advanced PanAsians, and the subsequent guerrilla struggle to overthrow them with even more advanced technology.

==After World War II==

Fears of Communist invasion became even more pronounced in books like [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' (1951) and films like ''[[Invasion U.S.A. (1952 film)|Invasion USA]]'' (1953) and a Department of Defense information film released to the general public ''[[Red Nightmare]]'' (1957). A more explicit Soviet invasion and occupation is depicted in [[Jerry Sohl]]'s'' [[Point Ultimate]]'' (1955) – where the United States lies prostrate under cruel and degenerate Soviet occupiers, helped by "Commie" American collaborators – but a band of undaunted rebels manage the improbable feat of launching an extensive space program under the Soviets' noses, colonising [[Mars]] and using it as a base of operations. Similar themes were continued in the 1980s with the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' (1984) and TV miniseries ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'' (1987).

During the 1960s, the enemy was changed from the Soviet Union to [[China|Red China]] where China was shown as behind plots to destroy the American economy with a nuclear weapon in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), instigating a war between the USA and USSR in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and invading the United States from tunnels dug beneath the ocean in ''[[Battle Beneath the Earth]]'' (1967).

In 1971, when realization of losing the [[Vietnam War]] was sinking into the American consciousness, two books appeared almost simultaneously, both depicting a United States under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation. In ''[[Vandenberg (novel)|Vandenberg]]'' by [[Oliver Lange]] – written, like "Dorking", as a cautionary tale – most Americans accept Soviet overlordship without much protest, the only resistance coming from a group of oddballs in a corner of [[New Mexico]]. In contrast, in [[John Ball (American author)|John Ball]]'s ''[[The First Team (novel)|The First Team]]'' – as in "The Great War" – a seemingly hopeless situation is retrieved by a band of courageous patriots with the book ending on a note of uplifting liberation. The ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' TV miniseries, depicting a Soviet-occupied US, was aired in 1987 - a time when [[Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] already rendered its theme highly implausible.  

The [[Tomorrow series|''Tomorrow'' series]] by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], published between 1993 and 1999, detail an invasion of [[Australia]] by an unnamed country from the perspective of a band of teenage [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]].

==Political impact==
Stories of a planned German invasion rose to increasing political prominence from 1906. Taking their inspiration from the stories of Le Queux and Childers, hundreds of ordinary citizens began to suspect foreigners of espionage. This trend was accentuated by Le Queux, who collected 'sightings' brought to his attention by readers and raised them through his association with the Daily Mail. Subsequent research has since shown that no significant German espionage network existed in Britain at this time. Claims about the scale of German invasion preparations grew increasingly ambitious. The number of German spies was put at between 60,000 and 300,000 (in spite of the total German community in Britain being no more than 44,000&amp;nbsp;people). It was alleged that thousands of rifles were being stockpiled by German spies in order to arm saboteurs at the outbreak of war.

Calls for government action grew ever more intense, and in 1909 it was given as the reason for the secret foundation of the [[Secret Service Bureau]], the forerunner of [[MI5]] and [[MI6]]. Historians today debate whether this was in fact the real reason, but in any case the concerns raised in invasion literature came to define the early duties of the Bureau's Home Section. [[Vernon Kell]], the section head, remained obsessed with the location of these saboteurs, focusing his operational plans both before and during the war on defeating the saboteurs imagined by Le Queux.

Invasion literature was not without detractors; policy experts in the years preceding the First World War said invasion literature risked inciting war between England and Germany and France. Critics such as [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] denounced Le Queux's ''[[The Invasion of 1910]]'' as "calculated to inflame public opinion abroad and alarm the more ignorant public at home."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt;  Journalist [[Charles Lowe (journalist)|Charles Lowe]] wrote in 1910: "Among all the causes contributing to the continuance of a state of bad blood between England and Germany perhaps the most potent is the baneful industry of those unscrupulous writers who are forever asserting that the Germans are only awaiting a fitting opportunity to attack us in our island home and burst us up."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt;

'''Kurt Walter Bachstitz''' (4 October 1882 – 1949 in [[The Hague]]) was a [[Germany|German]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[art dealer]]. He died shortly before his naturalization to the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name="libmma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libmma.org/digital_files/archives/Bachstitz_records_b18041048.pdf|title=Bachstitz, Inc. records, 1923-1937|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Archives|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.2|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General Information==

===Until Emigration 1938===
Bachstitz was born as the child of the Jewish couple Liber Jacob Bachstitz and Mathilde Markowitz. His place of birth is arguable. All contemporary sources mention the formerly German [[Breslau]] (the present-day Polish [[Wrocław]]) as his place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189; Central Bureau for Genealogy, The Hague, Calmery archive, Bachstitz file&lt;/ref&gt; But Bachstitz requested for himself the Austrian village Raipoltenbach as his place of birth when he claimed at the U.S. Department of Labor for an extension of his temporary stay in 1931.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt; He studied architecture in [[Paris]], [[London]] and [[Vienna]] where he finished his studies with a diploma. On the outbreak of the [[First World War]] he was called up for military service and served between 1914 and 1918 as an officer, lastly in the rank of a troop captain. He served actively in the field until 1916, when he was severely wounded.&lt;ref&gt;NA, Ministry of Justice, naturalization files, access code 2.09.22, inv. no. 13533, no. 2189&lt;/ref&gt; He married Elfriede Pesé (died in 1918) with whom he had two children – a son Walter Werner Michael who died in 1943 by tuberculosis in [[Switzerland]] and a daughter, Margit Martha&lt;ref&gt;File RC 1.78, estate inventory (via Ministry of Finance, inheritance tax returns)&lt;/ref&gt; who died in [[South Africa]] in 1982. On 19 December 1918 he married his second wife Elisa ("Lilly") Emma Hofer. Lilly was a [[Protestant]]. Because of her Bachstitz converted to the evangelic faith.&lt;ref&gt;NA, SNK 178, Bachstitz file, draft letter from Bogisch to Weyma, undated&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he apparently lived and traded in Munich. In his diary [[Thomas Mann]] wrote about a meeting in Bachstitz' Munich apartment, where Mann bought a work from Bachstitz. He described him quite prerogatively as a "blond-Jewish" example of an "international culture-capitalistic profiteer".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mann Tagebücher, 1918–1921, herausgegeben von Peter de Mendelssohn, Frankfurt/M. 1979, {{ISBN|978-3-10-048192-4}}, S. 143 – 145 '"Der Mensch, blond-jüdisch und elegant, Mitte dreißig, mit Monokel und fetten, weißen, manikürten Händen, in gesteppter Hausjacke und Lackhausschuhen, wunderbar als Typus des international-kultur-kapitalistischen Schiebertums."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he established an art dealership in the Hague named Kunsthandel K.W. Bachstitz (Bachstitz Gallery N.V.). Surinamestraat 11, He lived in Vienna and in [[Berlin]] and he created an internationally known company with art galleries in The Hague, [[New York City]] and Berlin. Lilly was the sister of art dealer [[Walter Hofer|Walter Andreas Hofer]] who had managed the Gallery in The Hague for a while and subsequently became an art buyer for [[Hermann Göring]].

In 1937 Bachstitz waived his Austrian citizenship. In 1938 the couple moved to The Hague.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;

===World War II===

Between the beginning of the German occupation in 1940 and 1941 Bachstitz sold a number of paintings to the "[[:de:Sonderauftrag Linz|Sondernauftrag Linz]]" that was run by [[Hitler]]'s Special Representative of the planned '[[Führermuseum]]' in Linz,&lt;ref&gt;Looted Art Commission.

In February 1941 Bachstitz officially resigned as supervisory director of the Bachstitz Gallery and his wife became the managing director. Together with his wife, he continued to provide a clandestine management role. In this way, they avoided having the Gallery placed under the forced administration for the duration of the war. According to the documents in the file concerning his successful application to become a Dutchman after the war&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, ministerie van justitie (1915–1955), inv. No. 13533 (1646)&lt;/ref&gt; the couple provided undercover protection for Jews trying to escape the authorities.

In 1942 Bachstitz was summoned by the occupation authority (the "Wirtschaftsamt") as he had failed to register the gallery as "non-Aryan property". Proceedings were commenced against him and he was arrested by the [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) in July 1943 and imprisoned in the Scheveningen prison in The Hague. Due to an intervention of Göring initiated by Bachstitz' brother-in-law Hofer, he was released from prison. He was then also exempted from wearing the Star of David. Furthermore, the couple had their marriage dissolved in September 1943 to prevent the confiscation of the gallery by the occupying authority.

Between 1942 und 1944 Bachstitz sold a number of works to the museums that were run by [[Kurt Martin]], the head of the Museums of the Upper Rhine (Alsace and Baden) under [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostart.de/Webs/DE/Datenbank/SucheMeldungDetail.html?resourceId=4348&amp;input_=4340&amp;pageLocale=de&amp;person=&amp;titelbesch=&amp;datierung=&amp;objektart=-1&amp;objektart.GROUP=1&amp;mattech=&amp;provsamml=kurt+martin&amp;institution=&amp;ort=&amp;id=&amp;type=DetailVerlust&amp;type.GROUP=1&amp;suche_typ=MeldungDetail&amp;suche_typ.HASH=01c6e21bb090266af660&amp;suchen=Suchen  10 Search Requests at www.lostart.de, latest view June 11, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944 Bachstitz managed to obtain permission to leave the Netherlands and he emigrated to Switzerland, again with the help of Andreas Hofer.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.6|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a bribe for the exit visa Bachstitz had to hand over art to Hermann Göring, namely a painting with the Samson and Delilah motive by [[Jan Steen]],&lt;ref&gt;US-NARA, RG 260, M1946. Roll 127.

===After The War - Successful and Unsuccessful Restitution Efforts===

After the war the Allies returned most of the art that the gallery had sold to German authorities to the Netherlands. The Netherlands restituted the painting by Jan Steen&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA, Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK), 2.08.42.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected an application for the restitution of the other works. They became part of the Collection of the Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit (SNK). Kurt Walter Bachsitz and Lilly Bachstitz-Hofer were again registered as officially married. Kurt Walter Bachstitz died in 1949. In 1951 his widow liquidated the Bachstitz Gallery N.V. with a high deficit.&lt;ref&gt;NL-NA 2.09.16, Nederlands Beheers Instituut NBI, inv.no. 2168, Note Kesselaar NBI 16 December 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery's art library was auctioned off.&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/artlibrary00inte|title=Art library of the late K.W.

In 2009 the Dutch government restituted the painting "Roman Capriccio" by [[Pietro Capelli]] from the stock of the SNK to Kurt Walter Bachstitz' grandchildren.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.18|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Restitution Committee of the Netherlands denied though a restitution claim concerning a number of other works, among them the works sold to Hitler (Sonderauftrag Linz). In view of most of these works the Committee argued that these sales had not been made under duress because Kurt Walter Bachstitz had been left "undisturbed" in 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref name="libmma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.restitutiecommissie.nl/adviezen/advies_178.html|title=Bachstitz, Restitution Commission of the Netherlands, Az RC 1.78, Consideration No.5|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The grandchildren applied in 2013 for the re-opening of the case in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;Act RC 4.138&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Prussian Heritage Foundation restituted a Tyrolean gothic wall-mounted writing slate (c. 1500) and a large 16th-century Italian bronze mortar.&lt;ref name="preussischer-kulturbesitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preussischer-kulturbesitz.de/pressemitteilung/news/2013/07/09/berliner-kunstgewerbemuseum-restituiert-zwei-werke-an-die-erben-des-kunsthaendlers-bachstitz.html|title=Berliner Kunstgewerbemuseum restituiert zwei Werke an die Erben des Kunsthändlers Bachstitz - Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz|publisher=preussischer-kulturbesitz.de|accessdate=2015-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lamentation (Pietà)''''' (also ''Lamentation Over The Dead Christ'') is an oil-on-panel painting of the common subject of the [[Lamentation of Christ]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painter]] [[Petrus Christus]], painted in c. 1444. It is now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris.

==History==
Bought by the Louvre in 1951 from the Schloss Fuschl Collection for 5000000 [[French francs]],&lt;ref&gt;For this collection see also refs at "[[Stefan Schörghuber]]"&lt;/ref&gt; this work of the Flemish artist belongs to a groups of paintings in which the [[Italian art|Italian]] influence is clearly visible: see for instance, the ''[[Commons:File:Petrus christus, deposizione di new york.jpg|Entombment]]'', the ''[[Nativity (Christus)|Nativity]]'', the ''[[Commons:File:Petrus Christus Death of the Virgin.jpg|Death of the Virgin]]'', and the ''[[Commons:File:Petrus christus, ritratto d'uomo, 1465 ca..JPG|Portrait of a Man]]''.

[[Petrus Christus]], working at [[Bruges]], continued to paint in the style of [[Jan van Eyck]] at a time when most Flemish artists had abandoned this manner in favour of [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s more dramatic and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] character. He seems to have visited [[Italy]] some time between 1454 and 1462, and various factors suggest that he may have travelled as far as the south of Italy: [[Antonello da Messina]]'s influence on him, for example, together with the presence of paintings from his hand in [[Sicily]] as early as the 16th century, and certain affinities between his work and that of the School of [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Faggin, ''Petrus Christus'', Fabbri Group (1966), pp.9-12.&lt;/ref&gt; He may possibly have contributed to the introduction of the Flemish technique of painting into Italy.

The artist's early manner was dry and awkward, with a tendency towards [[archaism]], but under the beneficial influence of Antonello his work gained in suppleness, revealing a new sense of harmony and rhythm in the compositions, a monumental conception of the figures, and a certain proud dignity of facial expression. The [[Louvre]] painting has all these characteristics: the landscape is painted in broad planes, and the diagonal arrangement of the heads and the delicate arabesque on Christ's body contribute to the subtlety of the composition. The Virgin's head is a perfect oval, in the manner of [[Antonello da Messina]]; [[John the Evangelist|St. John]]'s square-cut face, with his determined jaw, recalls that artist's portraits, and the woman's head seen in profile (very rare in the work of Flemish artists) is also reminiscent of certain heads by Italian painters.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Upton, ''Petrus Christus: His Place in Fifteenth-Century Flemish Painting'', Pennsylvania State University Press (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Goûter''''', also known as '''''Tea Time''''' (''Tea-Time''), and '''''Femme à la Cuillère''''' (''Woman with a teaspoon'') is an oil painting created in 1911 by the French artist and theorist [[Jean Metzinger]] (1883–1956). It was exhibited in Paris at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1911, and the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]], 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/viewer/exhibit-catalog-salon-de-la-section-dor-15197 Exhibit catalog for Salon de "La Section d'Or", 1912, Jean Metzinger, ''Le goûter (Tea Time)'', p. 11, no. 115.

==Description==
''Tea Time'' is an oil painting on cardboard with dimensions 75.9 x 70.2&amp;nbsp;cm (29.9 x 27.6 in), signed Metzinger and dated 1911 lower right. The painting represents a barely draped (nude) woman holding a spoon, seated at a table with a cup of tea. In the 'background', the upper left quadrant, stands a vase on a commode, table or shelf. A square or cubic shape, a chair or painting behind the model, espouses the shape of the stretcher. The painting is practically square, like the side of a cube. The woman's head is highly stylized, divided into geometrized facets, planes and curves (the forehead, nose, cheeks, hair). The source of light appears to be off to her right, with some reflected light on the left side of her face. Reflected light, consistently, can be seen on other parts of her body (breast, shoulder, arm). Her breast is composed of a triangle and a sphere. The faceting of the rest of her body, to some extent, coincides with actual muscular and skeletal features (collar bone, ribcage, pectorals, deltoids, neck tissue). Both of here shoulders are coupled with elements of the background, superimposed, gradational and transparent to varying degrees. Unidentified elements are composed of alternating angular structures, The colors employed by Metzinger are subdued, mixed (either on a palette of directly on the surface), with an overall natural allure. The brushwork is reminiscent of Metzinger's [[Divisionist]] period (ca. 1903–1907), described by the critic ([[Louis Vauxcelles]]) in 1907 as large, mosaic-like 'cubes', used to construct small but highly symbolic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.all-art.org/art_20th_century/metzinger1.html Art of the 20th Century, Louis Vauxcelles, 1907, describes the brushwork of Delaunay and Metzinger as mosaic-like 'cubes']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman in a Green Hat (by Paul Cézanne, 1894-95).jpg|thumb|left|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''Femme au Chapeau Vert'' (Woman in a Green Hat. Madame Cézanne), 1894–1895, oil on canvas, 100.3 x 81.3 cm, The [[Barnes Foundation]], Merion, PA]]
The figure, centrally positioned, is shown both staring at the viewer and gazing off to the right (to her left), i.e., she is seen both straight on and in profile position. The tea cup is visible both from the top and side simultaneously, as if the artist physically moved around the subject to capture it simultaneously from several angles and at successive moments in time.

"This interplay of visual, tactile, and motor spaces is fully operative in Metzinger's ''Le Gouter'' of 1911", write Antliff and Leighten, "an image of an artist's model, semi-nude, with a cloth draped over her right arm as she takes a break between sessions [...] her right hand delicately suspends the spoon between cup and mouth." The combination of frames captured at successive time intervals is given play, pictorially, in simultaneous conflation of moments in time throughout the work. The Cézannian volumes and planes (cones, cubes and spheres) extend ubiquitously across the manifold, merging the sitter and surroundings. The painting becomes a product of experience, memory and imagination, evoking a complex series of mind-associations between past present and future, between tactile and olfactory sensations (taste and touch), between the physical and metaphysical.&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten"&gt;Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, ''Cubism and Culture'', Thames &amp; Hudson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less radical than Metzinger's 1910 ''Nude''—which is closely related to the work of Picasso and Braque of the same year—from the viewpoint of faceting of the represented subject matter, ''Le goûter'' is much more carefully constructed in relation to the overall shape of the picture frame. "Not only was this painting more unequivocally classical in its pedigree (and recognized as such by critics who instantly dubbed it 'La Joconde cubiste') than any of its now relatively distant sources in Picasso's oeuvre," writes David Cottington, "but in its clear if tacit juxtaposition, remarked on by Green and others, of sensation and idea—taste and geometry—it exemplified the interpretation of innovations from both wings of the cubist movement that Metzinger was offering in his essays of the time, as well as the paradigm shift from a perceptual to a conceptual painting that he recognized as now common to them."&lt;ref name="David Cottington"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=Jean+Metzinger,+1910,+1911,+1912&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rm0CrcbXtN&amp;sig=a9Kf-dUKbXYjZbmLDg16tto5U0o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=horse&amp;f=false David Cottington, 2004, Cubism and its Histories], Manchester University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The quite atmosphere of ''Tea Time'' "seduces by means of the bridge it creates between two periods", according to Eimert and Podksik, "although Metzinger's style had already passed through an analytical phase, it now concentrated more on the idea of reconciling modernity with classical subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, Dorothea Eimert, Anatoli Podoksik, ''Cubism'', 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-78042-800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1912 ''Anecdotal History of Cubism'' [[André Salmon]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay painted landscapes planted with cottages reduced to the severe appearance of [[parallelepiped]]s. Living less of an interior life than Picasso, remaining to all outward appearances more like painters than their precursor, these young artists were in a much greater hurry for results, though they be less complete. [...]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Exhibited, their works passed almost unobserved by the public and by art critics, who ... recognized only the Fauves, whether it be to praise or to curse to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the king of the Fauves ... Henri Matisse ... with one word cast out Jean Metzinger and Robert Delaunay from the family. With that feminine sense of the appropriate, the basis of his taste, he baptized the cottages of the two painters, "Cubist." An ingenuous or ingenious art critic was with him. He ran to his newspaper and with style wrote the gospel article; the next day the public learned of the birth of Cubism.

In ''L'Art Vivant'' Salmon quotes a statement made by Metzinger in defense of himself and Picasso: 'Before us, no painter had the desire to feel the objects he painted' [''"Avant nous, aucun peintre n'avait eu le souci de palper les objets qu'il peignait"''] (Jean Metzinger).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www16.us.archive.org/stream/lartvivant00salm/lartvivant00salm_djvu.txt André Salmon, ''Artistes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui'', L'Art Vivant, Paris, Sixième Édition, Les Édition G.

Crès, Paris, 1920 p. 117]&lt;/ref&gt; What Metzinger probably refers to is that unlike the artists before them, he and Picasso move around their models and subjects, capturing not just one vision but many, capturing the full essence of their subject matter, if not all of its characteristics and properties. "Palper", or to 'palpate the objects' is more than just 'feel', it is to examine or explore by touch, a method of examination in which the artist feels size or shape or firmness or location of something, it implies volume, it involves a sense, just as taste. This text can also be found in ''André Salmon on French Modern Art'', translated as: "We have never had the curiosity to touch the objects we were painting."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BngwOaFvEecC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=in+L'Art+Vivant,+salmon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bdzyLgnD0b&amp;sig=UzNVh2hTYpcbIT2fUn1kNoQJDaQ&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false ''André Salmon on French Modern Art'', edited and translated by Beth S. Gersh-Nešić, Cambridge University Press, 2005], {{ISBN|0-521-85658-2}}, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; This translation of Metzinger's statement is obviously erroneous, and in fact says almost the exactly opposite of what was meant (and indeed what was said) in French.

And too in L'Art Vivant, André Salmon writes about ''Le Goûter'': 'It was Metzinger who attempted and was tempted by freedom. Savant in grace, he exhibited a painting we named the Mona Lisa of Cubism' ["''C'est Metzinger qui tenta et que tenta la liberté. Savant en la grâce, il exposa une toile qu'on baptisa la Joconde du cubisme"''].&lt;ref name="André Salmon" /&gt;

In his 1920 essay, André Salmon again quotes Metzinger's statement: "Jamais, jusqu’a ce jour, les peintres n’avaient eu la curiosité de ''toucher'' les objets dont ils prétendaient traduire l’apparence".&lt;ref name="Salmon 1920"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/lartvivant00salm#page/136/mode/2up André Salmon, ''Artistes d'hier et d'aujourd'hui'', L'Art Vivant, Paris, Sixième Édition, Les Édition G. Crès, Paris, 1920, pp. 136-137]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Salmon, Metzinger's reference to "touching" (''toucher'') the objects they attempted to represent, was a means by which to show all the sides, every aspect, each view-point, each element of the surface of the object [[Simultaneity|simultaneously]] ("toutes les faces d'un objet à la fois").&lt;ref name="Salmon p.117" /&gt;

''Tea Time'' was meant, according to A. Miller "as a representation of the fourth dimension. [...] It is straight forward multiple viewing, as if the artist were moving around his subject."&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, A., 2002, ''Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc'', Basic Books, New York, 2001, pp. 167-168&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' written the following year does not mention the fourth dimension explicitly. 'To establish pictorial space', write Metzinger and Gleizes, 'we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed to all our faculties. It is our whole personality, contracting or dilating, that transforms the plane of the picture. Since in reaction this plane reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912. English edition: ''Cubism'', Unwin, London, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/161062/rec/5 John Canaday, ''Metropolitan seminars in art: great periods in painting'', Metropolitan Museum of Art Publications, 1959, Fig. 13, pp. 17-18]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Le Goûter'' was hailed as a breakthrough... "and opened the eyes of [[Juan Gris]] to the possibilities of mathematics", wrote Richardson (1996).&lt;ref&gt;Richardson. J., ''A Life of Picasso: The Cubist Rebel, 1907–1916 (Vol 2)'', Random House, New York 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-375-71150-3}}, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Principally due to the repercussions of ''Tea Time'', Metzinger's publications and his high-profile status at the [[Salon d'Automne]] and [[Salon des Indépendants]] (and in the general absence of Picasso and Braque from large public exhibitions), he became the leader of the Cubist movement (simultaneously as a painter, theorist, spokesperson and writer).&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt; The showing at the 1911 Salon d'Automne prompted Salmon to refer to Metzinger as "the young prince of Cubism".&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, p. 29], {{ISBN|0300053746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is certainly a parallel to be drawn," writes the art historian Peter Brooke in a letter to Miller, "between [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s attempt to reconcile the different viewpoints from which mathematical calculations can be made ('all reference points') and the multiple perspective of the Cubists, attempting to establish what Metzinger called (in 1910) a 'total image'. In both cases, however," Brooke continues, "what was achieved was not the longed for reconciliation of the conventions but simply the addition of another convention—very short-lived in the case of the artists.&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/othertxts/miller Peter Brooke, Letter to Arthur Miller], A commentary on Arthur Miller's book ''Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc''&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of walking round an object to see it from different angles is treated in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' as just another convention. Miller takes this as the central theme in ''Du "Cubisme"'' (p.258 &lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;). The concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) ''"to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time"'' was also developed by Metzinger in his 1911 article,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Cubisme et tradition'', Paris-Journal, 16 August 1911&lt;/ref&gt; and to some extent in an article entitled ''Note sur la peinture'', published in ''Pan'', 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger, ''Note sur la peinture'', Pan (Paris), October–November 1910&lt;/ref&gt; As Brooke points out, "although it is certainly one of the central ideas in Metzinger's 1910 ''Note sur la Peinture'', in ''Du "Cubisme"'' its just treated as another convention which has shocked the public but which the public will eventually come to accept.&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;

==Creative intuition (and taste)==
[[File:Fantasio, 15 October 1911, Albert Gleizes, Portrait of Jacques Nayral, Jean Metzinger, Le Gouter, Tea Time, 1911...jpg|thumb|right|240px|Page from the periodical ''Fantasio'', 15 October 1911, featuring ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral'' by Albert Gleizes (1911) and ''Le goûter (Tea Time)'' by Jean Metzinger]]
Pictorial space has been transformed by the artist into the temporal flow of consciousness. Quantity has morphed into quality, creating a 'qualitative space', "the pictorial analogue", write Antliff and Leighten, "to both time and space: temporal heterogeneity and the new geometries." In accord with this view of pictorial space, Metzinger and Gleizes encouraged artists to discard classical perspective and replace it with ''creative intuition''. "Creative intuition is manifest in an artist's faculty of discernment, or 'taste', which coordinates all other sensations." Antliff and Leighten continue, "As we have seen Metzinger celebrated this faculty in ''Le Gouter'', and Apollinaire advised artists to rely on their 'intuition' in ''The Cubist Painters'' (1913)."&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Méditations esthétiques. Les peintres cubistes'', Paris, 1913&lt;/ref&gt;

Metzinger's interests in proportion, mathematical order, and his emphasis on geometry, are well documented.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; But it was his personal taste (''gout'' in French) that sets Metzinger's work apart from both the Salon Cubists and those of [[Montmartre]]. While ''taste'' in ''Tea Time'' was denoted by one of the five senses, it was also connoted (for those who could read it) as a quality of discernment and subjective judgement.&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt; ''Le gouter'' translates to 'afternoon snack' but also alludes to 'taste' in an abstract sense. This painting, writes Christopher Green, "can seem the outcome of a meditation on intelligence and the senses, conception and sensation. The word in French for tea-time is "le goûter"; as a verb. "goûter" refers to the experience of tasting.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

A page from the periodical ''Fantasio'', 15 October 1911, by [[Roland Dorgelès]], features ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait de Jacques Nayral]]'' by Albert Gleizes (1911) and ''Le goûter (Tea Time)'' by Jean Metzinger, juxtaposed with images of unidentified models, the man with his knees crossed and a book on his lap, the woman (clothed) holding a spoon and a tea cup, as if the sitters. The commentary is heavily ironic, with the headline reading ''Ce que disent les cubes...'' (''What the cubes say...'').&lt;ref name="C. Green"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vlY6SLmg-xEC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;lpg=PA292&amp;dq=%22Ce+que+disent+les+cubes%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jv-kMTnDPc&amp;sig=Xm5vXAYC1FrTKnqoPdOftHqE1Ck&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=fantasio&amp;f=false Christopher Green, ''Art in France: 1900-1940'', Yale University Press, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kubisme"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt502.html Kubisme.info, Albert Gleizes en Jean Metzinger]&lt;/ref&gt;

This painting was reproduced in ''Fantasio'': published 15 October 1911, for the occasion of the ''Salon d'Automne'' where it was exhibited the same year. Also exhibited at Salon de ‘La Section d'Or’, Galerie La Boëtie, Paris, October 1912]]
The complex forms that defined Metzinger's paintings of the period serve to ''suggest'' the underlying imagery (e.g., a nude, a horse, a dancer, a café-concert), rather than ''define'' the imagery; arousing the viewer's own creative intuition to decipher the 'total image.' This meant too, inversely, that the creative intuition of the artist would be aroused. No longer did the artist have to define or reproduce, painstakingly, the subject matter of a painting. The artist became to a large extent free, ''libre'', to place lines, shapes, forms and colors onto the painting according to his or her own creative intuition.

A similar concept lies behind Albert Gleizes' portrait of his friend, neo-Symbolist writer Joseph Houot, pen name ''Jacques Nayral'', who in 1912 would marry Mireille Gleizes, the sister of Albert Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Kubisme" /&gt; Along with Metzinger's ''Tea Time'', Gleizes' ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral (Gleizes)|Portrait de Jacques Nayral]]'', painted the same year, exemplifies ideas and opinions formulated between 1910 and 1911 that would soon be codified in ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' (1912). According to Gleizes, both the content and form in this painting were the result of mind associations as he completed the work from ''memory''; something that would play a crucial role in the works of other Cubists, such as [[Fernand Léger]], [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, ''Du "Cubisme"'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: ''Cubism'', Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt; More so than an 'objective' view of the real-world, Jacques Nayral valorized subjective experience and expression. He embraced an anti-rationalist and anti-positivist world-view, consistent with concepts that underscored Cubist philosophies. Nayral's interest in philosophy led him to correspond with [[Henri Bergson]], someone who would greatly inspire both Metzinger and Gleizes. Nayral's related interest in avant-garde art led him to purchase Metzinger's large 1912 oil on canvas entitled ''[[La Femme au Cheval]]'', also known as ''Woman with a Horse'' (Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen). Nayral's association with Gleizes led him to write the Preface for the Cubist exhibition at Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona (April–May 2012).&lt;ref name="Antliff and Leighten" /&gt;

The following edition of ''Fantasio'' (1 November 1911) began with ''"A Consultation at the Salon d'Automne"'' by Roland Catenoy; a suppository report of a walk around the Grand Palais accompanied by two medical men who offer their 'diagnosis' of the paintings on display. A climax is attained in the presence of Metzinger's ''Le goûter'': a "cubisticall nude woman" who presents all the symptoms of "lithopocdion", otherwise only previously seen in petrified fetuses; she is beyond treatment and close to death."&lt;ref name="Green et al"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Fantasio%22,+1911+metzinger,+gleizes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=olI8BJEmyD&amp;sig=aTz-aY7MmObuz9t440FV7W5so8o&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fantasio%22%2C%201911%20metzinger%2C%20gleizes&amp;f=true Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, ''Juan Gris: &amp;#91;catalogue of the Exhibition&amp;#93;'', 1992, London and Otterlo]&lt;/ref&gt;

"These two responses to Metzinger and the other Cubists at the 1911 Automne have one theme in common:" writes Green ''et al.'', "the absurdity of the gap between Cubist painting and appearance. Just as [[Louis Vauxcelles]] made the Cubists' repudiation of "current vision" (appearances in nature) the crux of his attacks, so most of the jokes in the press at the expense of Cubism centered on the question of likeness. If Metzinger's ''Tea-Time'' was not like its sitter, what could it mean? Surely nothing."&lt;ref name="Green et al" /&gt;

Guillaume Apollinaire reviewing the Cubist room at the Salon d'Automne of 1911 (in ''L'Intransigeant'') writes: 'Gleizes shows us the two sides of his great talent: invention and observation. Take the example of ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral'', there is good resemblance, but there is nothing [not one form or color] in this impressive painting that has not been invented by the artist. The portrait has a grandiose appearance that should not escape the notice of connoisseurs.'&lt;ref name="Tate"/&gt;

==Gleizes on Tea Time==
In his memoirs, Albert Gleizes writes of the structure of Tea Time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'The construction of his painting turns on the orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself. Already we can see, as a consequence of this movement introduced into an art which, we were told, had no relation to movement, a plurality of perspective points. These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while with the other hand she lifts a spoon to her lips. It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20two/picasso Peter Brooke, ''Part Two: On "Cubism" and other painters. Picasso and Braque. Gleizes v. Metzinger.

Peter Brooke writes of Metzinger's ''Tea-Time'': "The whole is inscribed in a beautifully {{Sic|hide=y|con|tructed}} armature of straight lines and curves whose relation to each other is not determined by the figuration (the woman enjoying her tea) but interweaves with it in a manner that is entirely intelligible. We can see clearly how the lines interact with each other."&lt;ref name="P. Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/contents Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context'', online since 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Life of Picasso'', John Richardson writes that Tea-Time persuaded [[Juan Gris]] of the importance of mathematics (numbers) in painting.&lt;ref&gt;''John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, volume II, 1907–1917'', ''The Painter of Modern Life'', Jonathan Cape, London, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; As Brooke points out, Gris started painting persistently in 1911 and first exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso''). "He appears with two styles", writes Brooke, "In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the ''Goûter'' and of Metzinger's later work in 1912."&lt;ref name="P. Brooke" /&gt;

[[:fr:Roger Allard|Roger Allard]] remarked that the general public viewing the works Metzinger, Gleizes and Le Fauconnier at the Salon d'Automne of 1910 found the "deformation of lines" less humorous than the "deformation of color", except with regards to the human face.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=juan+gris+portrait+of+Picasso,+Metzinger+tea-time&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=olI9AEClvD&amp;sig=UXMvAvrJdtcDhOL8XJd72h_zVO0&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=juan%20gris%20portrait%20of%20Picasso%2C%20Metzinger%20tea-time&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, ''Juan Gris: &amp;#91;catalogue of the Exhibition&amp;#93;'', 1992, London and Otterlo, p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Green writes that the "deformations of lines" allowed by mobile perspective in the head of Metzinger's ''Tea-time'' and Gleizes's Jacques Nayral "have seemed tentative to historians of Cubism. In 1911, as the key area of likeness and unlikeness, they more than anything released the laughter." Green continues, "This was the wider context of Gris's decision at the Indépendants of 1912 to make his debut with a ''Homage to Pablo Picasso'', which was a portrait, and to do so with a portrait that responded to Picasso's portraits of 1910 through the intermediary of Metzinger's ''Tea-time''.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Green" /&gt;

Just before the 1911 Salon d'Automne—Metzinger had already placed the last brushstroke of paint of ''Tea Time''—Gleizes published a major article&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''L'Art et ses représentants. Jean Metzinger'', Revue Indépendante, Paris, September, 1911, pp. 161–172&lt;/ref&gt; about Metzinger, within which he argued that 'representation' was fundamental, but that Metzinger's intention was 'to inscribe the total image'. This total image 'combined the evidence of perception with 'a new truth, born from what his intelligence permits him to know'. Such 'intelligent' knowledge, writes Green, "was the accumulation of an all-round study of things, and so it was conveyed by the combination of multiple viewpoints in a single image." He continues, "This accumulation of fragmented aspects would be given 'equilibrium' by a geometric, a 'cubic' structure. Metzinger's Tea-time, a work that attracted much attention at the Salon d'automne of 1911, is like a pictorial demonstration of Gleizes's text. Multiple perspectives and a firm overall geometric structure (almost a grid) take control of a near pornographic subject: 'intelligence' subdues the senses."&lt;ref name="C. Green" /&gt;

The Cubists had become by 1911 a legitimate target for critical disdain and satirical wit. "The cubists play a role in art today analogous to that sustained so effectively in the political and social arena by the apostles of anti-militarism and organized sabotage" wrote the critic Gabriel Mourney in his review of the Salon d'Automne of 1911 for ''Le Journal'', "so doubtless the excesses of the anarchists and saboteurs of French painting will contribute to reviving, in artists and amateurs worthy of the name, the taste for true art and true beauty."&lt;ref name="David Cottington, 1998"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=gleizes+baigneuses&amp;hl=en&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%20baigneuses&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-Garde and Politics in Paris, 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

Claude of ''Le Petit Parisien'' accused the salon cubists of ''[[:wikt:arrivisme|arrivisme]]'', Janneau for ''Gil Blas'' questioned the ''sincerity'' of the cubists, and Tardieu in ''Echo de Paris'' condemned "the snobbery of the gullible which applauds the most stupid nonsenses of the arts of painting presented to idiots as the audacities of genius."&lt;ref name="David Cottington, 1998" /&gt;

Henri Guilbeaux, reviewing the 1911 Indépendants for ''Les Hommes du jour'' described the paintings of Metzinger, Léger and others as 'grotesque, ridiculous, intended to bewilder—it would appear—the bourgeoisie', paintings 'whose cubes, cones and pyramids pile up, collapse and ... make you laugh.'&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Cottington, 1998" /&gt;

Vauxcelles, perhaps more so than his fellow critics, indulged in witty mockery of the salon Cubists: 'But in truth, what honor we do to these bipeds of the parallelepiped, to their lucubrations, cubes, succubi and incubi'. Vauxcelles was more than just skeptical. His comfort level had already been surpassed with the 1907 works of [[Matisse]] and [[Derain]], which he perceived as perilous, 'an uncertain schematization, proscribing relief and volumes in the name of I know not what principle of pictorial abstraction.'&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Cottington, 1998" /&gt;

His concerns deepened in 1909 as the work of Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Gleizes and Metzinger emerged as a unifying force. He condemned 'the frigid extravagances of a number of mystificators' and queried: 'Do they take us for dupes? Indeed are they fooled themselves? It's a puzzle hardly worth solving. Let M. Metzinger dance along behind Picasso, or Derain, or Bracke [sic] ... let M. Herbin crudely defile a clean canvas – that's their mistakes. We'll not join them ...'&lt;ref name="David Cottington" /&gt;&lt;ref name="David Cottington, 1998" /&gt;

The author of an article in Chroniques Médico-Artistique, ''Le Sabotage Anatomique au Salon d'Automne'', Paris, 1911, writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Believe for a moment with certain advocates of Cubism whose good faith would be worse than the posturing [roublardise], that this is an excellent workshop exercise; when these gentlemen have finished their stretching [assouplissements], then show us the result; it is with this hope that we can cast an eye on ''Le Goûter'' of M. Metzinger; when this eruption of cobblestones [pavés] will have been forgotten [passée] thanks to a harsh winter and to a good destructive fire, perhaps will we have one more talented painter!&lt;ref name="Chroniques Médico-Artistique" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Salon d'Automne of 1911===

Published in La Veu de Catalunya, 1 February 1912]]
In Room 7 and 8 of the 1911 Salon d'Automne, held 1 October through November 8, at the Grand Palais in Paris, hung works by Metzinger (''Le goûter''), [[Henri Le Fauconnier]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Roger de La Fresnaye]], [[André Lhote]], [[Jacques Villon]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[František Kupka]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]] and [[Francis Picabia]]. The result was a public scandal which brought Cubism to the attention of the general public for the second time. The first was the organized group showing by Cubists in ''Salle 41'' of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants (Paris), with Metzinger, Delaunay, le Fauconnier and Léger.

Apollinaire took Picasso to the opening of the exhibition in 1911 to see the Cubist works in Room 7 and 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kt324.html Kubisme.info ''Salon d'Automne'' 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the Salon d'Automne of 1911, Huntly Carter in ''The New Age'' writes that "art is not an accessory to life; it is life itself carried to the greatest heights of personal expression." Carter continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt; It was at the Salon d'Automne, amid the Rhythmists, I found the desired sensation. The exuberant eagerness and vitality of their region, consisting of two room remotely situated, was a complete contrast to the morgue I was compelled to pass through in order to reach it. Though marked by extremes, it was clearly the starting point of a new movement in painting, perhaps the most remarkable in modern times, It revealed not only that artists are beginning to recognise the unity of art and life, but that some of them have discovered life is based on rhythmic vitality, and underlying all things is the perfect rhythm that continues and unites them. Consciously, or unconsciously, many are seeking for the perfect rhythm, and in so doing are attaining a liberty or wideness of expression unattained through several centuries of painting.

In his review of the 1911 Salon d'Automne published in L'Intransigeant, written more as a counterattack in defense of Cubism, [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] expressed his views on the entries of Metzinger and Gleizes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The imagination of Metzinger gave us this year two elegant canvases of tones and drawing that attest, at the very least, to a great culture... His art belongs to him now. He has vacated influences and his palette is of a refined richness. Gleizes shows us the two sides of his great talent: invention and observation. Take the example of ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral'', there is good resemblance, but there is not one form or color in this impressive painting that has not been invented by the artist. The portrait has a grandiose appearance that should not escape the notice of connoisseurs. This portrait covers [revêt] a grandiose appearance that should not elude connoisseurs... It is time that young painters turn towards  the sublime in their art. ''La Chasse'', by Gleizes, is well composed and of beautiful colors and sings [chantant].&lt;ref name="Tate"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/gleizes-portrait-of-jacques-nayral-t02410/text-catalogue-entry Tate, London, Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait de Jacques Nayral'', 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k786131q/f2.image Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', L'Intransigeant, Numéro 11409, 10 October 1911, p. 2].

==Provenance==
* R. Auclair, Paris, in 1912
* Possibly Pierre Faure, Paris, by 1930
* Unidentified dealer, c. 1936; sold to Louise and Walter C. Arensberg, Los Angeles, through Marcel Duchamp as agent, 1936
* Gift to PMA, 1950. 1. A. Gleizes and J. Metzinger, Du Cubisme, Paris, 1912, repro. (as exhibition Salon d'Automne; collection M[onsieur] R. Auclair); G. Apollinaire, Les peintres cubistes, Paris, 1913, repro. (same information). "R. Auclair" may be a pseudonym. 2. A painting by Metzinger entitled "Le goûter" ("Le goûter" was the title by which "Tea Time" was commonly known in its earlier history) was lent by Faure for exhibition at de Hauke &amp; Co., NY, in April 1930. The dimensions listed in the de Hauke &amp; Co. exhibition logbook, 29 1/2 x 27 3/4 in., match the PMA painting closely. See Archives of American Art, Jacques Seligmann &amp; Co. Records / Series 9.4 / Box 406 / f. 8/ De Hauke &amp; Co., Inc. Records/ Exhibition Files: Logbooks, 1930-1932 (copy in curatorial file). The "Créateurs de cubisme" (Beaux-Arts, Paris, 1935, catalog by Raymond Cogniat), also lists a painting, no. 136, entitled "Le goûter," belonging to Pierre Faure. Faure may have purchased the painting through [[Léonce Rosenberg]], his usual dealer. However, this painting is dated 1912, while the Arensberg painting is inscribed with the date 1911. In addition, the Faure painting measurements are given as 68 x 68&amp;nbsp;cm., while the Arensberg painting is rectangular, measuring 75.9 x 70.2&amp;nbsp;cm. 3. Duchamp's provenance notes dated September 8, 1951, record that it was purchased "from dealer, 1936", probably a Paris dealer, as most of Duchamp's purchases were made there (PMA, Arensberg Archives).&lt;ref name="Philadelphia Museum of Art" /&gt;

Fox cancelled the show with 4 of the 13 episodes remaining unaired after heated meetings with Method Man &amp; Redman, who were not pleased with the show. The duo publicly criticized Fox several times after this.

[[Method Man]] was disappointed about the series for having a [[laugh track]] and Fox doing a bad job on editing. He had wanted it to be in the vein of ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]],'' of which he is a fan.

'''Migrant literature''' is either written by migrants or tells the stories of migrants and their [[immigration|migration]]. It is a topic of growing interest within literary studies since the 1980s. Migrants are people who have left their homes and cultural settings and who started a new life in another setting that is, in most cases, initially strange to them.

==Settings==
Although any experience of migration would qualify an author to be classed under migrant literature, the main focus of recent research has been on the principal channels of mass-migration in the twentieth century.  These include: European migration to North America or Australia; migration from former colonies to Europe ([[Black British]] literature, [[British-Asian]] literature, [[French Beur]] literature); situations of ethnic cleansing such as the mass migration of people from India to Pakistan and vice versa at the time of the partition of India; guest worker programs (Turks, Italians or Greeks in Germany and Holland); exile situations, such as that of exiled German dissidents during the Nazi period.

==Themes==
Migrant literature often focuses on the social contexts in the migrants' country of origin which prompt them to leave, on the experience of migration itself, on the mixed reception which they may receive in the country of arrival, on experiences of [[racism]] and hostility, and on the sense of rootlessness and the search for [[Psychological identity|identity]] which can result from displacement and cultural diversity.

==Relationship to post-colonial literature==

Colonialism often creates a setting which results in the migration of large numbers of people, either within the colonies or from them to the "imperial centre" (Britain, France etc.).  Consequently, migrant literature and [[postcolonial literature]] show some considerable overlap.  However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration.  A question of current debate is the extent to which [[postcolonial theory]] also speaks to migration literature of non-colonial settings.  The presence in central Europe of [[Gastarbeiter]] communities, for example, is not a result of colonialism, yet their literature does have much in common with, say, British-Asian literature.

==Categories==
A number of categories have been developed for discussing migrant literature.  Some of these are the standard categories of post-colonial theory, while others have been worked out precisely to cope with non-colonial settings.

===Displacement===
Displacement is a key term in post-colonial theory which applies to all migrant situations.  It refers both to physical displacement and a sense of being socially or culturally "out of place".

===Guest and host communities===
Picking up on the term ''Gastarbeiter'' and using it affirmatively, [[Rafik Schami]] has used the terminology of guest and host to express some of the dynamics of migrant situations.

===Emigrant versus immigrant perspectives===
It is possible to distinguish the "emigrant perspective" of the migrant whose main focus is backwards to the country of origin from the "immigrant perspective" of the migrant who is reconciled with the prospect of permanent residence in the country of arrival.&lt;ref&gt;Terminology first proposed in Graeme Dunphy, "Migrant, Emigrant, Immigrant: Recent Developments in Turkish-Dutch Literature", ''Neophilologus'', 85 (2001) 1-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary and secondary migration===
In relation to work migration, it is common for one member of a family, typically the father, to travel in search of work, the rest of the family following later. In the context of migration and family ties, "secondary migration" refers to the emigration of relatives to join the primary migrant.

(Alternatively, in other context related to migration, the expression "secondary migration" is also used to refer to the migration of an immigrant from their country of residence that is not their country of birth to yet another country.&lt;ref name="pmid20850920"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Urquia ML, Frank JW, Glazier RH |title=From places to flows. International secondary migration and birth outcomes |journal= 	Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=71 |issue=9 |pages=1620–6 |date=November 2010 |pmid=20850920 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.08.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is also used to refer to the [[Internal migration#Secondary migration|internal migration of an immigrant]], that is, the migration of an immigrant to another state within the country of residence.&lt;ref name="pmid21361922"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weine SM, Hoffman Y, Ware N, Tugenberg T, Hakizimana L, Dahnweigh G, Currie M, Wagner M |title=Secondary migration and relocation among African refugee families in the United States |journal=Family Process |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=27–46 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21361922 |pmc=5322815 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2010.01344.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===First and second generation migrants===
First generation migrants are those who, as adults, themselves made the move from one country to another.  Second generation migrants are the children of migrants, who were either very young at the time of migration or were born in the country of arrival.  The perspectives across the generations can differ enormously.  Some critics have even used the term "third generation migrants", though it is highly questionable whether this is meaningful: if a third generation is still culturally distinct it is probably more useful to speak of an established ethnic minority.

===Between cultures===
In literature of second generation migrants, a location "between" two cultures, sometimes called an "interstitial" space, is often mentioned as a way of expressing a sense of belonging in neither the guest nor the host community.  Those whose experience has been more positive may reject the notion of "between" and feel that they live, rather, in the cultural overlap, not a void but a place of particular richness.

===Hybridity===
[[Hybridity]] is another catch-phrase from post-colonial theory which applies also in many non-colonial migrant situations.  It refers to the migrant's culturally mixed identity as the opposed forces of assimilation and the search for roots force a middle way.
(In post-colonial theory, the term hybridity is also used in non-migrant situations to refer to the impact of the culture of the colonisers on the culture of the colonised.)

===Bilingual theory===
[[Multilingualism|Bilingualism]] is an essential component of hybridity.  Results of socio-linguistic research are therefore of importance to work on migrant literature.

[[File:CCC-Google StreetView Attrappe - FSA09.jpg|thumb|[[Google Street View]] mockup in [[Freiheit statt Angst]] demonstration, Berlin, September 11, 2010]]

In [[manufacturing]] and [[design]], a '''mockup''', or '''mock-up''', is a [[scale model|scale]] or full-size model &lt;!-- NOTE: Don't link "model"; it is a disambiguation page, and there is no Wikipedia article with the breadht required for this usage of "model" --&gt; of a design or device, used for teaching, demonstration, design evaluation, promotion, and other purposes. A mockup is a ''[[prototype]]'' if it provides at least part of the functionality of a system and enables testing of a design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Vieru, Tudor |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/KSC-Gets-Orion-Mock-Up-for-Testing-103300.shtml |title=KSC Gets Orion Mock-Up for Testing |publisher=News.softpedia.com|date= 30 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock-ups are used by designers mainly to acquire feedback from users. Mock-ups address the idea captured in a popular engineering one-liner: You can fix it now on the drafting board with an eraser or you can fix it later on the construction site with a sledge hammer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/mock-ups.html |title=Mock-ups |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date=16 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Mockups are used as [[design tool]]s virtually everywhere a new product is designed.

[[File:Boeing 2707 mock-up.jpg|thumb|left|[[Boeing 2707]] mockup at the [[Hiller Aviation Museum]] ]]Mockups are used in the automotive device industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, overall impression, and shapes are tested in a [[wind tunnel]] experiment. They can also be used to test consumer reaction.

== Systems engineering ==
Mockups, [[website wireframe|wireframes]] and prototypes are not so cleanly distinguished in [[Software engineering|software]] and [[systems engineering]], where mockups are a way of designing [[user interface]]s on paper or in computer images. A software mockup will thus look like the real thing, but will not do useful work beyond what the user sees. A software prototype, on the other hand, will look and work just like the real thing. In many cases it is best to design or prototype the user interface before [[source code]] is written or hardware is built, to avoid having to go back and make expensive changes.

Early layouts of a World Wide Web site or pages are often called ''mockups''. A large selection of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] or [[Open-source software|open-source]] software tools are available for this purpose.

== Military acquisition ==
Mockups are part of the [[military acquisition]] process.  Mockups are often used to test [[human factors]] and [[aerodynamics]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, Todd, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA490527&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf "Lessons Learned From Product Manager (PM) Infantry Combat Vehicle (ICV) Using Soldier Evaluation in the Design Phase"], ''ARMY AL&amp;T Magazine'', April–June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, mockups include [[wire-frame model]]s. They can also be used for public display and demonstration purposes prior to the development of a prototype, as with the case of the [[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II]] mock-up aircraft.

== Consumer goods==
Mockups are used in the consumer goods industry as part of the product development process, where dimensions, human factors, overall impression, and [[commercial art]] are tested in [[marketing research]].

== Furniture and cabinetry ==
Mockups are commonly required by designers, architects, and end users for custom furniture and cabinetry.&lt;ref&gt;Jesberger, Lee A., [http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Mock_Ups.html "Mock Ups"], ''Pro Woodworking Tips'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Consumer Product Safety Commission|United States Consumer Product Safety Commission]], [http://www.cpsc.gov/LIBRARY/FOIA/meetings/mtg08/smoldering7_14.pdf "Log of Meeting: Demonstration of the Proposed Smoldering Test Procedures"], 14 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The intention is often to produce a full-sized replica, using inexpensive materials in order to verify a design. Mockups are often used to determine the proportions of the piece, relating to various dimensions of the piece itself, or to fit the piece into a specific space or room. The ability to see how the design of the piece relates to the rest of the space is also an important factor in determining size and design.

When designing a functional piece of furniture, such as a desk or table, mockups can be used to test whether they suit typical human shapes and sizes. Designs that fail to consider these issues may not be practical to use. Mockups can also be used to test color, finish, and design details which cannot be visualized from the initial drawings and sketches. Mockups used for this purpose can be on a reduced scale.

The cost of making mockups is often more than repaid by the savings made by avoiding going into production with a design which needs improvement.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

== Software engineering ==
The most common use of mockups in software development is to create user interfaces that show the end user what the software will look like without having to build the software or the underlying functionality. Software UI mockups can range from very simple hand drawn screen layouts, through realistic bitmaps, to semi functional user interfaces developed in a software development tool.

Mockups are often used to create [[Unit testing|unit tests]] - there they are usually called [[mock object]]s. The main reasons to create such mockups is to be able to test one part of a software system (a unit) without having to use dependent modules. The function of these dependencies is then "faked" using mock objects.

This is especially important if the functions that are simulated like this are difficult to obtain (for example because it involves complex computation) or if the result is non-deterministic, such as the readout of a sensor.

A common style of software design is [[Service-oriented architecture]] (SOA), where many components communicate via [[Communications_protocol|protocols]] such as [[HTTP]]. [[Service virtualization]] and [[Comparison of API simulation tools|API mocks and simulators]] are examples of implementations of mockups or so called over-the-wire [[Test_double|test doubles]] in [[Software system|software systems]] that are modelling dependent [[Component-based software engineering|components]] or [[Microservices|microservices]] in SOA environments.

Mockup software can also be used for micro level evaluation, for example to check a single function, and derive results from the tests to enhance the products power and usability on the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prototypingtool.com/mockups |title=Mockups |publisher=Prototypingtool.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
[[File:Architectural Mockup.jpg|thumb|Architectural mockup for a new urbanist community in McKinney, Texas, US]]
At the beginning of a project's construction, architects will often direct contractors to provide material mockups for review.  These allow the design team to review material and color selections, and make modifications before product orders are placed. Architectural mockups can also be used for performance testing (such as water penetration at window installations, for example) and help inform the subcontractors how details are to be installed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9818">The '''Northumbrian Small Pipes Society''' was founded in 1893, by members of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]] to promote interest in, and playing of [[Northumbrian smallpipes]], and their music. As it only continued in existence for seven years, it is now regarded primarily as a short-lived precursor to the [[Northumbrian Pipers' Society]]. However, despite its short life, it played a significant role, publishing the first tutor for the instrument, J. W. Fenwick's ''Instruction Book for the Northumbrian Small-Pipes'' (1896), holding  regular meetings, and organising annual competitions. In  1894 and 1896-7, the society published Transactions, as well as publishing an account of their Annual Meeting of 1897. As well as Members, who  paid an annual 5s. subscription, there was a category of Honorary Playing Members. Since the society's records include the names and addresses of all members, of either kind, they have listed the names and addresses for 37 known pipers. [http://northshieldsnsp.co.uk/northumbrian-small-pipes-society/] Two articles in the Newcastle Courant, in April 1900, gave an account of their Annual General Meeting, at the [[Literary and Philosophical Society]], and referred to the society as flourishing, with 200 members, of whom almost half were pipers. &lt;ref&gt;Newcastle Courant, April 7th, 1900, recovered from British Newspaper Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;  Officers were elected for the following year; however there is no subsequent record of any formal activity of the society, such as meetings or competitions.  In 1906, when the [[Tom Clough|Cloughs]] played for [[King Edward VII]] at [[Alnwick Castle]], an account of this in the Berwickshire News stated that the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society had done some good work in reviving interest, but that 'seven winters had passed without it  giving any signs of life' &lt;ref&gt;Berwickshire News and General Advertiser,  July 17th 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;. This suggests that the society had been largely inactive for some time before its final AGM.  
 
The same week as the final meeting, a group of pipers, including [[Henry Clough]] and [[Richard Mowat]], organised a gathering of pipers and their friends at The Black Horse in [[Monkseaton]], showing that pipers themselves had begun to organise events in parallel to the society; the 1900 meeting was chaired by  Walter Corder, secretary of the NSPS. &lt;ref&gt;Newcastle Courant, April 14th, 1900, recovered from British Newspaper Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the second such meeting, the first having been the previous May. &lt;ref&gt;Morpeth Herald, May 13th 1899.&lt;/ref&gt;  These events were described as 'annual', but there are no subsequent newspaper accounts of these until an informal gathering there in 1906. &lt;ref&gt;Morpeth Herald,  March 24th, 1906, recovered from British Newspaper Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
The late 19th century in Northumberland was a period of growing interest in Northumbrian music in general, and the music of the Northumbrian smallpipes in particular. In the 1850s, the Society of Antiquaries had  started to collect tune and song manuscripts, and their Ancient Melodies Committee continued its work over the subsequent years. In the 1870s, that Society organised annual piping competitions, both to encourage pipers, and to reward the ablest among them. In 1882, the [[Northumbrian Minstrelsy]] was published, placing some of their researches before a wider public, and the second part of this book was devoted specifically to smallpipe tunes. So by 1893, the intellectual climate was ripe for the foundation of a society specifically devoted to the Northumbrian Smallpipes themselves.

==The Membership==
A large group of the 26 Committee members, only one of whom, J. W. Fenwick, was an Honorary Playing Member, were related to one another, being members of the extended group of Foster, Spence, Corder, and Watson families; a significant group of these were close neighbours in or near Rosella Place, a short Georgian terrace in [[North Shields]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosella Place and the Northumbrian Small Pipes Society, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol.32, p 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This Quaker family were descendants of Robert Foster, a close friend of [[Thomas Bewick]]. Although there is no direct evidence, it is very likely that Robert would have heard the piping of Thomas's son [[Robert Bewick]], and the family's interest in piping, apparent across several generations, may well date from this time.

One significant member was the artist [[Joseph Crawhall II]] (1821–1896), who had a deep interest in the culture and music of Northumberland, and had published  [[A Beuk o’ Newcassell Sangs Collected by Joseph Crawhall 1888|A Beuk o' Newcassell Sangs]] in 1888.  He had compiled a tunebook for the use of pipers, containing tunes copied from the [[William Vickers manuscript]], as well as tunes from oral tradition, some otherwise unknown. Parts of this are now on the FARNE archive. He corresponded with his friend and collaborator, the illustrator [[Charles Keene (artist)|Charles Keene]], who was also a Northumbrian piper - letters surviving from Keene to Crawhall confirm that both of them had had dealings with James Reid, the son of [[Robert Reid (pipemaker)|Robert Reid]], whose business he continued. In one of these letters, Keene refers to seeing the pipes of [[Thomas Hair (musician)|Tommy Hair]], on sale in Reid's shop in December 1873.&lt;ref&gt;James Reid, 1814-74: Clothing the Bare Facts, Richard Heard and Graham Wells, Journal of the Northumbrian Pipers' Society, vol. 34, 2013-14, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another committee member was Charles James Spence. He was a banker and a serious amateur artist, and an active member of the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne]], being their Curator of Museums from 1890-1905. He owned a rare, possibly unique, set of six-drone pipes by Reid, and an illustration of these is the frontispiece of Fenwick's tutor. It is not known whether his interest in these was as an antiquarian, or as a player, but he is not listed as a playing member, suggesting he did not consider himself to be a serious piper. Alternatively, it may be that as a man of some means, he felt obliged to pay the subscription.
He designed the medal which was awarded to first prize winners in the society's annual competitions, and the artwork illustrating the society's Transactions. In its lifetime the society awarded two pipers its Gold Medal; one was [[Richard Mowat]], and the other was [[Henry Clough]].&lt;ref&gt;Piping Past, reprinted obituary by Gilbert Askew, Northumbrian Pipers' Society Magazine, v.2 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cousin of his, [[Robert Spence Watson]] had had a strong interest in piping more than a decade earlier, and had donated the Spence Watson trophy, then worth £25, for the series of competitions organised by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne|Society of Antiquaries]] in Newcastle Town Hall. This was won outright by [[Old Tom Clough]] after three victories, in 1879. Robert's daughter Mary Spence Watson, herself an amateur piper, who had learned from [[Richard Mowat]], corresponded with Old Tom's grandson [[Tom Clough]]. That trophy is now 
in the [[Morpeth Chantry Bagpipe Museum]].

The president of the society was Richard Welford. In 1896 he delivered a lecture to the society on 'The Waits of Newcastle upon Tyne'. As the last of the Waits was [[John Peacock (piper)|John Peacock]], Welford must have had at least some interest in Northumbrian pipes. After Fenwick's death, he acquired Fenwick's collection of manuscript music, which still survives, and includes many unusual variants of traditional pipe tunes, some with attributions to named pipers, including Peacock and [[Robert Reid (pipemaker)|Robert Reid]].

==Why was the society so short-lived?==
The reasons for the society's short life are not documented. However, it is clear that with a committee of 26, only one of whom was an honorary playing member, and only 37 honorary playing members across the lifetime of the society, never more than 35 at any time, it may well be that pipers felt that the work of the society was not really about the living tradition of the instrument as it was currently played, so much as an antiquarian interest in preserving  an instrument falsely  perceived as being on the point of extinction. 

Such attitudes were certainly current when the [[Northumbrian Pipers' Society]] was founded,  30 years later, and it is known from [[Tom Clough|Tom Clough's]] letters that Tom, and perhaps also his father [[Henry Clough|Henry]], were initially cautious and even suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;The Clough Family of Newsham, Northumbrian Pipers' Society, ed. Chris Ormston and Julia Say, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Henry was elected by the NPS as one of the vice-presidents, though he did not play a very active role. Certainly the newer Society had much more involvement from pipers themselves; Tom himself acted as a Competition judge in the first three years, though he declined to be a vice-president,  stating that doing the work properly would require more of his time than he could spare. It is more likely that his personal disagreements with G.V.B. Charlton, the first president of the new society, played a large role in this decision. Another piper who played a major part in the NPS early on was [[Richard Mowat]], its chairman from 1933 until his death. In the same year, Tom was also elected as a vice-president, as [[Billy Pigg]] had been in 1930. The newer society, as its name suggests,  thus had far more involvement from pipers themselves than its short-lived predecessor, and this difference may explain why it survived, while the NSPS did not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3629">[[File:Ephesus odeon.JPG|thumb|260px|[[Ephesus]] Odeon, [[Turkey]]]]
'''Odeon''' is the name for several ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings built for music: singing exercises, musical shows, poetry competitions, and the like. The word comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] ᾨδεῖον, ''Ōideion'', literally "singing place", or "building for musical competitions"; from the verb ἀείδω, ''aeidō'', "I sing", which is also the root of ᾠδή, ''ōidē'',  "[[ode]]", and of ἀοιδός, ''[[aoidos]]'', "singer".

==Description==
In a general way the construction of an odeon was similar to that of an [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theatre]], but it was only a quarter of the size and was provided with a [[roof]] for [[acoustics|acoustic]] purposes, a characteristic difference. The prototype odeon was the Odeon of [[Pericles]] ([[Odeon of Athens]]), a mainly wooden building by the southern slope of the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. It was described by Plutarch as 'many-seated and many-columned' and may have been square, though excavations have also suggested a different shape, 208 x 62 feet. It was said to be decorated  with the masts and spars of ships captured from the Persians. It was rebuilt by king [[Ariobarzanes I of Cappadocia]] after destruction by fire in the [[First Mithridatic War]] in 87–86 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Classical Dictionary|publisher=OUP|page=617|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[File:Troy Troia Truva 1280866 1280910 Nevit 45 images.jpg|thumbnail|Hadrianic Odeon in Troy IX]]

The oldest known odeon in Greece was the Skias at [[Sparta]], so called from its resemblance to the top of a [[parasol]], said to have been erected by [[Theodorus of Samos]] (600 B.C.); in Athens an odeon near the spring Enneacrunus on the [[Ilissus]] was referred to the age of [[Peisistratos|Peisistratus]], and appears to have been rebuilt or restored by [[Lycurgus of Athens|Lycurgus]] (c. 330 B.C.). This is probably the building which, according to [[Aristophanes]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wasps'', 1109.&lt;/ref&gt; was used for judicial purposes, for the distribution of corn, and even for the billeting of soldiers.

[[File:Odeon-lyon.jpg|thumb|[[Odeon of Lyon|Odeon of Fourvière]], [[Lyon]], France]]
The most magnificent odeon was the [[Odeon of Herodes Atticus]] on the southwest cliff of the Acropolis at Athens. It was built in about 160 A.D. by the wealthy sophist and rhetorician [[Herodes Atticus]] in memory of his wife, and considerable remains of the odeon still exist. It had accommodation for 4500/5500 persons, and the ceiling was constructed of beautifully carved beams of cedar wood, probably with an open space in the centre to admit the light.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=390–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also profusely decorated with pictures and other works of art. Similar buildings also existed in other parts of Greece; at [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], also the gift of Herodes Atticus;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sear|2006|pp=393–394}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Patrae]], where there was a famous statue of [[Apollo]]; at [[Smyrna]], [[Tralles]], and other towns in [[Asia Minor]]. The first odeon in Rome was built by Domitian ([[Odeon of Domitian]]), a second by Trajan.

The '''Palm Sunday Handcraft Market''' ([[Tianguis]] de Domingo de Ramos), held in [[Uruapan]], is the largest event in the Mexican state of [[Michoacán]] dedicated to the sale of the [[Michoacán handcrafts and folk art|state’s traditional handcrafts]] and is reputed to be the largest of its kind in Latin America. The event draws over 1,300 artisans who offer over a million pieces for sale, which represent all of the state’s major handcraft traditions. It also includes other events such as a handcraft competition, exhibition of indigenous dress, food and other traditions, concerts, dance and more. The event is centered on the very large main plaza of the city of [[Uruapan]], but extends over to adjoining streets and to other plazas in the city.

==The tianguis==

The tianguis (open air market) runs during [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week]], officially beginning on the day before [[Palm Sunday]] and runs until the day after Easter Sunday, with the most important day being Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos).&lt;ref name=srangel&gt;{{cite news  |title= Se alista el Tianguis Artesanal del Domingo de Ramos en Uruapan  |newspaper= Diario ABC |location=Michoacán  |url= http://diarioabc.com.mx/mobil/noticia_completa.php?id_item=Nzc1OA== |accessdate=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes&gt;{{cite web |title=Domingo de Ramos en Uruapan (Michoacán) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/domingo-de-ramos-en-uruapan-michoacan.html |accessdate=April 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a major vacation period in Mexico, and the event draws visitors from Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name=visitmich&gt;{{cite web |title= Domingo de Ramos |publisher= State of Michoacán |url= http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/ss2015/domingo-ramos.html |accessdate= April 4, 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20150404231637/http://www.visitmichoacan.com.mx/ss2015/domingo-ramos.html |archivedate= April 4, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=travis&gt;{{cite book |author=Travis M.

[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 053.JPG|thumb|left|Section of the market selling maque and textiles]]
The tianguis fills the large main plaza (Plaza de Martíres de Uruapan) of the city and overflows to adjoining streets and other plazas such as Morelos Plaza, Huatapera Plaza and the Garcia Ortiz alleyway next to the Casa de Cultura (cultural center). Related events occurs in these areas as well as the Plaza de la Ranita, the Casa de Cultura, and the entrance to the Barranca de Cupatizio National Park.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;&lt;ref name=gponce/&gt;

In 2015, there were over one million pieces for sale, representing all of the major handcraft traditions.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt; These include textiles and traditional clothing, miniatures, jewelry, toys, furniture, lacquered gourds, chests, leather goods, iron, other metals, and the various types of ceramics produced, and those from stiff fibers such as wicker and palm fronds.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; Most of the items for sale are of high quality and are of styles only found in Michoacan such as clay pots from Huancito with animal heads, needlework from Charan, pre Hispanic lacquerware (maque) from Uruapan, copper pieces from [[Santa Clara del Cobre]] and wooden masks from Pamatacuaro,&lt;ref name=travis/&gt; but there are some stands selling mostly tourist and cheap items.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; For Palm Sunday, there are even more craftspeople, mostly Purépecha, on the atriums of the two main colonial churches, weaving palm fronds into intricate designs for churchgoers.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;

[[File:MuestraIndumentaria 2015 51.JPG|thumb|Purépecha children representing their community at the event in 2015]]
Over its history, the tianguis proper has since been expanded with other cultural events such as music and dance performances, a parade of artisans, a food exhibition featuring the traditional cuisine of the Purépecha and more.&lt;ref name=travis/&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;

The week is inaugurated with a parade of artisans and others in traditional dress, representing the four indigenous peoples found in the state, representing 45 communities and 25 Michoacan municipalities.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt; The parade also include artisans with examples of their wares such as those from Santa Clara del Cobre, Pamatacuaro and Paracho along with marching bands and mojigangas (large cartonería puppet figures) .&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;&lt;ref name=gponce/&gt; The parade runs from the National Park to the center of the city along Culver City and Emilio Carranza streets, ending at the Casa de Cultura.&lt;ref name=inauguran/&gt;
[[File:TianguiaPurhepechaFood33.JPG|thumb|left|Corundas (similar to tamales) steaming in a huge vat at the Plaza de la Ranita]]
The Casa de Cultura host’s the state’s main handcraft competition, where winners are announced on Palm Sunday. In 2015, the competition awarded over a million pesos in prizes in 259 awards.&lt;ref name=srangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; On the same day there is the State Regional Costume Festival held at the Huatapera Museum, in which all four indigenous communities are represented, both in dress and traditions such as dance.&lt;ref name=srangel/&gt;&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=visitmich/&gt;

At the Plaza de la Ranita, there is a demonstration and sale of traditional Purépecha food, which includes [[pozole]], [[corunda]]s, atole, enchiladas, [[buñuelos]], uchepos (tamales of sweet corn) and fish dishes. The goal of this is to provide example of more traditional and less tourist foods. [[Atole]] includes the atolenuitede from San Miguel Pomocuaran, which is salty and spice with serrano chili peppers. Churipo is a beef soup, atole de pinole (with toasted corn), tamales de chapata, made with amaranth seed.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;

==History==
The event is located in Uruapan, which has been an important commercial center since the pre Hispanic period because it is centered among the major Purépecha regions (Lake, Purepech highlands, Cañada de los Once Pueblos and Ciènega de Chapala), as well as between the highlands and the “[[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]],” the lower elevations that extend to the coast.&lt;ref name=visitmich/&gt;

The area has been an important one for trade since the pre Hispanic period as it is centered among the major Purépecha regions (Lake, Purepech highlands, Cañada de los Once Pueblos and Ciènega de Chapala).&lt;ref name=visitmich/&gt;&lt;ref name=moreliainvita&gt;{{cite web |title= Tianguis Artesanal Domingo de Ramos |publisher= Universidad La  Salle |url= http://www.moreliainvita.com/paginas/contenido.php?id_evento=10394 |accessdate= April 4, 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150412060406/http://www.moreliainvita.com/paginas/contenido.php?id_evento=10394 |archivedate= April 12, 2015 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original tianguis was dedicated only to pottery. which lasted for two or three days on Melchor Ocampo Street onto Santiago Street and the Izazaga Plaza. Later, this area was remodeled to create the current Morelos Plaza. This posed a problem for the vendors until the current event was established in 1960.&lt;ref name=moreliainvita/&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
[[File:Trebechovicky betlem 20110926 transport 05.JPG|thumb|Transport of the Probošt crib to storage on 26 September 2011.]]
The crib was first exhibited at the Zemská jednota řemeslnická ("''Provincial Artisan Union''") in [[Chrast (Chrudim District)|Chrast]] in 1906.&lt;ref name="zemanova156" /&gt; There the crib was received positively, and was awarded a diploma and a gold medal;&lt;ref name="hanova,valena16-17"&gt;Hánová; Valena. ''Betlémy: české a moravské lidové betlémy a jejich tvůrci''. pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; however, nobody wanted to sponsor it.

Other exhibitions were in the year 1934 in [[Kostelec nad Orlicí]], in 1935 in [[Prague]], in 1936 in [[Brno]] and in 1937 in [[Bratislava]], [[Piešťany]] and [[Hlohovec]].&lt;ref name="vaclik27" /&gt; Continued exhibiting was interrupted by [[World War II]]. Later, the crib was exhibited &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ineltour.cz/en/v-09-litomysl-and-trebechovice-95.html Fantastic Mechanical Christmas Crib] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130711001308/http://www.ineltour.cz/en/v-09-litomysl-and-trebechovice-95.html |date=2013-07-11 }} Retrieved 10 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[World's fair]] in [[Expo 67|Montreal]] (1967), where more than 8 million visitors saw it,&lt;ref name="splichal545"&gt;Šplíchal.

== Figures, mechanism ==
It was built at the turn of the 19th and the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pamatky-cz.eu/en/clanek/263-Trebechovice-pod-Orebem-Belec-nad-Orlici/index.htm Trebechovice pod Orebem] Retrieved 10 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; it took more than forty years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freenewspos.com/wikipedia/wikipedia-english?via=Probo%C5%A1t's_mechanical_Christmas_crib Mechanical Christmas Crib] Retrieved 10 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It includes more than 2000 carved parts and figures, which are put in motion by a small electric motor. Altogether, 373 people are depicted.&lt;ref name="splichal545" /&gt; The landscape is divided into seven terraces filled with characters representing both [[biblical figures]] and inhabitants of [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref name="splichal544"&gt;Šplíchal. ''Poselství dřeva''. p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; They are carved from [[Tilia|linden wood]]; three of the characters are reported to be made of [[pear]] wood.&lt;ref name="splichal521-523" /&gt; Figures are approximately 10–15&amp;nbsp;cm high&lt;ref name="hanova,valena16-17" /&gt; and not [[polychrome]]d, unlike the figures of most other nativity scenes; the carvers wanted to emphasize the unity of material.&lt;ref name="vaclik118"&gt;Vaclík. ''Lidové betlémy v Čechách a na Moravě''. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of Pitr's street who had been visiting Probošts to admire the nativity scene during its construction served as models for many of the characters depicted in the crib.&lt;ref name="splichal544" /&gt; Among them can be seen Probošt as a carpenter and Kapucián as wise old man.&lt;ref name="vaclik118" /&gt; The crib also includes six flowering spreading linden trees, a usual part of Czech nativity scenes;&lt;ref name="vaclik22"&gt;Vaclík. ''Lidové betlémy v Čechách a na Moravě''. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Vaclík, these are among the most beautiful trees carved in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name="vaclik22" /&gt;

The crib was originally built on a right angle but at the turn of the 19th and 20th century it was rebuilt in a single plane. The whole nativity scene (including mechanical parts) is made of wood and is {{Convert|6.9|m|ft}} long, {{Convert|2.2|m|ft}} high and {{Convert|1.9|m|ft}} deep.{{#tag:ref|Sometimes other lengths are stated in some books (for example: 7 x 3.2 x 2.70 m in Vaclík's one)&lt;ref name="vaclik27" /&gt; but these data do not reflect reality.|group=n}}

A film '''Production Office''' is the administrative office responsible for managing a [[film production]]. The office is responsible to the [[film producer|Film Producer]] and includes the [[production manager|Production Manager]], [[Assistant director|Assistant Director]] and one or more [[Production assistant|Production Assistants]]. Typically a ''Production Office'' is established in the [[pre-production]] phase and continues until at least [[post-production]].

The Production Office usually includes positions such as, but not entirely made of, Production Supervisor, Production Office Coordinator, Assistant Production Office Coordinator, Production Secretary and Office Assistants (otherwise known or credited as Office PA's or Staff Assistants).

A Production Office will look different for each production depending on many variables including the type of film, the production company producing the film and the size of the budget of the film itself. A Production Office can be as small as one or two people (mostly seen in an independent film structure) or as big as ten or more on a film with a sizeable budget.

The term dates from the 17th-century [[French language|French]] ''ruban rond'' (''round [[ribbon]]'').&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/81/14554.html Brewer, E. Cobham. Dictionary of Phrase &amp; Fable: Round Robin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;[http://www.phrases.org.uk/bulletin_board/15/messages/643.html Re: Round Robin], Oxford English Dictionary cited at The Phrase Finder, September 29, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; This described the practice of signatories to petitions against authority (usually Government officials petitioning the [[The Crown|Crown]]) appending their names on a document in a non-hierarchical circle or ribbon pattern (and so disguising the order in which they have signed) so that none may be identified as a [[leader|ringleader]].

This practice was adopted by sailors petitioning officers in the [[Royal Navy]] (first recorded 1731).

==Spanish–American War==
{{main|Round-Robin Letter (Spanish–American War)}}
A round robin letter was authored in Cuba after the cessation of hostilities in 1898 by a committee of 10 brigade commanders of the American Army's V Corps including acting brigade commander [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the [[Spanish–American War]], to accelerate the departure of the American Army back to the United States during the rainy disease-plagued summer season. This letter was leaked to the press and embarrassed the administration of US President [[William McKinley]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9780">'''Scams in intellectual property''' or '''invention scams''' are a type of [[scam]] in which either [[inventor]]s are lured to pay money for development of their idea but the development does not occur, or [[investors]] pay money for a non existing product or for an invention never to be developed.

[[Intellectual property]] (IP) is a very complex area and covers a vast range of diverse subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patent.gov.uk/protect/protect-advice.htm UK Patent Office advice]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, there are opportunities for unscrupulous individuals and organizations to take advantage of those wishing to secure protection for their IP.

==Registration services==
'''Registration services''' are organizations or individuals that contact IP applicants or owners and request payment for an apparently official registration of their IP.

Many applicants for and owners of [[patent]]s, [[trademark]]s and [[industrial design rights]] receive letters from such registration services and different IP offices and organizations around the world regularly issue warnings in connection with the offered services.

The registration services target applicants directly because patent, trademark and design applications are published a set time after filing or upon grant along with freely available information about a name and address for the applicant. Registration services use this information to send requests for payment to applicants shortly after publication.  The documents are confusing as they appear to be from official governmental agencies and to be legitimate invoices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/new-years-solicitations-creative-marketing-or-deceptive-advertising|title=New Years Solicitations - Creative Marketing or Deceptive Advertising? |first=Kurt|last=Anderson |work= Giordano, Halleran &amp; Ciesla, P.C.|year=2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A scam increasing in frequency, as of October 2011, is an email originating from a domain name registrar or IT consulting company based in China that purports to notify a trademark holder that another entity is seeking to register the client’s trademark or business name as a domain name in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, or Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Be Aware of Trademark and Patent Scams |url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/be-aware-trademark-and-patent-scams |publisher=Sterne, Kessler, Goldstein &amp; Fox P.L.L.C. |work=The National Law Review |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The email gives the brand owner a short period in time in which to secure the domain name for their own.  These notifications are essentially solicitations.  Generally, in the event there really is a third-party who is seeking to register your brand name for nefarious purposes, there are channels available for addressing such uses if and when they materialize.

==Domain slamming==
{{main|Domain slamming}}

'''Domain slamming''' is a form of [[scam]] in which an [[internet service provider]] (ISP) or [[domain name registrar]] attempts to trick customers of different companies into switching from their existing ISP/registrar to the scamming ISP/registrar, under the pretense that the customer is simply renewing their subscription to their old ISP/registrar.

==Invention promotion firm scams==
{{Main|Invention promotion firm#US legal protections for inventors}}
An '''inventor promotion scam''' or '''invention promotion scam''' is a scam where inventors are lured to pay money for development of their invention, or promotion of it, without the development or promotion actually occurring.

Some [[invention promotion firm]]s have been found to engage in improper and deceptive practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/07/mouse.shtm FTC/STATE "PROJECT MOUSETRAP" SNARES INVENTION PROMOTION INDUSTRY, US Federal Trade Commission, Press Release July 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023235640/http://www.ftc.gov/opa/1997/07/mouse.shtm |date=2011-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diana the Huntress - School of Fontainebleau, attributed to Luca Penni.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''[[Diana the Huntress]]'' - School of Fontainebleau (1550–60) (Louvre)]]

The '''Ecole de Fontainebleau''' (c.1530–c.1610) refers to two periods of artistic production in France during the late [[French Renaissance|Renaissance]] centered on the royal [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] that were crucial in forming the French version of [[Northern Mannerism]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/oxford-art-encyclopedia/fontainebleau-school Oxford Dictionary of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First School of Fontainebleau (from 1531)==

In 1531, the Florentine artist [[Rosso Fiorentino]], having lost most of his possessions at the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, was invited by [[Francis I of France|François I]] to come to France, where he began an extensive decorative program for the [[Château de Fontainebleau]].  In 1532 he was joined by another Italian artist, [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (from [[Bologna]]).  Rosso died in France in 1540.  On the advice of Primaticcio, [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (from [[Modena]]) was invited to France in 1552 by François's son [[Henry II of France|Henri II]].  Although known for their work at Fontainebleau, these artists were also invited to create works of art for other noble families of the period and were much esteemed and well-paid.
[[File:Scuola di fontainebleau, presunti ritratti di gabrielle d'estrées sua sorella la duchessa di villars, 1594 ca. 04.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Gabrielle d'Estrées and Duchess of Villars, School of Fontainebleau, c.1594]]
[[Image:Meister der Schule von Fontainebleau 003.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Lady at her Toilet'' - School of Fontainebleau (1585–1595) ([[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]])]]
The works of this "first school of Fontainebleau"  are characterized by the extensive use of [[stucco]] (moldings and picture frames) and [[fresco]]s, and an elaborate (and often mysterious) system of [[Allegory|allegories]] and [[Mythology|mythological]] iconography.  Renaissance decorative motifs such as [[grotesque]]s, [[strapwork]] and [[putti]] are common, as well as a certain degree of eroticism.  The figures are elegant and show the influence of the techniques of the Italian [[Mannerism]]  of [[Michelangelo]], [[Raphael]] and especially [[Parmigianino]].  Primaticcio was also directed to make copies of antique [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] statues for the king, thus spreading the influence of classical statuary.  

Many of the works of Rosso, Primaticcio and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate|dell'Abate]] have not survived; parts of the Chateau were remodelled at various dates.  The paintings of the group were reproduced in [[old master print|prints]], mostly [[etching]]s, which were apparently produced initially at Fontainebleau itself, and later in Paris.  These disseminated the style through France and beyond, and also record several paintings that have not survived.

The [[mannerist style]] of the [[Fontainebleau]] school influenced French artists (with whom the Italians worked) such as the painter [[Jean Cousin the Elder]], the [[sculptors]] [[Jean Goujon]] and [[Germain Pilon]], and, to a lesser degree, the painter and portraitist [[François Clouet]] the son of [[Jean Clouet]].

===Printmaking workshop===
[[File:Ant fantuzzi1.jpg|thumb|Etching by [[Antonio Fantuzzi]], copying a drawing for [[:File:P1290819 Fontainebleau chateau rwk.jpg|this stucco and paint surround]] at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]]]
[[File:P1290819 Fontainebleau chateau rwk.jpg|thumb|''The Enlightenment of Francois I'' by [[Rosso Fiorentino]], and its surround in the Gallery of Francois I in the palace. A preparatory drawing is copied in the print above.]]
Although there is no certain proof, most scholars have agreed that there was a printmaking workshop at the Palace of Fontainebleau itself, reproducing the designs of the artists for their works in the palace, as well as other compositions they produced.  The most productive printmakers were [[Léon Davent]], [[Antonio Fantuzzi]], and [[Jean Mignon]], followed by the "mysterious" artist known from his monogram as "Master I♀V" (♀ being the [[alchemical symbol]] for [[copper]], from which the printing plates were made),&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-83&lt;/ref&gt; and the workshop seems to have been active between about 1542 and 1548 at the latest; [[François I of France]] died in March 1547, after which funding for the palace ended, and the school dispersed.  These were the first etchings made in France, and not far behind the first Italian uses of the technique, which originated in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-81; Landau, 308-309&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest impressions of all the Fontainebleau prints are in brown ink, and their intention seems to have been essentially reproductive.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The intention of the workshop was to disseminate the new style developing at the palace more widely, both to France and to the Italians' peers back in Italy.  Whether the initiative to do this came from the king or another patron, or from the artists alone, is unclear. David Landau believes that Primaticcio was the driving force;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 95; Landau, 309&lt;/ref&gt; he had stepped up to become the director of the work at Fontainebleau after the suicide of [[Rosso Fiorentino]] in 1540.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The enterprise seems to have been "just slightly premature" in terms of catching a market.  The etched prints were often marked by signs of the workshop's inexperience and sometimes incompetence with the technique of etching, and according to Sue Welsh Reed: "Few impressions survive from these plates, and it is questionable whether many were pulled. The plates were often poorly executed and not well printed; they were often scratched or not well polished and did not wipe clean.  Some may have been made of metals soft as copper, such as [[pewter]]."&lt;ref&gt;Reed, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  A broadening market for prints preferred the "highly finished textures" of [[Nicolas Beatrizet]], and later "proficient but ultimately uninspired" engravers such as [[René Boyvin]] and [[Pierre Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau, 309&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable artists of the first school===
*[[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] (c.1509–1571) (Italian)
*[[Damiano del Barbiere]], Italian stuccoist and sculptor
*[[Francesco Scibec da Carpi]] (died c. 1557) Italian furniture maker, who worked on the ''boiseries''.
*[[Léon Davent]], French etcher
*[[Antonio Fantuzzi]], Italian painter and etcher
*[[Rosso Fiorentino]] (Giovanni Battista di Jacopo de' Rossi) (1494–1540) ([[Italy|Italian]])
*[[Juste de Juste]] (c.1505–1559) Franco-Italian sculptor and etcher
*[[Luca Penni]] (c. 1500/1504–1556) (Italian)
*[[Francesco Primaticcio]] (c.1505–1570) (Italian)
*[[Léonard Thiry]], Flemish, painter and etcher

=={{anchor|Second School of Fontainebleau}}Second School of Fontainebleau (from 1594)==

From 1584 to 1594, during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] the château of Fontainebleau was abandoned.  Upon his accession to the throne, [[Henry IV of France|Henri IV]] undertook a renovation of the Fontainebleau buildings using a group of artists: the Flemish born [[Ambroise Dubois]] (from Antwerp)  and the Parisians [[Toussaint Dubreuil]] and [[Martin Fréminet]].  They are sometimes referred to as the "second school of Fontainebleau".  Their late mannerist works, many of which have been lost, continue in the use of elongated and undulating forms and crowded compositions.  Many of their subjects include mythological scenes and scenes from works of fiction by the Italian [[Torquato Tasso]] and the ancient Greek novelist [[Heliodorus of Emesa]].

Their style would continue to have an influence on artists through the first decades of the 17th century, but other artistic currents ([[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and Flemish [[naturalism (visual art)|naturalist]] schools) would soon eclipse them.

===Notable artists of the second school===
*[[Ambroise Dubois]] (c.1542–1614) ([[Flemings|Flemish]] born)
*[[Toussaint Dubreuil]] (c.1561–1602)
*[[Martin Fréminet]] (1567–1619)

The '''Snettisham Hoard''' or ''Snettisham Treasure'' is a series of discoveries of [[Iron Age]] precious metal, found in the [[Snettisham]] area of the English county of [[Norfolk]] between 1948 and 1973.

==Snettisham iron age hoard==
The [[hoard]] consists of [[metal]], [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] and over 150 [[gold]] [[torc]] fragments, over 70 of which form complete torcs, dating from BC 70. Though the origins are unknown, it is of a high enough quality to have been royal treasure of the [[Iceni]].&lt;ref name=hilites&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm | title = The Snettisham Treasure | publisher = Current Archaeology | accessdate = June 6, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060509121039/http://www.cix.co.uk/~archaeology/hilites/snet.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snettisham Romano-British jeweller's hoard==
In 1985 there was also a find of [[Romano-British]] jewellery and raw materials buried in a clay pot in AD 155, the [[Snettisham Jeweller's Hoard]].

'''''The Battle of the Boyne''''' is a 1778 [[historical painting]] by the Anglo-American artist [[Benjamin West]].  It portrays the [[Battle of the Boyne]] which took place in Ireland in 1690. West's depiction of [[William III of Ireland|William of Orange]] on his white horse became the iconic image of liberation from Catholic Ireland; the painting was widely copied and distributed throughout the nineteenth century. The painting itself is at [[Mount Stewart]], [[Newtownards]], [[Northern Ireland]], and is the property of the [[National Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-death-of-frederick-1st-duke-of-schomberg-at-the-battle-of-the-boyne-132931/search/makers:benjamin-west-17381820/page/5 Art UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

==West and Historicism==
West became a celebrated figure for his 1770 work ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', which portrayed [[James Wolfe]]'s death during the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|fight for Quebec]] in 1759. His [[historical painting]]s brought him to national attention and he became a leading member of the [[Royal Academy of Arts|Royal Academy]]. West was influenced by [[neoclassicism]] and attempted to portray scenes that drew an emotional response, rather than being historically accurate.  As a "history painter," he was more concerned with the epic rendition of the narrative rather than with its possible accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pamela M. Fletcher|title=Narrating Modernity: The British Problem Picture, 1895-1914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvT_0aOkOSkC&amp;pg=PA146|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3568-0|page=146 note 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

West's 1778 work portrays the fighting at the Boyne, part of the [[Williamite War in Ireland]] (1689&amp;ndash;91). The battle was a decisive victory for the [[Williamite|Williamites]] over [[James II of Ireland|James II]]'s [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]], leading to the capture of the Irish capital city [[Dublin]]. By the time West made the painting, the Boyne had come to occupy an important position in Irish [[Protestant culture]]. The dominant image of the painting is [[William III of Ireland|William of Orange]] crossing the [[River Boyne]]. West's portrayal of the King became influential on subsequent images of William, particularly his use of a white horse.&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In the bottom right corner, he portrays the death of [[Marshal Schomberg]], the second-in-command of William's army. Schomberg had crossed the Boyne earlier than William and had been killed by Jacobite cavalry in the melee around [[Oldbridge]] ford. West transformed Schomberg's chaotic death into a tableau, one that has strong similarities to other heroic death scenes in West's paintings, such as General Wolfe or [[Horatio Nelson]] in ''[[The Death of Nelson (West painting)|The Death of Nelson]]'' (1806).&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom p.193&lt;/ref&gt;
==Adoption by the Orange Order==
Since the 1690s commemorations—state-sponsored and those held by the lower classes—had been held throughout Ireland celebrating key dates in the [[Williamite War]] such as the [[Battle of the Boyne]], [[Siege of Derry]] and the [[Siege of Cork]].&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ian McBride |title=History and Memory in Modern Ireland |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-79366-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; These followed a tradition started in [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] England of celebrating key events in the Protestant calendar. By the 1740s such organizations as the Boyne Club and the Protestant Society, both seen as forerunners to the [[Orange Order]], held parades in Dublin.&lt;ref name="McBride"/&gt;  As a "history painting, then, West's Battle of the Boyne represented an important moment in time, making it a crucial depiction of an event that was at least anecdotally important, monoscenic depictions of crucial moments in an implied narrative in the ongoing Orangist narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Lecture IV, p. 172, ''Lectures on Architecture and Painting: Delivered at Edinburgh, in November, 1853'', 1854, Wiley, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qKsaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22historical+painting%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lxuvUePlD4Pu0gXYk4CwBA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22historical%20painting%22&amp;f=false google books].&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Origin of the painting==
In 2011, another original painting of the battle was discovered in a basement of Brownlow House, [[Lurgan]], and testing indicated the painting dates from about the same time as West's 1778 work. Experts conducting the testing and restoration believe the painting was made by a Dutch artist who did not sign his or her work and the piece contains more details than the West painting, suggesting it may even be an earlier production.  The painting was damaged by bullet holes and knife slashes, and approximately 45 percent of the painting had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Newsletter: The Pride of Northern Ireland.

Accessed 23 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproductions==
Since West's painting, several reproductions have been made, mostly line etchings and engravings; these are widely exhibited.  The most prominent of these was made in 1781 by [[John Hall (artist)|John Hall]] ([[Wivenhoe]] 1739 – London 1797), which can be found at the [[Wordsworth House]], [[Cumbria]].  Versions of West's painting were often reproduced on walls throughout Belfast, although these reproductions are becoming increasingly rare as the walls give way to urban development.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Cathcart, [http://historyonline.chadwyck.co.uk/getImage?productsuffix=_studyunits&amp;action=printview&amp;in=gif&amp;out=pdf&amp;src=/pci/c172-1988-038-07-000007/conv/c172-1988-038-07-000007.pdf&amp;IE=.pdf ''Ireland and King Billy: Triumphalism Usage and Abusage.''] &lt;u&gt;History Today&lt;/u&gt;.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
In 2009, an elderly Cecil Gaines [[Frame story|recounts]] his life story while waiting at the [[White House]] to meet the newly inaugurated president.

In 1926, at the age of seven, Gaines is raised on a [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States|cotton plantation]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. When the farm's owner [[rape]]s Cecil's mother, Cecil's father confronts him and is killed. Cecil is taken in by the estate's caretaker, who trains Cecil as a house servant.

In 1937, at age eighteen, Cecil leaves the plantation. Desperately hungry, he breaks into a hotel pastry shop. The elderly master servant, Maynard, takes pity on Cecil and gives him a job. Cecil learns advanced serving and interpersonal skills from Maynard, who later recommends Cecil for a position in a [[Washington, D.C.]] hotel. While working there, Cecil meets and marries Gloria, and the couple has two sons: Louis and Charlie. In 1957, Cecil is hired by the [[White House]] during [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s administration. White House [[maître d'hôtel]] Freddie Fallows introduces Cecil to head butler Carter Wilson and co-worker James Holloway. Cecil witnesses Eisenhower's reluctance to use troops to enforce school desegregation, then his resolve to uphold the law by [[Little Rock Nine|racially integrating]] [[Little Rock Central High School]] in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Arkansas]].

Louis, the elder son, becomes a university student at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], although Cecil feels that the [[Deep South|South]] is too volatile. Louis joins a student program led by [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) activist [[James Lawson (American activist)|James Lawson]], which leads to a [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] [[sit-in]] at a [[Nashville sit-ins|segregated diner]], where he is arrested. Gloria, who feels that Cecil puts his job ahead of her, descends into [[alcoholism]].

In 1961, after [[John F. Kennedy]]'s inauguration, Louis and [[Freedom Riders|others]] are attacked by members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] while on a [[Freedom Riders|freedom ride]] to [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Louis participates in the 1963 [[Birmingham Campaign|Birmingham Children's Crusade]], where dogs and water cannons are used to stop the marchers, one of the movement's actions which inspires Kennedy to deliver [[Civil Rights Address|a national address]] proposing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. After Kennedy is [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated]] his successor, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], enacts the legislation. As a goodwill gesture, [[Jackie Kennedy]] gives Cecil one of the former president's [[necktie]]s.

Louis participates in the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches|Selma Voting Rights Movement]], which inspires Johnson to demand that Congress enact the landmark [[1965 Voting Rights Act|Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Johnson also gives Cecil a [[tie bar]].

In the late 1960s, after civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|assassination]], Louis tells his family that he has joined the [[Black Panthers]]. Cecil orders Louis and his girlfriend to leave his house. Louis is arrested again. Cecil becomes aware of President [[Richard Nixon]]'s plans to suppress the Black Panthers.

Charlie confides to Louis that he plans to join the [[Vietnam War|war in Vietnam]]. After enlisting, Charlie is killed and buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. When the Black Panthers resort to violence, Louis leaves the organization and returns to college, earning his [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] and eventually running for a seat in [[United States Congress|Congress]], although Cecil continues to hold resentment against him.

Cecil repeatedly confronts his supervisor at the White House over the unequal pay and career advancement provided to the black White House staff. With President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s support, Cecil prevails, his reputation growing to the point that he and his wife are invited by the Reagans to be guests at a state dinner. Cecil becomes uncomfortable with the class divisions in the White House. After witnessing Reagan's refusal to support [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act|economic sanctions]] against Apartheid [[South Africa]], Cecil resigns.

Gloria encourages Cecil to mend his relationship with Louis. Realizing his son's actions are heroic, Cecil joins Louis at a protest against [[Apartheid in South Africa|South African apartheid]]; they are arrested and jailed together.

In 2008, Gloria dies shortly before [[Barack Obama]] [[United States presidential election, 2008|is elected]] as the nation's first African-American president. Two months, two weeks and one day later, Cecil prepares to meet the newly [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|inaugurated]] President, wearing the articles he received from Kennedy and Johnson. [[Stephen W. Rochon]] approaches Cecil and tells him the president is ready, preparing to show him the way to the Oval Office. Cecil tells him that he knows the way.

==Production==

===Development===
[[Danny Strong]]'s screenplay is inspired by Wil Haygood's ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article "A Butler Well Served by This Election".&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite news |last=Haygood |first=Wil |title=A Butler Well Served by This Election|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/06/AR2008110603948_pf.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Reliable Source | date= August 6, 2013 | title= No, President Obama isn't doing a cameo in 'The Butler' | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/wp/2013/08/06/no-president-obama-isnt-doing-a-cameo-in-the-butler/ |department=Reliable Source (blog) | work=[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project received initial backing in early 2011, when producers Laura Ziskin and Pam Williams approached [[Sheila Johnson]] for help in financing the film. After reading Danny Strong's screenplay, Johnson pitched in her own $2.7 million before bringing in several African-American investors. However, Ziskin died from cancer in June 2011. This left director Daniels and producing partner Hilary Shor to look for further producers on their own. They started with [[Cassian Elwes]], with whom they were working on [[The Paperboy (2012 film)|''The Paperboy'']]. Elwes joined the list of producers, and started raising funding for the film. In spring 2012, Icon U.K., a British financing and production company, added a $6 million guarantee against foreign pre-sales. Finally the film raised its needed $30 million budget through 41 producers and executive producers, including Earl W. Stafford, Harry I. Martin Jr., Brett Johnson, [[Michael Finley]], and Buddy Patrick. Thereafter, as film production started [[Weinstein Co.]] picked up U.S. distribution rights for the film. David Glasser, Weinstein Co. COO, called fund raising as an independent film, "a story that's a movie within itself."&lt;ref name=holly13&gt;{{cite web| title = Why 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' Has 41 Producers| url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/why-lee-daniels-butler-has-605011|date=August 14, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Lee Daniels' The Butler: The film with FORTY ONE producers: How a host of stars and entrepreneurs raised $30m to fund The Butler |work=[[Daily Mail]] | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2394397/Lee-Daniels-The-Butler--The-film-FORTY-ONE-producers-How-host-stars-entrepreneurs-raised-30m-fund-The-Butler.html |date=August 15, 2013| accessdate = August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Weinstein Company]] acquired the distribution rights for the film after [[Columbia Pictures]] put the film in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brevet |first=Brad |title=New Look at 'The Butler' as the Weinstein Co.

The film's title was up for a possible rename due to a [[Motion Picture Association of America]] claim from [[Warner Bros.]], which had inherited from the defunct Lubin Company a now-lost 1916 silent short film with the same name.&lt;ref name=boies/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Ted |title=Harvey Weinstein Has Already Won 'The Butler' Battle (Opinion) |url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/biz/the-butler-title-tiff-why-weinstein-is-already-victorious-1200560460/ |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently resolved with the MPAA granting The Weinstein Company permission to add Daniels' name in front of the title, under the condition that his name was "75% the size of ''The Butler''{{-"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/07/toldja-mpaa-oks-weinstein-co-to-use-lee-daniels-the-butler/ |title=TOLDJA!

===Critical response===
''The Butler'' received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a 71% rating on the [[film critic]] aggregate site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 175 reviews. The site's consensus says, "Gut-wrenching and emotionally affecting, ''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' overcomes an uneven narrative thanks to strong performances from an all-star cast."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lee_daniels_the_butler/ |title=''Lee Daniels' The Butler'' (2013) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |date=August 16, 2013 |accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another review aggregator, [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Normalization (statistics)|normalized]] rating out of 100 top reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a score of 66 based on 47 reviews, indicating "generally positive reviews".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee Daniels' The Butler|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/lee-daniels-the-butler|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Regarding historical accuracy, Eliana Dockterman wrote in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'': "Allen was born on a [[Virginia]] plantation in 1919, not in Georgia.... In the movie, Cecil Gaines grows up on a cotton field in Macon, where his family comes into conflict with the white farmers for whom they work. What befalls his parents on the cotton field was [[Stereotypes of African Americans|added for dramatic effect]].... Though tension between father and son over civil rights issues fuels most of the drama in the film, [Eugene Allen's son] Charles Allen was not the radical political activist that Gaines's son is in the movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dockterman |first=Eliana |title=The True Story of The Butler: Fact vs. Fiction in Lee Daniels' The Butler |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2013/08/16/what-the-butler-really-saw/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particular criticism has been directed at the film's accuracy in portraying President [[Ronald Reagan]]. While Alan Rickman's performance generated positive reviews, the director and screenwriters of the film have been criticized for depicting Reagan as indifferent to civil rights and his reluctance to associate with the White House's black employees during his presidency. According to [[Michael Reagan]], the former president's son, "The real story of the White House butler doesn't imply racism at all. It's simply Hollywood liberals wanting to believe something about my father that was never there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bond|first=Paul|title=President Reagan's Son Attacks 'Lee Daniels' The Butler'|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/president-reagans-son-attacks-lee-614568 |accessdate=August 28, 2013|newspaper=The Hollywood Reporter|date=August 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/29/the-butler-ronald-reagan-not-racist|publisher=The Guardian|title=The Butler falsely portrays Ronald Reagan as racist, says son|date=August 29, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Newsmax|title=The Butler from Another Planet|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Reagan/Butler-Reagan-Oprah-Allen/2013/08/22/id/521814|date=August 27, 2013|first=Michael|last=Reagan|accessdate=December 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Kengor]], one of President Reagan's biographers, also attacked the film, saying, "I've talked to many White House staff, cooks, housekeepers, doctors, and Secret Service over the years. They are universal in their love of Ronald Reagan." In regard to the president's initial opposition to sanctions against [[apartheid]] in South Africa, Kengor said, "Ronald Reagan was appalled by apartheid, but also wanted to ensure that if the apartheid regime collapsed in South Africa that it wasn't replaced by a Marxist-totalitarian regime allied with Moscow and Cuba that would take the South African people down the same road as Ethiopia, Mozambique, and, yes, Cuba. In the immediate years before Reagan became president, 11 countries from the Third World, from Asia to Africa to Latin America, went Communist. It was devastating. If the film refuses to deal with this issue with the necessary balance, it shouldn't deal with it at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/lee-daniels-butler-reagan-biographers-608233|title=Lee Daniels' 'The Butler': Reagan Biographers Slam President's Portrayal|work=The Hollywood Reporter.com|date=August 16, 2013|accessdate=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Hapa Project''' is a [[multiracial]] [[Cultural identity|identity]] [[art]] project created by American artist [[Kip Fulbeck]].  The project embodies a range of mediums, including a published book, traveling photographic exhibition, satellite community presentations, and online communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citizen.nfb.ca/hapa-project |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708100712/http://citizen.nfb.ca/hapa-project |archivedate=2012-07-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Fulbeck began the project in 2001, traveling the country photographing over 1200 volunteer subjects who self-identified as [[Hapa]] (defined for the project as mixed ethnic heritage with partial roots in Asian and/or Pacific Islander ancestry)&lt;ref&gt;[http://seaweedproductions.com/the-hapa-project/hapa-about/].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=495&amp;nf=1] {{dead link|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each individual was photographed in a similar minimalist style (directly head-on, unclothed from the shoulders up, and without jewelry, glasses, excess make-up, or purposeful expression).  After being photographed, participants chose their own racial/ethnic terms to describe themselves, then responded to the question "What are you?" in their own handwriting.  The photographs, self-descriptions, and handwritten responses were then combined and displayed as a collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070518155355/http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=480&amp;nf=1] &lt;/ref&gt;

Over 1200 volunteer participants were photographed at dozens of shoots throughout California and Hawaii, as well as Illinois, New York, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2297 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objective==
The Hapa Project was created to promote awareness and recognition of the millions of multiracial/multiethnic individuals of Asian/Pacific Islander descent in the U.S; to give voice to multiracial people and previously ignored ethnic groups; to dispel myths of exoticism, hybrid vigor and racial homogeneity; to foster positive identity formation and self-image in multiracial children; and to encourage solidarity and empowerment within the multiracial/Hapa community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704071724/http://www.imdiversity.com/Villages/Asian/arts_culture_media/archives/fulbeck_hapa_project.asp |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fulbeck also notes that a main objective "... was to make the book I wish I owned when I was a kid. I never knew anyone else like me, going through things I went through, not fitting in, always having to choose sides ... Identity is a personal process and I’m adamant that it should be a personal decision, not one made by a community, a government or others." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513031725/http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/184.html |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of race as identifier==
Fulbeck states that despite its utilization of common racial classifications, The Hapa Project is fundamentally a project about identity rather than a project about race: "It's about identity using race as a starting point." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fulbeck |first=Kip |url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/forum/en/node/2298 |title=kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa – an artist’s thoughts - part 2 |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date=2008-03-19 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that race in itself is not biologically determined, but socially created: "For the record, race is not a scientifically sound assumption. For example, there is no DNA difference between human beings. We are all African. Biologically, race does not exist. It is a social and [[cultural construct]] ... The U.S. is a country with a long history of social genocide (Native Americans, African slavery, etc.) and this was all due to the seeming differences we attributed to race. Yes, it is very convenient to categorize people according to race. It is also extremely inaccurate, however." &lt;ref name="fulbeck1"/&gt;

==Conceptual strategies==
[[Image:janm2.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
[[Image:janm1.jpg|thumb|400px|The Hapa Project at the Japanese American National Museum]]
The use of a clinical photographic style combined with the listing of the subject's ethnic heritage alongside their image visually quotes from various pseudo-scientific 18th and 19th century racial studies of [[Carl Linnaeus]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]], and [[Arthur de Gobineau]] [See: Spickard, Paul, ''Almost All Aliens'', Routledge, New York, NY 2007]  However, Fulbeck's decision to have the subjects self-designate their ethnicity and to include their individual handwritten statements counters this methodology, giving ownership and responsibility to the subjects themselves. As historian Paul Spickard writes, "Kip Fulbeck is using the pictures to provoke and encourage his readers.  He is using the old form, but with exactly opposite content." [See: Fulbeck, Kip, Part Asian, 100% Hapa, Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;261]

The project also plays upon and critiques the official photographs each person has taken for their driver's licenses, passports and other forms of identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janm.org/press/release/92/ |title=Photographic Exhibition Kip Fulbeck: Part Asian, 100% Hapa Explores Perceptions of Identity, Questions Notions of Race, Ethnicity &amp;#124; Press Releases &amp;#124; Japanese American National Museum |publisher=Janm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further strategy aimed at diminishing the power dynamic between photographer/subject was to have each participant choose their own image, with the option of re-photographing them if they desired.  Fulbeck states, "... every participant not only got to write their statement the way they wanted to, they also got to pick their own image. A camera is a tremendously powerful tool and the power dynamic between photographer and subject is palpable. For this reason, I wanted to give some of the power back to the subjects. It was never going to be completely democratic – it is, after all, my concept, my project, and my design – but there are some strategies you can employ to make it less unilateral. Everyone got to see their image and choose to keep it or erase it and shoot again."  One participant was re-photographed 27 times.&lt;ref name="imdiversity1"/&gt;

==Offshoot projects==
Numerous schools and community organizations have created similar projects inspired by Fulbeck's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/emory_omps/sets/72157602156257949/set=72157602156257949&amp;nsid=43037005@N00&amp;lang=en-us |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.brown.edu/Student_Services/TWC/2006_2007/aahm.html |title=ANNOUNCEMENTS &amp;#124; Brown Center for Students of Color |publisher=Brown.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731214017/http://www.dbq.edu/news/news1.cfm?ID=375 |archivedate=July 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/nikkeialbum/en/collection/6926/item/7435 |title=The Hapa Collection |publisher=Discover Nikkei |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition history==
[[Image:hapaproject1.jpg|thumb|400px|Participatory component of The Hapa Project]]
The Hapa Project publicly premiered in 2006 at the [[Japanese American National Museum]] with a 5-month solo exhibition entitled "kip fulbeck: part asian, 100% hapa."  The work has also exhibited at Space180 Gallery (San Francisco), Mandeville Gallery (New York), [[The Field Museum]], [[University of North Carolina]], [[Oakland University]], [[Northern Arizona University]], [[Santa Clara University]], and [[Woodward Academy]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seaweedproductions.com/bio/curriculum-vitae/ |title=Curriculum Vitae - Kip Fulbeck |publisher=Seaweedproductions.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen images from the series are included in the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]]'s exhibition ''Race: Are We So Different?'' currently touring nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smm.org/travelingexhibits/race/gallery/11/ |title=Science Museum of Minnesota - The Hapa Project |publisher=Smm.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the exhibitions include a participatory component where visitors can take part in the project by having their picture taken and writing an individual statement.

==Public attention==
The project has received both national and international news coverage, being featured on [[CNN]], [[MTV]], [[PBS]], [[NPR]], and [[Voice of America]].  Major newspapers covering the project include [[The Los Angeles Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/jun/11/local/me-hapas11 |title=Mixed-Race Asians Find Pride as Hapas - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2006-06-11 |accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orange County Register]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/life/homepage/article_1158297.php |title=Hapa nation |publisher=Ocregister.com |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Kyoto Journal.  It has also been featured on dozens of websites exploring race and identity in the U.S.

==Book==
[[Image:Part Asian 100% Hapa Cover.jpg|thumb|''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' (Chronicle Books)]]
A book based on the project entitled ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'' was published by [[Chronicle Books]] in 2006.  It features a foreword by musician [[Sean Lennon]] and an afterword by historian Paul Spickard.

The book includes portraits and statements from approximately 10% of the overall project participants.  Fulbeck has discussed the difficulties in selecting these images from the overall pool, as well the problematic of selecting a single image for the book cover.  He also has written about the conscious decision to dispel stereotypes of Hapa people all being conventionally attractive.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

==Influences==
Fulbeck cites photographer [[Jim Goldberg]] and comic artist [[Lynda Barry]] as specifically influential to the creation of the project.  Lynda Barry also participated in the project and is included in ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa.''  Fulbeck also credits historian Paul Spickard as a major influence, particularly his book ''Mixed Blood: Intermarriage &amp; Ethnic: Intermarriage And Ethnic Identity In Twentieth Century America'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 1991) [See: Fulbeck, Kip, ''Part Asian, 100% Hapa'', Chronicle Books, San Francisco 2006, pp.&amp;nbsp;8, 55, 259].

==Anonymity and celebrity==
Participant names are listed alphabetically in both the photographic exhibition and book (without  index to individual images).  Fulbeck chose participant anonymity both for the safety of the children and as a thematic strategy.  "...I wanted participants to have as blank a slate as possible to work with, to not be burdened by any pre-existing identifiers. It’s interesting with celebrities, because celebrities without their gear – their look or environment or entourage – don’t look like celebrities. They look like people. And that’s what I wanted. I could photograph Cher this way and she’d look like a regular person." &lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;

Celebrities in the project include [[Lynda Barry]], [[Wuv Bernardo]], [[Asia Carrera]], [[Karen David]], [[Amy Hill]], [[Sean Lennon]], Liz Masakayan, [[Greg Pak]], [[Sonny Sandoval]], and [[Sandra Tsing Loh]].

==Emerging patterns==
Two-thirds of the project volunteers were part Japanese-American. An overwhelming majority of participants were female, including some shoots where women outnumbered men 20:1.&lt;ref name="discovernikkei1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/people/clip.php?id=485&amp;nf=1 |accessdate=September 5, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==

[[File:Jacob van Ruisdael, een watermolen schetsend Rijksmuseum SK-A-4865.jpeg|thumb|Historical painting of Jacob van Ruisdael sketching a watermill in Gelderland, by [[Gerard Bilders]], a 19th-century landscape painter who was inspired by Ruisdael's work]]
'''''The Watermill''''' (c. 1660) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Victoria]].

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "146. THE WATER-MILL. View across the mill-pool towards 
the water-mill, which stands amid trees. The same mill as that painted by [[Meindert Hobbema|Hobbema]], as, for example, in the two pictures at the Rijksmuseum 
(see Hobbema, 66, 67). The building on the right is roofed with red tiles, and the timbers are grey. To the left is a green hill. There is no distant 
view. On the road to the left is a man, followed by a dog. To the right is a flowering elder bush. To judge from the style, the picture was 
probably painted about the time when Hobbema and Ruisdael worked together (1660-63). 
Signed with the monogram on the left ; canvas, 25 inches by 27 1/2 inches. 

Exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] Winter Exhibition, London, 1876, No. 80, and 1902, No. 134. 
In the collection of the Right Hon. Lewis Fry, Clifton, Bristol. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/51/mode/1up  Entry 146 (Ruisdael) for ''''The Water-Mill''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael and his pupil Hobbema made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Scholars have tried to locate this specific watermill as it was portrayed so many times, but so far it has only been documented as being "somewhere in [[Gelderland]]."

The '''vagina and vulva have been depicted in art''' from [[prehistoric art|prehistory]] to the [[contemporary art]] era of the 21st century. [[Visual art]] forms representing the female genitals encompass two-dimensional (e.g. paintings) and three-dimensional (e.g. statuettes). As long ago as 35,000 years ago, people sculpted [[Venus figurine]]s that exaggerated the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or [[vulva]].

In 1866, [[Gustave Courbet]] painted a picture of a nude woman which depicted the female genitals, entitled "[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]". In the 20th and 21st century, artists such as [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Jean Tinguely]], [[Megumi Igarashi]] and [[Anish Kapoor]] have created artworks that depict the [[vagina]] or [[vulva]]. Sometimes these are explicitly works of [[feminist art]]: [[Judy Chicago]] created ''[[The Dinner Party]]'' to celebrate 39 women of history and myth, many of whom had fallen into obscurity. Other artists deny that their works reference the vulva or vagina, although critics view them as such; the flower paintings of [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] are a case in point.

There have long been folklore traditions, such as the ''[[vagina loquens]]'' ("talking vagina") and the ''[[vagina dentata]]'' ("toothed vagina"). Playwright [[Eve Ensler]] wrote the ''[[Vagina Monologues]]'', a popular stage work about many aspects of [[human female sexuality|women's sexuality]]. In some cases, vagina- or vulva-themed art has attracted controversy and led to legal issues or official [[censorship]] pertaining to perceptions of [[obscenity]].

For example, the term ''pudendum'', the Latin term used in medical English for the external genitalia, literally means "shameful thing".

As an aspect of [[Goddess|Goddess worship]] such reverence may be part of modern [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] beliefs.

==History==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Venus-of-Schelklingen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Venus of Hohle Fels]] sculpture, which is at least 35,000 years old, is the oldest example of a vulva in art.]]

Two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations of the vulva, i.e. paintings and [[figurine]]s, exist from tens of millennia ago.  They are some of the earliest works of [[prehistoric art]].

The [[cave of Chufín]] located in the town of Riclones in [[Cantabria]] ([[Spain]]) has prehistoric rock art which may be a depiction of the vulva. The cave was occupied at different periods, the oldest being around 20,000 years ago. Aside from schematic engravings and paintings of animals, there are also many symbols, such as a those known as "sticks". There is also a large number of drawings using points (''puntillaje''), including one which has been interpreted as a representation of a vulva.

A [[Venus figurine]] is any [[Upper Paleolithic]] statuette portraying a woman. Most have been unearthed in Europe, but others have been found as far away as Siberia, extending their distribution across much of Eurasia. Most of them date from the [[Gravettian]] period (28,000–22,000 years ago), but examples exist as early as the [[Venus of Hohle Fels]], which dates back at least 35,000 years to the [[Aurignacian]], and as late as the [[Venus of Monruz]], from about 11,000 years ago in the [[Magdalenian]].

These figurines were carved from soft stone (such as [[steatite]], [[calcite]] or [[limestone]]), bone or ivory, or formed of [[clay]] and fired. The latter are among the oldest [[ceramic]]s known. In total, over a hundred such figurines are known; virtually all of modest size, between 4&amp;nbsp;cm and 25&amp;nbsp;cm in height. Most of them have small heads, wide hips, and legs that taper to a point. Various figurines exaggerate the abdomen, hips, breasts, thighs, or vulva. In contrast, arms and feet are often absent, and the head is usually small and faceless.

===Ancient times===

===11th and 12th century===
[[File:SheelaWiki.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A 12th century sheela na gig on the [[SS Mary and David's Church, Kilpeck|church]] at [[Kilpeck]], [[Herefordshire]], England]]
[[Sheela na gig]]s are 11th and 12th century figurative carvings of naked women displaying an exaggerated vulva. They are [[grotesque#In architecture|architectural grotesques]] found on churches, castles, and other buildings, particularly in Ireland and Great Britain, sometimes together with male figures. One of the best examples may be found in the [[Irish round tower|Round Tower]] at [[Rattoo]], in [[County Kerry]], Ireland. There is a replica of the round tower sheela na gig in the county museum in [[Tralee]] town. Another well-known example may be seen at [[Kilpeck]] in [[Herefordshire]], England.

Such carvings are said to ward off death and evil.&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;Andersen, Jorgen ''The Witch on the Wall'' (1977) Rosenkilde &amp; Bagger {{ISBN|978-87-423-0182-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weir&gt;Weir, Anthony &amp; Jerman, James [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvgHL_LQ4H8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Images of Lust: Sexual Carvings on Medieval Churches], London: B. T. Batsford Ltd, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Other grotesques, such as [[gargoyle]]s and [[hunky punk]]s, were frequently part of church decorations all over Europe. It is commonly said that their purpose was to keep evil spirits away through the use of [[apotropaic magic]]. They often are positioned over doors or windows, presumably to protect these openings.

Weir and Jerman argue that their location on churches and the grotesque features of the figures, by [[Middle Ages|medieval]] standards, suggests that they represented female lust as hideous and sinfully corrupting.&lt;ref name=Weir/&gt; Another theory, espoused by Joanne McMahon and Jack Roberts, is that the carvings are remnants of a pre-Christian fertility or [[mother goddess]] religion.&lt;ref name=McMahon&gt;McMahon, J. &amp; Roberts, J. ''The Sheela-na-Gigs of Ireland and Britain: The Divine Hag of the Christian Celts – An Illustrated Guide,'' Mercier Press Ltd. (2000) {{ISBN|978-1-85635-294-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 book by Starr Goode called the ''Sheela na gig: The Dark Goddess of Sacred Power'', traces these images throughout history and contributes a discussion of the universality of "female sacred display" in it meanings and functions back to the origins of culture as seen in the Paleolithic cave art through the inclusion of the image in contemporary art, particularly [[feminist art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goode|first1=Starr|title='Sheela na gig: The Dark Goddess of Sacred Power|url=https://www.innertraditions.com/author/starr-goode/|website=Inner Traditions|publisher=Inner Traditions|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Folklore traditions===
The [[vagina loquens]], or "talking vagina", is a significant tradition in literature and art, dating back to ancient [[Motif (folkloristics)|folklore motifs]].&lt;ref name=ozark&gt;{{cite book|title=Unprintable Ozark Folksongs and Folklore: Blow the candle out|publisher=[[University of Arkansas Press]]|author=Vance Randolph, Gershon Legman |year=1992|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S93LdPw2KP0C&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=1557282374|pages=819–820}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zizek&gt;{{cite book|title=Organs without bodies: Deleuze and consequences|publisher=[[Routledge]]|author=Slavoj Zizek |year=2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pp6-1yQbgmgC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0415969212|page=173|accessdate=2015-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tales usually involve vaginas talking due to the effect of magic or charms, and often admitting to their unchastity.&lt;ref name=ozark/&gt;

Another folk tale concerns the [[vagina dentata]] ("toothed vagina"). The implication of these tales is that sexual intercourse might result in injury, [[emasculation]], or [[castration]] for the man involved. These stories were frequently told as [[cautionary tale]]s warning of the dangers of unknown women and to discourage rape.&lt;ref name=WhatsUp&gt;{{cite book| isbn = 978-0-312-64436-9| url = https://books.google.com/?id=2ybaNhKqGmwC&amp;pg=PA59| title       = What's Up Down There?: Questions You'd Only Ask Your Gynecologist If She Was Your Best Friend| publisher  = [[St. Martin's Press]]| date = 2010| accessdate = 2012-02-11| quote = | page= 59| author = Rankin, Lissa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blue-green.jpg|thumb|right|upright|While [[Georgia O'Keeffe]]'s paintings have been interpreted by some modern feminist artists as stylized depictions of the vulva, O'Keeffe herself consistently denied these Freudian interpretations of her paintings (pictured is "Blue and Green Music", 1921).]]

In 1966, the French artist [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] collaborated with [[Dadaist]] artist [[Jean Tinguely]] and [[:sv:Per Olof Ultvedt|Per Olof Ultvedt]] on a large sculpture installation entitled "hon-en katedral" (also spelled "Hon-en-Katedrall", which means "she-a cathedral") for Moderna Museet, in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. The outer form is a giant reclining sculpture of a woman with her legs spread. Museum patrons can go inside her body by entering a door-sized vaginal opening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikidesaintphalle.org/niki-de-saint-phalle/biography/#1965-1969 "Biography - 1965-69"], Niki de Saint Phalle Foundation, Retrieved 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Phalle stated that the sculpture represented a [[fertility goddess]] who was able to receive visitors into her body and then "give birth" to them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.academia.edu/4436238/_In_sorrow_she_created_delight_An_Appeal_for_a_Greater_Appraisal_of_the_Life_and_Art_of_Niki_de_Saint_Phalle |title="In sorrow, she created delight": An Appeal for a Greater Appraisal of the Life and Art of Niki de Saint Phalle |last1=Tripp |first1=Andrew |last2= |first2= |date=  |page=10 |website=www.academia.edu|publisher=Academia |access-date=24 October 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside her body is a screen showing [[Greta Garbo]] films, a goldfish pond and a soft drink vending machine. The piece elicited immense public reaction in magazines and newspapers throughout the world.
 
From 1974 to 1979, [[Judy Chicago]], a [[feminist art]]ist, created the vulva-themed [[installation art]]work "[[The Dinner Party]]". It consists of 39 elaborate place settings arranged along a triangular table for 39 mythical and historical famous women. [[Virginia Woolf]], [[Susan B. Anthony]], [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora of Byzantium]] are among those honoured. Each plate, except the one corresponding to Sojourner Truth (a Black woman), depicts a brightly-colored, elaborately styled butterfly-vulva form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brooklyn Museum: Place Settings|url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/place_settings/|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it was produced, despite resistance from the art world, it toured to 16 venues in six countries to a viewing audience of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reilly|first1=Maura|title=founding curator|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/tour_and_home.php|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, it has been on permanent exhibition in [[Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art|the Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art]] at the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York. Chicago gave [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] a prominent place in ''The Dinner Party'', because some modern feminists believe that O'Keeffe's detailed flower paintings such as ''Black Iris III'' (1926) evoke a veiled representation of female genitalia. O'Keeffe consistently denied the validity these Freudian interpretations of her art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/objects/166103/Georgia_OKeeffe_Place_Setting/ |title=Georgia O'Keeffe Place Setting |publisher=[[Brooklyn Museum]] |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artistic representation of the vagina coincides with 18th century anatomical dissection and identification of the genitalia (i.e., [[William Hunter (anatomist)|William Hunter]]).&lt;ref&gt;Paola Uparella Carlos A.

REVISTA DE HISTORIA, TEORIA Y CRITICA DE ARTE , 3 (Julio-Diciembre). https://doi.org/10.25025/hart03.2018.04&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary art, from a feminist perspective, has revisited and deconstructed the androcentric view of woman genitalia and the stereotypical identification with female subjectivity (i.e., Ana Mendieta, [[Enrique Chagoya]], [[Vik Muniz]], [[Candice Lin]], etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Paola Uparella and Carlos A.

''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', a 1996 episodic play by [[Eve Ensler]], has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, [[rape]], menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Ensler, Eve (2001).

[[Jamie McCartney]], based in [[Brighton]] on the south coast of England, created the Great Wall of Vagina, made from dozens of models of vulvas, showing widespread variation.

[[Aidan Salahova]] is an Azerbaijanian artist, gallerist and public person. In an article entitled "Vagina Art Veiled at Azerbaijan's Venice Biennale Pavilion, Causing Some to Cry Censorship", Kate Deimling stated that in 2011, Salahova's "Black Stone", a "sculpture depicting the black stone in Mecca venerated by Muslims within a vagina-like marble frame, were both covered up".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vagina Art Veiled at Azerbaijan's Venice Biennale Pavilion, Causing Some to Cry Censorship|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37829/vagina-art-veiled-at-azerbaijans-venice-biennale-pavilion-causing-some-to-cry-censorship/|author=Kate Deimling|date=8 June 2011|work=Blouin Art Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was representing the Azerbaijan Pavilion among other national artists at the 54th [[Venice Biennale]]. Two of her artworks previously approved by the ministry of culture were ordered to be covered and eventually removed from the exhibition a day before the opening, "because of government sensitives towards the nation's status as a secular Muslim country".&lt;ref&gt;Rob Sharp [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/venetian-mask-azerbaijan-censors-its-own-biennale-entry-2292827.html ''Venetian mask: Azerbaijan censors its own Biennale entry''], The Independent (London), 4 June 2011.

In 2012, an image of an 1866 [[Gustave Courbet]] painting of the female genitals, entitled "[[L'Origine du monde|The Origin of the World]]", being posted on [[Facebook]] led to a legal dispute. After a French teacher posted an image of the painting, Facebook considered the image to be [[pornography|pornographic]] and suspended his account for violating its terms of use.&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stern |first=Mark Joseph |date=3 July 2012 |title=France Wants To Punish Facebook For Censoring A Painting of A Vagina.

In Japan, artist [[Megumi Igarashi]] has drawn attention for her work featuring vaginas and vulvas, which she considers "overly hidden" in Japan compared to male genitalia. In July 2014, Igarashi was arrested by Japanese authorities for distributing 3D data of her vulva to contributors of her crowdsource campaign. She has also made vagina-themed sculptures.&lt;ref name="The Guardian 15 July 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCurry|first1=Justin|title=Vagina selfie for 3D printers lands Japanese artist in trouble|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/15/vagina-selfie-for-3d-printers-lands-japanese-artist-in-trouble|accessdate=15 July 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While police charged Igarashi for her vulva- and vagina-themed artworks, there are several phallus festivals in Japan in which participants parade with massive penis sculptures, a practice which is deemed acceptable by authorities.

In 2015 [[Anish Kapoor]], a [[Turner Prize]]-winning artist, created controversy with his sculpture entitled "Dirty Corner", a "massive steel funnel set in broken stone, placed in the garden of the...[[Palace of Versailles]]", which he claims is a depiction of the vagina of the former Queen of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frank |first=Priscilla|date=6 August 2015 |title=Anish Kapoor Put A Vagina Sculpture In Versailles' Garden, And People Are Unimpressed |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/anish-kapoor-vagina-sculpture_n_7537204 |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3329">'''Wired for Books''' was an online educational project of the [[Ohio University|WOUB]] Center for Public Media at [[Ohio University]] in [[Athens, Ohio]]. Created and produced by David Kurz, and launched on May 25, 1997, the website featured author interviews, dramatic audio productions of classic literature, poetry readings, short stories, lectures, essays, and children's literature.{{cn|date=June 2014}}

Nearly 700 uncut audio author interviews conducted by Don Swaim for his ''Book Beat'' show on [[CBS Radio]] were available at Wired for Books in their entirety. Original unabridged audio productions of ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/alice/ Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]'', ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/carol/content.htm A Christmas Carol]'', ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/macbeth/ Macbeth]'', and ''[http://www.wiredforbooks.org/oz/ The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]'' could be found at Wired for Books in [[RealAudio|streaming media]] as well as some downloadable [[MP3]] files. Essayists, fiction writers, and poets read their works, often with commentary. Kids' Corner, the children's section of Wired for Books, featured the stories of [[Beatrix Potter]] and other classic stories for children.

==Reception==
In 1999, the website was awarded the Streamers WebSage Award from RealNetworks for the best educational use of streaming media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ohiou.edu/about/new/wfbaward.html |title= "Wired for Books" Wins Streaming Media Award" |website= [[Ohio University]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, Education World rated Wired for Books an A+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.education-world.com/awards/2004/r0504-24.shtml|title= Site Review: Wired for Books|website= [[Education World]] |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Wired for Books was chosen by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] as one of the best online sites for education in the humanities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://edsitement.neh.gov/spotlight.asp?id=103 |author= EDSITEment’s |title=2005-2006 'Best of the Humanities on the Web' |website= [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eTech Ohio presented the 2006 Program of the Year Award to Wired for Books as part of the Ohio Public Broadcasting Awards for Radio.{{cn|date=July 2014}}

On November 20, 2007, Wired for Books was featured in ''[[PC Magazine]]''{{'}}s "Best of the Internet" column.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2211446,00.asp|title= Best of the Internet |work= [[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2007-11-20 |date=2007-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, due to changes in staffing and resources for the management of wiredforbooks.org, the Don Swaim files were provided to Alden Library at Ohio University (where the original master tapes are held) - and the website went dark.  The URL has been picked up by another organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of [[analytical psychology]], the '''Wise Old Woman and the [[Wise Old Man]]''' are [[archetypes]] of the [[Collective Unconscious]]. 'The "wise old woman"...[or] helpful "old woman" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Jacobi, "Symbols in an Individual Analysis" in C. G . Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 331 and p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity'&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; is her male counterpart.

==Individuation==

In Jung's thought, the [[individuation]] process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the intermediate position of '[[Anima and animus|anima or animus]]...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed "[[Mana]]" personalities or "supraordinate" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the ''mother'' ("Primordial Mother" and "[[Earth Mother]]") as a supraordinary personality...as the "self"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''[[guru]]''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "The Process of Individuation", in C. G. Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 226-7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by [[Hecate]] or the [[Crone]] ...the Great Mother'&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, ''The Old Woman's Daughter'' (Texas 2006) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore "for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in Jolande Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung: An Introduction'' (London 1946) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mana attributes: positive and negative==

In Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'the "good Wise Man" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure',&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the "terrible mother"'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; 

But judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the "supraordinate personality", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 226 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a "coniunctio oppositorum", a union of opposites.  'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 115 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;
