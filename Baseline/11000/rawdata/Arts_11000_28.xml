'''130–136 Piccotts End''' is a medieval [[timber framed]] building in [[Piccotts End]] in [[Hertfordshire]], England. Originally a [[hall house]],&lt;ref name="pep"&gt;{{cite web|title=About 132 Piccotts End|url=https://www.piccottsendpaintings.uk/about-the-cottage/|website=Piccotts End Paintings|accessdate=14 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114105125/https://www.piccottsendpaintings.uk/about-the-cottage/|archivedate=14 November 2017|language=en|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the structure has been divided into a row of cottages. Two of the cottages are of interest for the art work they contain.&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{NHLE|num=1342208|desc=130–136 Piccotts End|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Important murals were discovered at No 132 in the 1950s and the entire building was [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed Grade I]].

==Location==
[[Piccotts End]] is a village near [[Hemel Hempstead]]. The original function of the building is not known. It has been suggested that the building was connected with [[Ashridge Priory]], which was in existence from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=mural&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/article/the-secret-religious-code-of-mystery-medieval-murals/|title=The secret religious code of mystery medieval murals|publisher=Dacorum Heritage Trust|accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murals==
Inside the house at number 132 are a number of fifteenth-century religious [[Mural|wall painting]]s, which are of particular interest to historians as a rare example of pre-Reformation English Catholic art. The paintings are thought to originate from around 1470-1500. Following the [[English Reformation]], religious art came to be regarded as a form of [[idolatry]] and many works were obliterated or destroyed; for this reason, some of the faces in the Piccotts End murals were mutilated and the paintings subsequently covered over by whitewash. They remained hidden for over 400 years until they were uncovered in 1953 by a resident.&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;

The origins of the paintings is unknown. Historians surmise that the Piccotts End house may have served as a [[hospice]] for pilgrims, as it was located close to a [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrim trail]] which went via the nearby [[Ashridge Priory|Monastery of the Bonhommes at Ashridge]]. At Ashridge, pilgrims could venerate a phial of the [[Blood of Christ]] before proceeding to [[St Albans Abbey]] to venerate the holy [[relic]]s of [[Saint Alban]]. The art historian [[E. Clive Rouse]] has noted that the murals exhibit a technique of [[woodcut]] illustration dating from the late 15th and early 16th centuries, suggesting the influence of the artistic style of the [[Habsburg Netherlands|Low Countries]].&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mural/&gt;

The wall paintings consist of five panels, arranged in a type of [[iconostasis]], resembling a large screen covered with icons, set in tiers. In the centre panel is [[Christ in Majesty]], with the [[Christogram#IHS|"IHS" Sacred Monogram]] in the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]].  In the right panel is depicted the  [[Baptism of Jesus]] by [[Saint John the Baptist]]; in the background an [[archangel]] holds Christ’s robes. On the extreme right is a badly damaged image of [[Pope Clement I|Saint Clement]], the third Pope with a symbolic anchor on each shoulder and the [[Papal cross]]. The left panel contains a [[Pietà]] (the Virgin Mary holding the dead Christ), and on the far left is a representation of [[Saint Peter]] wearing the [[Papal Tiara]], with a Papal cross and the [[Keys of Heaven]]. In the two lower panels are paintings of figures of [[St Catherine of Alexandria]] (with her Catherine wheel)  and [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]] emerging from the belly of a dragon. Many figures are depicted wearing typical [[1400–1500 in European fashion|Tudor dress]]. They are decorated with orange-red, grey and blue and white foliation with yellow fruit and flowers. A blank space in the lower wall suggests the former presence of an altar.&lt;ref name="pep" /&gt;

It has been suggested that some of the symbolism contained in the wall paintings indicate connections with the doctrines of [[Catharism]], a sect considered [[Heresy in Christianity|heretical]] by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="pep"/&gt;

==Hospital==
In the 1820s the building was converted for use as a [[cottage hospital]] by the anatomist and surgeon Sir [[Astley Cooper]].&lt;ref name="Telegr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/property/4811661/Inside-story-Piccotts-End.html |title=Inside story |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the early 1830s the number of patients increased because of injuries to workers constructing the [[London and Birmingham Railway|London to Birmingham railway]]. Accordingly the hospital moved to larger premises at [[Hemel Hempstead Hospital|Cheere House]] in [[Hemel Hempstead]] in 1832.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=412|title=Hemel Hempstead General Hospital (West Herts Wing), Hemel Hempstead|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Twentieth-century art'''—and what it became as [[modern art]]—began with [[modernism]] in the late nineteenth century. Nineteenth-century movements of [[Post-Impressionism]] ([[Les Nabis]]), [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] led to the first twentieth-century art movements of [[Fauvism]] in France and [[Die Brücke]] ("The Bridge") in Germany. Fauvism in Paris introduced heightened non-representational colour into figurative painting. Die Brücke strove for emotional [[Expressionism]]. Another German group was [[Der Blaue Reiter]] ("The Blue Rider"), led by [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] in [[Munich]], who associated the ''blue rider'' image with a spiritual non-figurative mystical art of the future. Kandinsky, [[František Kupka|Kupka]], [[Robert Delaunay|R. Delaunay]] and [[Francis Picabia|Picabia]] were pioneers of [[Abstract art|abstract]] (or non-representational) art. [[Cubism]], generated by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger|Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes|Gleizes]] and others rejected the plastic norms of the [[Renaissance]] by introducing multiple perspectives into a two-dimensional image. [[Futurism]] incorporated the depiction of movement and machine age imagery. [[Dadaism]], with its most notable exponents, [[Marcel Duchamp]], who rejected conventional art styles altogether by exhibiting [[found object]]s, notably a [[Fountain (Duchamp)|urinal]], and too [[Francis Picabia]], with his ''Portraits Mécaniques''.

Parallel movements in Russia were [[Suprematism]], where [[Kasimir Malevich]] also created non-representational work, notably a black canvas. The [[Jack of Diamonds (artists)|Jack of Diamonds]] group with [[Mikhail Larionov]] was expressionist in nature.

[[Dadaism]] preceded [[Surrealism]], where the theories of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] psychology led to the depiction of the dream and the unconscious in art in work by [[Salvador Dalí]]. [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky's]] introduction of [[Abstract art|non-representational art]] preceded the 1950s American [[Abstract Expressionist]] school, including [[Jackson Pollock]], who dripped paint onto the canvas, and [[Mark Rothko]], who created large areas of flat colour. Detachment from the world of imagery was reversed in the 1960s by the [[Pop Art]] movement, notably [[Andy Warhol]], where brash commercial imagery became a Fine Art staple. Warhol also minimised the role of the artist, often employing assistants to make his work and using mechanical means of production, such as [[Screen-printing|silkscreen printing]]. This marked a change from [[Modernism]] to [[Post-Modernism]]. [[Photorealism]] evolved from Pop Art and as a counter to Abstract Expressionists.

Subsequent initiatives towards the end of the century involved a paring down of the material of art through [[Minimalism]], and a shift toward non-visual components with [[Conceptual art]], where the idea, not necessarily the made object, was seen as the art. The last decade of the century saw a fusion of earlier ideas in work by [[Jeff Koons]], who made large sculptures from [[kitsch]] subjects, and in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Young British Artists]], where Conceptual Art, Dada and Pop Art ideas led to [[Damien Hirst]]'s exhibition of a [[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living|shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9600">The '''Access to Knowledge''' ('''A2K''') movement is a loose collection of [[civil society]] groups, [[government]]s, and individuals converging on the idea that access to [[knowledge]] should be linked to fundamental principles of [[justice]], [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and [[economic development]].

==History ==

The [[Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities]] from 2003 is a major declaration reflecting the goals of the movement pertaining to academic publishing.

In October 2004, the [[Geneva declaration on the future of the World Intellectual Property Organization]] emerged from a call from [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]] for a development agenda for the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and was supported by hundreds organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/genevadeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of WIPO|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Supporters included the [[Free Software Foundation]], with a statement ''Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation": Supporting the Geneva Declaration.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsfe.org/activities/wipo/wiwo.en.html|title=FSFE - Towards a "World Intellectual Wealth Organisation"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the proposals of the declaration was to a «call for a Treaty on Access to Knowledge and Technology. The Standing Committee on Patents and the Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights should solicit views from member countries and the public on elements of such a treaty».&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/ip/wipo/futureofwipodeclaration.html|title=Geneva Declaration on the Future of the World Intellectual Property Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A shared discussion platform on A2K issues is the [[mailing list]] of that name, which was initiated around discussion of the Geneva declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Formerly at https://web.archive.org/web/20090213032523/http://lists.essential.org/pipermail/a2k/, now at http://lists.keionline.org/mailman/listinfo/a2k_lists.keionline.org.&lt;/ref&gt;
A draft "A2K treaty" was later produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/a2k_treaty_may9.pdf |title=Treaty on Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed treaty is intended to ease the transfer of knowledge to developing nations, and to secure the viability of open innovation systems all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/weblog/index.php?p=19&amp;res=1280_ff&amp;print=0 |title=Experts Debate Access To Knowledge &amp;#124; Intellectual Property Watch |publisher=Ip-watch.org |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights debate===
Access to knowledge and science is protected by Article 27 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. The article balances the right of access with a right to protection of moral and material interests:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Article 27
Everyone has the right freely to participate in the cultural life of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement and its benefits.
&lt;br /&gt;
Everyone has the right to the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is the author.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A2K academics argue that “material interests” are not simply equivalent to current intellectual property provisions, not least because these rights are saleable and transferable, and therefore not “inalienable”. The right to access is ultimately the more important part of the right. Current levels of IP protection seem out of balance with Article 27, according to A2K theorists:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... in a very real sense, rights delayed are rights denied. Had access to oral rehydration therapy and second-generation vaccine technologies been delayed for twenty years ... three million children would have died. Even for less life- and-death technologies, a twenty-year delay works an immense limitation on enjoyment of the right. For cultural works, the situation is even worse; protection lasts longer than a human lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ssrn= 1354788 |title=The Right to Science and Culture |first=Lea |last=Shaver|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1354788 |journal=Wisconsin Law Review |date=2010 |volume=1 |pages=121–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Supporters==

=== Knowledge Ecology International ===
[[CP Tech]] (now [[Knowledge Ecology International]]) say: "the A2K (Access to Knowledge) movement takes concerns with copyright law and other regulations that affect knowledge and places them within an understandable social need and policy platform: access to knowledge goods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cptech.org/a2k/ |title=Access to Knowledge |publisher=Cptech.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumers International===
Many different groups refer to the A2K movement. [[Consumers International]] is particularly prominent, running a dedicated domain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://a2knetwork.org/ |title=A global advocacy network for consumers in the digital age |publisher=A2Knetwork.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030152718/http://a2knetwork.org/ |archivedate=2013-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and defines the movement as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the umbrella term for a movement that aims to create more equitable public access to the products of human culture and learning. The ultimate objective of the movement is to create a world in which educational and cultural works are accessible to all, and in which consumers and creators alike participate in a vibrant ecosystem of innovation and creativity.&lt;br/&gt;
These goals are of interest to a broad coalition of consumer groups, NGOs, activists, Internet users and others. For many of them, coming to grips with the issues involved in the A2K movement can be daunting. These issues, including copyright and patent law reform, open content licensing, and communications rights, often involve legal and technological concepts that even specialists find difficult.

The '''Association of British Orchestras (ABO)''' exists to support, promote and advance the interests and activities of professional orchestras in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abo.org.uk Association of British Orchestras] www.abo.org.uk, 18/03/10&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was founded in 1947 as the Orchestral Employers' Association, primarily to negotiate with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)]] and other bodies on behalf of its membership, which consisted almost entirely at that time of those orchestras receiving annual funding from the newly established [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abo.org.uk History] www.abo.org.uk, 18/03/10&lt;/ref&gt; The past decade has seen a substantial development in the organisation in terms of its size (an increase from 35 organisations in 1989 to over 180 today&lt;ref&gt;Classic FM [http://www.classicfm.co.uk/about-classic-fm/partners/association-british-orchestras/ www.classicfm.co.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228065533/http://www.classicfm.co.uk/about-classic-fm/partners/association-british-orchestras/ |date=28 December 2010 }}, 18/03/10&lt;/ref&gt;) and its role has expanded to include a diverse range of activities designed to support the development of the UK's orchestral life.

==Mission==
The ABO's mission is to enable and support a vibrant, innovative, collaborative and sustainable orchestral sector. It exists to support and champion professional orchestras in the UK in their ambition to perform music to the highest artistic standards for the widest possible audience. 

The key objectives of the Association cover three areas of activity:

•	Connecting
•	Championing
•	Developing

==History==
The Association of British Orchestras was founded in 1947 as the Orchestral Employers' Association, primarily to negotiate with the [[Musicians' Union (UK)]] and other bodies on behalf of its membership, which consisted almost entirely at that time of those orchestras receiving annual funding from the newly established [[Arts Council of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abo.org.uk ABO] 18/03/10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the Association took on limited company status, becoming the Association of British Orchestras.  It continues to negotiate the ABO/MU Freelance Orchestral Agreement with the MU and represent its membership in discussions and negotiations with a number of other national organisations.

The Association of British Orchestras has developed a role as co-ordinator of various national projects, including two major sponsorship programmes involving the participation of a large number of member orchestras. A series of nationally co-ordinated education projects over the past years resulted in the Orchestras in Education programme, which existed to promote the education work of member orchestras and to develop the relationship between schools, teachers, and orchestral players.

The ABO has also mounted a number of research initiatives, with a series of industry reports being produced, such as a comprehensive statistical survey of the UK's orchestral profession, 'Knowing the Score', and a report on noise damage to musicians, 'A Sound Ear'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abo.org.uk/Information/Publications/ 'A Sound Ear'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313021143/http://www.abo.org.uk/Information/Publications/ |date=13 March 2010 }} Alison Wright Reid (2001), www.abo.org, 24/03/10.

*'''Healthy Orchestra Charter'''
The Healthy Orchestra Charter is a joint initiative by the ABO and the [[Musicians' Benevolent Fund]]. Launched at the 2006 ABO Conference in Newcastle/Gateshead, the Charter aims to set an industry-wise standard of care and award charter marks to orchestras that are displaying good practice towards the physical, mental and emotional health of employees – both orchestral musicians and their management.

*'''Pearle'''
The ABO and its members are members of PEARLE*, which helps the ABO keep track of legislative developments within the EU.

*'''Sustainable touring'''
The ABO is working with Julie's Bicycle, a [[not-for-profit organisation]] helping the music industry cut its [[greenhouse gas]] emissions and create a low carbon creative future and has published the Green Orchestras Guide and Green Charter{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Annual Conference===

The ABO's primary event each year is its annual conference, the major gathering of the classical music industry in the UK, with around 300 delegates drawn from orchestras both from within the UK and abroad, plus funding agencies, venues, agents, publishers, and suppliers. The principal media partner is [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]].

==ABO Trust==
The ABO Trust is the charitable wing of the Association of British Orchestras and exists to support its work. Its remit includes the promotion of public musical education, research projects, research archive, and fundraising.

'''Bishapur''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''Bay-Šāpūr''; {{lang-fa|بیشاپور|}}, ''Bishâpûr'') was an ancient city in [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persia]] ([[Iran]]) on the ancient road between [[Persis]] and [[Elam]]. The road linked the [[Sassanid]] capitals [[Estakhr]] (very close to [[Persepolis]]) and [[Ctesiphon]]. It is located south of modern [[Faliyan]] in the [[Kazerun County]] of [[Pars Province]], [[Iran]].

Bishapur was built near a river crossing and at the same site there is also a fort with rock-cut reservoirs and a river valley with six Sassanid [[rock relief]]s.

The most important point about this city, is the combination of Persian and Roman art and architecture that hadn't been seen before Bishapur construction. Before Bishapour was built, almost all the main cities in Persia/Iran had a circular shape like the old city in [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]] or [[Darab]].  Bishapour is the first city with vertical and horizontal streets also in the city specially in interior design we can see tile work that's adapted from [[Roman art|Roman Art]]  

== History ==
[[File:Bishapour palais Shapur.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Ruins of Shapour Palace in Bishapur]]
[[File:Bishapur by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Bishapur in 1840; a painting by [[Eugène Flandin]] in the book "Travel in Persia" (''Voyage en Perse'')]]
[[File:Bishapour jarres.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Jarres discovered in Bishapur]]

The name ''Bishapur'' derives from ''Bay-Šāpūr'', which means ''Lord Shapur''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bisapur-town&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an inscription, the city itself was founded in 266 AD by [[Shapur I]] (241-272), who was the second Sassanid king and inflicted a triple defeat on the Romans, having killed [[Gordian III]], captured [[Valerian (emperor)|Valerian]] and forced [[Philip the Arab]] to surrender. In his native province of [[Fars Province|Fars]], he built a new capital that would measure up to his ambitions: Bishapur, ''Shapur's City''. Outside the city, Shapur decorated the sides of the Bishapur River gorge with huge historical relief commemorating his triple triumph over Rome. One of these reliefs, in a semicircular shape, has rows of registers with files of soldiers and horses, in a deliberate imitation of the narrative scenes on the [[Trajan]] column in Rome. 

At Bishapur the king also inaugurated the Sassanid imagery of the king's investiture, which would be copied by his successors: the king and the god are face to face, often on horseback, and the god - usually [[Ahura Mazda]] - is holding the royal diadem out to the sovereign.

The city, has the remarkable [[Band-e Kaisar|dam bridge in Shushtar]], built by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] soldiers who had been captured after [[Battle of Edessa|Valerian's defeat]] in 260. However, it was not a completely new settlement: archaeologists have found remains from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Elamite Kingdom|Elamite]] ages.

The city remained important until the [[Arab conquest of Persia]] the rise of Islam in the second quarter of the 7th century AD. There were still people living there in the 10th century.

The city has a rectangular plan with a grid pattern of regular intra urban streets, resembling [[Ancient_Roman_architecture#City_design|Roman city design]]. This design was never repeated in the [[architecture of Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salma |first1=K. Jayyusi|last2=Holod|first2=Renata|last3=Petruccioli|first3=Attilio|last4=André|first4=Raymond|title=The City in the Islamic World|date=2008|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004162402|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations and Research==
The site was cleared by the Russian-French archaeologist [[Roman Ghirshman]] in the 1930s. The British archaeologist [[Georgina Herrmann]] has also written a book about the Sasanian rock reliefs in Bishapur which was published in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldcat.org/title/sasanian-rock-reliefs-at-bishapur-part-1-bishapur-iii-triumph-attributed-to-shapur-i/oclc/59815517&amp;referer=brief_results&lt;/ref&gt;

== Decoration ==
[[File:Mosaic01.jpg|thumb|450px|upright|Persian-Roman floor mosaic detail from the palace of [[Shapur I]] at Bishapur. Now this tile work is in [[National Museum of Iran]]]]
The main part of the excavations took place in the royal sector, in the east of the city. A water temple, interpreted as a  [[Anahita|Anahita temple]] , was erected near the palace. In the center there is a cross-shaped space with eight large square exedrae decorated with 64 alcoves. The French excavators believed it had been covered with a dome roof, but this reconstruction has been rejected. To the west lies a courtyard decorated with mosaics; to the east, a square iwan used as a reception room. Its walls must have been covered with small stucco ornaments: rows of medallions, bands of foliage, and topped with merlons inherited from Achaemenid architecture. All these decorative techniques were still used after the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]].

The floor was paved with black marble slabs, with a mosaic border. Along the walls runs a narrow band featuring a series of heads and masks, in a frontal or profile view, on a white background. At the top of each alcove there was a picture of women naked under their transparent veils: courtesans, musicians, dancers, women twisting garlands, together with a few richly attired noble ladies.

'''Burnt by the Sun''' was a band from [[New Jersey]], United States. Formed in November 1999 by ex-[[Human Remains (band)|Human Remains]] drummer [[Dave Witte]] and guitarist John Adubato. ex-For the Love of... Vocalist Mike Olender and bassist Ted Patterson joined soon after. A split EP with The Luddite Clone on [[Ferret Records]] brought them to the attention of metal-specialized [[Relapse Records]]. Impressed by the band's inventive, often humorous take on the metalcore genre, Relapse quickly signed the band, releasing a self-titled EP. Their full-length debut, ''Soundtrack to the Personal Revolution'' (featuring second guitarist Chris Rascio), was released on January 22, 2002, followed by ''The Perfect Is The Enemy Of The Good'' which was released on October 7, 2003.

Witte and Olender opted to part ways with the group in 2004, leading to a lengthy search for suitable replacements. But, in 2006, both returned to a revamped group (now featuring Nick Hale, formerly of Premonitions of War, on 2nd guitar)
 
On August 25, 2009 Burnt By The Sun released ''Heart of Darkness''.  The band stated that ''Heart of Darkness'' is BBTS' final album.

In 2016, former members Mike Olender, John Adubato and Dave Witte started a new band called River Black.

'''''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting''''' is a 1966 conceptual artwork by the Japanese artist [[Yoko Ono]].

==Work==
The work is made from paper, glass, a metal frame, a metal chain, a magnifying glass, and a painted ladder. The word YES is printed on the piece of paper.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://yokoono.guggenheim-bilbao.eus/en/artworks/ceiling-painting-yes-painting.html|publisher=Guggenheim Museum Bilbao|accessdate=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is interactive, with the viewer (or participant) expected to climb the ladder and use a magnifying glass to look at the word 'YES' which is printed on paper beneath a sheet of glass suspended from the ceiling.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

==History==
The work was shown at Ono's autumn 1966 show, ''Unfinished Paintings and Objects By Yoko Ono'' at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London.&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt; Two different ladders were used by Ono in the New York and subsequent London showing of the piece.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Buskirk|title=Creative Enterprise: Contemporary Art Between Museum and Marketplace|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ELqZ5YQZ1HUC|date=12 April 2012|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-4411-8820-5|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was displayed at Ono's 2014 retrospective at the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]].&lt;ref name='Bilbao'/&gt;

The relationship of the participant to the piece has changed in subsequent decades. At a retrospective in 2000, ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was displayed on a pedestal with physical interaction no longer possible. Interaction with Ono's ''Painting to Hammer a Nail'' was equally limited, with the piece having been displayed behind plexiglass.&lt;ref name="Buskirk2012"/&gt;

The preview night of Ono's INDICA exhibition on 9 November 1966 was visited by the musician [[John Lennon]] who had heard that "this amazing woman was going to be putting on a show...and it was going to be a bit of a happening". Lennon was initially impressed by the humour of Ono's work ''[[Apple (artwork)|Apple]]'', and later said of his interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' that he had "climbed the ladder, looked through the spyglass, and in tiny little letters it said 'yes'...So it was positive. I felt relieved".&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nell Beram|author2=Carolyn Boriss-Krimsky|title=Yoko Ono: Collector of Skies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6pCOWKp3LZ0C|date=1 February 2012|publisher=Abrams|isbn=978-1-61312-513-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon's initial interaction with ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' was depicted in the Canadian playwright [[Jean Yoon]]'s 2002 play ''The Yoko Ono Project''.&lt;ref name="YoonOno2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean Yoon|author2=Yōko Ono|title=The Yoko Ono Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fGahrFq9-FgC|year=2002|publisher=Broken Jaw Press|isbn=978-1-55391-001-5|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positive message of the piece attracted Lennon to Ono, the pair were subsequently introduced with neither apparently knowing much about each other's creative work.&lt;ref name="BeramBoriss-Krimsky2012"/&gt; Ono recalled in a 2014 interview with art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] for ''[[The Guardian]]'' that "The ladder John had to climb up was very high" with Jones writing that the "smallness of the yes and the difficulty of reaching it" reflected Ono's pain after the breakup of a recent relationship.&lt;ref name=Guard14&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/mar/13/yoko-ono-guggenheim-bilbao-conceptual-influence|title=Yoko Ono show at Guggenheim shines light on pioneering conceptual artist|date=13 March 2014|author=Jonathan Jones (journalist)|work=The Guardian|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' has been described by Ono as being representative of a journey towards [[hope]] and affirmation from [[pain]]. The difficulty in attaining hope and affirmation has been likened by Ono to the intimidating stature of a cathedral.&lt;ref name='ArtStory'&gt;{{cite web|title=Ceiling Painting, Yes Painting|url=http://www.theartstory.org/artist-ono-yoko-artworks.htm|publisher=The Art Story|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between ''Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting'' and Ono's 1964 work ''Cut Piece'' was extensively critiqued by James M. Harding in his essay "Between Material and Matrix: Yoko Ono's ''Cut Piece'' and the Unmaking of Collage" in his 2012 book of essays, ''Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde''.&lt;ref name="Harding2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M. Harding|title=Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u__fYFkBaJEC|date=26 June 2012|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-03520-7|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crass''' were an English [[art collective]] and [[punk rock]] band formed in 1977{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=69}}&lt;ref&gt;''"In August 1977 Dave King went (...) As Dave exits stage left, Steve Ignorant returns to Dial House and (...) Crass was born."'' {{cite book |author=Berger, George |title=The Story of Crass |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2006 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; who promoted [[anarchism]] as a political ideology, a [[lifestylism|way of life]] and a [[resistance movement]]. Crass popularised the [[anarcho-punk]] movement of the [[punk subculture]], advocating [[direct action]], [[animal rights]], [[feminism]] and [[environmentalism]]. The band used and advocated a [[DIY ethic]] approach to its albums, [[sound collage]]s, leaflets, and films.

Crass spray-painted stencilled [[graffiti]] messages in the [[London Underground]] system and on advertising billboards, coordinated [[Squatting|squats]] and organised political action. The band expressed its ideals by dressing in black, military-surplus-style clothing and using a stage backdrop amalgamating [[icon]]s of perceived authority such as the [[Christian cross]], the [[swastika]], the [[Union Jack]] and the [[ouroboros]].

The band was critical of the punk subculture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote=We believed that you could no more be a socialist [band] and signed to CBS (The Clash) than you could be an anarchist and signed to EMI |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |year=2004 |title=Love Songs |publisher=Pomona Publishing |page=xxiv |isbn=1-904590-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[youth culture]] in general. Nevertheless, the anarchist ideas that they promoted have maintained a presence in punk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d11374|label=Anarchist Punk genre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to their free experimentation and use of tape collages, graphics, spoken word releases, poetry and improvisation, they have been associated with [[avant-punk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2010/12/03/crass-the-anarcho-punk-fountainhead-is-coming-to-sf-in-march-sort-of|title=Crass, the Anarcho-Punk Fountainhead, Is Coming to S.F. in March -- Sort Of|first=Josh|last=Graham|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/16660-louder-than-words-walk-through|title=Reading And Rioting: A Louder Than Words Walk Through|publisher=The Quietus|date=11 November 2014|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_uk/article/gvdkbm/smoke-gets-in-your-eyes-anthony-mccalls-enchanting-film-installations|title=Smoke Gets In Your Eyes: Anthony McCall's Enchanting Film Installations|first=Erica|last=Gonsales|publisher=Creators|website=VICE|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[art punk]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/sep/28/popandrock.shopping4|first1=Dorian|last1=Lynskey|title=Jeffrey Lewis, 12 Crass Songs|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1977: Origins===
[[File:Crass steve 1981.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Steve Ignorant onstage, June 1981|Steve Ignorant onstage, June 1981]]
The band was based around [[Dial House (Essex, England)|Dial House]], an [[commune|open-house community]] near [[Epping, Essex|Epping]], Essex, and formed when Dial House founder [[Penny Rimbaud]] began jamming with [[Steve Ignorant]]&lt;ref&gt;Sleeve note on ''Bullshit Detector Volume 1'' (Crass Records, cat no.421984/4); ''"Sometime in 1977 Rimbaud and Ignorant started messing around with a song called 'owe us a living'. They ran through it a few times and decided to form a band consisting of themselves. They called themselves Crass"''&lt;/ref&gt; (who was staying in the house at the time). Ignorant was inspired to form a band after seeing [[The Clash]] perform at Colston Hall in [[Bristol]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"At the end of the Clash gig there was all these people shouting and saying 'your shit!' and Joe Strummer stood there and said 'if you think you can do any better go ahead and start your own band.' And I was like what a great idea!" {{cite web |url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/anarcho_punk/steve_ignorant_interview_2007.htm |title=Steve Ignorant Interview |publisher=Punk77}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rimbaud, a veteran of avant garde [[performance art]] groups such as [[EXIT (performance art group)|EXIT]] and Ceres Confusion,&lt;ref&gt;Rimbaud, P; "...EXIT – 'The Mystic Trumpeter, Live at the Roundhouse 1972' accompanying booklet, Exitstencil Recordings 2013&lt;/ref&gt; was working on his book ''Reality Asylum''. They produced "So What?" and "Do They Owe Us A Living?" as a drum-and-vocal duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Rimbaud, P |title=Love Songs |page=xxi |publisher=Pomona Publishing |year=2004 |isbn=1-904590-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; They briefly called themselves Stormtrooper{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=14}} before choosing Crass in reference to a line in the [[David Bowie]] song "[[Ziggy Stardust (song)|Ziggy Stardust]]" ("The kids was just crass").{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=99}}

Other friends and household members joined (including [[Gee Vaucher]], [[Pete Wright (musician)|Pete Wright]], [[N. A. Palmer]] and Steve Herman), and Crass played their first live gig at a squatted [[Street party|street festival]] in Huntley Street, [[North London]]. They planned to play five songs, but a neighbour "pulled the plug" after three.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=83}} Guitarist Steve Herman left the band soon afterwards, and was replaced by Phil Clancey, aka [[Phil Free]].{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=86}} [[Joy De Vivre]] and [[Eve Libertine]] also joined around this time.

Crass played two gigs at the [[The Roxy (Covent Garden)|Roxy Club]] in Covent Garden, London.&lt;ref name="punk77.co.uk"/&gt; According to Rimbaud, the band arrived drunk at the second show and were ejected from the stage; this inspired their song, "Banned from the Roxy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Banned from the Roxy" from ''Feeding the 5000'' |publisher=Small Wonder Records |year=1978 |url=http://www.plyrics.com/lyrics/crass/bannedfromtheroxy.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rimbaud's essay for Crass' self-published magazine ''International Anthem'', "Crass at the Roxy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rimbaud, Penny |title="Crass at the Roxy" from ''International Anthem 1'' |year=1977 |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/anthem1/anthem1_4.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051201130815/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/anthem1/anthem1_4.html |archivedate=1 December 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident the band took themselves more seriously, avoiding alcohol and cannabis before shows and wearing black, military surplus-style clothing on and offstage.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=103}}

[[File:The Crass logo.png|thumb|alt=Crass logo|Crass logo]]They introduced their stage backdrop, a logo designed by Rimbaud's friend Dave King.{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=23}} This gave the band a militaristic image, which led to accusations of fascism.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=104}} Crass countered that their uniform appearance was intended to be a statement against the "[[cult of personality]]", so (in contrast to many rock bands) no member would be identified as the "leader".{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=104}}

Conceived and intended as cover artwork for a self-published pamphlet version of Rimbaud's ''Christ's Reality Asylum'',{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=13}} the Crass logo was an amalgam of several "icons of authority" including the [[Christian cross]], the [[swastika]], the [[Union Jack]] and a two-headed [[Ouroboros]] (symbolising the idea that power will eventually destroy itself).{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=90}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Crass interview |journal=''New Crimes'' |issue=3 |date=Winter 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using such deliberately mixed messages was part of Crass' strategy of presenting themselves as a "barrage of contradictions",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Crass interview |journal=[[The Leveller]] |issue=25 |date=April 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; challenging audiences to (in Rimbaud's words) "make your own fucking minds up".{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=90}} This included using loud, aggressive music to promote a [[pacifism|pacifist]] message,{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=89}} a reference to their [[Dada]]ist, performance-art backgrounds and [[Situationist International|situationist]] ideas.{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=88}}

The band eschewed elaborate [[stage lighting]] during live sets, preferring to play under 40-watt household light bulbs; the technical difficulties of filming under such lighting conditions partly explains why there is little live footage of Crass.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=108|ps=: "They were very difficult to film, because with Super-8 you needed far more light than was available at a Crass gig – all you'd get was shadows and light – that would be about it. So it was a bit pointless filming the gigs. I did try asking for maybe 60 watt bulbs instead of 40 but there was no deal" – Mick Duffield}} They pioneered [[multimedia art|multimedia]] presentation, using video technology (back-projected films and [[video art|video collages]] by Mick Duffield and [[Gee Vaucher]]) to enhance their performances, and also distributed leaflets and handouts explaining anarchist ideas to their audiences.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=185}}

===1978–1979: ''The Feeding of the 5000'' and Crass Records===
{{main|Crass Records}}
Crass' first release was ''[[The Feeding of the 5000 (album)|The Feeding of the 5000]]'' (an 18-track, 12" [[Gramophone record|45 rpm]] EP on the [[Small Wonder Records|Small Wonder]] label) in 1978. Workers at the record-pressing plant refused to handle it due to the allegedly [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] content of the song "Asylum",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=George Berger |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-iqD__ZkppsC&amp;pg=PT182 |title=The Story of Crass |isbn=9780857120120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maria Raha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-NGokpBxFcC&amp;pg=PA96 |title=Cinderella's Big Score: Women Of The Punk And Indie Underground |page=96 |isbn=9781580051163 |date=31 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the record was released without it. In its place were two minutes of silence, entitled "The Sound of Free Speech". This incident prompted Crass to set up their own [[independent record label]], [[Crass Records]], to prevent Small Wonder from being placed in a compromising position and to retain editorial control over their material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ignorant, Steve |year=2010 |title=The Rest is Propaganda |publisher=Southern Records |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A re-recorded, extended version of "Asylum", renamed "Reality Asylum", was shortly afterwards released on Crass Records as a [[Single (music)|7]]" single and Crass were investigated by the police due to the song's lyrics. The band were interviewed at their Dial House home by [[Scotland Yard]]'s vice squad, and threatened with prosecution; however, the case was dropped.&lt;ref name=rimbaudsleevenote /&gt; "Reality Asylum" retailed at 45[[Coins of the pound sterling|p]] (when most other singles cost about 90p),{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=137}} and was the first example of Crass' "pay no more than..." policy: issuing records as inexpensively as possible. The band failed to factor [[value added tax]] into their expenses, causing them to lose money on every copy sold.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=138}} A year later Crass Records released new pressings of "The Feeding of the 5000" (subtitled "The Second Sitting"), restoring the original version of "Asylum".

===1980: ''Stations of the Crass'' and ''Bloody Revolutions''===
[[File:Crass3.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Guitarist and singer on stage|Crass, 1981; [[N. A. Palmer]] (left) and [[Steve Ignorant]] pictured at [[Digbeth Civic Hall]], Birmingham]]In 1979 the band released their second album (''[[Stations of the Crass]]''), financed with a loan from [[Poison Girls]],&lt;ref&gt;Rimbaud, P; sleeve notes to 'The Crassical Collection; Stations of the Crass' Crass Records, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; a band with whom they regularly appeared. This was a double album, with three sides of new material and a fourth side recorded live at the Pied Bull in [[Islington]].

The next Crass single, 1980's "Bloody Revolutions", was a benefit release with Poison Girls which raised £20,000 to fund the [[Wapping Autonomy Centre]].{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=23}} The words were a critique (from an anarchist-pacifist perspective) of the traditional [[Marxist]] view of [[Revolution|revolutionary struggle]], and were (in part) a response to violence marring a gig at [[Conway Hall]] in London's [[Red Lion Square]] at which both bands performed in September 1979.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=169}} The show was intended as a benefit for the so-called "Persons Unknown", a group of anarchists facing [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] charges.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=145}} During the performance [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] supporters and other [[anti-fascists]] attacked [[British Movement]] [[neo-Nazi]]s, triggering violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lux, Martin |title=Anti-Fascist |publisher=Phoenix Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-948984-35-8|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crass afterwards argued that the leftists were largely to blame for the fighting, and organizations such as [[Rock Against Racism]] were causing audiences to become polarised into left- and right-wing factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greengalloway.blogspot.co.uk/2007/10/spice-girls-to-cover-crass-song.html |date=23 October 2007 |title=Anarchy in UK: Crass interviewed: 1979  |work=greengalloway |publisher=[[Blogspot]] |quote=But Crass blame this on Rock Against Racism which, they allege, has polarised youth.

[[File:Crass Joy.jpg|thumb|alt=Crass singer Joy De Vivre|Crass singer [[Joy De Vivre]], 1984]]"Rival Tribal Rebel Revel", a [[flexi disc]] single given away with the ''Toxic Grafity''{{sic}} [[fanzine]], was also a commentary about the events at Conway Hall attacking the mindless violence and [[tribalism|tribalistic]] aspects of contemporary youth culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Diboll |publisher=Kill Your Pet Puppy |title=Crass – Toxic Grafity Fanzine |year=1979 |url=http://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/toxic-grafity-fanzine-1979/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the single, "Nagasaki Nightmare/Big A Little A". The strongly [[anti-nuclear]] lyrics of the first song were reinforced by the fold-out-sleeve artwork. It featured an article by Mike Holderness of ''[[Peace News]]'' magazine connecting the [[atomic power]] industry and the manufacture of nuclear weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Mike Holderness, sleeve notes of "Nagasaki Nightmare/Big A Little A" single, Crass Records, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; and a large poster-style map of nuclear installations in the UK. The other side of the record, "Big A Little A", was a statement of the band's anti-statist and individualist anarchist philosophy:

"Be exactly who you want to be, do what you want to do / I am he and she is she but you're the only you" &lt;ref&gt;Rimbaud, P; "Big A Little A", Crass Records 1980. Quoted in ''Love Songs'' p.57, Pomona Publishing {{ISBN|1-904590-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1981: ''Penis Envy''===
[[File:Crass in Loving magazine.png|thumb|left|alt=Magazine record ad|''Loving'' ad for "Our Wedding"]]Crass released their third album, ''[[Penis Envy (album)|Penis Envy]]'', in 1981. This marked a departure from the hardcore-punk image  ''The Feeding of the 5000'' and ''Stations of the Crass'' had given the group. It featured more-complex musical arrangements and female vocals by Eve Libertine and Joy De Vivre (singer Steve Ignorant was credited as "not on this recording"). The album addressed feminist issues, attacking marriage and [[sexual repression]].

The last track on ''Penis Envy'', a parody of an [[Middle of the road (music)|MOR]] [[love song]] entitled "Our Wedding", was made available as a white [[flexi disc]] to readers of ''Loving'', a teenage romance magazine. Crass tricked the magazine into offering the disc, posing as "Creative Recording And Sound Services". ''Loving'' accepted the offer, telling their readers that the free Crass flexi would make "your wedding day just that bit extra special".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Southern Studios archive |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410.html |publisher=[[web.archive.org]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309043333/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410.html |archivedate=9 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] controversy resulted when the hoax was exposed, with the ''[[News of the World]]'' stating that the title of the flexi's originating album was "too obscene to print".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=News of the World |date=7 June 1981 |page=13 |url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410d.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320134115/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/09410d.html |archivedate=20 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite ''Loving''{{'}}s annoyance, Crass had broken no laws.{{sfn|Berger|2006}}

The album was banned by the retailer HMV,&lt;ref name="Rimbaud"&gt;Rimbaud, P; "...In Which Crass Voluntarily Blow Their Own", sleeve note essay included with Best Before 1984 album&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1984 copies of the album were seized from the Eastern Bloc record shop by [[Greater Manchester Police]] under the direction of [[Chief Constable]] [[James Anderton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Petley, Julian |title=Smashed Hits: Overview |url=http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/4107/1/Fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shop owners were charged with displaying [[Obscene Publications Act|"obscene articles for publication for gain"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Flux of Pink Indians – F.C.T.U.L.P. – Alternative Mixes – 1984 |publisher=Kill Your Pet Puppy |url=http://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/flux-of-pink-indians-f-c-t-u-l-p-alternative-mixes-1984/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge ruled against Crass in the ensuing court case, although the decision was overturned by the [[Court of Appeal]] (except the lyrics to one song, "Bata Motel", which were upheld as "sexually provocative and obscene").&lt;ref name="Rimbaud_a"&gt;Rimbaud, P; sleeve notes to 'The Crassical Collection; Ten Notes on a Summer's Day' Crass Records, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Crass steve dec1981.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Steve Ignorant and N.A. Palmer|Steve Ignorant and N.A. Palmer pictured at the Wapping Autonomy Centre, December 1981]]The band's fourth LP, 1982's double set ''[[Christ - The Album]]'', took almost a year to record, produce and mix (during which the [[Falklands War]] broke out and ended). This caused Crass to question their approach to making records. As a group whose primary purpose was [[Political criticism|political commentary]], they felt overtaken and made redundant by world events:

{{quote|The speed with which the Falklands War was played out and the devastation that Thatcher was creating both at home and abroad, forced us to respond far faster than we had ever needed to before. ''Christ – The Album'' had taken so long to produce that some of the songs in it, songs that warned of the imminence of riots and war, had become almost redundant. Toxteth, Bristol, Brixton and the Falklands were ablaze by the time that we released. We felt embarrassed by our slowness, humbled by our inadequacy.&lt;ref name="Rimbaud" /&gt;}}

Subsequent releases (including the singles "How Does It Feel? (to Be the Mother of a Thousand Dead)" and "Sheep Farming in the Falklands" and the album ''[[Yes Sir, I Will]]'') saw the band's sound go back to basics and were issued as "tactical responses" to political situations.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=220}} They anonymously produced 20,000 copies of a flexi-disc with a live recording of "Sheep Farming...", copies of which were randomly inserted into the sleeves of other records by sympathetic workers at the [[Rough Trade Records]] distribution warehouse to spread their views to those who might not otherwise hear them.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=215}}

===Direct Action and internal debates===
[[File:Stations.jpeg|thumb|left|alt=Album cover, featuring graffiti|Detail from front cover of ''[[Stations of the Crass]]'', illustrating Crass' stenciled graffiti]]
From their early days of spraying stencilled [[anti-war]], anarchist, [[feminist]] and [[anti-consumerist]] [[graffiti]] messages in the [[London Underground]] and on billboards,{{sfn|McKay|1996|p=87}} Crass was involved in politically motivated [[direct action]] and musical activities. On 18 December 1982, the band helped co-ordinate a 24-hour squat in the empty west London Zig Zag club to prove "that the underground punk scene could handle itself responsibly when it had to and that music really could be enjoyed free of the restraints imposed upon it by corporate industry".{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=25}}

In 1983 and 1984, Crass were part of the [[Stop the City]] actions co-ordinated by [[London Greenpeace]]{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=247}} which foreshadowed the [[anti-globalisation]] rallies of the early 21st century.{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=248}} Support for these activities was provided in the lyrics and sleeve notes of the band's last single, "You're Already Dead", expressing doubts about their commitment to [[non-violence]]. It was also a reflection of disagreements within the group, as explained by Rimbaud; "Half the band supported the pacifist line and half supported direct and if necessary violent action. It was a confusing time for us, and I think a lot of our records show that, inadvertently".{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=99}} This led to introspection within the band, with some members becoming embittered and losing sight of their essentially positive stance.{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=249}} Reflecting this debate, the next release under the Crass name was ''[[Acts of Love]]'': [[European classical music|classical-music]] settings of 50 poems by Penny Rimbaud, described as "songs to my other self" and intended to celebrate "the profound sense of unity, peace and love that exists within that other self".&lt;ref&gt;[[Liner notes|Sleeve notes]] of ''Acts of Love'', Crass Records, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially Rimbaud refused Ignorant permission to perform Crass songs he had written, but later changed his mind: "I acknowledge and respect Steve's right to do this, but I do regard it as a betrayal of the Crass ethos".&lt;ref name=guardian07&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/19/popandrock/|title=Why should we accept any less than a better way of doing things?|date=19 October 2007|first1=Iain|last1=Aitch|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorant had a different view: "I don't have to justify what I do...Plus, most of the lyrics are still relevant today. And remember that three-letter word, 'fun'?"&lt;ref name=guardian07/&gt;

In 2010 it was announced that Crass would release ''The Crassical Collection'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Feeding of the Five Thousand on Crassical Collection |url=http://blog.southern.com/2010/08/the-feeding-of-the-five-thousand-on-crassical-collection/}}&lt;/ref&gt; remastered reissues of their back catalogue. Three former members objected, threatening legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Story of the Crassical Collection |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/50808/interviews-the-story-of-the-crassical-collection/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anarchy And Peace, Litigated |url=https://www.vice.com/read/anarchy-and-peace-litigated-490-v17n8/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their concerns the project went ahead, and the remasters were eventually released. First in the series was ''The Feeding of the 5000'', released in August 2010. ''Stations of the Crass'' followed in October, with new editions of ''Penis Envy'', ''Christ – The Album'', ''Yes Sir, I Will'' and ''Ten Notes on a Summer's Day'' released in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/crass_to_reissue_back_catalog.html |title=Crass To Reissue Back Catalog |publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics praised the improved sound quality and new packaging of the remastered albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Crassical Collection |url=http://www.punknews.org/review/11795/crass-the-crassical-collection/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Christ the Album, The Crassical Collection |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/release/christ-the-album-the-crassical-collection-mr0003333892/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Steve Ignorant embarked on an international tour, entitled "The Last Supper". He performed Crass material, culminating with a final performance at the Shepherds Bush Empire on 19 November.&lt;ref name=steveignorantblogpost&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve Ignorant |title=Blog post – Sheperd's Bush |date=25 November 2011 |url=http://steveignorant.co.uk/2011/11/shepherds-bush-part-1-19th-november-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ignorant said that this was the last time he would sing the songs of Crass,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Steve Ignorant |title=Blog post – The Absolute last Supper |date=25 November 2011 |url=http://steveignorant.co.uk/2011/02/the-absolute-last-supper/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Rimbaud's support; the latter joined him onstage for a drum-and-vocal rendition of "Do They Owe Us A Living", bringing the band's career full circle after 34 years: "And then Penny came on...and we did it, 'Do They Owe Us A Living' as we'd first done it all those years ago. As it started, so it finished".&lt;ref name=steveignorantblogpost /&gt; Ignorant's lineup for the tour were [[Gizz Butt]], Carol Hodge, Pete Wilson and Spike T. Smith, and he was joined by Eve Libertine for a number of songs.&lt;ref name=steveignorantblogpost /&gt; The set list included a cover of "West One (Shine on Me)" by [[The Ruts]], when Ignorant was joined onstage by the Norfolk-based [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] crew with whom he volunteers.&lt;ref name=steveignorantblogpost /&gt;

==={{anchor|Artwork and Exhibitions}}Artwork and Exhibitions===
In February 2011, artist [[Toby Mott]] exhibited a portion of his Crass ephemera collection at the Roth Gallery in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curatedmag.com/news/2011/01/20/crass-selections-from-the-mott-collection/ |title=Curated Mag |date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crassthesecondsitting.wordpress.com/2011/01/27/crass-selections-from-the-mott-collection-18th-february-18th-march-2011/ |title=CRASS: selections from The Mott Collection 18th February – 18th March 2011 &amp;#124; |publisher=Crassthesecondsitting.wordpress.com |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit featured artwork, albums (including 12" LPs and EPs), 7" singles from Crass Records and a complete set of Crass' self-published [[zine]], ''Inter-National Anthem''.

Artwork by Gee Vaucher and Penny Rimbaud, including a recording of the original 'Thatchergate Tape', featured as part of the 'Peculiar People' show at the [[Focal Point Gallery]] in [[Southend on Sea]] during the Spring of 2016, part of a series of events celebrating the history of 'Radical Essex'.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/secret-radical-history-of-essex&lt;/ref&gt; Vaucher's painting 'Oh America', featuring an image of the [[Statue of Liberty]] hiding her face with her hands, was used as the front page of the UK [[Daily Mirror]] newspaper to mark the election of [[Donald Trump]] as US President on November 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/gee-vauchers-artwork-oh-america-9231864&lt;/ref&gt; From November 2016 to February 2017 the [[Firstsite]] art gallery in [[Colchester]], hosted a retrospective of Gee Vaucher's artwork.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.firstsite.uk/whats-on/gee-vaucher-introspective/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, "The Art of Crass" was the subject of an exhibition at the LightBox Gallery in Leicester curated by artist and technologist Sean Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thehippiesnowwearblack.org.uk/2016/07/01/the-art-of-crass-exhibition-curator-sean-clark-reflects/ |title=The Art of Crass exhibition – curator Sean Clark reflects |date=2016-07-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition featured prints and original artworks by Gee Vaucher, Penny Rimbaud, Eve Libertine and Dave King. During the exhibition Penny Rimbaud, Eve Libertine and Louise Elliot performed "The Cobblestones of Love", a lyrical reworking of the Crass album "Yes Sir, I Will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/penny-rimbaud-eve-libertine-and-louise-elliot-leicester-live-review/ |title=Penny Rimbaud, Eve Libertine and Louise Elliot : Leicester : live review |date=2016-06-15 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the final day of the exhibition there was a performance by Steve Ignorant's Slice of Life. The exhibition is documented on The Art of Crass website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theartofcrass.uk/ |title=The Art of Crass |date=2016-06-01 |accessdate=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences and Influence==
[[File:Crass2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Crass onstage]]
For Rimbaud the initial inspiration for founding Crass was the death of his friend [[Wally Hope|Phil 'Wally Hope' Russell]], as detailed in his book ''The Last of the Hippies: An Hysterical Romance''. Russell had been placed in a [[psychiatric]] hospital after helping to set up the first [[Stonehenge free festival]] in 1974, and died shortly afterwards. Rimbaud believed that Russell was murdered by the State for political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Last of the Hippies – An Hysterical Romance |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |authorlink=Penny Rimbaud |year=1982 |publisher=Crass |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/britain/sp001297.txt |quote=The court passed a verdict of suicide with no reference at all to the appalling treatment that had been the direct cause of it. [...] Our inquiries convinced us that what had happened was not an accident. The state had intended to destroy Wally's spirit, if not his life, because he was a threat, a fearless threat who they hoped they could destroy without much risk of embarrassment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder Ignorant has cited the influence of The Clash &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and David Bowie {{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=99}} as major personal influences. Band members have also cited influences ranging from [[existentialism]] and [[Zen]] to [[situationism]],{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=33}} the poetry of [[Baudelaire]],&lt;ref&gt;http://thequietus.com/articles/05258-penny-rimbaud-crass-interview&lt;/ref&gt; British working class '[[Kitchen sink realism|kitchen sink]]' literature and films such as ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.litopia.com/radio/steve-ignorant-crass-warrior/&lt;/ref&gt; and the films of [[Anthony McCall]]{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=33}} (McCall's ''Four Projected Movements'' was shown as part of an early Crass performance).{{sfn|Berger|2006|p=146}}

Crass have said that their musical influences were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly [[Benjamin Britten]], on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based),{{sfn|McKay|1996|page=95}} [[free jazz]],&lt;ref name="Rimbaud_a" /&gt; European [[atonality]]&lt;ref name="Rimbaud_a" /&gt; and avant-garde composers such as [[John Cage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Crass interview |journal=New Crimes |issue=3 |date=Winter 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].&lt;ref name="Rimbaud_a" /&gt; Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Savage, Jon |year=1991 |title=England's Dreaming: Sex Pistols and Punk Rock |page=584|ISBN=978-0571227204}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the [[peace movement]] and the UK [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] during the late 1970s and early 1980s.{{sfn|Rimbaud|1999|p=109}} Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding.&lt;ref&gt;"In their own writing, Crass somewhat overstate the contribution that anarcho-punk made to resuscitating the moribund Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in the early 1980s. The initiation of a new arms race, confirmed by plans to deploy first-strike Cruise and Pershing nuclear missiles across Europe, revived anti-nuclear movements across the continent, and would have arisen with or without the intercession of anarcho-punk. What Crass and anarcho-punk can quite legitimately claim is to have convinced a substantial number of radical youth to commit their energies to the most militant anti-militarist wings of the disarmament movement, which laid siege to nuclear installations across the country and which saw no conflict between its pacifist precepts and its willingness to commit acts of 'criminal damage' on the military property of the nuclear state" Rich Cross, 'The Hippies Now Wear Black', Kill Your Pet Puppy web site http://killyourpetpuppy.co.uk/news/hippies-now-wear-black-rich-cross/&lt;/ref&gt; Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later [[free improvisation|free-form]] style (heard on ''Yes Sir, I Will'' and their final recording, ''Ten Notes on a Summer's Day'').{{sfn|Glasper|2007|p=17}} Their painted and [[collage]] black-and-white record sleeves (by [[Gee Vaucher]]) may have influenced later artists such as [[Banksy]] (with whom Vaucher collaborated)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Santa's Ghetto 2004, Charing Cross Road, London, December 2004 |url=http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/banksy/Banksy_Santas_Ghetto_2004.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[subvertising]] movement. [[Anti-folk]] artist [[Jeffrey Lewis]]'s 2007 album, ''[[12 Crass Songs]]'', features acoustic covers of Crass material.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

'''Deccani painting''' is a Deccan form of miniature painting, evolved in [[South India|south]]-[[Western India|western]] [[India]]—(also known as [[Deccan]]), during the inception of [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in 1347 AD. The style developed under the patronage of [[Deccan sultanates]]—( namely, [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]], [[Golconda Sultanate|Golkonda]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate|Ahmadnagar]], [[Bidar Sultanate|Bidar]], and [[Berar Sultanate|Berar]] ) and lasted until the extinct of the [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] in 1687 AD.&lt;ref name="HIA"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Indian Art|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=2VJADAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=deccani+painting+history&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|last=Kanjilal|first=Kajal|isbn=9789351991182|year=1983|pages=58–59|publisher=Saraswati House Pvt Ltd|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chaitanya"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Painting: The modern period|url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=McSbSMhArFgC&amp;dq|last=Chaitanya|first=Krishna|isbn=9788170173106|year=1976|page=31|publisher=Abhinav Publications|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark"&gt;{{cite book|title=Deccani Painting|last=Zebrowski|first=Mark|isbn=9780520048782|year=1983|publisher=Sotheby Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
While [[Mughal painting]] was developing under [[Akbar]], in the second half of the 16th century, the art form was evolving independently in the Deccan sultanates. The miniature painting style, which flourished initially in the Bahmani court of Bahmani Sultanate and later in the courts of Ahmadnagar, Bijapur, Bidar Berrar and Golkonda is popularly known as the Deccan school of Painting. One of the earliest surviving paintings are found as the illustrations of a manuscript ''[[Tarif-i-Hussain Shahi]]'' (1565 AD), which is now in [[Bharat Itihas Sanshodhak Mandal]], [[Pune]]. About 400 miniature paintings are found in the manuscript of [[Nujum-ul-Ulum]] (Stars of Science) (1570), kept in [[Chester Beatty Library]], [[Dublin]].

==Style==

The style of Deccani painting flourished in the 16th and 17th centuries, Passing through multiple phases of sudden maturation and prolonged stagnation, later in the 18th and 19th centuries after the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] conquest of Deccan the style gradually withered away and new form of Hyderabad style painting evolved in the Deccan region particularly in the [[Nizam]] terotary. Most of the colouring of Deccani paintings are Islamic [[Turkish painting|Turkish]] and [[Persian painting|Persian]] tradition specially the arabesques, but those are surmounted by a pure Deccani piece of foliage.

[[File:Documents No1 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of ''Documents'' No 1, 1929]]
'''''Documents''''' was a [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] [[list of art magazines|art magazine]] edited by [[Georges Bataille]]. Published in [[Paris]] from 1929 through 1930, it ran for 15 issues, each of which contained a wide range of original writing and photographs. 

''Documents'' was financed by Georges Wildenstein, an influential Parisian art dealer and sponsor of the Surrealists. Given its title and focus, the magazine initially listed an eleven-member editorial board including Wildenstein himself (with Bataille listed as "general secretary"); however, by the fifth issue, Bataille was the only editorial member to remain on the masthead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1768599,00.html?gusrc=rss "A Playful Museum"], [[Dawn Adès]] and Fiona Bradley, ''The Guardian'', May 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Called "a war machine against received ideas" by Bataille,&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/flash/page/0,,1771082,00.html "Special Reports : Undercover Surrealism"], ''Guardian UK''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Documents'' brought together a wide range of contributors, ranging from dissident surrealists including [[Michel Leiris]], [[André Masson]], and [[Joan Miró]], to Bataille's [[numismatics|numismatist]] colleagues at the National Library's Cabinet of Coins and Medals. The publication's content was even more wide-ranging, juxtaposing essays on [[jazz]] and [[archaeology]] with a photographic series fetishizing the [[hallux|big toe]], an entire issue dedicated to [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicweb.uk.net/SandH/2006/Jan-Jun06/surrealism.htm "Undercover Surrealism"], Alex Russell, ''Seen and Heard'', January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and paeans to the "ominous grandeur" of the [[slaughterhouse]]s photographed by [[Eli Lotar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1768599,00.html?gusrc=rss "A Playful Museum"], Dawn Ades and Fiona Bradley, ''The Guardian'', May 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A regular section of the magazine called the "Critical Dictionary" offered short essays on such subjects as "Absolute," "Eye," "Factory Chimney," and "[[Buster Keaton|Keaton (Buster)]]."

''Documents'' was a direct challenge to "mainstream" Surrealism as championed by [[André Breton]], who in his ''Second Surrealist Manifesto'' of 1929 derided Bataille as "(professing) to wish only to consider in the world that which is vilest, most discouraging, and most corrupted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.missouri.edu/~engjnc/bataille/breton.html "Second Manifesto of Surrealism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060524020700/http://www.missouri.edu/~engjnc/bataille/breton.html |date=May 24, 2006 }}, André Breton, ''Manifestoes of Surrealism'', translated by Richard Seaver and Helen R. Lane (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The violent juxtapositions of pictures and text in ''Documents'' were intended to provide a darker and more primal alternative to what Bataille viewed as Breton's disingenuous and weak brand of Surrealist art. By presenting explicit, often profane imagery side by side with "intellectual" writing, Bataille used ''Documents'' to propel Surrealism in a direction he felt Breton dared not: toward an overturning of all hierarchies of art and morality, and a complete democracy of form.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000088&amp;sid=az_JOSfHezkE&amp;refer=culture "Surrealism's Dark, Disgusting Side Goes on Display in London"], Martin Gayford, Bloomberg.com, May 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa''' ({{lang-pt|Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa}}) is a royal palace in Portugal, located in the [[freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Nossa Senhora da Conceição (Vila Viçosa)|Nossa Senhora da Conceição]], in the [[concelho|municipality]] of [[Vila Viçosa Municipality|Vila Viçosa]], in the [[Alentejo]], situated about 150 km (93 miles) east of the capital [[Lisbon]]. It was for many centuries the seat of [[House of Braganza]], one of the most important noble houses in Portugal which was the ruling house of the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] from 1640 until 1910 when King [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]], titular head of the family, was deposed in the [[5 October 1910 Revolution]] which brought in a Republican government.

[[File:Vila Viçosa-Palais des Duc de Bragance-1967 08 05.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Tree-lined roadway to the palace, part of the remodelled grounds]]
[[Vila Viçosa]] became a [[fiefdom]] of the [[Dukes of Braganza]] when [[Fernando I of Braganza]] succeeded his father [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza]], and received the title of [[Count of Arraiolos]] from his grandfather, [[Nuno Alvares Pereira]]. Fernando I established his seat at the primitive [[Castelo de Vila Viçosa|Vila Viçosa Castle]]. However, following the 1483 execution of his son, [[Fernando II of Braganza|Fernando II, 3rd Duke of Braganza]], for treason by order of King [[John II of Portugal]], the family was exiled to the [[Kingdom of Castile]]. Returning in 1498 (after the death of King John II in 1495), the family regained its ancestral lands, although [[Jaime, Duke of Braganza|Jaime, 4th Duke of Braganza]] (Fernando II's successor), declined to live in the Castle of Vila Viçosa, owing to its association with his father's betrayal and murder.

Construction of the ducal palace of the Dukes of Braganza began during the tenure of Duke Jaime of Braganza, between 1501–1502.&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2750 |title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa (v.PT040714030009) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal|language=Portuguese|first=Castro |last=Nunes|year=1993 |accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGESPAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|title=Paço Ducal de Vila Viçosa|editor=IGESPAR|accessdate=6 April 2012|year=2006|location=Lisbon, Portugal|publisher=IGESPAR – Instituto de Gestão do Património Arquitectónico e Arqueológico|language=Portuguese|first=Catherine|last=Oliveira|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130416224802/http://www.igespar.pt/en/patrimonio/pesquisa/geral/patrimonioimovel/detail/70205/|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was situated in the ''Horta do Reguengo'' outside the walls of the nearby medieval village, in an area that was ''"characterized by extensive olive orchards and an abundance of water"'', presenting some similarities to the feudal residences of the region, such as the ''Sempre Noiva'' or ''Paço de Alvito''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Teixeira (1997), pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Braganza regained much of its power and wealth over time due to Duke Jaime's close kinship with the royal family (he being the nephew of King [[Manuel I of Portugal]]) and his actions in reconciling relations between the nobles. Duke Jaime of Braganza commanded the victorious expedition to Azamor in 1513, and having secured a pardon expanded the wealth of the House of Braganza, and contributed to the growth of the ducal palace.

In 1535 [[Teodósio I, 5th Duke of Braganza]] was appointed ''Constable of the Kingdom''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; He managed to negotiate the marriage of his sister, [[Isabella of Braganza, Duchess of Guimarães|Isabella of Braganza]], with  [[Infante Edward, 4th Duke of Guimarães]] (a brother of King [[John III of Portugal]]), securing a closer association with the royal family.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;  Following the need to expand the palace for the celebrations of the royal marriage, Teodósio I began the construction of the imposing facade,{{clarify|date=April 2018|which facade?}} faced with marble in the Italianate-style, and in 1558 began the installation of the ''Sala de Música'' (''Hall of Music'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; As Rafael Moreira (1997) indicated, the first building was a designed and decorated in the [[Manueline]] style, and was remodelled in classical lines, along with the adjacent buildings and the expansion of the square in front of the building.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;50&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by the profile of the [[Ribeira Palace]] in Lisbon.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Moreira (1997), p.&amp;nbsp;51&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive remodeling later occurred in 1566, during the tenure of [[João I, Duke of Braganza|João I, 6th Duke of Braganza]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; 

It was the 7th Duke, [[Teodósio II, 7th Duke of Braganza|Teodósio II]], who in 1583 began the grand works of the classical facade, completed in 1635 during the regency of King [[John IV of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; formerly Duke of Braganza. In 1602, Teodósio II married the Spanish noblewoman [[Ana de Velasco y Girón]], hoping to produce heirs. In commemoration of the marriage a composition of [[azulejo]] tiles by Fernando Loyaza, known as the ''Talavera de la Reina'', was installed in the ''Sala Grande'' (''Great Hall'').&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"&gt;José Teixeira (1997), p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; The ''Talavera de la Reina'' azulejos in the Great Hall are the only ones of the type to survive in their original setting, after the destruction of [[Guadalajara, Castilla-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], in 1937 during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole project of the classical facade was firstly executed by Nicolau de Frias, royal architect, but was later supplemented by Pedro Vaz Pereira and Manuel Pereira Alvenéo.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref name="José Teixeira 1997, p. 11"/&gt;  The monumental facade was completed in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style, consisting of two floors, one with Tuscan capitals, the other with Ionic capitals. Later, in 1610, construction began of an additional third floor.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;
In about 1611 the fireplace in the ''Sala de Medusa'' (''Medusa's Hall'') was designed and constructed by Pêro Vaz Pereira.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Following the 1640  ascension of [[John V of Portugal|João II, 8th Duke of Braganza]] to the throne of Portugal as King John IV, the palace lost its importance as the permanent residence of the Dukes of Braganza.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first new remodelling to the Palace occurred in the 18th century, with the installation of an organ in the chapel. In 1716 King John V began minor renovations. Later, in 1762 under Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]],&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; the construction began of the main tower fronting the Duchess's Garden (or ''Forest Garden'') and of a new wing, formally designated as the ''Quartos Novos'' (''New Quarters''). This included the ''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall''), which along with the other works, was finally completed under her successor, King [[Joseph I of Portugal]] in 1770.

During the Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the Portuguese royal family fled to [[Brazil]], and the palace was closed.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Long after the return of the royal family to Portugal, King [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his wife [[Amélie of Orleans]] began the renovations of the ''New Quarters'', to the designs of the Frenchman Negrier, in order to serve as their residence.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; After a period of living in these quarters as his semi-official residence, on 1 February 1908 King Carlos I returned with his family to Lisbon, where he was later [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated]].&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

On [[5 October 1910 Revolution|5 October 1910]] a revolution, instigated by Republican sympathizers, caused the royal family to flee to England and the residences of the monarchy were closed to the public.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

In 1932, whilst in exile, King [[Manuel II of Portugal]] died from an abnormal swelling in the throat. His will ordered the creation of a foundation to safeguard the royal estate, which led to the creation of the ''Fundação da Casa de Bragança'' (''House of Braganza Foundation'').&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; As part of this process, a systematic inventory and assessment was undertaken of the contents of the Palace by the DGEMN (''Direcção Geral dos Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais'', "General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments") completed in 1938.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1945 and 1952 the DGMEN initiated public works to restore the Palace after years of neglect, supplemented by repairs to the roof in 1963.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;

It was not until 18 May 1984 that the palace was opened to the public, including  one of the largest and most varied permanent expositions of carriages in Europe.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

A re-tiling of the central wing was completed in 1985–1986, followed in 1989 by a similar project in the ''Ala dos Moços'' ("Children's Wing") in 1989.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

==Architecture==
Located in the urban context of Vila Viçosa, the palace is situated on a stable plain at the foot of the castle hill. Rising {{convert|395|m|ft}} above this context, on a grand space, it fronts other historical buildings, including the Church of the Augustine Friars ({{lang-pt|Igreja dos Agostinhos}}), the Episcopal Palace ({{lang-pt|Paço do Bispo|links=no}}) and Convent of the Stigmata ({{lang-pt|Convento das Chagas|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The building consists of a grand rectangular profile, extending east to west, with three floors, and an irregular trapezoid structure to the north-south, with the roofing differently tiled above each of the spaces.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The principal facade is fully lined with [[ashlar]] masonry and pink Estremoz marble, corresponding to the three respective floors and central pediment broken by two main doorways.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The rest of the facades are broken by a series of rectangular windows, that harmoniously divide the surface in a rhythmic classic pattern, some with semi-circular pediments and framed cornices. [[Pilaster]]s and [[architrave]]s define the horizontal and vertical frames of many of the windows, giving the whole composition great sobriety and classicism.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Lady's Garden'' occupies a comparable space by the residence, consisting of symmetrical patterns interspersed with sculptures of ancient shells and royal cavalry.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

===Interior===
Access to the residence is made across the [[Lobby (room)|vestibule]]. From this space is the main marble staircase and marble walls, as well as a painted mural fresco representing the ''Tomada de Azamor'' (''Taking of Azamor'') in northern Africa in 1513 by Portuguese troops, commanded by James, Duke of Braganza. On the left-side is the disembarkation ({{lang-pt|Desembarque}}), to the centre the preparations of the encirclement ({{lang-pt|Preparativos do Cerco|links=no}}) and to the right the conquest of the fortress ({{lang-pt|Conquista da Praça|links=no}}).&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In the first years of the 17th century, the palace received a decorative palette, considered "one of the richest group of fresco mural paintings encountered in Portuguese art".&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The rooms in the Palace extend along the horizontal plane, with a single corridor linking the spaces, including the ''Sala das Tapeçarias'' (''Tapestry Hall''), with [[sillar]] covered in 17th-century polychromtic blue-and-white azulejo tile, white marble fireplace, tile floor, and vaulted ceiling with phytomorphic painting.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Several of the main rooms include spaces with painted fresco ceilings, and 17th-century blue-and-white/yellow azulejo tile, such as the ''Sala do Gigante'' (''Hall of the Giant''), with 16th-century fresco depicting the biblical episode between [[David and Goliath]], which is framed by the arms of the Dukes of Braganza; the ''Oratório da Duquesa'' (''Duchess' Oratory''); and''Sala de Medusa'' (''Hall of Medusa''), with a painted fresco representing the battle between [[Medusa]] and [[Perseus]]. These group of paintings were''"largely faithful to the aesthetic canons of the Italianate Mannerists"''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt; The compositions are replent in Moorish-influenced motifs executed between 1600 and 1640 by different painters: Tomás Luís, famous Lisbon painter, was attributed to the ''"two notable mural [ceiling] decorations"'' in the ''Hall of Medusa'' and the gallery of Duchess Catherine and José de Avelar Rebelo painted the ceilings of the ''Music Pavilion''.&lt;ref name=IGESPAR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vítor Serrão (1997), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
The remainder of these rooms extend laterally through the accessway: the ''Sala de D. Duarte'' (''Edwards' Hall''), with a painted ceiling, with anthropomorphic elements and tiled floor; the ''Sala dos Duques'' (''Hall of the Dukes'') or ''Sala dos Tudescos'' is a noble salon and largest room in the building, decorated with frames of 17 Dukes of Braganza, from [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]]: the ''Sala das Virtues'' (''Hall of Virtues'') has an artesnal ceiling comprising framed paintings showing the seven theological virtues and morals, among them: ''Fé'' (''Faith''), ''Esperança'' (''Hope''), ''Caridade'' (''Charity''),''Prudência'' (''Prudence''), ''Justiça'' (''Justice''), ''Forteleza'' (''Strength''), ''Temperança'' (''Temperance'') and ''Sapiência'' (''Wisdom''); and the''Sala de Jantar'' (''Dining Hall'') there is a similarly paneled ceiling with medallions, decorated in classical and mythological motifs. The rooms five doorways give access to the ''Jardim das Damas'' (''Lady's Garden'').

A chapel, referred to as the ''Sala dos Paramento/Órgãos'' (''Hall of the Vestments/Organ'') is covered in a vaulted ceiling with comparably painted roof frames.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The ''Pavilhão da Música'' (''Music Pavilion'') is an exceptional example: it consists of a painted wood ceiling, sillar with 17th-century azulejo tile depicting figures in panchromatic tiles in yellow, blue, green and red, representing the history of [[Book of Tobit|Tobit]] ({{lang-pt|Tobiãs}}) with the coat-of-arms of the Dukes of Braganza, and signed FIAB.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

In addition, there are several other "named" rooms in palace, including the ''Sala D. Duarte'' (''[[Edward of Portugal|D. Durate's Hall]]''), ''Sala D. Fernando II'' (''[[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand's Hall]]''), ''Sala do Século 17'' (''17th-century Hall''), ''Sala da Restauração'' (''Restoration Hall''), ''Sala de Hércules'' (''Hall of Hercules''), ''Sala Dourada ou da Duquesa'' (''Golden Hall'' or ''Duchess Hall''), named for [[Catherine of Portugal|Catherine]] wife of the 6th Duke, the ''Sala da Cabra Cega'' (''Hall of the Blind Goat''); ''Sala Indo-Portuguesa'' (''Portuguese-India Hall''); ''Sala das Loiças'' (''Hall of Dishware''); ''Sala dos Vidros'' (''Hall of Glass''); ''Sala dos Reis'' (''Kings' Hall''); the armory; and the famous wing of the ''New Quarters'', named for the fact that it acted as the residence and studies for the King, with diverse antechambers, and corridors.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Near the kitchen are the ovens, wine cellars, avery and storage spaces.

'''Gradation''' in art is a visual technique of gradually transitioning from one colour hue to another, or from one shade to another, or one texture to another.  Space, distance, atmosphere, volume, and curved or rounded forms are some of the visual effects created with gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gradation.svg|thumb|A gradient illustration, showing a gradation spectrum from black to white.]]
Artists use a variety of methods to create gradation, depending upon the art medium, and the precise desired effect. [[Blending (art)|Blending]], [[shading (art)|shading]], [[hatching]] and [[crosshatching]] are common methods.  A fading effect can be created with [[pastels]] by using a [[torchon (art)|torchon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gradation in photography==
Gradation can also be useful in composing photographs. The early decades of the development of photography involved much effort and experimentation aimed at improving gradation detail in photographs. Different materials were tested in producing lithographs and early photographs, with steady improvement in producing detailed gradation. In 1878, one photographer wrote: {{blockquote|The great defect of all the processes of photolithography described in the last section is that they can only be applied with advantage to the reproduction of drawings or subjects in which the gradation of shade is shown by lines or dots separated by white spaces of varying sizes and at varying intervals apart, as in line or stipple engravings and lithographs in line and chalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The British Journal of Photography|date=2007|orig-year=First published 1878|volume=XXV|pages=518|author=J. Waterhouse, Capt.|publisher=Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
[[File:Halftone example CMYK.png|thumb|Example of a halftone reproduction of a photograph.]]
A major innovation was the development of [[halftone]] photography in the late 19th century. Halftone photography involves creating a reproduction of an original photograph by taking an image of it using a [[Photomechnical transfer camera (PMT)]], with a [[halftone screen]] as an intermediary tool to create gradation in the final reproduction. Halftone screens are a plate or film, made up of a continuous pattern of small dots, and when used in a photomechanical transfer camera, the halftone screen serves as an image filter. The invention of halftone photography was an important milestone, allowing photographs to be reproduced for mass publication in newspapers and magazines.

Analog photography is limited by the materials and equipment used by the photographer to capture gradation. These constraints are eliminated in digital photography, where software can be used to manipulate photograph images to create gradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ralph Lambrecht |author2=Ralph W.

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919).

[https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

==Music==

===Digital music===
From conceptualisation to composing, from sound calibration to mastering, Lin has produced music on a PC without a sound card and midi instruments. Lin creates virtual instruments including a virtual [[didgeridoo]], a [[berimbau]] used by the [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] aborigines. In 2006, Lin has realised the [[sonification]] of nature, including a [[rainforest]], [[waterfalls]] and wind by an interactive virtual [[sound board (music)|sound board]] she has created. Hsin Hsin's music has been performed in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]] in 2002, [[Bourges]], France in 2003, 2004 and [[Pisa]], Italy, 2005.

===Music visualisation===
Lin has composed music and painted music as an artist. The 45 paintings in the "Abstraction in Music" Series (1986–1987) is her interpretation of music on canvas, as she is moved by the music of great composers such as [[Handel]] ([[Water Music (Handel)|Water Music]]), [[Mozart]] ([[Jupiter Symphony]]), [[Franz Liszt]] (Rhapsodies dan l'espace), [[Vivaldi]] ([[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|The Four Seasons]]), [[Debussy]] ([[La Mer (Debussy)|La Mer]]). In addition to the [[canvases]], there are the paperworks subtitled "''La Petite Séries''" created with different techniques, an abstraction of audio visualisation—perceived images of the sound in music such as Musical Ornaments: [[Trill (music)|Trill]], [[Appoggiatura]] and [[Turn (music)|Turn]] ([[Staccato]]) and sound in the universe like [[Woodpecker]].

Lin has conceptualised and written about the art in music and music in art. Since 2002, Hsin Hsin has digitally created [[visual music]], or [[animated music]], as she puts it.

2005, Lin built wearables and lights that response to music.

2006, Lin built paradigm shift interactive digital real-world musical instruments—I-Musika&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1271614 I1)-Musika:Mobile Interface Musical Expression (MIME)]

===Interactive music===
Lin developed an interactive Music Sound Board in 2006. The creation of this soft sound board enables real time creation of the sound of nature. Examples are elements of sound audible in nature, such as [[rain forest]], insects, water, and wind.

==Intermedia==
Combining mathematics, technology, art and music, Hsin Hsin pursues [[interdisciplinary]] studies.

== Poetry ==
Lin speaks, reads and writes in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[French language|French]]. She writes [[poems]] in these languages

[[File:Federico Barocci - La Madonna del Gatto.jpg|thumb|''Madonna del Gatto'']]
The painting titled '''''Madonna of the Cat''''' or '''''Madonna del gatto''''' was painted in 1575 by  [[Federico Barocci]]. It is presently in the  [[National Gallery|National Gallery of London]].

==History and Description==
The painting was made for Count Antonio Brancaleoni of [[Perugia]]. Engravings of the painting appeared by 1577. 

The Holy Family, consisting of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], Mary, a young [[John the Baptist]], and a lactating infant Jesus, are portrayed in a domestic moment. John appears to be teasing the cat with a captured goldfinch, an allegoric symbol of Christ's Passion. John's reed rests against a wall in the background. The main characters form a proto-[[Baroque art|Baroque]]-style diagonal to the right. In the style of Barocci, the cheeks are rosy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/federico-barocci-the-madonna-of-the-cat-la-madonna-del-gatto The Madonna of the Cat ('La Madonna del Gatto')], website of the National Gallery, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neo-pop''' is a [[postmodern art]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred S. Kleiner, Helen Gardner, Christin J. Mamiya, Richard G. Tansey, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages: Chapters 19-34'', Thomson Wadsworth, 2004, p1068. {{ISBN|0-534-64091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; movement of the 1980s. The term refers to artists influenced by [[pop art]] and pop culture imagery, such as [[Jeff Koons]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter Childs, Mike Storry, ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary British Culture'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1999, p413. {{ISBN|0-415-14726-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but also artists working in graffiti and cartoon art, such as [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.glbtqarchive.com/arts |title=Index of /arts |website=www.glbtqarchive.com |access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese artist [[Takashi Murakami]] is described as the first of the Japanese neo-pop artists to "break the ice in terms of recycling Japanese pop culture".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta. "From a mushroom cloud, a burst of art reflecting Japan’s psyche." ''New York Times'' 8, no. 04 (2005): B28.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese neo-pop is associated with the [[otaku]] subculture and the obsessive interests in anime, manga and other forms of pop culture. Artists such as [[Kenji Yanobe]] exemplify this approach to art and [[fandom]].&lt;ref&gt;Munroe, Alexandra.

==History==
In 2008, Stefan Siegel and his brother Daniel founded NJAL as a networking platform for fashion designers.&lt;ref name = wonderlandmagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name = whatdesigncando&gt;{{cite web | url = http://issuu.com/whatdesigncando/docs/wdcd12_book_web_issuu| title = The Connecting Forces of Design | publisher = WDCD | year = 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; NJAL launched "The Shop" section of their website in 2009, making it the first e-commerce site to allow consumers to buy directly from designers.&lt;ref name = monocle/&gt; ''Grazia Daily'' reported that items in "The Shop" were curated by celebrities including [[Amanda Lepore]] and [[Lara Stone]].&lt;ref name = graziadaily/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elle.com/fashion/news/a2636/london-fashion-news-lara-stone-matches-2110/| title = London Fashion News: Lara Stone and Matches | publisher = Elle | date = 25 August 2009 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Spring/Summer 2010 season, NJAL released a limited edition offering of organic cotton T-shirts and tank tops featuring signature designs and prints of designers.&lt;ref name = thenextweb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thediscerningbrute.com/tag/not-just-a-label/| title = Not Just a Label: Exclusive Organic Collection | publisher = The Doscerning Brute | date = 17 June 2010 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NJAL collaborated with Spanish label [[Mango (clothing)|Mango]] in a competition where young designers presented collections at the 'El Botón' Mango Fashion Awards with NJAL supervising competitors. The same year, the site won the [[Drapers]] Etail Award for Best E-Commerce innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Curated By NJAL | publisher = Highs Nobiety | author = Reeve, Georgia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL first collaborated with the [[British Council]] in 2011 for the "London Meets Beirut" seminar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mycake.org/london-meets-beirut-innovation-in-the-design-industry/  | title = London meets Beirut: Innovation in the design industry | publisher = My Cake | date = 30 November 2011 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Davies, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, NJAL received a grant from the British Council to travel to India during Lakmé Fashion Week in order to develop business relationships in the country.&lt;ref name = thenextweb/&gt;&lt;ref name = creativeeconomy&gt;{{cite web | url = http://creativeconomy.britishcouncil.org/people/stefan-siegel/ | title = Stefan Siegel | publisher = British Council| accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, NJAL participated in a three-week tour of Eastern European fashion weeks where the company delivered workshops and scouted talent in [[Bratislava]], [[Kiev]], [[Łódź]], [[Belgrade]] and [[Riga]]. The trips were documented through a partnership with [[Vogue Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vogue.it/en/talents/news/2012/10/eastern-europe-diary-1  | title = Eastern Europe Diary 1 | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 18 October 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.vogue.it/en/talents/news/2012/11/eastern-europe-diary-2  | title = Eastern Europe Diary 2 | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 2 November 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, online-trend analysis and research service [[WGSN]] offered NJAL designers services at a 98 percent discount in order to support young talent while expanding the WGSN professional network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fashionotes.com/content/2012/05/not-just-a-label-partners-with-wgsn/ | title = Not Just A Label Partners With WGSN | publisher = Fashionotes | date = 24 May 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Bailie, Lauren }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insidefmm.com/2012/05/not-just-a-label-offers-nearly-free-trend-service-this-month/ | title = Not Just A Label Offers Nearly-Free Trend Service This Month | publisher = Inside FMM | date = May 2012 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL began The Open Source Partnership with [[Vivienne Westwood]] in 2013. NJAL advised the fashion house on expanding their e-commerce business and creating a new open-source website for Westwood. In turn, Westwood became a major investor in the platform.&lt;ref name = dasmagazin&gt;{{cite news | title = Sechs Jahre Im Leben | publisher = Das Magazin | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alt(r)a Moda | publisher = Ci | author = Damaggio, Marika }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Wir tauschen die Marke durch die Story aus | publisher = Form Magazin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL collaborated with the Who's Next fashion trade show in 2013 to create "The Future of Fashion" program where twenty emerging designers competed for the chance to show their designs during the Who's Next Autumn/Winter [[Paris]] trade show. Selected designers showed their collections at the 2014 Who's Next show with Siegel as one of the judges of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/fashion-news/design/whos-next-and-not-just-a-label-launch-new-program-2013112819240 | title = Who's Next and Not Just A Label launch new program | publisher = Fashion United | date = 28 November 2013 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, NJAL partnered with Matteo Marzotto and the Fiera di Vicenza center to hold the company's first offline event called "Origin Passion &amp; Beliefs." 100 NJAL designers participated in order to showcase their wares and network with others in the fashion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/05/matteo-marzotto-joins-just-label-unite-fashion-jewellery.html | title = Matteo Marzotto Joins with Not Just a Label to Unite Fashion and Jewellery | publisher = The Business of Fashion | date = 21 May 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Kansara, Vikram Alexei }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/3def5f6e-8f3b-11e3-be85-00144feab7de.html#axzz3QhKbPm5a | title = Matteo Marzotto reveals his plans to revitalise his country’s gold industry | publisher = Financial Times | date = 26 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Sanderson, Rachel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.notjustalabel.com/sites/default/files/pressfiles/167585/vogue_italia_on_origin_notjustalabel_1389358678.pdf  | title = Origin Passion &amp; Beliefs | publisher = Vogue Italia | date = 21 April 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, NJAL was the only international platform to attend Ukrainian Fashion Week during the [[2014–15 Russian military intervention in Ukraine|political turbulence]] occurring at the time.&lt;ref name = mbkiev&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mbkievfashiondays.com/en/news/v-kiev-edet-progressivnyiy-london-v-litse-osnovatelya-not-just-a-lable/| title = The Founder of Not Just a Label Will Give A Public Talk In Kiev | publisher = Mercedes-Benz Kiev Fashion Days |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uacrisis.org/ukrainian-fashion-week-stands-against-war/| title = Ukrainian Fashion Week Stands Against War | publisher = Ukraine Crisis Media Center | date = 22 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2014/03/20/couturiers-undeterred-by-crisis-at-ukraine-fashion-week/| title = Couturiers Undeterred by Crisis at Ukraine Fashion Week | publisher = The Wall Street Journal | date = 20 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Mesco, Manuela }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL curated and managed the launch of the [[AEG]] produced documentary "The Next Black" about the future of textiles. The film was released in conjunction with the release of new high efficiency [[washing machines]].&lt;ref name = ellebelgium&gt;{{cite news | title = 10 choses quivont revolutionner la mode | publisher = Elle | date = September 2014 | language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2014 Copenhagen Fashion Summit, NJAL presented plans for the "Re-start Fashion" initiative, developed to help designers solve ecological challenges in the fashion industry through sustainable design.&lt;ref name = ecofashionworld&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecofashionworld.com/Events/Copenhagen-Fashion-Summit-The-Anatomy-of-Sustainable-Fashion.html | title = Copenhagen Fashion Summit: The Anatomy of Sustainable Fashion | publisher = Eco Fashion World | date = 8 May 2014 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Locskai, Nora }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = copenhagen&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.copenhagenfashionsummit.com/video | title = Restart Fashion - 5 Easy steps by Connie Nielsen, Stefan Siegel and Jonas Eder-Hansen | publisher = Copenhagen Fashion Summit | accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NJAL relaunched its site in 2014 in order to make it more user-compatible on smart phones and tablets as well as desktops.&lt;ref name = femalefirst&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/lifestyle-fashion/stylenews/not-just-a-label-hand-picked-luxury-fashion-511519.html| title = Not Just A Label launches website for hand-picked luxury fashion | publisher = Female First | date = 31 July 2014 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Davies, Taryn }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the e-commerce part of the site was established in 2009, the 2014 relaunch made sales the main component of the site.&lt;ref name = stylebubble&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stylebubble.co.uk/style_bubble/2014/08/a-new-njal.html| title = A New NJAL | publisher = Style Bubble | date = 1 August 2014 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The relaunch also incorporated an open source [[content management system]] into the site which allows designers to edit their own profiles.&lt;ref name = femalefirst/&gt;

===Notable designers and celebrity clients===
Notable designers who showcased early on with NJAL include [[Mary Katrantzou]], [[Damir Doma]] and [[Rad Hourani]].&lt;ref name = nytimes/&gt;&lt;ref name = dasmagazin/&gt;&lt;ref name = mbkiev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://howtospendit.ft.com/style/4222-where-to-spot-fashions-next-big-thing| title = Where to spot fashion's next big thing | publisher = How To Spend It | date = 5 April 2011 | accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Macpherson, Lindsay }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities who have purchased items from designers showcased on NJAL include [[Rihanna]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Alice Dellal]], [[Pixie Geldof]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Taylor Swift]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]], [[Elle Mcpherson]] and [[Beyoncé]].&lt;ref name = graziadaily/&gt;&lt;ref name = whatdesigncando/&gt;&lt;ref name = insidefmm&gt;{{cite web | url = http://insidefmm.com/2010/09/not-just-a-label-supporting-avant-garde-fashion-designers/| title = Not Just A Label: Supporting Avant-garde Fashion Designers | publisher = Inside FMM |accessdate = 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business model==
NJAL is a platform for designers, buyers, press and consumers to collaborate with each other independently.&lt;ref name = britishcouncil&gt;{{cite web | url = http://design.britishcouncil.org/blog/2014/nov/02/not-just-label-skopje/| title = Not Just a Label at Skopje | publisher = British Council | date = 2 November 2014 |accessdate = 15 February 2015 | author = Lean, Marion }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.martinez-ribes.com/en/will-there-be-a-revolution/ | title = WILL THERE BE A REVOLUTION?

Representatives from NJAL visit fashion week events, institutions, showrooms and studios looking for emerging designers with established look-books before providing exposure via editorial coverage and social media. Designers are also able to approach NJAL independently.&lt;ref name = wonderlandmagazine/&gt;&lt;ref name = britishcouncil/&gt; Limited-edition collections and [[bespoke]] pieces are assessed by NJAL staff before listed on the site.&lt;ref name = fashionunited/&gt;

In addition to the retail shop, the NJAL site contains a designer directory indexed alphabetically as well as by country, womenswear, menswear, shoes, bags, accessories, jewellery and organic products.&lt;ref name = insidefmm/&gt; NJAL also acts as an agency that collaborates with large corporations and governments to create and manage partnerships that promote ethical fashion.&lt;ref name = thenextweb/&gt;&lt;ref name = monocle/&gt;&lt;ref name = ellebelgium/&gt;&lt;ref name = ecofashionworld/&gt;&lt;ref name = copenhagen/&gt;&lt;ref name = britishcouncil/&gt;

The '''Odysseus in the Underworld krater''' is a Lucanian kalyx-[[krater]] decorated in the [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] style dating to ca. 380 BC - ca. 360 BC.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact?name=Paris%2C+Cab.+M%26%23233%3Bd.+422&amp;object=Vase|title=Paris, Cab.

== Measurements ==
The kalyx-krater used measures at 48.4 cm in height and 49.8 cm in diameter. It has a pair of curved handles emerging from the lower body of the vessel and sprouting outward to the lip.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31743/CARDIFF-THESIS-2015.pdf?sequence=1|title=Drinking with the Dead: Odyssean Nekuomanteia and Sympotic Sophrosyne in Classical Greek Vase Painting|last=Cardiff III|first=Hal Victor|date=May 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A side ===
The A-side scene on the belly of the kalyx-krater depicts Homer's story of Odysseus's visit to the Underworld to consult the dead seer Teiresias. This meeting is known as a nekuomanteion or "consultation with the dead".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Odysseus is seated in the middle of the scene on uneven ground; he is seated between Eurylochos, second-in-command of Odysseus' ship during the return to Ithaca after the Trojan War, and Perimedes, one of [[Odysseus]]'s companions during his return voyage from [[Troy]], awaiting the consultation with the ghost of Teiresias. Odyseus is wearing boots and has a short sword in his right hand. There are two dead rams directly underneath Oddyseus's sword, a sacrifice needed to summon the dead for ghosts cannot speak until they have drunk blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BmmW1h7Qk7MC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;lpg=PA212&amp;dq=Odysseus+and+Tiresias+in+the+Underworld+krater&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qW5l16zNE-&amp;sig=xR8rH9F-s3rWavwDGzU8la1FZCA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjk5N3AlKHXAhUKOiYKHZAuBBcQ6AEIWzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=Odysseus%20and%20Tiresias%20in%20the%20Underworld%20krater&amp;f=false|title=The Art of Vase-Painting in Classical Athens|last=Robertson|first=Martin|date=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521338813|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== B side ===
The scene on the B-side of the krater depicts the judgment of Paris where Hermes (on left) asks Paris, the Trojan prince, to arbitrate the contest between Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena and determine who is the most beautiful. The scene is so well detailed that many scholars describe the krater as having a “double A-side”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14910">The '''One Dimension Group''' (''Al Bu'd al Wahad'') was a modern art group founded in Iraq, by [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] in 1971 which attempted to combine medieval [[Sufism|Sufi]] traditions with contemporary, abstract art. Although  the One Dimension Group was founded in Iraq, its members originated from across Arab nations, and its influence was felt across the Arab art world. 

==Background==

One Dimension is one of a number of [[Iraqi art#Art groups|art groups]] that formed in 20th-century Iraq. During the first world war, a small group of European officers and artists settled in Iraq, exposing young artists to Western art traditions and techniques. &lt;ref&gt;Davis, E., ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq,'' University of California Press, 2005, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; While local artists and middle classes developed an appreciation for European art, the arts community searched for ways of synthesising indigenous art with international trends. In effect, these groups were seeking to forge an Arabic art aesthetic and to use art to help their nations reassert a sense of national identity. &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F. (ed.), ''Strokes of Genius: Contemporary Iraqi Art,'' London:, Saqi Books, 2001, p. 25; Baram, A., ''Culture, History and Ideology in the Formation of Ba'thist Iraq,1968-89,'' Springer, 1991, pp 70-71&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between the 1930s and the early 1970s, more than six different art groups were formed: ''The Pioneers'' formed in the 1930s;&lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Avantgarde Group'' formed in 1950; &lt;ref&gt;Ulrike al-Khamis, “An Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,” in: Maysaloun, F.

(eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of these groups endured for decades, while others were short-lived and abandoned within a few years of their formation. &lt;ref&gt;Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.," ''Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad,'' Iraq, 2010, pp 7-9; Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each of these groups developed different ideas about how to combine heritage and modernity and developed a different vision for a national art aesthetic. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 79 -80&lt;/ref&gt; collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ali, N. and Al-Najjar, D., ''We Are Iraqis: Aesthetics and Politics in a Time of War,'' Syracuse University Press, 2013, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of these art groups, the Baghdad Modern Art Group and the One Dimension Group are the most frequently cited.

==Brief history and philosophy==
The One Dimension Group was established formally in 1971 by the prominent Baghdadi artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said, when he published a manifesto for the group.&lt;ref&gt;The manifesto was published in the Iraqi newspaper, ''al-Jamhuriyyah,'' issue no. 880, p. 8; See: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said had previously been a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art (Jama'at Baghdad lil-Fann al-Hadith) together with [[Jawad Saleem]] (1919-1961) and [[Jabra Ibrahim Jabra]] (1919-1994), but he along with several high profile artists, had withdrawn from that group when it lost its sense of direction, following the death of its founder, Jawad Saleem in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt; 

The One Dimension manifesto gives voice to the group's commitment to both heritage and modernity and sought to distance itself from the modern Arab artists which they perceived as following European artistic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; One Dimension's objectives are complex and sophisticated; it is philosophy, technique, style and a relationship between time and space, between the visual and the non-visual.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109M&lt;/ref&gt; The "one dimension" is an oblique reference to [[Sufism]], which has been described as "the inner dimension of [[Islam]]."&lt;ref&gt;Titus Burckhardt, ''Art of Islam: Language and Meaning'' (Bloomington: World Wisdom, 2009), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single "inner dimension". This approach was influenced by both the philosophy of [[Martin Heidegger]] and the traditions of [[Arabic calligraphy]] and associated [[Sufi]] movements. In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to realise because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52; Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; At a more profound level, one dimension refers to "eternity".&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]; also see Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;Al Said explained:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in: Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articls/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|"From a philosophical point of view, the One-Dimension is eternity, or an extension of the past to the time before the existence of pictorial surface; to the non-surface. Our consciousness of the world is a relative presence. It is our self-existence while our absence is our eternal presence." }}

Al Said actively searched for relationships between time and space; and for a visual language that would connect Iraq's deep art traditions with modern art methods and materials. The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this relationship. The letter became part of Al Said's transition from figurative art to abstract art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic calligraphy was charged with intellectual and esoteric Sufi meaning,&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95&lt;/ref&gt; in that it was an explicit reference to a Medieval theology where letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Said, and members of the One Dimension group, searched for a new artistic identity, drawn from within their own culture and heritage and successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy and Arabic motifs, into contemporary, abstract compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; At an individual level, these artists were carrying out their own dialogue with national identity and modern art, at a broader level they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Arab identity.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294; Mejcher-Atassi, S., "Shakir Hassan Al Said," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Shakir-Hassan-Al-Said.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Al Said and his group successfully bridged the gap between modernity and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., ''Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan,'' Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In so doing, they "charted a new Arabo-Islamic art aesthetic, and thus initiated a possible alternative for art valuating for local and regional art other than those allowed through an exclusionary Western canon of art history."&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.,"Shakir Hassan Al Said: Time and Space in the Work of the Iraqi Artist - A Journey Towards One Dimension," ''Nafas Art Magazine,'' May, 2008, [https://universes.art/nafas/articles/2008/shakir-hassan-al-said/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In focusing on the Arabic letter as the central element of his work, al-Said soon was collaborating with [[Madiha Omar]] (who by then was living in the US) and [[Jamil Hamoudi]], who both joined his group.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, J., ''Why Are We 'Artists'?: 100 World Art Manifestos, Penguin, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p. See section M52&lt;/ref&gt; The One Dimension Group was very significant to the so-called School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]) which comprised groups of artists that had emerged independently across North Africa and the Middle East in the second half of the 20th century, with the common thread being that each group searched for ways to integrate tradition and modernity in a way that would contributed to a distinct national style.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt;

Although each of these groups developed locally, and went by different labels at the local level, collectively, these groups and their practitioners would become known as the School of Calligraphy (or [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, the movement emerged in the 1950s and was known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement'',&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

(eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; and in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, artworks took on a slightly different form - since artists rejected Western art traditions and included both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School.'' &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.R., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Original members of the One Dimension group include: [[Rafa al-Nasiri]], [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]], [[Nuri al-Rawi]], [[Dia Azzawi]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]], Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), Hashim al-Baghdadi (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture'', Kassel University Press, 2017, p.117&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''operating agreement''' is a key document used by [[limited liability company|LLCs]] because it outlines the business' financial and functional decisions including rules, regulations and provisions. The purpose of the document is to govern the internal operations of the business in a way that suits the specific needs of the business owners. Once the document is signed by the members of the limited liability company, it acts as an official contract binding them to its terms. Many states in the United States require an LLC to have an operating agreement. LLCs operating without an operating agreement are governed by the state's default rules contained in the relevant [[statute]] and developed through state court decisions. An operating agreement is similar in function to [[by-laws|corporate by-laws]], or analogous to a [[partnership agreement]] in multi-member LLCs. In single-member LLCs, an operating agreement is a declaration of the structure that the member has chosen for the company and sometimes used to prove in court that the LLC structure is separate from that of the individual owner and thus necessary so that the owner has documentation to prove that he or she is indeed separate from the entity itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/blogs/basic-information-about-operating-agreements|title=Basic Information About Operating Agreements {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most states do not require operating agreements. However, an operating agreement is highly recommended for multi-member LLCs because it structures an LLC's finances and organization, and provides rules and regulations for smooth operation. The operating agreement usually includes percentage of interests, allocation of profits and losses, member's rights and responsibilities and other provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sba.gov/starting-business/choose-your-business-structure/limited-liability-company|title=Limited Liability Company (LLC) {{!}} The U.S. Small Business Administration {{!}} SBA.gov|website=www.sba.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Operating agreements are legally significant. Having a correctly drafted operating agreement is crucial in case legal disputes arise between business owners.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The '''Pasadena Society of Artists''', founded in 1925, is one of the longest-running, nonprofit arts organizations in the state of California, USA.

==Overview==
Pasadena Society of Artists, from its founding, attracted practitioners of a variety of artistic styles, including impressionists, modernists, abstract artists and traditionalists.  

During its formative years, the Pasadena Society of Artists was associated with the [[Pasadena Arts Institute]].  As a result, its membership had close ties with the [[Pasadena Museum of Art]] (which later became the [[Norton Simon Museum]]) and the [[Pacific Asia Museum]].

Pasadena Society of Artists continues to hold frequent [[Juried (competition)|juried]] exhibitions of its members works, and its Annual Exhibitions have taken place without interruption since 1925.

==1920s to 1950s==
PSA's formation closely followed the founding of the Pasadena Arts Institute, and many of its first members were involved in the creation of both institutions.  Its first president was landscape artist [[Edward B. Butler]], a successful businessman who retired to pursue his career as an oil painter.  Early members of the Society included nationally-renownded arstists, including California [[impressionists]] [[Alson S. Clark]] and [[Marion Wachtel]], and the noted adherent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] [[Ernest A. Batchelder]], 

From the 1920s into the 1950s, Pasadena Society of Artists was given an office and exhibit space in the [[Grace Nicholson]] Galleries, located at 46 North Los Robles Avenue.  However, the society eventually lost the space when the Nicholson gallery became the [[Pacific Asia Museum]].

== 1960s to Present ==
Despite the lack of a permanent exhibition space, the Society continued to attract professional artists, and to hold juried shows of its members works, often in venues outside the Pasadena city limits.

Today the Society continues to be operated entirely by the voluntary efforts of its artist members.

'''''Perseus Freeing Andromeda''''' is a painting by the Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], executed in 1622. It is housed in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] of [[Berlin]], Germany.

The painting belonged the M. Pasquier collection in [[Rouen]], which was auctioned in 1755 in Paris. In the 18th century it entered the collection of [[Frederick II of Prussia]] and, in 1830, it became part of the Berlinese museum collection.

The scene is similar to another ''Perseus Freeing Andromeda'' by Rubens now in the [[Hermitage Museum]] of [[St. Petersburg]]. It depicts the [[Greek mythology]] hero [[Perseus]] in the act of freeing [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], after defeating the sea monster which kept her as prisoner. Perseus, wearing helmet, cuirass and cloak, is sided by two puttoes, and one of them  is helping him in removing the ropes that tie Andromeda to the rock.

On the left, two puttoes are playing with [[Pegasus]], Perseus' winged horse.

'''Piratbyrån''' ({{IPA-sv|pɪ²rɑːtbʏˌroːn|lang|Piratbyrån-pronunciation.ogg}} "The Pirate Bureau") was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] organization (or [[think tank]]) established to support the free sharing of information, culture, and [[intellectual property]]. Piratbyrån provided a counterpoint to [[lobby group]]s such as the Swedish [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Anti-Piracy Bureau]].

In 2005 Piratbyrån released an [[anthology]] entitled ''Copy Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Piratbyrån | title=Copy Me - Samlade Texter Från Piratbyrån | year=2005 | language=Swedish | url=https://archive.org/details/CopyMeSamladeTexterFranPiratbyran}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing selected texts previously available from its website. Members of Piratbyrån participated in debates on Swedish Radio and Swedish Television and also gave several lectures in other European countries, such as at the 2005 22nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107| title = Piratbyrån speech at Chaos Communication Congress 22C3 in Berlin|date=December 2005 |author=[[Palle Torsson]] and [[Rasmus Fleischer]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206151626/http://www.piratbyran.org/index.php?view=articles&amp;id=107 |archivedate=6 February 2006 |accessdate=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piratbyrån's activities might have changed over the years, partly as a result of the addition of the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] to the Swedish political scene. During [[Walpurgis Night]] 2007, Piratbyrån burned all of their remaining copies of ''Copy Me'' in a ritual-like performance, declaring:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The file-sharing debate is hereby buried. When we talk about file-sharing from now on it's as one of many ways to copy. We talk about better and worse ways of indexing, archiving and copying—not whether copying is right or wrong. Winter is pouring down the hillside. Make way for spring!&lt;ref&gt;[http://piratbyran.org/walpurgis/ Walpurgis] Piratbyran. Retrieved 16 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jonas Andersson, a Swedish researcher specialized in the politics of [[file-sharing]], gave this brief definition in October 2009:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Piratbyrån is entirely separate from The Pirate Party; it is more of a loosely organised think-tank, a website, a philosophical greenhouse or FAQ guide to digitization.&lt;ref&gt;Andersson, Jonas (13 October 2009). [http://liquidculture.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/qa-re-pirate-politics/ Q&amp;A re Pirate Politics] ''liquidculture notebook'' (Blog).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[MPAA]]-funded Svenska [[Svenska antipiratbyrån|Antipiratbyrån]] (Swedish Anti-Piracy Bureau), an agency devoted to fighting copyright infringement, was formed in 2001, before Piratbyrån. Piratbyrån humorously copied the name of their opponent, removing the "anti".&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband"&gt;Ernesto (23 June  2010).

In June 2010 the group disbanded following the death of co-founder and prominent member [[Ibrahim Botani]], also known as Ibi Kopimi Botani.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-disband" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Ibrahim | last=Botani | title=Untitled blog | website=Botanibladet | date=19 June 2008 | url=http://botanibladet.blogspot.nl/2008/06/botanibladets-ppnande.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several former members of Piratbyrån are now involved in [[Telecomix]]. The front page of the website was replaced with the three words {{lang|se|Stängt för eftertanke}} (Swedish for ''Closed for reflection'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.piratbyran.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041001003858/http://www.piratbyran.org/ |archivedate=2004-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-definition==
In 2008 Piratbyrån published a report titled ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007''  which starts with the following description of the organisation:

{{quote|Piratbyrån (The Bureau of Piracy) is not an organization, at least not primarily. First and foremost, Piratbyrån is since its beginning in 2003 an ongoing conversation. We are reflecting over questions regarding copying, information infrastructure and digital culture. Within the group, using our own different experiences and skills, as in our daily encounters with other people. These conversations often bring about different kinds of activities.|&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.org/PBverksamhet2007/PB%20activities%202007%20(text%20only).pdf|format=PDF| title = Piratbyrån – The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007| year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Definition by Prix Ars Electronica jury==
As Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" at [[Prix Ars Electronica]] in 2009,&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"&gt;oso (9 September 2009). [http://el-oso.net/blog/archives/2009/09/09/ars-electronica-digital-communities-forum/ |Ars Electronica| Communities Forum] El-Oso.net.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"&gt;[http://www.aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 History of Prix Ars Electronica / 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025084014/http://aec.at/prix_history_en.php?year=2009 |date=2010-10-25 }} Ars Electronica, 2009. Retrieved 17 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; the jury statement said:

{{quote|Piratbyrån is not an organization but an on-going conversation on copyright, file-sharing and digital culture. Over the last six years Piratbyrån has been able to create a discursive space that enables individual and collective actors to be heard, and to significantly expand the range of opinions entering the public debate regarding copyright. To advance this conversation, they have been using a wide range of innovative, experimental, often humorous techniques – as well as traditional means such as public discussions, interviews and publications.

The resulting debate has been multi-layered ranging from the technological (e.g. The Pirate Bay) to the artistic (e.g. a bus tour through Europe to Manifesta 08) to the political (e.g. Pirate Party). With very limited resources, Piratbyrån has been able to galvanize a political movement that has already shaped the development of digital culture and public policy in Sweden and across Europe, pushing the boundaries of the possible.

Piratbyrån aims at nothing less than to fundamentally question the most basic categories – e.g. the distinction between the producer and the consumer – through which we understand culture in order to investigate if and how these apply to the digital condition.

Piratbyrån does not claim to offer a solution to this extremely complex issue; indeed, it questions the assumption that copyright offers a one-size-fits all solution to cultural production, which now needs to be replaced with another unified solution. All of this has been done with great dedication and under considerable personal risk, yet they never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers.|&lt;ref name="copyriot.se"&gt;Fleischer, Rasmus (17 September 2009).

==BitTorrent tracker==
{{wikinews|The Pirate Bay and Piratbyrån raided}}
[[Image:Rasmus Fleischer.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rasmus Fleischer]], spokesman of Piratbyrån speaking at a demonstration in [[Stockholm]] held 3 June 2006.]]
Members of Piratbyrån founded the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] tracker [[The Pirate Bay]] in 2003 as a Swedish language site. The Pirate Bay now operates independently from Piratbyrån, although a number of The Pirate Bay administrators were also active in Piratbyrån.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |last=Harrison |first=Ann |title=The Pirate Bay: Here to Stay? |publisher=Wired |date=13 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031053808/http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/03/70358 |archivedate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story819_Slyck_Interviews_The_Pirate_Bay| last=Ingram | first=Michael | title=Slyck Interviews The Pirate Bay| publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |date=7 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police raid===
On the morning of 31 May 2006, the servers of both [[The Pirate Bay]], a popular Swedish [[BitTorrent tracker]], and Piratbyrån were confiscated in a raid by Swedish police. The seizure was part of investigation into possible illegal activities on the part of The Pirate Bay. Piratbyrån and the Antipiratbyrån set up a temporary news blog during the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://piratbyran.blogspot.com/| title = Piratbyrån Blog |accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|title= Antipiratbyrån Blog|accessdate= 25 July 2008|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080806101720/http://www.antipiratbyran.com/index.htm?id=news&amp;p=p19#19|archivedate= 6 August 2008|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities in 2007==
In ''Piratbyrån - The Bureau of Piracy Activities 2007'', published in 2008, Piratbyrån list its activities for the year 2007. Activities by Piratbyrån members include lectures at universities and conferences, the publication of reports, participation in art projects and research projects, an interview with [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] in February 2007, participation in the planning of [[The Oil of the 21st Century]] conference in Berlin, presentations at a Norwegian computer party (The Gathering), interviews to the media regarding the raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], opening of a webshop to sell Kopimi Klothing, participation in the organisation of protests to mark the one-year anniversary of the police raid on [[The Pirate Bay]], attendance of the BELEF07 festival in [[Belgrade]] ([[Serbia]]), and participation in the organisation of a one-day art event in [[Stockholm]] titled "Who Makes And Owns Your Work".&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In March 2007 Piratbyrån members were invited to a meeting with the executive group for the [[Swedish Film Institute]], to share their views about film and copying. According to Piratbyrån "The leadership listens with interest — only to some months later launch new anti-piracy initiatives...". In the same month Piratbyrån collaborates with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] group [[Piratgruppen]], launching the counter-campaign "Piracy frees music" (promoted via [[The Pirate Bay]]), in response to the "Piracy kills music" anti-piracy campaign by the Norwegian record industry.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

In 2007 members of Piratbyrån also contributed to the production of the film ''[[Steal This Film|Steal This Film (Part Two)]]'', which features interviews with Piratbyrån members and was released in December 2007.&lt;ref name="piratbyran.org"/&gt;

==Activities in 2009==
Piratbyrån organized the "Spectrial", a theatricalizing intervention in [[The Pirate Bay trial]] in Stockholm, early in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ The Pirate Bay Trial website].  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306020910/http://trial.thepiratebay.org/ |date=6 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

At the [[Prix Ars Electronica]] Piratbyrån received an "award of distinction" (including a prize money of 5000 euro) in the category "Digital Communities".&lt;ref name="el-oso.net"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aec.at"/&gt; The motivation of the jury underlined the Piratbyrån "never forget that humor and irony are among the strongest weapons available to cultural producers." &lt;ref name="copyriot.se"/&gt;

==Kopimi==
{{Multiple image
| image1=Kopimi_pyra2.svg | width1=200
| image2=Kopimi k.svg | width2=96

}}
The '''Kopimi''' symbol, also spelled '''kopimi''', was conceived in January 2005 by Piratbyrån co-founder [[Ibrahim Botani]]. The logo, pronounced "copy me", can be used to specifically request people to copy and distribute a work, for any purpose. Botani intended the logo to be the opposite of copyright, which usually restricts copying a work, and as a unifying symbol of the [[Opposition to copyright|anti-copyright]] ideas Piratbyrån stood for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rasmus | last=Fleischer | title=Ibi Kopimi Botani | date=23 June 2010 | website=Copyriot | url=http://copyriot.se/2010/06/23/ibi-kopimi-botani/}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Kopimi may be considered an [[anti-copyright notice]] of sorts.

Later in 2005, the Kopimi logotype was included in the Piratbyrån book ''Copy Me''.&lt;ref&gt;Piratbyrån (2005). pp. 153, 154, 160, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also put on the front page of [[The Pirate Bay]], where it remains until this day. The history section of the site stated: "''Some of you may have noticed that little symbol at the bottom of the page, the pyramid. It's a symbol called Kopimi (Copy Me) which was founded by an old friend of ours, the artist Ibi Botani. It's basically about promoting copying. Using the kopimi symbol on something not only shows that it is ok to copy it, it says it wants to be copied, mixed or manipulated!''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=History of 2007 | url=http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | website=thepiratebay.org | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201011954/http://thepiratebay.org/history/2007 | archive-date=1 February 2009 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Kopimi may appear to be a radical [[List of free content licenses|free content license]], in effect similar to [[Creative Commons license#Zero / public domain|Creative Commons Zero]], no one associated with Piratbyrån ever called Kopimi a license, instead describing it as a symbol of certain ideas. The website of Kopimi contains no terms or legal text. The [[Open Source Initiative]], [[Free Software Foundation]], or any other organisation within the [[open-source movement]], does not list Kopimi as an approved license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Open Source Initiative | title=Licenses by Name | website=Opensource.org | url=http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Free Software Foundation | title=Various Licenses and Comments about Them | website=gnu.org | url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikimedia Commons]], a repository of free content and a sister site of Wikipedia, allows users to label their files with Kopimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=– | title=Pages that link to "Template:Kopimi" | website=Wikimedia Commons | url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Kopimi&amp;hidelinks=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kopimism===
{{Main article|Missionary Church of Kopimism}}
'''Kopimism''' and '''kopimist(s)''' are terms derived from Botani's symbol. It is unclear who coined them, but they have been used since at least July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=TPB announces its support for ACFI against Ladonia | date=25 July 2006 | website=thepiratebay.org | url=http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323072858/http://thepiratebay.org/blog.php?id=34 | archivedate=23 March 2007 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Unknown | title=How the Kopimists Conquered Internets – and Launched a War | date=25 July 2006 | website=Solidarity with Ladonia!

The Pirate Bay declared: "''To make sure the owners will be kopimistic and that the country won’t be governed by people that do not care about its future, we have come up with a plan. With the help of all the kopimists on Internets, we want to buy Sealand.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=The Pirate Bay | title=Buy Sealand | url=http://buysealand.com/ | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070126211851/http://buysealand.com/ | archivedate=2007-01-26 | dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Tuan | last=Nguyen | title=PirateBay.org Wants to Be Own Country | website=[[DailyTech]] | url=http://www.dailytech.com/PirateBayorg+Wants+to+Be+Own+Country/article5692.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Missionary Church of Kopimism]] was founded in 2010 by Isak Gerson, a philosophy student and a member of the [[Pirate Party of Sweden]]. After two failed attempts, Kopimism was officially recognized as a religion by the Swedish government in January 2012. The Church considers copying a holy virtue, and uses various Kopimi symbols to present itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author=Ernesto | title=File-sharing recognized as official religion in Sweden | date=4 January 2012 | website=[[TorrentFreak]] | url=https://torrentfreak.com/file-sharing-recognized-as-official-religion-in-sweden-120104/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | first=Rolle | last=Romig | title=The First Church of Pirate Bay | website=[[The New Yorker]] | date=12 January 2012 | url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-first-church-of-pirate-bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copie===
[[File:Copie.svg|thumb|150px|Copie logo]]
Inspired by Kopimi, the [[Pirate Party of Brazil]] created their own version of the concept called "Copie", which plays both on the Portuguese words "copie" (meaning copy) and "co-pie" (meaning tweet together). The Copie logo shows 5 birds tweeting together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.partidopirata.org/copie PartidoPirata] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707074649/http://www.partidopirata.org/copie |date=2009-07-07 }} Brazilian Pirate Party website.

The '''Rossano Gospels''', designated by '''042''' or '''Σ''' (in the [[Biblical manuscript#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]] numbering), ε 18 ([[Biblical manuscript#Von Soden|Soden]]), at the [[Rossano Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Rossano]] in [[Italy]], is a 6th-century [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]] written following the reconquest of the [[Italian peninsula]] by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Also known as  '''Codex purpureus Rossanensis''' due to the reddish-purple (''purpureus'' in [[Latin]]) appearance of its pages, the [[codex]] is one of the oldest surviving [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the [[New Testament]]. The manuscript is famous for its prefatory cycle of miniatures of subjects from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', arranged in two tiers on the page, sometimes with small [[Old Testament prophet portrait]]s below, prefiguring and pointing up to events described in the New Testament scene above.

== Description ==
The now incomplete [[codex]] contains the text of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] and the majority of the [[Gospel of Mark]], with only one lacuna (Mark 16:14-20).&lt;ref name = Gregory&gt;{{Cite book | last = Gregory | first = Caspar René | authorlink = Caspar René Gregory | title = Textkritik des Neuen Testaments, Vol. 1 | publisher = J.C.

Like the [[Vienna Genesis]] and the [[Sinope Gospels]], the Rossano Gospels are written in silver ink on purple dyed [[parchment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

The large ({{nowrap|300 mm}} by {{nowrap|250 mm}}) book has text written in a {{nowrap|215 mm}} square block with two columns of twenty lines each. There is a prefatory cycle of illustrations which are also on purple dyed parchment.

It contains the [[Epistula ad Carpianum]], tables of the κεφάλαια (''tables of contents'') before each Gospel, τίτλοι (''titles'') at the top of the pages, numbers of [[Ammonian Sections]], and references to the [[Eusebian Canons]].&lt;ref name = Gregory/&gt;

== Text ==
The text of the Codex agrees generally with the [[Byzantine text-type]] in close relationship to the [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus]]. The Rossano Gospels, along with the manuscripts [[Codex Petropolitanus Purpureus|N]], [[Sinope Gospels|O]], and [[Codex Beratinus|Φ]], belong to the group of the [[Purple parchment|Purple Uncials]] (or purple codices). [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] placed all four manuscripts of the group (the Purple Uncials) in [[Categories of New Testament manuscripts|Category V]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book

'''''semaZen'''''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=semaZen at Youtube|

The video features a computer generated model of the artist, dressed in traditional [[Sufi]] clothing, weaved from the inside and outside the head in a constant loop which is unified with a continuous count to 41, in English and Turkish. The number 41 has a significance, as it is the number of times the God's name must be repeated in [[dhikr]].

Semazen is the name for Whirling Dervishes in Sufi tradition. Gulan states that he was influenced by the software he used for creating 3D models. Software reminded him the constant revolve of the Whirling Dervishes and the tides between the inner and outer self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Me Istanbul|

{{For|the 1984 film adaptation|Another Man's Wife and a Husband under the Bed (film)}}
{{no footnotes|date=February 2016}}
"'''Somebody else's wife and a husband under the bed'''" ({{lang-ru|Чужая жена и муж под кроватью}}, ''Chuzhaya zhena i muzh pod krovatyu'') is an 1848 short story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].

== Background ==
The story originated from two separate pieces: "Somebody else's wife and a husband under the bed" (published in 1848 in the journal "Notes of the Fatherland"). In preparing the 1859 two-volume collected works, the writer combined both in one story - "Another Man's Wife and the husband under the bed." The first part only slightly changed certain lines, while the second part is more significantly altered. 

In his story, Dostoevsky utilized some techniques of the [[vaudeville]] genre, in particular the construction of the dialogues, replete with puns. The title of the story, too, resembles popular titles of the vaudeville 1830-1840s (e.g., [[Fyodor Koni]]'s 1834 "Husband in the Fire, While His Wife On a Visit"). Dostoevsky continued to use these techniques in future works (for example, in "[[Uncle's Dream]]"). Subsequently, Dostoevsky gave a different, deeply psychological interpretation of the theme of the deceived husband, in the story ''[[The Eternal Husband]]'' (1870).

==Adaptations==
The story has been repeatedly reworked for the stage, for example:

*1900 - W. Stromilov ("Jealous Husband")
*1912 - S. Antimonov ("Somebody else's wife and a husband under the bed")

The story was made into [[Somebody else's wife and a husband under the bed (film)|a film in 1984]], directed by [[Vitaly Melnikov (film director)|Vitaly Melnikov]].

==Composition==

===Background===
The symphony has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is written in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]], mimicking the traditional four-movement [[Symphony|symphonic form]].  Rouse drew inspiration for the work from [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]], about which he recalled in the score program notes:{{quote|The first piece of "classical music" I remembering hearing — "[[Peter and the Wolf]]" doesn't count — was Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. I was six years old and had been listening to a great deal of early, new-at-the-time [[rock and roll]]; my mother said, "That's fine, but you might like this as well." It was a recording of the Beethoven symphony, and I remember thinking that a whole new world was opening up to me. I decided that I wanted to become a composer.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}
The composition thus features a number of homages to the Beethoven symphony, including a paraphrase of the famous four-note [[Motif (music)|motif]] that opens the first movement.  Rouse added, "The most extended reference is to the connective passage that links the third and fourth movements of the Beethoven: the mysterious passage for timpani over a long chord in the strings. My timpani part is identical to Beethoven's; once again, though, what goes on around it is different."  He concluded, "As is often the case in my music, the language ranges freely — but I hope in an integrated way — between a dissonant language and a more consonant one. There is no programmatic element to the work, though I do hope to transport the listener through a series of emotional states, from turbulence to serenity."&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra consisting of three [[Western concert flute|flutes]] (third doubling [[bass flute]]), three [[oboe]]s, three [[clarinet]]s, three [[bassoon]]s, four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], percussion (three players), two [[Pedal harp|harps]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Reviewing the world premiere performance, Scott Cantrell of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' wrote, "Rarely does a brand-new piece of music really grab me and keep me completely engaged on first hearing. But the world premiere of Christopher Rouse's brilliant, exciting and at times hauntingly beautiful Fifth Symphony had that effect Friday night, at the Meyerson Symphony Center. Judging by the roaring ovation after the Dallas Symphony Orchestra performance, under music director Jaap van Zweden, lots of others were similarly affected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Cantrell |first=Scott |title=A razzle-dazzle Dallas Symphony concert, with a Christopher Rouse world premiere |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |date=February 10, 2017 |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/arts/classical-music/2017/02/10/razzle-dazzle-dallas-symphony-concert-christopher-rouse-world-premiere |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wayne Lee Gay of the ''Texas Classical Review'' also praised the work, remarking, "With this new addition to the list, [Rouse] can stake claim to the title of the leading American symphonist of our time."  He added:{{quote|Rouse has no qualms about seducing the listener with harp chords and sweeping melodies, nor is he shy about jolting the audience with all the noise the modern symphony orchestra can muster. As in so many great [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and post-Romantic symphonies of the past, grand ideas are packaged in a logical form that gives the listeners, whether or not they are consciously aware of the structure, a sense of emotional pilgrimage—of moving into a spiritual and intellectual space not on any map. This listener, for one, will welcome the opportunity to hear, explore, and emotionally experience this work again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gay |first=Wayne Lee |title=Rouse's Fifth Symphony proves an instant classic with powerful sendoff from van Zweden, Dallas Symphony |date=February 11, 2017 |url=http://texasclassicalreview.com/2017/02/11/rouses-fifth-symphony-proves-an-instant-classic-with-powerful-sendoff-from-van-zweden-dallas-symphony/ |accessdate=February 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Te Whakaruruhau o Ngā Reo Irirangi Māori''' ('''National Māori Radio Network''') is a [[New Zealand]] [[radio network]], consisting of [[radio stations]] set up to serve the country's indigenous [[Māori people]]. Most stations receive contestable Government funding from [[Te Māngai Pāho]] to operate on behalf of affiliated [[iwi]] (tribes) or [[hapu]] (sub-tribes). Under their funding agreement, the stations must produce programmes in the local [[Māori language]] and actively promote local Māori culture.&lt;ref name=maorimedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Iwi Radio Coverage|url=http://www.maorimedia.co.nz/Iwi_Radio_Coverage.pdf|website=maorimedia.co.nz|publisher=Māori Media Network|accessdate=14 June 2015|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stations combine an English language [[urban contemporary]] playlist during breakfast and drive shows with [[full service (radio format)|full service broadcasting]] and Māori language programmes at other times of the day.&lt;ref name=sea92fm&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carlsson|first1=Sven|title=Contractors install the Whakaatu Whanaunga Trust’s far-reaching antenna last Friday|url=http://www.opotikinews.co.nz/webapps/i/88879/228222/602305|website=Opitiki News|publisher=Opitiki News|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have their own local shows, personalities and breakfast programmes, and broadcast through both terrestrial frequencies and online streams. There are regular segments updating people about local events, and teaching people Māori language and [[tikanga]] (customs).&lt;ref name="awards14"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maoritelevision.com/news/latest-news/iwi-radio-stations-prepare-bi-annual-awards-night |title=Iwi Radio stations prepare for bi-annual awards night |publisher=[[Māori Television]] |author=Wepiha Te Kanawa |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations also produce local news shows, Māori music, educational programmes, comedies and dramas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irirangi.net/roopu-tautoko/history/whakaaro-ake.aspx|title=A brief history of Māori radio broadcasting|publisher=Te Whakaruruhau o Nga Reo Irirangi Māori|accessdate=25 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024150324/http://www.irirangi.net/roopu-tautoko/history/whakaaro-ake.aspx|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tmpradio&gt;{{cite web|title=TMP Radio|url=http://www.tmp.govt.nz/iwi-radio-stations|website=[[Te Māngai Pāho]]|publisher=[[Te Māngai Pāho]]|accessdate=26 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141007151341/http://www.tmp.govt.nz/iwi-radio-stations|archivedate=7 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network oversees the sharing of news bulletins, the pooling of resources and the production of network programmes. Manukau's Radio Waatea operates the network news service and produces network programmes. Its chief executive, [[Willie Jackson (politician)|Willie Jackson]], also serves as association chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/te-manu-korihi/227665/iwi-radio-happy-with-jackson's-governance-role|title=Iwi radio happy with Jackson's governance role|publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]]|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Programmes are shared and simulcast on a high-speed [[wide area network]].&lt;ref name=brianpauling /&gt; Almost every Māori person in New Zealand lives within the range of an iwi radio frequency, but transmission issues have been reported in remote areas.&lt;ref name=hiddensuccess /&gt;

==History==

===Early Māori broadcasting (1928-1978)===

The first Māori language to be broadcast on the radio were songs. A programme of Māori history, stories and songs were broadcast around the country on [[Waitangi Day]] 1928, and a regular programme featuring correct pronunciation of Māori began the same year. Māori broadcasters were appointed: Lou Paul of [[Ngāti Whātua]] in Auckland, Kīngi Tāhiwi of [[Ngāti Raukawa]] in Wellington, Te Ari Pītama of [[Ngāi Tahu]] in Christchurch, and broadcasting pioneer Airini Grenell of [[Ngāi Tahu]] in Dunedin.&lt;ref name=walkerfirstdecades&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=First decades of Māori radio|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-1|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first programme entirely in the Māori language was a news bulletin about [[World War II]] and local Māori issues, presented by Wiremu Bill Parker in 1940. Other shows followed, including ''Nga pao me nga pakiwaitara a te Maori: song and story of the Maori'', based in Wellington, and ''Te reo o te Māori'', broadcast from Napier.

Leo Fowler set up a Māori Programmes Section of the [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]] in 1964, and, alongside Bill Kerekere took a mobile broadcasting studio to important Māori events. The department produced the English language Māori affairs programme ''Te puna wai kōrero'' and helped increase airtime for Māori music and show bands, including the Patea Māori Club hit [[Poi E]].&lt;ref name=walkerstory&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=Story: Māori radio – reo irirangi|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Te Reo o Aotearoa, a Māori and Pacific unit of New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation's successor [[Radio New Zealand]], was set up in 1978 to produce Māori and Pacific programmes.&lt;ref name=patday1&gt;{{cite book|last1=Day|first1=Patrick|title=A history of broadcasting in New Zealand. Vol. 1, The radio years.|date=1994|publisher=[[Auckland University Press]]|location=Auckland|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for iwi stations (1978-1990)===

By the 1970s state broadcasters broadcast less than 90 minutes of Māori language and Māori interest programming a week, and there were growing concerns about the decline in fluent Māori speakers. [[Victoria University of Wellington]]’s Te Reo Māori Society campaigned for Māori radio, helping to set up Te Reo o Poneke, the first Māori-owned radio operation, using airtime on Wellington student radio station [[Radio Active (New Zealand)|Radio Active]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=walkerfirstiwi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=First iwi radio station|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-3|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other part-time Māori radio stations were also set up by young volunteers: [[Otaki, New Zealand|Ōtaki]]'s Te Reo o Raukawa in 1985, and [[Mangamuka]]'s Tautoko Radio and [[Ruatōria]]'s Radio Ngāti Porou in 1987.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork /&gt; The establishment of a Māori Radio Network was also discussed at a hui or gathering at [[Takapuwahia]] Marae in [[Porirua]]. Te Reo o Poneke gained a full-time license in 1987, becoming the pan-tribal Wellington radio station Te Upoko O Te Ika.&lt;ref name=culturalsurvivor&gt;{{cite web|last1=McArdle|first1=Erin|title=Piecing Together Māori, Word by Word|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/piecing-together-maori-word-word|website=culturalsurvivor.org|publisher=Cultural Survior|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first bilingual school opened at [[Ruatoki]] in [[Urewera]] in 1978, and the [[Māori Language Commission]] was formed when Māori language became an official language in 1987.&lt;ref name=officiallanguage&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori becomes official language|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/maori-becomes-an-official-language|website=[[Nzhistory.net.nz]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=18 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Māori culture continued to be underrepresented on [[radio in New Zealand|New Zealand radio]].&lt;ref name=shanahan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neill|first1=Karen|last2=Shanahan|first2=Morris William|title=The Great New Zealand Radio Experiment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rEq27qhOdDwC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=18 July 2012|year=2005|publisher=Cengage Learning Australia|isbn=9780170124805|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tairawhiti Polytechnic]] head of Māori studies Joe Te Rito operated a part-time station, Te Toa Takitini, on the polytechnic's [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] campus in 1988 and 1989, in an effort to broadcast [[Ngāti Kahungunu|Rongomaiwahine-Ngāti Kahungunu]]'s local elders and native speakers.&lt;ref name=kahungunuoff /&gt; A year later he relaunched it as full-time station Radio Kahungunu in [[Hastings, New Zealand|Hastings]], to increase grammatical and spoken Māori language fluency, and expose the language to homes where no one spoke it.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walker|first1=Piripi|title=The iwi radio network|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-radio-reo-irirangi/page-4|website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]]|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Te Rito archived more than 2000 programme recordings, which he used to study and translate the tribe's distinctive [[dialect]], teach courses on the local spoken and written language, and provide an international model for preserving dialects in other communities in [[Asia]] and [[Pacific Ocean|the Pacific]].&lt;ref name=joeterito&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengthening Rongomaiwahine-Kahungunu Dialects through Archival Recordings|url=http://www.maramatanga.co.nz/project/kia-areare-ki-ng%C4%81-reo-o-ng%C4%81-t%C4%ABpuna|website=Ngā Pae o te Māramatanga|publisher=[[University of Auckland]]|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Te Rito, J.

===Waitangi Tribunal challenges (1990-1994)===

The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fourth Labour Government]] deregulated the radio industry during the 1980s, selling the rights to use radio frequencies to private companies. The Wellington Māori Language Board, Nga Kaiwhakapumau i te Reo, was supporting the self-funded Te Upoko O Te Ika, and claimed the Government's sell off of broadcasting spectrum amounted to theft.&lt;ref name=geetheft&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gee|first1=Debbie|title=Airwaves theft?|journal=Onfilm|date=August 1989|volume=6|issue=5|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the New Zealand Māori Council jointly, it challenged the spectrum sell off and the lack of support for Māori broadcasting. In one case brought through the [[Waitangi Tribunal]], a permanent commission set up to investigate breaches of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], they argued the treaty gave them sovereignty over the airwaves and broadcast spectrum. They sought a share of the proceeds from the sale of rights to spectrum frequencies,&lt;ref name=maorislay&gt;{{cite news|title=Maoris lay claim to air waves|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=30 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and frequencies for their own use.&lt;ref name=drinnandeal&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drinnan|first1=John|title=Maoris get poor deal, court told|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=5 October 1990|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cases followed through the [[High Court of New Zealand|High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]], with one case reaching the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council in London]].&lt;ref name=walkerfirstiwi /&gt;

The Government addressed the claim by instructing [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Television New Zealand]] to broadcast more Māori programmes,&lt;ref name=shanahan /&gt; and funding the establishment of Māori-owned and Māori-controlled radio stations.&lt;ref name=walkerkaranga&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Ranginui|title=Te Karanga : Maori radio|agency=[[Metro Magazine]]|issue=141|date=March 1993|pages=122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty one iwi radio stations were started between 1989 and 1994. These were initially funded by [[NZ on Air]] from 1990, with six percent of broadcasting fees allocated to Māori broadcasting.&lt;ref name=cherrylsmith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Cherryl Waerea-I-Te Rangi Smith|title=Kimihia Te Maramatanga: Colonisation and Iwi Development|date=1994|publisher=[[University of Auckland]]|location=Auckland|pages=119–141|accessdate=20 September 2015|url=http://www.kaupapamaori.com/assets/SmithC/kimihia_te_maramatanga_chpt6.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call for Māori to have greater control of funding led to the establishment of a separate [[Te Mangai Paho]] funding agency in 1995, and this agency became funded through taxation.&lt;ref name=brianpauling /&gt; The establishment of these stations allowed the Government to justify the sale of [[Radio New Zealand]]'s commercial [[Newstalk ZB]] and [[ZM (New Zealand)|ZM]] stations to the privately owned [[Australian Radio Network]] partnership in 1996,&lt;ref name=campbellarn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Campbell|first1=Gordon|title=Maori fight radio sale|agency=[[New Zealand Listener]]|issue=Vol. 153 No. 2922|date=27 April 1996|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the sale was challenged in the High Court and Court of Appeal.&lt;ref name=brieftimeline&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief timeline of Maori activity related to the search for Tino Rangatiratanga over the spectrum and their investments|url=http://www.nzmis.maori.nz/digital-library/radio-spectrum/timeline/|website=nzmis.maori.nz|publisher=Te Whānua Irirangi New Zealand Māori Internet Society|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aotearoa Radio era (1994-1997)===

Several iwi applied for Government funding to establish radio stations in areas with significant Māori populations, developing an iwi-based radio network. However, the new stations struggled to survive as budgets did not cover the costs, volunteer staff lost enthusiasm, staff training was inadequate, and funding was insufficient to create professional career paths for Māori radio announcers and managers. Three stations broadcast on AM frequencies, costing an extra $100,000 a year than FM frequencies, but received the same flat rate of funding.&lt;ref name=walkeriwinetwork /&gt; 
Radio Ngāti Porou station manager Ngahiwi Apanui set up a joint venture between iwi stations, the national advertising agency Māori Media Network, in 1994 to increase each station's sources of revenue.&lt;ref name="ruahistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.raukawafm.co.nz/index.php?pag=cms&amp;id=169&amp;p=history.html|website=Ruakawa FM|publisher=Ruakawa FM|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Māori Communication Network was set up in 1997.&lt;ref name=kennedystyle&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kennedy|first1=Erin|title=Maori radio changes style|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=17 June 1997|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the first Māori language radio network, Aotearoa Radio or Irirrangi Radio, began in Auckland on 18 July 1988 on a short-term warrant, broadcasting on 1XO 603 AM.&lt;ref name=teiwi&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maori radio begins in Auckland|journal=Te Iwi o Aotearoa|date=August 1998|issue=12|pages=14–15|issn=0113-4523}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained a full-time warrant in 1989, extending to Tauranga on 1XV 603 AM, Wellington on 2XO 1323 AM and Christchurch on 3XQ 1323 AM.&lt;ref name=awaiting&gt;{{cite news|last1=Drinnan|first1=John|title=Aotearoa awaiting permanent warrant|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion]]|publisher=[[Independent Newspapers]]|date=30 May 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio and television producer [[Ray Waru]] was the chief executive.&lt;ref name=randomwaru&gt;{{cite web|title=Secrets and Treasures: Our stories told through the objects at Archives New Zealand by Ray Waru|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.nz/books/ray-waru/secrets-and-treasures-our-stories-told-through-the-objects-at-archives-new-zealand-9781869796891.aspx|website=randomhouse.co.nz|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teacher, lecturer and consultant Haare Williams served as the general manager.&lt;ref name=comethaare&gt;{{cite web|title=Haare Williams|url=http://www.comet.org.nz/wawcs0143729/idDetails=178/COMET'-s-kaumatua.html|website=comet.org.nz|publisher=COMET|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aotearoa Radio operated alongside the iwi radio stations, and broadcast a range of programmes on Māori issues, and gave airtime to Māori women at a time when women and Māori were both underrepresented in radio.&lt;ref name=kippingbreaking&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kipping|first1=Pat|title=Breaking sound barriers : Irirangi women|journal=Broadsheet|date=October 1990|volume=182|pages=14–17|issn=0110-8603}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tipene O'Regan]], Beverly Adlam, Pauline Butt, Toby Curtis, Wiremui Ohia, [[Temuera Morrison]], [[Dalvanius Prime]], [[Moana Maniapoto|Moana Maniapoto-Jackson]], Neil Gudsell, James Waerea, Libby Hakaraia, Trada Chadwick and Koro Wetere were involved in the Māori Radio Board during this period.

[[Ngāti Whātua]] took a leading role in iwi radio during the 1990s and early 2000s through its subsidiary Mai Media. The iwi started [[urban contemporary]] station, [[Mai FM]], in Auckland in July 1992, and New Zealand's first Māori language network, Ruia Mai Te Ratonga Irirangi o te Motu 1179AM, in April 1996.&lt;ref name=hitsairwaves&gt;{{cite journal|title=National Maori radio service hits the airways|journal=Te Māori|date=May 1996|volume=5|issue=8|page=7|issn=1171-5103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Ruia Mai it secured a contract with Te Māngai Pāho to provide Māori language news bulletins,&lt;ref name=tewaha&gt;{{cite news|title=Funding cut silences Ruia Mai|url=http://www.tewahanui.info/pdfs/2/twn02pg13.pdf|accessdate=21 July 2009|agency=Te Waha Nui|publisher=[[AUT University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which broadcast on 26 iwi radio stations.&lt;ref name=tauiwanews&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stuart|first1=Ian|title=Media: Tauiwa and Maori News: An Indigenous Perspective|url=http://www.davidrobie.org.nz/cafepacific/resources/aspac/maori.html|website=davidrobie.org.nz|publisher=Asia Pacific Network|accessdate=19 September 2015|date=13 November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also produced a range of current affairs, documentary and children's programmes.&lt;ref name=mcgarveyrangi&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGarvey|first1=Rangi Karaitiana|title=Ruia Mai : Te Ratonga Irirangi o te Motu|agency=Pu Kaea|date=June 1997|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these programmes were recognised in the [[New Zealand Radio Awards]].&lt;ref name=ruiamai /&gt;

==Operations==

===Funding===

Iwi radio stations receive a share $11.7 million in Government funding each year, and can each be eligible for an annual Government grant of $350,000. They also source funding from sponsorship, advertising and leasing of studio space.&lt;ref name=sunfmawa&gt;{{cite web|title=Sun FM - Te Reo Irirangi o te Mānuka Tūtahi|url=http://www.ngatiawa.iwi.nz/cms/view/sunfm.aspx|website=Te Rūnanga o Ngāti Awa|publisher=Ngāti Aaw|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government-funded stations must broadcast at least eight hours of Māori language content between 6am and 12pm each day of the week.&lt;ref name=brianpauling&gt;{{cite book|author-last=Pauling|author-first=Brian|title="New Zealand - A Radio Paradise?" in: Radio in Small Nations: Production, Programmes, Audiences|editor1-last=Hand|editor1-first=Richard J.|editor2-last=Traynor|editor2-first=Mary|date=2014|publisher=University of Wales Press|location=[[Cardiff]]|isbn=0708325440|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Station managers are also usually required to be proficient in the Māori language.&lt;ref name=awamanager&gt;{{cite web|title=Awa FM station manager|url=http://www.mahi.co.nz/details/4855#.VSfXz_mUf50|website=Mahi,co.nz|publisher=Taea Limited|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 0.9% and 1.2% of each station's annual revenue is returned to the music industry through [[Recorded Music NZ]],&lt;ref name=radiotvbw&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio &amp; Television Broadcast &amp; Webcast|url=http://www.recordedmusic.co.nz/portfolio/broadcast-webcast/|website=recordedmusic.co.nz|publisher=[[Recorded Music NZ]]|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each station treated differently for licensing purposes.&lt;ref name=apraamcos&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio|url=http://apraamcos.co.nz/music-customers/licence-types/radio/|website=apraamcos.co,nz|publisher=APRA AMCOD New Zealand|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2014 and 2018, the Iwi Radio Network received an extra $12 million to cover new operating costs and to assess the feasibility of expanding the network with new iwi stations, and $1.5 million towards archiving historic Māori language programmes. Māori Affairs Minister [[Pita Sharples]] said the extra funding would increase Māori language content and programme quality, and would ensure interviews with dead elders would be not be lost.&lt;ref name=boostfour&gt;{{cite news|title=$12m boost over four years for iwi radio stations|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1405/S00254/12m-boost-over-four-years-for-iwi-radio-stations.htm|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[New Zealand Government]]|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funding was specifically allocated to increasing community engagement with iwi stations, increasing Māori language hours and expanding the number of people the network reached.&lt;ref name=estimatestovote&gt;{{cite web|title=Māori Affairs Committee 2014/15 Estimates for Vote Māori Affairs: Written questions 124 133|url=http://www.parliament.nz/resource/mi-nz/50SCMA_EVI_00DBSCH_EST_13173_1_A398907/4e85fcc31245ec1b286985029c2c3f0ddb0bed29|website=parliament.nz|publisher=[[New Zealand Parliament]]|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network chairman Willie Jackson said many iwi stations were struggling, and welcomed and desperately needed the extra funding.&lt;ref name=wikitoria&gt;{{cite news|last1=Day|first1=Wikitōria|title=Iwi radio stations receive a $12 million boost|url=http://www.maoritelevision.com/news/regional/iwi-radio-stations-receive-12-million-boost|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[Te Kāea]]|publisher=[[Māori Television]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role and effectiveness===

A two-year [[Massey University]] survey of 30,000 people, published in 2003, indicated 50 percent of Māori in Iwi Radio Network broadcast areas listened to an iwi station. The results were consistent with those of similar surveys by individual stations, and countered the misconception that iwi stations reached small and specific audiences. According to the research, iwi stations were often associated with old music and interviews with elders, but many Māori listeners used it to stay in touch with their culture, family history, spirituality and community, and maintain their language skills.&lt;ref name=hiddensuccess&gt;{{cite news|title=The hidden success of Māori radio|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/2003/press_releases/01_08_03a.html|accessdate=20 September 2015|publisher=[[Massey University]]|date=1 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further [[Auckland University of Technology]] research in 2009 suggested the potential audience of iwi radio stations would increase due to the growth of New Zealand's Māori and Pacific population.&lt;ref name=diversityreportage&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robie|first1=David|title=Diversity reportage in Aotearoa: demographics and the rise of the ethnic media|journal=Pacific Journalism Review|date=1 May 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=67–91|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/2313/pjr_15%281%29_6_diversityreportage_pp67-911.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|accessdate=20 September 2015|location=Auckland|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Māori language advocates have recognised radio broadcasting as having a small but significant role in bringing Māori language to New Zealand audiences for more than half a century, particularly since the establishment of radio stations under iwi control. [[Postcolonialists]] have also suggested the Iwi Radio Network is a form of decolonisation, a means of achieving decolonisation, and a way to assert cultural identity and challenge [[Pākeha]] cultural dominance.&lt;ref name=cherrylsmith /&gt; Massey University research in 2006 assessed five year qualitative and quantitative research, literature on the long term history of the Māori language, comparative studies between Māori and Irish radio, and [[Tūhoe]]'s experiences setting up a radio station, and found the Iwi Radio Network had a positive impact on Māori language revitalisation.&lt;ref name=tereopaho&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matamua|first1=Rangiānehu|title=Te Reo Pāho : Māori radio and language revitalisation : a thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Māori Studies at Massey University|journal=Thesis|date=2006|url=http://mro.massey.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10179/1864/02_whole.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|publisher=[[Massey University]]|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stations have failed to counter a decline in the number of fluent Māori speakers in the 2010s, but continue to be part of the strategy to promote it.&lt;ref name=tereoprecious&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Te reo Maori far too precious to be lost|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11296481|accessdate=20 September 2015|agency=[[New Zealand Herald]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]|date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and recognition===

The National Māori Radio Network has held its own annual awards since 2012. Te Upoko o te Ika was the inaugural winner of Station of the Year, Willie Jackson calling it a tribute to their work towards promoting the Māori language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.tangatawhenua.com/2012/03/oldest-maori-radio-station-takes-top-award/ |title=Oldest Maori Radio Station Takes Top Award |publisher=tangatawhenua.com |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taranaki's Korimako FM won Station of the Year in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/claudettehauiti/status/455068003747368960 |title=Accepting their Tohu for Best Iwi Radio Station Korimako FM Taranaki |author=[[Claudette Hauiti]] |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maniapoto FM in Te Kuiti, Moana Radio in Tauranga, Radio Ngāti Porou in Ruatoria, Te Korimako in New Plymouth and Te Hiku o te Ika in Kaitaia were finalists for Station for the Year in 2014.&lt;ref name="awards14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngatiporou.com/article/contribution-iwi-radio-recognised-award-ceremony |title=Contribution of Iwi Radio recognised at award ceremony |publisher=[[Ngāti Porou]] |accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stations are also eligible for awards at the [[New Zealand Radio Awards]]. One award, for Iwi Station of the Year, recognises radio networks or individual stations which have performed outstandingly as a champion of Māori language and culture. The station is judged on the quality and effectiveness of its Māori language use, and its programmes, client relations, community involvements, news and current affairs, personality strength, promotions and marketing campaigns.&lt;ref name=iwiyear&gt;{{cite web|title=Iwi Station of the Year|url=http://radioawards.co.nz/awards/detail/cid/20|website=radioawards.co.nz|publisher=[[New Zealand Radio Awards]]|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tumeke FM won Iwi Station of the Year in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Radio Awards "Iwi station of the year"|url=http://tumekefm.co.nz/?p=3665|website=tumekefm.co.nz|publisher=Tumeke FM|accessdate=21 July 2015|date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ngati Porou won the award in 2013, but faced criticism about its management and financial oversight a few months later.&lt;ref name=troubleiwi&gt;{{cite news|title=Trouble at Iwi Station of the Year|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/te-karere-news/trouble-iwi-radio-station-year-6058144|accessdate=21 January 2015|agency=[[Te Karere]]|publisher=[[TVNZ]]|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes==

===Days and nights===
The iwi stations broadcast a range of programmes during the day, combining the use of conversational Māori with commercially viable English language programmes. Many weekend programmes cover special interests, use local Māori language dialects, or cater to local [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] communities.&lt;ref name=sea92fm /&gt; For example, Tokoroa's Ruakawa FM follows a conventional radio schedule, with programmes like Daybreak with Roger Mahu, Rangatahi Days with Ngaitarangi Toma, and night show Rangatahi Vibes geared to younger audiences.&lt;ref name=ruaonair&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruakawa On Air|url=http://www.raukawafm.co.nz/pag_onair|website=Ruakawa FM|publisher=Ruakawa FM|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ruastaff&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruakawa Staff|url=http://www.raukawafm.co.nz/pag_staff_boardid_2|website=Ruakawa FM|publisher=Ruakawa FM|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend line-up includes the Hakinakina Hard Saturday sports morning show with Josiah Teokotai, and Sunday night Te Taura Vaanaga show for the local Cook Island community.&lt;ref name=ruaonair /&gt;

===Overnights===

Moana Radio's Tai Pari Tai Timu programme is simulcast across most of the Iwi Radio Network from midnight to 6.00am every day. The show's rotating hosts discuss news, views, issues and events from the Māori world in a [[Freeform (radio format)|free format]]. Retro phone requests are received after 4.00am.&lt;ref name=taipari&gt;{{cite web|title=Tai Pari Tai Timu|url=http://www.raukawafm.co.nz/pag_staff_boardid_2_staffid_83 |website=Ruakawa FM Tokoroa|publisher=Te Reo Irirangi Raukawa|accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other services===

Most iwi stations are involved in locals events, news media and other iwi or pan-tribal activities. Tokoroa's Raukawa FM, for example, has been holding concerts since December 1990, sponsored the Tainui Games in [[Kawhia]] in January 1992, supported the Raukawa Education and Training Establishment in June 1992, and helped set up the first Raukawa newspaper, Te Paki o Raukawa Kia Ora News, in August 1992.&lt;ref name=ruahistory /&gt; Radio Kahungunu set a special broadcast during the 2008 Takitimu Festival, broadcasting a live simulcast of its station on 105.5 FM from the nearby Hawke's Bay Showgrounds.&lt;ref name=napierhastings /&gt; Many stations are service contractors and offer their studios for hire. Rotorua's Te Arawa FM, for example, operates as Te Arawa Communications and provides marketing, film and audio engineering services, and has recently started a very successful commercial station The Heat 99.1FM &lt;ref name=tearawa /&gt;

Each station has its own website, and most stations stream online.&lt;ref name=irirangi&gt;{{cite web|title=Listen Online|url=http://www.irirangi.net/listen-online.aspx|website=Irirangi|publisher=Te Whakaruruhau o Nga Reo Irirangi Māori|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the websites were designed by Māori web developers. For example, the websites of Radio Kahungunu, Tekorimako 94.5FM and Turanga FM were the work of [[Ngāti Porou]] designer Alex Walker.&lt;ref name=falcon&gt;{{cite web|title=Showcase|url=http://falconcreations.co.nz/index.php/showcase|website=Falcon Creations|publisher=Alex Walker|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bridge''''' is a [[Lithography|lithograph]] print by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] artist [[M. C. Escher]], first printed in March 1930.

It depicts a bridge connecting two sheer cliffs. On the top of the left hand cliff is a city. The chasm between the two cliffs is narrow but plummets out of view. In the distance is another outcrop with a city built on top. Both the rock and the architecture on this third outcrop are darker in colouration than in the foreground. The buildings appear to be modelled partly after southern Italian architecture. The rock is in blocky formations that appeared often during Escher's Italian period and it is possible that the village seen is [[Assisi]].

[[File:The Indigo Book cover.png|thumb|Cover]]
'''''The Indigo Book: An Open and Compatible Implementation of A Uniform System of Citation''''' (formerly '''''Baby Blue's Manual of Legal Citation''''') is a [[free content]] version of the ''[[Bluebook]]'' system of [[legal citation]]. Founded by [[New York University]] professor Christopher Jon Sprigman, authored collectively by Sprigman and a group of NYU law students, and published by [[Public.Resource.Org]], it is an adaptation based on the 10th edition of the ''Bluebook'' as published by the [[Harvard Law Review|Harvard Law Review Association]] in 1958, which had entered the [[public domain]] in the United States because its [[copyright]] had expired due to [[Copyright renewal|non-renewal]].

The project was inspired by correspondence between Public.Resource.Org's founder [[Carl Malamud]] and a [[Nagoya University]] academic, who was threatened by lawyers representing the HLRA over plans to incorporate the ''Bluebook'' system into the [[open source]] citation management program [[Zotero]]. Sprigman has argued that the system of citation expressed in the ''Bluebook'' was effectively public domain because its mandated usage in courts made it an "[[edict of government]]", and because, barring trivial changes, the then-current 19th edition was nearly identical to the public domain 10th edition. Sprigman stated that the project's main goal was to allow the Bluebook's system of citation to be widely available at no cost, and allow others to collaborate on it under an [[open-source model]].

The ''Indigo Book'' is an unofficial substitute to the official ''Bluebook'' and is not endorsed by the Harvard Law Review Association; in December 2015, the project faced legal threats over its original name, ''Baby Blue's'', which lawyers representing the HLRA felt was too similar to the ''Bluebook'' trademark. These threats led to the renaming of the guide to ''The Indigo Book'' in March 2016.

== History ==
[[Nagoya University]] Graduate School of Law academic Frank Bennett had wished to include support for the ''[[Bluebook]]''—a widely used system of legal citations, into the [[open source]] citation management software [[Zotero]]. However, lawyers representing the [[Harvard Law Review|Harvard Law Review Association]], who publishes the ''Bluebook,'' asserted that the ''Bluebook''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s inclusion of "carefully curated examples, explanations and other textual materials" made it a [[copyright]]ed work. [[Carl Malamud]], head of the organization [[Public.Resource.Org]], was informed by Bennett about the refusals. [[New York University School of Law]] professor Christopher Jon Sprigman caught wind of Malamud's correspondence; he had argued that the system of citation expressed in the ''Bluebook'' was in the [[public domain]] because its widely mandated use in the court system made it an [[edict of government]],&lt;ref name="harvard-letter"/&gt; going on to state that "in this case, a copyright is being used to keep something private that we all have to use."&lt;ref name="abajournal-bluebookzotero"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal minds differ on whether The Bluebook is subject to copyright protection|url=http://www.abajournal.com/magazine/article/legal_minds_differ_on_whether_the_bluebook_is_subject_to_copyright_protecti|magazine=ABA Journal|accessdate=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[U.S. copyright law]] states that a "[[Idea-expression divide|system]]" is ineligible for copyright protection.&lt;ref name="Post2016" /&gt;

Research conducted by Malamud and Sprigman found that the 10th edition of the ''Bluebook'', published in 1958, had fallen into the public domain because its copyright had not been [[Copyright renewal|renewed]], as required by U.S. law at the time. On October 6, 2014, Sprigman sent a letter of response to the Harvard Law Review Association, disclosing these findings and arguing that the content of the then-current 19th edition was nearly identical to the 10th barring trivial changes. Thus, he also announced an intent to publish a [[free content|free-content]] version of the ''Bluebook'' known as ''Baby Blue'', which would be adapted from the public domain text of the 10th edition with "newly-created material that implements the Bluebook's system of citation in a fully usable form."&lt;ref name="harvard-letter"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sprigman|first1=Christopher Jon|title=HLR letter|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/code/blue/harvard.response.20141006.pdf|accessdate=21 April 2016|date=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leung2016"&gt;{{cite web |first=Peter C. |last=Leung |url=http://www.bna.com/copyright-obstacle-properly-b57982067276/ |title=Intellectual Property Blog: Is Copyright an Obstacle to Properly Cited Justice? |publisher=Bloomberg&amp;nbsp;BNA |date=February 11, 2016 |access-date=March 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213092000/http://www.bna.com/copyright-obstacle-properly-b57982067276/ |archive-date=February 13, 2016 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abajournal-bluebookzotero"/&gt;

Sprigman explained that "every person, including every poor person, should be able to cite the law. Imprisoned litigants, [[Pro se legal representation in the United States|pro se litigants]], legal clinics, small law firms and solo practitioners — all of them need better access to our system of legal citation if the law is to work for them and for their clients. And that means free access."&lt;ref name="Post2016"/&gt; Sprigman also stated that the use of an [[open-source software development|open-source development]] model and licensing would allow others to contribute to and help improve the system; he argued that the ''Bluebook'' in its current form was "over-prescriptive and rigid" and "a barrier to entry to our legal system," going on to ask, "what other standard of this importance to the American public would be entrusted to a group so small, unrepresentative, closed to input, and beyond both supervision and discipline?"&lt;ref name="Post2016"/&gt;

=== Trademark issues ===
[[File:Cover of Baby Blue's Manual of Legal Citation.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The original ''Baby{{nbsp}}Blue'' title was the subject of legal threats due to its similarities to that of ''Bluebook''.]]
In December 2015, following [[Twitter]] postings by Malamud teasing the upcoming release of ''Baby Blue'', the Harvard Law Review Association threatened legal action against the project, as it believed that the name ''Baby Blue'' had a [[confusing similarity]] to the "Bluebook" [[trademark]], and requested a copy of the publication to perform intellectual property examinations under a presumption that it may be substantially similar to the copyrighted work. Sprigman objected to the trademark claims, feeling that "the idea they own the name 'blue' for a manual for legal citations is ridiculous." Following the threats, a group of over 120 [[Yale Law School]] students issued a letter in support of the ''Baby Blue'' project.&lt;ref name="Post2016"&gt;{{cite web |last=Post |first=David G. |author-link=David G.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6270">[[File:St John the Baptist Church - The Layer Monument.jpg|thumb|280px|Marble polychrome monument circa 1600 with Northern Mannerist style figurines.]]
The '''Layer monument''' is an early 17th-century polychrome marble mural monument (320 × 350&amp;nbsp;cm) erected to the memory of the lawyer [[Christopher Layer (merchant)|Christopher Layer]] (1531–1600), and located in the [[Church of Saint John the Baptist, Maddermarket, Norwich]].

==Inscription==
Its inscription is in Latin, and reads in translation:
{{quote|This Urn of cold marble covers Christopher Layer who bore Christ in his heart along with Imperial Minds, [[Numa Pompilius|Numa]] known for his justice, [[Fabius]] for his legal robe, and [[Cato_the_Elder|Cato]] for his strict morals. He had seen thrice twenty and thrice three years when he gave his body to be covered by the earth. He was great in years but greater with much honour, for twice he was Mayor of Norwich. His dearest wife bore him five daughters and three sons when she became a sad relic with a widow's bed. But two sons died and the one who survived his father placed here this tomb. Father died 19 June 1600 Mother died 23 January 1604.}}

==Interpretation==
The monument is notable on two accounts, firstly, its four figurines housed in its two columns, ''Pax'' and ''Gloria'', ''Vanitas'' and ''Labor'', are relatively rare examples of [[Northern Mannerist]] sculpture extant in Britain; secondly, these four figurines exemplify how, during the era of [[Elizabeth I]], Christian iconography occasionally integrated symbolism which originated from the western [[esoteric]] traditions of [[alchemy]] and [[astrology]] into works of art, including funerary monuments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frances |last=Yates |authorlink=Frances Yates |title=The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age |publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1979 |isbn=071000320X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Layer Quaternity ==
[[File:Alchemical air 1606.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"The Philosophers' Stone" from ''Alchemia'' (1606) by [[Andreas Libavius]]]]
The four figurines of [[The Layer Quaternity]] share a number of iconographical details to an illustration found in ''Alchemia'' (1606) by the German academic [[Andreas Libavius]] in a chapter entitled ''De Lapide Philosophorum'' ([[Philosophers' stone|The Philosophers' Stone]]) including - an identical pairing of a lower mortal pair with an immortal pair of bare-legged male and draped female above them, the shared titled captions of ''Gloria'' and ''Labor'', along with both monument and illustration also depicting a palm branch, sun, moon and rotundum.

Symbolically, the Layer Quaternity correspond to the alchemical "deities" of [[Apollo]], [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercurius]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] as named in ''[[Atalanta Fugiens]]'' (1617) by the German alchemist-physician [[Michael Maier]] (Emblem XVII).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. B. |last=Craven |title=Count Michael Maier, Doctor of Philosophy and of Medicine, Alchemist, Rosicrucian, Mystic, 1568–1622: life and writings |origyear=1910 |year=2003 |publisher=Ibis Press |place=Berwick, Me. |isbn=0892540834 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively the Layer Quaternity are a unique alchemical [[mandala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=McLean |authorlink=Adam McLean |title=The Alchemical Mandala: a survey of the mandala in the Western esoteric traditions |publisher=Phanes Press |place=Grand Rapids, MI |year=1989 |isbn=0933999798 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through polarized symbolism they delineate essential coordinates associated with Mandala art, namely Space (Heaven and Earth) and Time (Young and Old). Utilizing variety and multiplicity, key attributes of Northern Mannerist art, they also represent fundamental aspects of the human condition, namely, gender, youth and age, pleasure and suffering. A fifth, uniting symbol, a skull, is located at the very centre of the monument. The skull is the commonest of all ''[[memento mori]]'' symbols in [[funerary art]]. It was also defined as the philosophical vessel (''Vas Philosophorum'') in Renaissance-era alchemy.
 
The role of the Quaternity in religious symbolism is discussed in depth in the writings of the Swiss psychologist [[Carl Gustav Jung]]. In essence, the Layer monument's four figurines represent spiritual entities which agree with Jung's analytical psychology, that the psyche moves toward individuation in fours (made up of pairs of opposites).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C.

[[File:Liebermann, Max - Zwei Reiter am Strand - Gurlitt.jpg|thumb|Version of the painting that was seized by the Nazis in 1938]]
'''''Two Riders on the Beach''''' ({{lang-de|Zwei Reiter am Strand|link=no}}) is the title of two similar paintings by [[Max Liebermann]]. Both were painted in 1901 while Liebermann was on vacation in [[Scheveningen]] on the North Sea. The paintings are considered masterpieces of German [[impressionism]], heavily influenced by the style of French impressionist painters [[Édouard Manet]] and [[Edgar Degas]].

One of the paintings in the 1930s belonged to the collection of Jewish factory owner and art collector David Friedmann in [[Wrocław]], then Breslau, Silesia. It was seized by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] authorities shortly after the anti-Jewish ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' pogrom in 1938 and became a part of the collection of [[Hildebrand Gurlitt]]. After World War II the painting was seized by Allied authorities along with other works from Gurlitt's collection, but was returned to Gurlitt when he convinced the authorities he was the rightful owner. It was contained in the [[2012 Munich artworks discovery]] and was returned to the heirs of Friedmann by German authorities. The painting was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/nazi-looted-painting-from-munich-fetches-1-55-million/ TimesofIsrael: Nazi-looted painting from Munich fetches 1.55 Million]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other painting was part of a private collection in New York City before it was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2009. The new owner was again a private collector. The paintings are very similar; one difference is that the one that was part of Friedmann's collection shows both forelegs of the second horse.

A [[viewshed]] is an area that is visible from a specific location. '''Viewshed analyses''' are a common function of most [[geographic information system]] (GIS) software. The analysis uses the elevation value of each cell of the [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) to determine visibility to or from a particular cell. The location of this particular cell varies depending on the needs of the analysis. 
For example, a viewshed analysis is commonly used to locate communication towers or determining the view from a road. Viewsheds can be calculated using an individual point such as a tower or multiple points such as a line representing a road. When analyzing a line segment, each of the [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] along the line is calculated to determine its visible area. The process can also be reversed. For example, when locating a [[landfill]], the analysis can determine from where the landfill is visible to keep it hidden from view.

== Viewshed analysis process ==
A viewshed analysis can be performed using one of many [[GIS]] programs, such as [[GRASS GIS]] (r.los, r.viewshed), [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadlightspeed LuciadLightspeed], [http://www.luciad.com/solutions/luciadmobile LuciadMobile], [[SAGA GIS]] (Visibility), TNT Mips, [[ArcMap]], [[Maptitude]], [[ERDAS IMAGINE]]. A viewshed is created from a [[digital elevation model|DEM]] by using an algorithm that estimates the difference of elevation from one cell (the viewpoint cell) to the next (the target cell). To determine the visibility of a target cell, each cell between the viewpoint cell and target cell is examined for line of sight. Where cells of higher value are between the viewpoint and target cells the line of sight is blocked. If the line of sight is blocked then the target cell is determined to not be part of the viewshed. If it is not blocked then it is included in the viewshed (Kim et al., 2004).

The algorithm is also based on a given set of variables. When performing a viewshed analysis, several variables can be used to limit or adjust the calculation. For example, if the analysis is to determine the location of a radio tower, the height of the tower could be added to the elevation of that location (cell value). If no height is given, then the viewshed analysis uses the cell value of the DEM in which the tower is located.

Another way to add the height of the tower is to use an offset variable. Offset values can be added to a sending tower as well as a receiving tower. The offset value is then added to the elevation value of the cell to obtain the actual elevation of each tower.

The viewshed analysis can also have a limited viewing angle. The viewing angle, or [[azimuth]], of the radio tower can be incorporated into the calculation by adding two values. The first value is the lowest possible azimuth angle and the second value is the highest possible azimuth angle. The program will analyze the viewshed only within these given azimuth angles. 
A vertical angle can be added as well. The values for vertical angle are from 90° (looking straight up) to -90° (looking straight down). This variable would need to be added in cases where the radio tower emits a very narrow vertical beam.
The final variable used in the viewshed analysis is the radius value. In the case of the radio tower, if the radio signal has a limited range, perhaps 10 miles, then the radius variable can be set to limit the viewshed analysis to a 10-mile radius.

== Viewshed analysis uses ==
Besides tower placement a viewshed analysis can be used for other applications. For example, a viewshed analysis could estimate the impact of the addition of a large building. The viewshed analysis would show all the areas from which the building could be seen as well as any views that would be obscured from any particular location. Viewshed analyses are also used to locate [[fire lookout tower|fire observation stations]] in mountain areas (Lee and Stucky, 1998). This allows the stations to be placed so that the entire forest can be observed for possible fires.

An example of using a viewshed analysis on a line segment is from the [[Wyoming]] State Office, [[Bureau of Land Management]], in which the office used a viewshed analysis to determine the visibility from [[National Historic Trail]]s across Wyoming. Within the Rock Springs Field Office area there are five different viewsheds to choose from. The example here is viewshed number one. The viewshed indicates the land areas visible from the trails at four different levels from not visible to visible, based on the number of times the area could be seen from the trail. This is an indication of what the pioneers could see as they traveled along the trails of the western frontier (Rock Springs Field Office).

== A unique viewshed analysis ==
[[File:mars viewshed.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gusev (Martian crater)|Gusev crater]] on Mars: the viewshed (red) is overlaid on an elevation map]]
In another example the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) used a viewshed analysis to assist [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) project. When NASA needed to find appropriate landing spots for the [[Mars]] rovers, they turned to the USGS to map the best possible sites. Part of the analysis included a viewshed of the possible site selections. In this case the viewshed indicates the areas which may or may not be visible by the Mars rovers from each landing site (MER Landing Site Viewshed Analysis).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8822">The '''World Architecture Survey''' was conducted in 2010 by ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', to determine the most important works of [[contemporary architecture]]. 52 leading architects, teachers, and critics, including several [[Pritzker Prize]] winners and deans of major architecture schools were asked for their opinion.

The survey asked two questions:&lt;ref name="VF Results"&gt;{{cite news |title=Vanity Fair’s World Architecture Survey: the Complete Results |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-list-201008 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=30 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108161337/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-list-201008 |archivedate=November 8, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#What are the five most important buildings, bridges, or monuments constructed since 1980?
#What is the greatest work of architecture thus far in the 21st century?

While the range of responses was very broad, more than half of the experts surveyed named the [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]] by [[Frank Gehry]] as one of the most important works since 1980.  The [[Beijing National Stadium]] (Bird’s Nest stadium) in [[Beijing]] by [[Herzog and de Meuron]] was the building most often cited, by seven respondents, as the most significant structure of the 21st century so far.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-slideshow-201008?currentPage=13 Architecture’s Modern Marvels]&lt;/ref&gt; Counted by architect, works by Frank Gehry received the most votes, followed by those of [[Rem Koolhaas]]. The result of the survey led ''Vanity Fair'' to label Gehry as "the most important architect of our age".&lt;ref name="VF Tyrnauer 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrnauer|first=Matt|title=Architecture in the Age of Gehry|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2010/08/architecture-survey-201008?currentPage=all|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Writing for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Blair Kamin criticized the "self-aggrandizing" survey for not including any [[green buildings]].&lt;ref name="Kamin 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamin|first=Blair|title=The blind spot in Vanity Fair's world architecture survey: green design |url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/theskyline/2010/07/the-blind-spot-in-vanity-fairs-world-architecture-survey.html|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=July 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Lance Hosey]] of ''Architect'' magazine conducted an alternate survey of leading green building experts and found that no buildings appeared on both lists, suggesting that standards of "good design" and "green design" are misaligned.&lt;ref name="Hosey 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hosey|first=Lance|title=The G List |url=http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/the-g-list_o|accessdate=28 July 2010|magazine=Architect|date=July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators also noted that several of the architects surveyed (but not Gehry)&lt;ref name="Culture Monster"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ng|first=David|title=Frank Gehry's Bilbao museum tops Vanity Fair architecture list|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2010/06/frank-gehrys-bilbao-museum-tops-vanity-fair-architecture-list.html|work=[[Culture Monster]]|publisher=[[LA Times]]|accessdate=22 July 2010|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "perhaps took the magazine’s title a little too seriously" and voted for their own buildings.&lt;ref name="Winston 2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Winston|first=Anna|title=Vanity Fair reveals vanity voting behind list of best modern buildings|url=http://www.bdonline.co.uk/vanity-fair-reveals-vanity-voting-behind-list-of-best-modern-buildings/5002211.blog|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Building Design (newspaper)|Building Design]]|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glick Kudler  2010"&gt;{{cite news|last=Glick Kudler |first=Adrian|title=Bilbao Wins, But Which Architects Nominated Themselves to Vanity Fair List?|url=http://la.curbed.com/archives/2010/06/bilbao_wins_but_which_architects_nominated_themselves_to_vanity_fair_list.php|accessdate=22 July 2010|newspaper=[[Curbed (blog)|Curbed]]|date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Fantasy Award]]s are given each year by the [[World Fantasy Convention]] for the best [[fantasy literature|fantasy fiction]] and [[Fantastic art|art]] published during the preceding calendar year. The awards have been described by sources such as ''[[The Guardian]]'' as a "prestigious fantasy prize",&lt;ref name="AwardBust"/&gt; and one of the three most renowned [[speculative fiction]] awards, along with the [[Hugo Award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula Award]]s (which cover both fantasy and [[science fiction]]).&lt;ref name="STARquote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CHICquote"/&gt; The '''World Fantasy Award—Artist''' is given each year to artists of works related to fantasy released in the preceding calendar year. Fantasy artists are also eligible for the [[World Fantasy Special Award—Professional|Special Award—Professional]] category. The Artist category has been awarded annually since 1975.&lt;ref name="Locusrules"/&gt;

World Fantasy Award nominees and winners are decided by attendees and judges at the annual World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees of the current and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner.&lt;ref name="Locusrules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WFArules"/&gt; The panel of judges is typically made up of fantasy authors&lt;ref name="TORstats"/&gt; and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties.&lt;ref name="Locusrules"/&gt; The final results are presented at the World Fantasy Convention at the end of October.&lt;ref name="WFArules"/&gt; Winners were presented with a statue in the form of a bust of [[H.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Lovecraft]] through the 2015 awards; more recent winners receive a statuette of a tree.&lt;ref name="AwardBust2"/&gt;

During the 44 nomination years, 91 artists have been nominated; 38 of them have won, including ties. Three artists have won three times: [[Shaun Tan]], out of four nominations; [[Charles Vess]], out of five; and [[Michael Whelan]], out of nine. Four other artists have won twice: [[Thomas Canty]], out of nine nominations; [[Lee Brown Coye]], both times he was nominated; [[Edward Gorey]], out of four; and J.&amp;nbsp;K.&amp;nbsp;Potter, out of ten. No other artists have won more than once. Potter and [[John Picacio]] have received the most nominations at ten, followed by Canty, [[Don Maitz]], and Whelan at nine each. [[Stephen Fabian]] and [[John Jude Palencar]] are tied at eight for the most nominations without winning.
