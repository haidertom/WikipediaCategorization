The '''Agris Helmet ''' ({{lang-fr|'''Casque d'Agris'''}}) is a ceremonial [[Celts|Celtic]] helmet from {{circa|350}}&amp;nbsp;BC that was found in a cave near [[Agris]], Charente, France, in 1981.
It is a masterpiece of [[Celtic art]], and would probably have been used for display rather than worn in battle.
The helmet consists of an iron cap completely covered with bands of bronze.
The bronze is in turn covered with unusually pure gold leaf, with embedded coral decorations attached using silver rivets.
One of the cheek guards was also found and has similar materials and designs.
The helmet is mostly decorated in early Celtic patterns but there are later Celtic motifs and signs of Etruscan or Greek influence.
The quality of the gold indicates that the helmet may well have been made locally in the Atlantic region.

==Discovery==

The Agris helmet was found in a cave near [[Angoulême]] in 1981.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The Perrats cave had been known for just over a week when [[caver]]s found two contiguous parts of the front of the helmet on 9–10 May 1981.
The fragments were on a cone of debris thrown out from a badger burrow in the cave's main chamber.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
An excavation team was quickly formed to search the site. They found scraps of gold leaf, two fragments that joined to form a larger triangular piece, and then the helmet itself, which was well-preserved other than the part that had been torn off by the badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

The site shows signs of having been occupied from the [[Bronze Age]] through the [[Iron Age]], the Gallo-Roman period and into the [[Middle Ages]].
The entrance collapsed and closed the cave in the 13th or 14th century AD.{{sfn|Gomez|1983|p=196}}
At the time of discovery almost all the parts of the helmet had been disturbed by burrowing animals.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
In 1983, the cheek guard and three fragments of ornamentation from the side of the helmet were discovered during excavations.
Other fragments were found in 1986, including the base of the helmet's crest, several meters from where the helmet had been found.
They seem to have been carried there accidentally, either by people or by badgers.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The second cheek guard and the ornamentation of the summit of the helmet have not been found.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}

The government bought the found objects from the proprietor of the land.
The helmet was restored by Laszlo von Lehóczky at the [[Romano-Germanic Central Museum (Mainz)]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It is now held by the ''[[Musée d'Angoulême]]'' in [[Angoulême]], France.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}{{efn|It is sometimes reported that the helmet was given to the Archaeological and Historical Society of the Charente. This is incorrect.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}} }}
The helmet is considered one of the masterpieces of Celtic art and has been featured in several international exhibitions.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
It has even formed the basis for a graphic novel, ''Le casque d'Agris'' (2005).{{sfn|Luccisano|2005}}

==Context==
{{Location map|France|caption=Location of [[Agris]] to the west of the [[Massif Central]] in France|relief=y|lat_deg= 45.7755|lon_deg=0.3358}}
Excavations in 2002 show that the cave entrance was guarded by a mud wall and a ditch, and would have been a sanctuary until the early [[Roman Empire]].
The helmet is isolated, with no sign of a human burial, and was buried deliberately.
At the time of burial at least some of the external ornaments had been broken off and placed in the interior of the helmet.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=56}}
The helmet had been carefully placed.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The archaeologists who found it think it may have been buried as part of a ritual to the underworld spirits.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Roman sources say that the Celtic warriors generally did not wear helmets.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The helmet would have been used for display, and would have indicated the high rank of the owner, or their wish to obtain such a rank.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=376}}

The helmet dates from the early period of the [[La Tène culture]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The gold leaf is extremely pure, and the helmet may be one of the oldest refined gold objects of Western Europe.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
It was found further west than most other examples of high-status La Tène metalwork.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
A few similar objects have been found in France at [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] (Normandy), [[Saint-Jean-Trolimon]] (Brittany) and Montlaurès near [[Narbonne]] (Aude) and in Italy at [[Canosa di Puglia|Canosa (Puglia)]].{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}

The design of the inner iron cap is similar to that of a series of helmets that have mostly been found in the Central Alps.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The veneer of bronze strips recalls Italian helmets of the [[Montefortino]] type.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The [[palmette]]-based design links it to the early style of the La Tène culture.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
Most of the motifs in the decoration belong to the first western style of the culture, or are closely derived from this style.
Other motifs are from an intermediate stage with the [[Waldalgesheim style]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

Authorities differ on the date of the helmet.
In a 2001 paper José Gomez De Soto suggests the middle or the second half of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
D. W. Harding says the stratigraphic association of the helmet with a Dux-type ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibula]]'' from La Tène B and other signs indicate that it was made in the later part of the 4th century.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
However, in a 2010 paper Gomez de Soto and Stephane Verger conclude that the decorations, when viewed as a whole, indicate that the helmet was made in the 2nd quarter or the middle of the 4th century.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Structure==
[[File:Casque d'Agris, musée d'Angoulême, Lamiot 2015 01.JPG|thumb|View of the helmet showing the neck guard (lower left) and cheek protector (lower center)]]
The helmet has been described as having a jockey-cap shape, but the "bill" of the cap is actually a neck-guard.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=75}}
It is {{convert|21.4|cm}} high and {{convert|23|by|19|cm}} laterally.{{sfn|Eluère|1984|p=110}}
The inner cap of the helmet is of iron, now heavily corroded.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
It is made of a single piece of hammered iron, with the neck guard riveted to the back.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The iron is entirely covered by ornamental bronze bands with low-relief decoration formed partly by [[casting]] and partly by [[repoussé and chasing]].{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The four wide horizontal strips of bronze are fully covered with gold leaf on the outside surface.
The decorations include embedded [[cabochon]]s of shaped and polished [[Precious coral|coral]].{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}

All the relief decorations were formed on the bronze strips before the [[gold leaf]] was applied.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=9}}
The gold leaf, about 70 microns thick, was affixed by pressing it closely onto the bronze relief with a tool that may have been made of wood or bone.
The gold leaf would have been held in place by the grooves and imitation [[filigree]] in the bronze.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=10}}
The coral cabochons were attached to the bronze by silver rivets whose heads are decorated with motifs such as diamonds or palm leaves.{{efn|The rivets are made of an alloy with at least 80% silver, 20% gold and almost 1% copper. This would have been relatively easy to work, but stronger than pure gold or silver.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}} }}{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=12}}
Sometimes the hollow that holds the coral was at least partially gold-covered before the coral was placed.
Gold leaf was then applied generously around the coral to form a small cup.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=11}}

There is a finely wrought cheek-piece.{{sfn|Green|2012|p=43}}
The cheek guard (''paragnathide'') and the side and top ornaments used the same materials and techniques as the main helmet.
There are signs that organic materials such as wood and leather were also used.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Decoration==

The helmet is particularly richly ornamented.{{sfn|Koch|Minard|2012|p=423}}
The main theme is a series of palmettes, with many of the palmettes and studs infilled with coral.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
The ornamentation is arranged into three superimposed bands completely covered by compositions inspired by plants.
The many different patterns combined into complex compositions make the headpiece one of the richest of ancient Celtic artworks.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

In the lower and upper panels a series of unconnected palmettes are arranged formally in friezes.
The central panel decorations are based on a formal arrangement of S-curves terminating in swelling leaves, with a  filler pattern that includes palmettes, comma-leaves and over-and-under tendrils.
The neck-guard has a less formal and more fluid pattern.
The cheek guard has a palmette design in which may be seen a curled serpent that appears to be horned.
Horned serpents are often found in Romano-Celtic works in Britain and France, but very rarely in early La Tène.
The depiction on the helmet may have some special significance.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}

The decoration mainly reflects the 5th century Early Style of Celtic Art, but some motifs are characteristic of the Waldalgesheim style of the 4th century,{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}
The central panel designs show similarities to the [[Waldalgesheim]] bracelets.{{sfn|Harding|2007|p=76}}
This indicates that the helmet was made in the first half of the 4th century.
The large palmettes with seven petals in the lower band and the main frieze in the central band may have been inspired by architectural [[terracotta]] from [[Tyrrhenians|Tyrrhenian]] central Italy in the 5th and 4th centuries.
The neck guard combines Waldalgesheim style with elements of 4th century Greek or Etruscan work.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=57}}

==Origin==
[[File:Casque d'Amfreville Eure.jpg|thumb|The Amfreville helmet, another Celtic prestige helmet from the Atlantic region.]]
Three main regions of the Celtic world have been proposed as the origin of the helmet. The first is the northern or central Adriatic region of Italy.
Some think the new plant-style compositions were developed by Celtic craftsmen who settled in Italy and were influenced by Etruscan or Greek craftsmen with whom they had direct contact.
The complexity of the montage and decoration may be explained by proximity to advanced metalworking centers such as those of [[Taranto]] or [[Campania]].
The objection is that all Celtic helmets from the period found in Italy were in one piece.
Those with riveted neck guards have all been found in the Alps, the regions north of the Alps or the Atlantic region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The second proposed region of origin is the North Alpine area that formed the ancient center of Celtic culture.
The materials and techniques, and the general composition and decoration, seem to place the work among the best 5th century Celtic works from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
The conical shape of the top of the helmet seems to be derived from Celtic helmets from the start of the second Iron Age.
Where these were decorated, the decorations were in superimposed bands.
Some details of the plant ornamentation are very similar to small Celtic ornaments from Austria, the Alpine regions and western Switzerland.
This is the area where helmets with riveted neck guards are found most often.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

The third possibility is that the helmet was made in the area where it was found.
It is one of a small set of prestige helmets that were mostly found in western France, the most famous being the completely decorated helmet of [[Amfreville-sous-les-Monts]] in the Eure.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}
All were made of an iron or bronze cap covered with bands of another metal that were completely decorated.
They have red ornaments, mostly coral.
Riveted neck pieces are also found in this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=58}}

Gold samples from various parts of the helmet are exceptionally pure, typically 99% gold, 0.5% silver and 0.2% copper.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
This degree of purity is very unusual in the ancient world.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Analysis of Greek and Etruscan objects of the period shows much higher silver content.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
Most ancient objects with this degree of purity have been found to the southwest of the [[Loire]], the region that includes Agris.{{sfn|Éluère|Gomez de Soto|Duval|1987|p=18}}
The only comparable objects are 3rd century Celtic jewelry from this region.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}
Probably the helmet was made in the West by craftsmen trained in the North Alpine School.{{sfn|Gomez de Soto|2001|p=213}}
The gold may well have come from mines in the west of the [[Massif Central]], which had been in operation since at least the 5th century BC.
Other high-quality works of Celtic art have been found in the Western region, so a local provenance is entirely possible.{{sfn|Gomez De Soto|Verger|2010|p=59}}

The '''horse paradox''' is a [[falsidical paradox]] that arises from flawed demonstrations, which purport to use [[mathematical induction]], of the statement ''All [[horse]]s are the same color''.  There is no actual contradiction, as these arguments have a crucial flaw that makes them incorrect. This example was originally raised by [[George Pólya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pólya |first=George |authorlink=George Pólya |date=1954 |title=Induction and Analogy in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was also used by Joel E. Cohen as an example of the subtle errors that can occur in attempts to prove statements by induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the nature of mathematical proof|first=Joel E.|last=Cohen|year=1961|journal=Opus}}. Reprinted in ''A Random Walk in Science'' (R. L. Weber, ed.), Crane, Russak &amp; Co., 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The argument ==
The argument is [[proof by induction]]. First we establish a base case for one horse (&lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;). We then prove that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses have the same color, then &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses must also have the same color.

===Base case: One horse===
The case with just one horse is trivial. If there is only one horse in the "group", then clearly all horses in that group have the same color.

===Inductive step===
Assume that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses always are the same color. Let us consider a group consisting of &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses.

First, exclude the last horse and look only at the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses; all these are the same color since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses always are the same color. Likewise, exclude the first horse and look only at the last &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses. By the same reasoning, these too, must also be of the same color. Therefore, the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle, who in turn are of the same color as the last horse. Hence the first horse, middle horses, and last horse are all of the same color, and we have proven that:
*If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses have the same color, then &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses will also have the same color.

Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction,  in any group of horses, all horses must be the same color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/30002.8.shtml|title=All Horses are the Same Color|publisher=Harvey Mudd College Department of Mathematics|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The argument above makes the implicit assumption that the two [[subset]]s of horses to which the induction assumption is applied have a common element. This is not true when the original set (prior to either removal) only contains two horses.

Let the two horses be horse A and horse B. When horse A is removed, it is true that the remaining horses in the set are the same color (only horse B remains). The same is true when horse B is removed. However the statement "the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle" is meaningless, because there are no "horses in the middle" (common elements (horses) in the two sets). Therefore the above proof has a logical link broken. The proof forms a [[falsidical paradox]]; it seems to show by valid reasoning something that is manifestly false, but in fact the reasoning is flawed.

'''''An Amateur Concert''''' is an oil painting on canvas by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] painter [[Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro]] of 1882.

== Description ==
The painting measures 220 cm and 300 cm wide. It is in the collection of the [[Chiado Museum]] in [[Lisbon]].&lt;ref name="matriz"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.matriznet.dgpc.pt/MatrizNet/Objectos/ObjectosConsultar.aspx?IdReg=200758|title=MatrizNet|website=www.matriznet.dgpc.pt|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five people are singing and playing in the dark: Maria Augusta Bordalo Pinheiro, the artist's sister, in a white satin dress; next to her, the painter [[Adolfo Greno]] in right profile; then an Italian singer in a dark suit; in the background Josefa Greno, in a three-quarters view, looking down; and on the far right another painter, [[Artur Loureiro]], at the piano.&lt;ref name="matriz" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
The large painting was presented at the 1882 [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] under the title ''Soirée chez lui''. The oval composition shows the social circle. It is friendship that unites them both in painting and music, though a shadowy unknown figure next to the piano is watching. In France it was not received well, and in Portugal there was controversy about the abstract and vague figures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/2063606/POR_280_005.html|title=Concerto de Amadores|website=www.europeana.eu|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Art Museum of Estonia]] Friends of Art Society''' was founded in 2007 with the intention to contribute in the improvement of art in Estonia and to popularize art within the Estonian nation, to introduce Estonian art abroad and also to support the organizing of the exhibitions of the Estonian Art Museum abroad. The goals of the Society are also improving the activity of the Estonian Art Museum, collocating open-minded friends of culture who are interested in contributing in the growth of the collections of the Estonian Art Museum, and also developing and supporting the library of the Estonian Art Museum.

Next to the Art Museum of Estonia Friends of Art Society operates the Board of Art Patrons which is an important financial supporter of the Art Museum of Estonia Friends of Art Society, as the members of the Board are paying higher membership fee.

==Members of the Board of the Friends of Art Society==
The members of the Board of the Art museum of Estonia Friends of Art Society are [[Enn Kunila]] (Chairman of the Board), Märt Haamer, Sirje Helme, Kai-Riin Meri, Tarmo Saaret ja Kersti Tiik.

==Artwork donations ==
The Art Museum of Estonia Friends of Art Society has helped the Estonian Art Museum to complement its collection, purchasing important artwork for the museum.

===[[Postal stationery]]===
In 2008 [[KUMU (museum)|Kumu Art Museum]] was awarded with the European Art Museum title and to celebrate the award, the Society in collaboration with [[Eesti Post]] published the postal stationery depicting the reproduction of the painting „Maastik punase pilvega“ ("Landscape With A Red Cloud“) by Konrad Mägi, the master of the Estonian classic art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klassikaraadio.err.ee/uudised?news=2257 „Kumus esitletakse täna erikujundusega postkaarti ja postmarki“] Klassikaraadio, 10. detsember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
„Maastik punase pilvega” (“Landscape With A Red Cloud“) is the only artwork by an Estonian author that the experts of art have chosen to the chrestomathy “1001 Paintings You Must See Before You Die”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klassikaraadio.err.ee/uudised?news=2257 „Kumus esitletakse täna erikujundusega postkaarti ja postmarki“] Klassikaraadio, 10. detsember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to publishing the postal stationery, the Society gave booklets both in Estonian and English of the oil painting "Maastik punase pilvega" ("Landscape With A Red Cloud") by [[Konrad Mägi]] to [[KUMU (museum)|Kumu Art Museum]] as a gift for handing out for free. The gift also included the passport of the painting and a chrestomathy, compiled by art scientists, which includes the full history of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://klassikaraadio.err.ee/uudised?news=2257 „Kumus esitletakse täna erikujundusega postkaarti ja postmarki“] Klassikaraadio, 10. detsember 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supporting Art Museum of Estonia==
In addition to the art donations and postage stamp series of the Gold Foundation of the Art Museum the Society has also financially supported the Art Museum in publishing catalogues of its exhibitions.

Catalogues published with the support of the Society:
*In 2011 ─ catalogues of the exhibition „Vinum et panis. Veini ja leiva motiiv 16.-20. sajandi kunstis“  („Vinum et panis. Motifs of Wine and Bread in the Art of the 16th─20th century)&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuhuminna.tallinn.ee/Sundmused/vinum-et-panis-veini-ja-leiva-motiiv-1620-sajandi-kunstis?facet&amp;#91;&amp;#93;=137131 „Vinum et panis. Veini ja leiva motiiv 16.–20. sajandi kunstis“] Kuhuminna.ee, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*In 2012 ─ „Kollektsionääri kirg. Hõbe ja graafika Reinansi kogust“ (“The Passion of A Art Collector. Silver and Graphics in the Collection of Reinans”).

On the request of the Art Museum of Estonia the Society also supported the organizing of the exhibition „[[John Constable]]. Victoria &amp; Alberti muuseumi kogudest“ (“John Constable. From the Collections of Victoria and Albert Museum”).

== Work ==

Eagle began in 1954 to paint plants in order to assist with learning their botanical names. By 1968 she started planning a book with examples of every [[genus]] of tree and shrub in New Zealand. In 1975, after more than twenty years of work, ''Eagle's Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand in Colour'' was published.  The book contained illustrations of 228 [[species]], reproduced in life-size, with meticulous notes on identification, distribution and the source of the illustrated material. In 1982, she published a second book, illustrating a further 405 species and varieties. Both books were revised in 1986 to bring the [[nomenclature]] up to date. However, as a result of botanical research, a further revision was necessary. In 2006 [[Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa|Te Papa Press]] published the two-volume edition incorporating all of Eagle's previous illustrations, together with a further 173 new paintings, under the title ''Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand''.&lt;ref name="Te Papa 2013" /&gt;

==Awards==
Eagle was made a Companion of the [[New Zealand Order of Merit]] in the [[2001 Birthday Honours|2001 Queen's Birthday Honours]] for services to botanical art. In 2007 the 2006 two-volume edition of ''Eagle's Complete Trees and Shrubs of New Zealand'' earned her the [[New Zealand Post Book Awards|Montana Medal]] for Non-Fiction and the Booksellers Choice award.  The [[University of Otago]] conferred an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the University of Otago|honorary doctor]] of science degree on her in [[Dunedin]] at a graduation ceremony on 4 May 2013.&lt;ref name="Otago 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gibb|first1=John|title='Bit overwhelmed' by honorary doctorate|url=http://www.odt.co.nz/campus/university-otago/255469/bit-overwhelmed-honorary-doctorate|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=Otago Daily Times|date=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Page 259 of Fairy tales and stories (Andersen, Tegner).png|right|thumb|175px|1900 illustration by Hans Tegner]]
'''"Blockhead Hans"''' (Danish: ''Klods-Hans'') is a literary fairy tale by [[Hans Christian Andersen]].
It was first published in Danish in 1855&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klods-Hans|url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=119|website=The Hans Christian Andersen Centre|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An early English translation appeared in [[Andrew Lang]]'s 1894 ''[[The Yellow Fairy Book]]'', although Lang gave no source for the tale.
The tale has been variously translated as "Clumsy Hans"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hersholt (Translator)|first1=Jean|title=The Complete Andersen|date=1949|publisher=The Limited Editions Club|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "Silly Hans" and "Jack the Dullard".
It is number 119 in the Hans Christian Andersen's register of Andersen's literary works.

== Story ==

The two educated sons of an old [[squire]] wanted to marry the princess, who said that she would marry the man who chose his words best. They studied hard to speak well to the princess, and their father gave them each a horse to ride to the King's hall. A third son (of a lesser mind) called Blockhead-Hans wanted to win the princess as well, but his father would not give him a horse, so he rode a goat, instead.

On the way to the King's hall, Blockhead-Hans picked up gifts to give to the princess: a dead crow, an old wooden shoe without the top, and mud. At the King's throne, three reporters and an editor stood by each window. They were writing down what words each suitor said, to publish later. The fireplace was very hot, as each suitor was failed before the princess. Both brothers stammered and failed to impress the princess with their words. Blockhead-Hans rode his goat into the royal hall, and remarked about the heat. The princess replied that she was roasting young roosters, meaning the suitors. "That's good!" replied Blockhead-Hans; "then can I roast a crow with them," taking out the dead crow. The Princess approved and asked Blockhead if he also had something to cook it in. He produced the shoe, calling it "a cooking implement with tin rings," and placed the dead crow in it. The princess approved and asked where the soup was. Blockhead-Hans poured mud on the crow. She liked him and decided to marry him. The princess told him that the reporters were writing down everything he said to be published. Blockhead said, "Then I will give the editor my best," and threw mud in the editor's face. Blockhead-Hans went on to marry the princess and later became king.

==History==
[[File:Pano Plazo Botero.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Plaza Botero is a popular tourist site for taking pictures.]]
Throughout his career, Fernando Botero has donated several artworks to museums in [[Bogotá]] and his hometown of Medellín. In 2000, Botero donated 123 pieces of his work and 85 pieces from his personal collection to a museum in Bogota. This included works from other artists, including works by [[Chagall]], [[Picasso]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], and the French impressionists.&lt;ref name="LaRosaMejía2012" /&gt; He also donated 119 pieces to the Museum of Antioquia.&lt;ref name="Caputo"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lorrain Caputo|title=VIVA Colombia Adventure Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c16G3Z9EtgcC&amp;pg=PT624|publisher=Viva Publishing Network|isbn=978-1-937157-05-0|pages=624–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four more of his sculptures can be found in Medellín's [[Berrío Park]] and San Antonio Plaza.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Sculptures==
[[File:Alumbrado 2011 - Plaza Botero-01.jpg|220px|thumbnail|right|The plaza illuminated during the [[Christmas lights in Medellín|Christmas season]] ''(2011)'']]
The sculptures are all made out of bronze. Many of them were previously housed in museums of Paris, New York, and Madrid. The sculptures tend to have simple names, such as "The Hand", "Eve", "Maternity", "Man on horseback", and "Roman Soldier" to name a few. The "Botero legend" suggests that rubbing the statues brings love and good fortune.&lt;ref name="Michelin2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michelin|title=Colombia Green Guide Michelin 2012-2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mPUPB37Ifl8C&amp;pg=PT286|date=1 March 2011|publisher=MICHELIN|isbn=978-2-06-718208-0|pages=286–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3554">[[File:Floor-stone 02.JPG|thumb|Cement tiles, end of 19th century]]
'''Cement tiles''' or '''hydraulic tiles''' are handmade colourful tiles used as floor and wall tiling. They appeared in [[Catalonia]] in the 1850s, and have been widely used in Europe and America. They represented a revolution in flooring in their day because they were much cheaper, more durable and easier to make than the previous handmade glazed ceramic tiles and were therefore more universally available for houses, and they allowed for profuse decorative patterns, their age of splendour being the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th centuries, before they were gradually superseded by newer technology as of the 1960s, such as terrazzo, salt-glazed stoneware, etc. that didn't allow for such decorative embellishment but were cheaper.

They are mostly known throughout the world as [[encaustic cement tile]]. Like their predecessors, encaustic clay tiles, they derive their name from the term "encaustic" which is an art term used for metal enameling that uses a type of lost wax procedure. They have this name because of the intricate patterns and designs that mimic the encaustic enameling process. Cement tiles are not fired; there is no glaze layer on the surface of the tile. They derive their durability from the combination of finely dehydrated ground [[Portland cement]] layer and a more coarse layer of sand and cement. The pigment layer is hydraulically pressed into the surface and becomes a part of the tile.

==History==
Cement tile appeared in the 1850s in Catalonia. They were exhibited in the Paris (France) [[International Exposition (1867)|International Exposition]] of 1867 by the Catalan company ''Garret &amp; Rivet''.

In the United States, several sources say the first tiles were made near the country's first [[Portland cement]] plant. Around the turn of the 20th century, the tiles were very popular and were considered a high-end floor covering. It was used in thousands of landmark public buildings and palaces. Their popularity began to wane in the 1920s, but spread again in the 40s primarily in California and Florida.

==Manufacture and quality==
[[File:Moule à carreau.jpg|thumb|Cement tile mold, France, 1920]]
Cement tiles are made by hand, one at a time, using mineral pigments, cement, a mold, and an hydraulic press. The metal mold is handmade following specific design drawings. The pigment composition is a mixture of high quality white Portland cement, marble powder, fine sand, and natural mineral colour pigments. Cement tiles being handmade are expected to have slight imperfections, which give them character and depth.

There are numerous cement tile manufacturers worldwide. The primary difference between manufacturers is the hydraulic method used. Small companies employ a hand-operated hydraulic press; the quality of the tiles varies due to inconsistent pressure.  Larger manufacturers use electric-powered hydraulic presses that produce a consistently higher quality product. The higher pressure (1,500 PSI) permits a thicker pigment layer to be embedded into the cement layer. The pigment layer is usually 3–4&amp;nbsp;mm thick.

Another difference is the quality of the pigments used. High quality producers use mineral-based pigments only. Non-mineral based pigments fade with age.

'''Color (or colour) photography''' is [[photography]] that uses media capable of reproducing [[color]]s. By contrast, [[black-and-white]] (monochrome) photography records only a single channel of [[luminance]] (brightness) and uses media capable only of showing shades of gray.

In color photography, electronic sensors or light-sensitive chemicals record color information at the time of [[Photographic exposure|exposure]]. This is usually done by analyzing the spectrum of colors into three channels of information, one dominated by red, another by green and the third by blue, in imitation of the way the normal human eye senses color. The recorded information is then used to reproduce the original colors by mixing various proportions of red, green and blue light ([[RGB color]], used by video displays, digital projectors and some historical photographic processes), or by using dyes or pigments to remove various proportions of the red, green and blue which are present in white [[light]] ([[CMYK color model|CMY color]], used for prints on paper and transparencies on film).

Monochrome images which have been "[[Film colorization|colorized]]" by tinting selected areas by hand or mechanically or with the aid of a computer are "colored photographs", not "color photographs". Their colors are not dependent on the actual colors of the objects photographed and may be very inaccurate or completely arbitrary.

The foundation of virtually all practical color processes, the three-color method was first suggested in an 1855 paper by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]], with the first color photograph produced by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]] for a Maxwell lecture in 1861.&lt;ref name="1861 Maxwell"&gt;{{cite news|title=1861: James Clerk Maxwell's greatest year|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/newsevents/news/newsrecords/2011/04Apr/JamesClerkMaxwell.aspx|publisher=King's College London|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell"/&gt;  Color photography has been the dominant form of photography since the 1970s, with monochrome photography mostly relegated to niche markets such as art photography.

==History==

===Early experiments===
Colour photography was attempted beginning in the 1840s. Early experiments were directed at finding a "chameleon substance" which would assume the colour of the light falling on it. Some encouraging early results, typically obtained by projecting a solar [[spectrum]] directly onto the sensitive surface, seemed to promise eventual success, but the comparatively dim image formed in a camera required exposures lasting for hours or even days. The quality and range of the colour was sometimes severely limited mainly to primary colours, as in the chemically complicated "Hillotype" process invented by American [[Daguerreotype|daguerreotypist]] [[Levi Hill]] around 1850. Other experimenters, such as [[A. E. Becquerel|Edmond Becquerel]], achieved better results but could find no way to prevent the colours from quickly fading when the images were exposed to light for viewing. Over the following several decades, renewed experiments along these lines periodically raised hopes and then dashed them, yielding nothing of practical value.

===An entirely different approach to color===
[[Gabriel Lippmann]] is remembered as the inventor of a method for reproducing colors by photography, based on the interference phenomenon, which earned him the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for 1908.&lt;ref name="From Nobel Lectures 1921"&gt;From Nobel Lectures, Physics 1901–1921, Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Lippmann's interest had turned to a method of fixing the colors of the solar spectrum on a photographic plate. On 2 February 1891, he announced to the Academy of Sciences: "I have succeeded in obtaining the image of the spectrum with its colors on a photographic plate whereby the image remains fixed and can remain in daylight without deterioration." By April 1892, he was able to report that he had succeeded in producing color images of a stained glass window, a group of flags, a bowl of oranges topped by a red poppy and a multicolored parrot. He presented his theory of color photography using the interference method in two papers to the academy, one in 1894, the other in 1906.&lt;ref name="Bintz"&gt;[http://massard.info/pdf/lippmann_livre.pdf Jacques Bintz, "Gabriel Lippmann 1845–1921"], in ''Gabriel Lippmann: Commémoration par la section des sciences naturelles, physiques et mathématiques de l’Institut grand-ducal de Luxembourg du 150e anniversaire du savant né au Luxembourg, lauréat du prix Nobel en 1908'' (Luxembourg: Section des sciences naturelles, physiques et mathématiques de l’Institut grand-ducal de Luxembourg en collaboration avec le Séminaire de mathématique et le Séminaire d’histoire des sciences et de la médecine du centre universitaire de Luxembourg, 1997), ''Jean-Paul Pier &amp; Jos. A. Massard: éditeurs'', Luxembourg 1997. Retrieved 4 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three-color processes===
The three-color method, which is the foundation of virtually all practical color processes whether chemical or electronic, was first suggested in an 1855 paper on [[color vision]] by Scottish physicist [[James Clerk Maxwell]].&lt;ref name="1861 Maxwell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{cite news|title=From Charles Mackintosh's waterproof to Dolly the sheep: 43 innovations Scotland has given the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/charles-mackintosh-chemist-waterproof-google-doodle-scotland-inventions-innovation-bicycles-a7499911.html|publisher=The independent|date=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is based on the [[Young-Helmholtz theory]] that the normal human eye sees color because its inner surface is covered with millions of intermingled [[cone cell]]s of three types: in theory, one type is most sensitive to the end of the [[spectrum]] we call "red", another is more sensitive to the middle or "green" region, and a third which is most strongly stimulated by "blue". The named colors are somewhat arbitrary divisions imposed on the continuous spectrum of visible light, and the theory is not an entirely accurate description of cone sensitivity. But the simple description of these three colors coincides enough with the sensations experienced by the eye that when these three colors are used the three cones types are adequately and unequally stimulated to form the illusion of various intermediate wavelengths of [[light]].

In his studies of color vision, Maxwell showed, by using a [[Maxwell's discs|rotating disk]] with which he could alter the proportions, that any visible hue or gray tone could be made by mixing only three pure colors of light&amp;nbsp;– red, green and blue&amp;nbsp;– in proportions that would stimulate the three types of cells to the same degrees under particular lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Experiments on colour, as perceived by the eye, with remarks on colour-blindness|first=James Clerk|last=Maxwell|year=1855|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=XXI part II|url=http://www.jimworthey.com/archive/|accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To emphasize that each type of cell by itself did not actually see color but was simply more or less stimulated, he drew an analogy to black-and-white photography: if three colorless photographs of the same scene were taken through red, green and blue filters, and transparencies ("slides") made from them were projected through the same filters and superimposed on a screen, the result would be an image reproducing not only red, green and blue, but all of the colors in the original scene.&lt;ref&gt;

 }} (Note: in apparent deference to the primaries named by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], Maxwell calls the short-wavelength primary "violet" in the relevant paragraphs of his 1855 paper, though he actually used blue in his own experiments, which the paper also describes, and in his 1861 demonstration)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first color photograph made according to Maxwell's prescription, a set of three monochrome "[[color separation]]s", was taken by [[Thomas Sutton (photographer)|Thomas Sutton]] in 1861 for use in illustrating a lecture on color by Maxwell, where it was shown in color by the triple projection method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The first colour photograph, 1861|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2013/jul/09/first-colour-photograph|publisher=The Guardian|date=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test subject was a bow made of ribbon with stripes of various colors, apparently including red and green. During the lecture, which was about physics and physiology, not photography, Maxwell commented on the inadequacy of the results and the need for a photographic material more sensitive to red and green light. A century later, historians were mystified by the reproduction of any red at all, because the photographic process used by Sutton was for all practical purposes totally insensitive to red light and only marginally sensitive to green. In 1961, researchers found that many red dyes also reflect ultraviolet light, coincidentally transmitted by Sutton's red filter, and surmised that the three images were probably due to ultra-violet, blue-green and blue wavelengths, rather than to red, green and blue.&lt;ref&gt;R.W.G. Hunt (2004). ''The Reproduction of Colour'', 6th edition. Wiley. pp 9–10.&lt;br&gt;R.M. Evans (1961a). “Some Notes on Maxwell’s Colour Photograph.” ''Journal of Photographic Science'' '''9'''. pp243–246&lt;br&gt;R.M. Evans (1961b). “Maxwell's Color Photography”. ''Scientific Photography'' '''205'''. pp 117–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additive color===
Creating colors by mixing colored lights (usually red, green and blue) in various proportions is the additive method of color reproduction. LCD, LED, plasma and CRT (picture tube) color video displays all use this method. If one of these displays is examined with a sufficiently strong magnifier, it will be seen that each pixel is actually composed of red, green and blue sub-pixels which blend at normal viewing distances, reproducing a wide range of colors as well as white and shades of gray. This is also known as the [[RGB color model]].

===Subtractive color===
The same three images taken through red, green and blue filters which are used for additive color synthesis may also be used to produce color prints and transparencies by the subtractive method, in which colors are subtracted from white light by dyes or pigments. In photography, the dye colors are normally cyan, a greenish-blue which absorbs red; magenta, a purplish-pink which absorbs green; and yellow, which absorbs blue. The red-filtered image is used to create a cyan dye image, the green-filtered image to create a magenta dye image, and the blue-filtered image to create a yellow dye image. When the three dye images are superimposed they form a complete color image.

This is also known as the [[CMYK color model]]. The "K" is a black component normally added in ink-jet and other mechanical printing processes to compensate for the imperfections of the colored inks used, which ideally should absorb or transmit various parts of the spectrum but not reflect any color, and to improve image definition.

At first it may seem that each image ought to be printed in the color of the filter used in making it, but by following any given color through the process the reason for printing in complementary colors should become apparent. A red object, for example, will be very pale in the red-filtered image but very dark in the other two images, so the result will be an area with just a trace of cyan, absorbing just a bit of red light, but a large amount of magenta and yellow, which together absorb most of the green and blue light, leaving mainly red light to be reflected back from the white paper in the case of a print, or transmitted through a clear support in the case of a transparency.

Before the technical innovations of the years 1935 to 1942, the only way to create a subtractive full-color print or transparency was by means of one of several labor-intensive and time-consuming procedures. Most commonly, three pigment images were first created separately by the so-called [[carbon print|carbon process]] and then carefully combined in register. Sometimes, related processes were used to make three gelatin matrices which were dyed and assembled or used to transfer the three dye images into a single layer of gelatin coated on a final support. Chemical toning could be used to convert three black-and-white silver images into cyan, magenta and yellow images which were then assembled. In a few processes, the three images were created one on top of another by repeated coating or re-sensitizing, negative registration, exposure and development operations. A number of variations were devised and marketed during the first half of the 20th century, some of them short-lived, others, such as the Trichrome Carbro process, enduring for several decades. Because some of these processes allow very stable and light-fast coloring matter to be used, yielding images which can remain virtually unchanged for centuries, they are still not quite completely extinct.

The production of photographic three-color prints on paper was pioneered by [[Louis Ducos du Hauron]], whose comprehensive 1868 French patent also included the basic concepts of most of the color photographic processes which were subsequently developed. For making the three color-filtered negatives required, he was able to develop materials and methods which were not as completely blind to red and green light as those used by Thomas Sutton in 1861, but they were still very insensitive to those colors. Exposure times were impractically long, the red or orange-filtered negative requiring hours of exposure in the camera. His earliest surviving color prints are "sun prints" of pressed flowers and leaves, each of the three negatives having been made without a camera by exposing the light-sensitive surface to direct sunlight passing first through a color filter and then through the vegetation. His first attempts were based on the red-yellow-blue colors then used for pigments, with no color reversal. Later he used the primary colors of light with color reversal.

===Color sensitization===
As long as photographic materials were usefully sensitive only to blue-green, blue, violet and ultraviolet, three-color photography could never be practical. In 1873 German chemist Hermann Wilhelm Vogel discovered that the addition of small amounts of certain aniline dyes to a photographic emulsion could add sensitivity to colors which the dyes absorbed. He identified dyes which variously sensitized for all the previously ineffective colors except true red, to which only a marginal trace of sensitivity could be added.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, H: "On the sensitiveness of bromide of silver to the so-called chemically inactive colours", ''Chemical News'', December 26, 1873:318–319, copying from ''The Photographic News'', date and page not cited but apparently December 12, 1873 (the latter not known to be available online as of August 6, 2010), in turn translated from Vogel's own publication ''Photographische Mittheilungen'', December, 1873 10(117):233–237. The capital letters used in this and other sources cited refer to the Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum, in keeping with contemporary practice. For convenience of reference: C is 656 nm, a slightly deeper red than the output of an average red laser pointer; D is 589 nm, the orange-yellow light of a sodium vapor lamp; E is 527 nm, green.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, H: "Photo-spectroscopic researches", ''The Photographic News'', March 20, 1874:136–137, translated from ''Photographische Mittheilungen'', February, 1874 10(119):279–283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, H: "Rendering actinic non-actinic rays", ''The Photographic News'', July 3, 1874:320–321, a direct communication (apparently in the original English) to ''The Photographic News''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meldola, R. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9R8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA641&amp;pg=PA717#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Recent Researches In Photography"]. "Popular Science", October 1874, Pg.717–720 ISSN 0161-7370&lt;/ref&gt; In the following year, Edmond Becquerel discovered that chlorophyll was a good sensitizer for red.&lt;ref&gt;Becquerel, E: "The action of rays of different refrangibility upon the iodide and bromide of silver: the influence of colouring matters", ''The Photographic News'', October 23, 1874:508–509, translated from ''Comptes Rendus'' (1874) 79:185–190 (the latter downloaded from the Bibliotheque Nationale Francaise on January 28, 2006 but not directly linkable). Note one significant error in the ''Photographic News'' translation, page 509: "...vigorous band between the rays C and D" (referring to Fraunhofer lines) should be "C and B" per the original French text and in agreement with subsequent mentions in the translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it would be many more years before these sensitizers (and better ones developed later) found much use beyond scientific applications such as spectrography, they were quickly and eagerly adopted by Louis Ducos du Hauron, Charles Cros and other color photography pioneers. Exposure times for the "problem" colors could now be reduced from hours to minutes. As ever-more-sensitive gelatin emulsions replaced the old wet and dry collodion processes, the minutes became seconds. New sensitizing dyes introduced early in the 20th century eventually made so-called "instantaneous" color exposures possible.

===Color cameras===
Making color separations by reloading the camera and changing the filter between exposures was inconvenient, added delays to the already long exposure times and could result in the camera being accidentally shifted out of position. To improve the actual picture-taking, a number of experimenters designed one or more special cameras for color photography. They were usually of two main types.

The first type used a system of partially reflecting surfaces to divide the light coming through the lens into three parts, each part passing through a different color filter and forming a separate image, so that the three images could be photographed at the same time on three plates (flexible film had not yet replaced glass plates as the support for the emulsion) or different areas of one plate. Later known as "one-shot" cameras, refined versions continued to be used as late as the 1950s for special purposes such as commercial photography for publication, in which a set of color separations was ultimately required in order to prepare printing plates.

The second type, known variously as a multiple back, repeating back or drop back camera, still exposed the images one at a time but used a sliding holder for the filters and plates which allowed each filter and the corresponding unexposed area of emulsion to be quickly shifted into place. German photochemistry professor [[Adolf Miethe]] designed a high-quality camera of this type which was commercially introduced by Bermpohl in 1903. It was probably this Miethe-Bermpohl camera which was used by Miethe's pupil [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]] to make his now-celebrated color photographic surveys of [[Russia]] before the 1917 revolution. One sophisticated variant, patented by Frederic Eugene Ives in 1897, was driven by clockwork and could be adjusted to automatically make each of the exposures for a different length of time according to the particular color sensitivities of the emulsion being used.&lt;ref&gt;Ives, F: ''Kromskop Color Photography'', pages 33–35. The Photochromoscope Syndicate Limited, London, 1898. Only a brief description of this automated camera is given but a line drawing of the mechanism and the patent reference are included. An Ives one-shot camera is described and illustrated on pages 30–33 and a horizontally oriented multiple back attachment is illustrated on page 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otherwise simple cameras with multiple color-filtered lenses were sometimes tried, but unless everything in the scene was at a great distance, or all in a plane at the same distance, the difference in the viewpoints of the lenses ([[parallax]]) made it impossible to completely "register" all parts of the resulting images at the same time.

===Color photography leaves the laboratory===
Prior to the late 1890s color photography was strictly the domain of a very few intrepid experimenters willing to build their own equipment, do their own color-sensitizing of photographic emulsions, make and test their own color filters and otherwise devote a large amount of time and effort to their pursuits. There were many opportunities for something to go wrong during the series of operations required and problem-free results were rare. Most photographers still regarded the whole idea of color photography as a pipe dream, something only madmen and swindlers would claim to have accomplished.

In 1898, however, it was possible to buy the required equipment and supplies ready-made. Two adequately red-sensitive photographic plates&lt;ref&gt;Abney, W: "Orthochromatic photography", ''Journal of the Society of Arts'', May 22, 1896 44:587–597 describes and illustrates (with spectrum photographs and curves) the characteristics of the Lumière Panchromatic and Cadett Spectrum plates as of 1896. Note that during this period "orthochromatic" was not intended to mean "red-blind", although most or all commercial products so labeled indeed were, which may explain the subsequent evolution in the meaning of the word. The wild roller-coaster curves necessitated laborious adjustment and testing of the color filters to obtain the three desired curves. In the cases of the red and green filters, that could mean quashing over ninety-nine percent of the overall sensitivity, requiring exposures measured in seconds under circumstances where one-fiftieth of a second would have sufficed for unfiltered monochrome use. Disproportionate blue sensitivity, requiring the use of a yellow filter for accurate monochrome rendition in daylight, was typical of commercial panchromatic emulsions far into the 20th Century. See also the previously referenced Ives, F: ''Kromskop Color Photography'', price list (following page 80) pages 1–2, and the subsequently referenced Joly, J: "On a method...", page 135 for mentions of the use of the Lumière Panchromatic in those systems. The alternative alluded to in Ives may be the Cadett Spectrum but could also be the Edwards Isochromatic, only slightly sensitive to red, which Ives is on record as having employed at an earlier date. The Cadett ''Lightning'' Spectrum plate, with an improved spectral response curve and greatly increased overall speed, was available by mid-1900.&lt;/ref&gt; were already on the market, and two very different systems of color photography with which to use them, tantalizingly described in photographic magazines for several years past, were finally available to the public.

The most extensive and expensive of the two was the "Kromskop" (pronounced "chrome-scope") system developed by [[Frederic Eugene Ives]].&lt;ref&gt;https://thebioscope.net/2008/01/12/colourful-stories-no-2-the-kromskop/&lt;/ref&gt; This was a straightforward additive system and its essential elements had been described by James Clerk Maxwell, Louis Ducos du Hauron and Charles Cros much earlier, but Ives invested years of careful work and ingenuity in refining the methods and materials to optimize color quality, in overcoming problems inherent in the optical systems involved, and in simplifying the apparatus to bring down the cost of producing it commercially. The color images, dubbed "Kromograms", were in the form of sets of three black-and-white transparencies on glass, mounted onto special cloth-tape-hinged triple cardboard frames. To see a Kromogram in color it had to be inserted into a "Kromskop" (generic name "chromoscope" or "photochromoscope"), a viewing device which used an arrangement of colored glass filters to illuminate each slide with the correct color of light and transparent reflectors to visually combine them into a single full-color image. The most popular model was [[stereoscopic]]. By looking through its pair of lenses, an image in full natural color and 3-D was seen, a startling novelty in the late Victorian age.

The results won near-universal praise for excellence and realism. At demonstrations, Ives sometimes placed a viewer displaying a still-life subject next to the actual objects photographed, inviting direct comparison. A Kromskop triple "lantern" could be used to project the three images, mounted in a special metal or wooden frame for this purpose, through filters as Maxwell had done in 1861. Prepared Kromograms of still-life subjects, landscapes, famous buildings and works of art were sold and these were the Kromskop viewer's usual fodder, but a "multiple back" camera attachment and a set of three specially adjusted color filters could be bought by "Kromskopists" wishing to make their own Kromograms.

Kromskops and ready-made Kromograms were bought by educational institutions for their value in teaching about color and color vision, and by individuals who were in a position to pay a substantial sum for an intriguing optical toy. A few people did, indeed, make their own Kromograms. Unfortunately for Ives, this was not enough to sustain the businesses which had been set up to exploit the system and they soon failed, but the viewers, projectors, Kromograms and several varieties of Kromskop cameras and camera attachments continued to be available through the Scientific Shop in Chicago as late as 1907.

===The Screen Plate era===
The simpler and somewhat more economical alternative was the Joly Screen process. This required no special camera or viewer, just a special color-compensating filter for the camera lens and a special holder for the photographic plates. The holder contained the heart of the system: a clear glass plate on which very fine lines of three colors had been ruled in a regular repeating pattern, completely covering its surface. The idea was that instead of taking three separate complete photographs through three colored filters, the filters could be in the form of a large number of very narrow strips (the colored lines) allowing the necessary color information to be recorded in a single compound image. After the negative was developed, a positive transparency was printed from it and a viewing screen with red, green and blue lines in the same pattern as the lines of the taking screen was applied and carefully aligned. The colors then appeared as if by magic. The transparency and screen were very like the layer of monochrome liquid crystal elements and overlay of hair-thin red, green and blue color filter stripes which create the color image in a typical LCD display. This was the invention of Irish scientist John Joly, although he, like so many other inventors, eventually discovered that his basic concept had been anticipated in Louis Ducos du Hauron's long-since-expired 1868 patent.&lt;ref&gt;Joly, J: "On a method of photography in natural colors", ''Scientific Transactions of the Royal Dublin Society'', October, 1896 6(2):127–138 includes details such as the actual reasons for the unusual colors employed in the taking screen and examples of the exposures required. The color illustrations have obviously had considerable hand-work done by the engravers and may have been entirely hand-colored using the original transparencies as a guide. As is evident from page 127, publication was delayed by more than a year. The 1895 date is confirmed by the publication of a lengthy abstract in ''Nature'', November 28, 1895 53(1361):91–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joly Screen process had some problems. First and foremost, although the colored lines were reasonably fine (about 75 sets of three colored lines to the inch) they were still disturbingly visible at normal viewing distances and nearly intolerable when enlarged by projection. This problem was exacerbated by the fact that each screen was individually ruled on a machine which used three pens to apply the transparent colored inks, resulting in irregularities, high reject rates and high cost. The glass used for photographic plates at the time was not perfectly flat, and lack of uniform good contact between the screen and the image gave rise to areas of degraded color. Poor contact also caused false colors to appear if the sandwich was viewed at an angle. Although much simpler than the Kromskop system, the Joly system was not inexpensive. The starter kit of plate holder, compensating filter, one taking screen and one viewing screen cost US$30 (the equivalent of at least $750 in 2010 dollars) and additional viewing screens were $1 each (the equivalent of at least $25 in 2010 dollars). This system, too, soon died of neglect, although in fact it pointed the way to the future.

Surviving examples of the Joly process usually show extremely poor color now. The colors in the viewing screens have badly faded and shifted, making it impossible to judge their original appearance. In some specimens the viewing screen is also misaligned.

[[Lippmann plate|Lippmann photography]] is a way of making a color photograph that relies on Bragg reflection planes in the emulsion to make the colors. It is similar to using the colors of soap bubbles to make an image. [[Gabriel Lippmann|Gabriel Jonas Lippmann]] won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1908 for the creation of the first color photographic process using a single emulsion.  The color fidelity is extremely high but the images can not be reproduced and viewing requires very specific lighting conditions.  The development of the Autochrome process quickly rendered the Lippmann method redundant.  The method is still utilized to make singular images that cannot be copied for security purposes.

The first commercially successful color process, the [[Autochrome Lumière|Lumière Autochrome]], invented by the French [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]], reached the market in 1907. Instead of colored strips, it was based on an irregular screen plate filter made of three colors of dyed grains of [[potato starch]] which were too small to be individually visible. The light-sensitive emulsion was coated directly onto the screen plate, eliminating problems due to imperfect contact between the screen and image. Reversal processing was used to convert the negative image which was initially produced into a positive image by removing the exposed silver metal, and re-exposing the remaining silver halide, so no printing or screen registration was required. The shortcomings of the Autochrome process were the expense (one plate cost about as much as a dozen black-and-white plates of the same size), the relatively long exposure times which made hand-held "snapshots" and photographs of moving subjects impractical, and the density of the finished image due to the presence of the light-absorbing color screen.

Viewed under optimum conditions and by daylight as intended, a well-made and well-preserved Autochrome can look startlingly fresh and vivid. Unfortunately, modern film and digital copies are usually made with a highly diffused light source, which causes loss of color saturation and other ill effects due to light scatter within the structure of the screen and emulsion, and by fluorescent or other artificial light which alters the color balance. The capabilities of the process should not be judged by the dull, washed-out, odd-colored reproductions commonly seen.

Millions of Autochrome plates were manufactured and used during the quarter century before the plates were replaced by film-based versions in the 1930s. The very last film version, named Alticolor, brought the Autochrome process into the 1950s but was discontinued in 1955. Many additive color screen products were available between the 1890s and the 1950s, but none, with the possible exception of [[Dufaycolor]], introduced as film for still photography in 1935, was as popular or successful as the Lumière Autochrome. The most recent use of the additive screen process for non-digital photography was in Polachrome, an "instant" 35mm slide film introduced in 1983 and discontinued about twenty years later.

===Tripacks===

Louis Ducos du Hauron had suggested using a sandwich of three differently color-recording emulsions on transparent supports which could be exposed together in an ordinary camera, then taken apart and used like any other set of three-color separations. The problem was that although two of the emulsions could be in contact face-to-face, the third would have to be separated by the thickness of one transparent support layer. Because all silver halide emulsions are inherently sensitive to blue, the blue-recording layer ought to be on top and have a blue-blocking yellow filter layer behind it. This blue-recording layer, used to make the yellow print which could most afford to be "soft", would end up producing the sharpest image. The two layers behind it, one sensitized to red but not green and the other to green but not red, would suffer from scattering of the light as it passed through the topmost emulsion, and one or both would further suffer by being spaced away from it.

Despite these limitations, some "tripacks" were commercially produced, such as the Hess-Ives "Hiblock" which sandwiched an emulsion on film between emulsions coated on glass plates. For a brief period in the early 1930s, the American Agfa-Ansco company produced Colorol, a roll-film tripack for snapshot cameras. The three emulsions were on unusually thin film bases. After exposure, the roll was sent to Agfa-Ansco for processing and the triple negatives were returned to the customer with a set of color prints. The images were not sharp and the color was not very good, but they were genuine "natural color" snapshots.

"Bipacks" using only two emulsions face-to-face were the subject of some development. Although the range of colors which could be reproduced by only two components was limited, skin tones and most hair and eye colors could be rendered with surprising fidelity, making bipack processes a viable option for color portraiture. In commercial practice, however, the use of bipacks was almost entirely confined to two-color motion picture systems.

If the three layers of emulsion in a tripack did not have to be taken apart in order to produce the cyan, magenta and yellow dye images from them, they could be coated directly on top of each other, eliminating the most serious problems. In fact, some chemical magic was under development which would make that possible.

===Color film since the 1930s===

In 1935, American [[Eastman Kodak]] introduced the first modern "integral tripack" color film and called it [[Kodachrome]], a name recycled from an earlier and completely different two-color process. Its development was led by the improbable team of [[Leopold Mannes]] and [[Leopold Godowsky, Jr.]] (nicknamed "Man" and "God"), two highly regarded classical musicians who had started tinkering with color photographic processes and ended up working with the Kodak Research Laboratories. Kodachrome had three layers of emulsion coated on a single base, each layer recording one of the three additive primaries, red, green, and blue. In keeping with Kodak's old "you press the button, we do the rest" slogan, the film was simply loaded into the camera, exposed in the ordinary way, then mailed to Kodak for processing. The complicated part, if the complexities of manufacturing the film are ignored, was the processing, which involved the controlled penetration of chemicals into the three layers of emulsion. Only a simplified description of the process is appropriate in a short history: as each layer was developed into a black-and-white silver image, a "[[dye coupler]]" added during that stage of development caused a cyan, magenta or yellow dye image to be created along with it. The silver images were chemically removed, leaving only the three layers of dye images in the finished film.

Initially, [[Kodachrome]] was available only as 16mm film for home movies, but in 1936 it was also introduced as 8mm home movie film and short lengths of 35mm film for still photography. In 1938, sheet film in various sizes for professional photographers was introduced, some changes were made to cure early problems with unstable colors, and a somewhat simplified processing method was instituted.

In 1936, the German [[Agfa]] followed with their own integral tripack film, [[Agfacolor|Agfacolor Neu]], which was generally similar to Kodachrome but had one important advantage: Agfa had found a way to incorporate the dye couplers into the emulsion layers during manufacture, allowing all three layers to be developed at the same time and greatly simplifying the processing. Most modern color films, excepting the now-discontinued Kodachrome, use the incorporated dye coupler technique, but since the 1970s nearly all have used a modification developed by Kodak rather than the original Agfa version.

In 1941, Kodak made it possible to order prints from Kodachrome slides. The print "paper" was actually a white plastic coated with a multilayer emulsion similar to that on the film. These were the first commercially available color prints created by the [[chromogenic]] dye coupler method. In the following year, Kodacolor film was introduced. Unlike Kodachrome, it was designed to be processed into a negative image which showed not only light and dark reversed but also complementary colors. The use of such a negative for making prints on paper simplified the processing of the prints, reducing their cost.

The expense of color film as compared to black-and-white and the difficulty of using it with indoor lighting combined to delay its widespread adoption by amateurs. In 1950, black-and-white snapshots were still the norm. By 1960, color was much more common but still tended to be reserved for travel photos and special occasions. Color film and color prints still cost several times as much as black-and-white, and taking color snapshots in deep shade or indoors required the use of [[Flash (photography)|flashbulbs]], an inconvenience and an additional expense. By 1970, prices were coming down, film sensitivity had been improved, [[Flash (photography)|electronic flash units]] were replacing flashbulbs, and in most families color had become the norm for snapshot-taking. Black-and-white film continued to be used by some photographers who preferred it for aesthetic reasons or who wanted to take pictures by existing light in low-light conditions, which was still difficult to do with color film. They usually did their own developing and printing. By 1980, black-and-white film in the formats used by typical snapshot cameras, as well as commercial developing and printing service for it, had nearly disappeared.

[[Instant film|Instant color film]] was introduced by [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] in 1963. Like Polaroid's contemporary instant black-and-white film, their first color product was a negative-positive peel-apart process which produced a unique print on paper. The negative could not be reused and was discarded. The blight created by carelessly discarded caustic-chemical-laden Polaroid negatives, which tended to accumulate most heavily at the prettiest, most snapshot-worthy locations, horrified Polaroid founder [[Edwin Land]] and prompted him to develop the later SX-70 system, which produced no separate negative to discard.

Some currently available color films are designed to produce positive transparencies for use in a [[slide projector]] or magnifying viewer, although paper prints can also be made from them. Transparencies are preferred by some professional photographers who use film because they can be judged without having to print them first. Transparencies are also capable of a wider dynamic range, and therefore of a greater degree of realism, than the more convenient medium of prints on paper. The early popularity of color "slides" among amateurs went into decline after the introduction of automated printing equipment started bringing print quality up and prices down.

Other currently available films are designed to produce color negatives for use in creating enlarged positive prints on color photographic paper. Color negatives may also be digitally scanned and then printed by non-photographic means or viewed as positives electronically. Unlike reversal-film transparency processes, negative-positive processes are, within limits, forgiving of incorrect exposure and poor color lighting, because a considerable degree of correction is possible at the time of printing. Negative film is therefore more suitable for casual use by amateurs. Virtually all single-use cameras employ negative film. Photographic transparencies can be made from negatives by printing them on special "positive film", but this has always been unusual outside of the motion picture industry and commercial service to do it for still images may no longer be available. Negative films and paper prints are by far the most common form of color film photography today.

===Digital photography===
After a transition period centered around 1995–2005, color film was relegated to a niche market by inexpensive multi-megapixel [[digital camera]]s which can shoot both in monochrome as well as color. Film continues to be the preference of some photographers because of its distinctive "look" and fondness of the format.

==Artists' perspectives==
Photographers differed in opinion about color photography when it was first introduced. Some fully embraced it when it was available to the public in the late 1930s, while others remained skeptical of its relevance in the art of photography.

===Fans of color===
[[Ferenc Berko]], a classic photographer{{Vague|date=February 2013}} who lived during the rise of color film, was one of the photographers who immediately recognized the potential of color film. He saw it as a new way to frame the world; a way to experiment with the subjects he photographed and how he conveyed emotion in the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honan|first=William|title=Ferenc Berko, 84, Pioneer In Use of Color Photography|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/26/nyregion/ferenc-berko-84-pioneer-in-use-of-color-photography.html?src=pm|work=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Hedgecoe]], another photographer who lived during this time period,{{Vague|date=February 2013}} was another example of those who preferred color. He published a book entitled ''The Art of Color Photography'', in which he explained the importance of understanding the "special and often subtle relationships between different colors". He also described the psychological and emotional power that color can have on the viewer, since certain colors, he argues, can make people feel a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hedgecoe|first=John|title=The Art of Color Photography|year=1998|publisher=Reed Consumer Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Groover]], a postmodernist noted for her work during the 1970s used color extensively in her work.

===Skeptics===
Though color photography had its followers, black-and-white still remained the more popular and respected film when color first came out.

[[Harold Baquet]], for instance—a relatively current photographer{{Vague|date=February 2013}} known best for documenting New Orleans civil rights—was not keen on color. He preferred to take pictures mainly using black-and-white film. When asked about his reasoning for this preference during an interview, he replied “The less is more thing. Sometimes the color distracts from the essential subject. Sometimes, just light, line and form is enough, and it allows you to explore the sculptural qualities of that third dimension, that illusional dimension of depth. And it’s fun”.&lt;ref name="Tuley 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tuley |first=Laura Camille |date=December 2007 |title=An Interview with Harold Baquet |url=http://www.neworleansreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/NOR33.2_text.pdf?056111 |journal=New Orleans Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |page=108–116 |accessdate=March 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aversion to color was due mainly to a fear of losing simplicity in his pictures. He worried that color gave the eye too much to take in.&lt;ref name="Tuley 2007"/&gt;

This worry was not uncommon. Photographer [[Ansel Adams]], known best for his dramatic black-and-white landscapes, also felt that color could be distracting, and could therefore divert the artist's attention away from creating a photograph to his full potential, according to some experts. Adams actually claimed that he could get "a far greater sense of 'color' through a well-planned and executed black-and-white image than [he had] ever achieved with color photography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Woodward |first=Richard B. |date=November 2009 |title=Ansel Adams in Color |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/ansel-adams-in-color-145315674/ |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another expert source{{Vague|date=February 2013}} mentioned that Adams was a "master of control". He wrote books about technique, developed the [[Zone System]]—which helped determine the optimal exposure and development time for a given photograph—and introduced the idea of "previsualization", which involved the photographer imagining what he wanted his final print to look like before he even took the shot. These concepts and methods allowed for nearly total control of all the potential variables that factor into a final print. Because of this love for control, Adams disliked color because it lacked this element that he had mastered with black-and-white.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

While Adams initially was far from thrilled with color, he did experiment with it, unknown to many. A few examples of his color work are available in the online archive of the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona. His subjects that he shot in color ranged from portraits to landscape to architecture;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccp-emuseum.catnet.arizona.edu/view/objects/asimages/People@25?t:state:flow=2937374a-e072-4c80-bc31-7e4da99bdc20 |title=Ansel Adams: Browse |website=Center for Creative Photography |publisher=University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; a similar scope to that of his black and white work. In fact, toward the end of his life, Adams admitted{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} his regret of not being able to master the technique of color, according to an expert source.{{Vague|date=February 2013}}

Though a wide range of film preference still exists among photographers today, color has, with time, gained a much larger following as well as a higher level of respect in the field of photography as a whole.

==Preservation issues==
Experimentation with creating photographs that mirrored the colors of real life began in the 1840s. Each process may require different methods of preservation.

Color photographic materials are impermanent and are by nature unstable. [[Chromogenic]] color photographs, for example, are composed of [[yellow]], [[magenta]], and [[cyan]] organic [[dye]]s, which fade at different rates. Even when in dark storage and enclosed in the proper archival materials, deterioration is unavoidable. However, when given the proper preservation care, fading, color shifting, and discoloration can be delayed.

===Factors===
Numerous factors can deteriorate and even destroy photographs. Some examples include:
*High temperature and high [[relative humidity]] (RH)
*[[Air pollution]] and dirt
*Light exposure
*Biological threats such as [[Fungus|fungi]] and [[insect]]s
*Residual processing chemicals
*Base and emulsion deterioration
*Handling and usage
*Improper storage and enclosures

Three signs of age that affect color photography are:
*'''Dark fading''' occurs regardless of the procedures taken to preserve a photograph and is unavoidable. It is instigated by temperature and RH. Cyan dyes will typically fade more quickly, which will make the image appear too red in color.
*'''Light fading''' occurs when materials are exposed to light, e.g. while on display. The intensity of the light source and [[Ultraviolet light|ultraviolet]] (UV) rays will affect the rate of change and fade. Magenta dyes will typically fade the quickest.
*'''Highlight staining''' occurs with older color photographic papers, and is a yellowing of the border and highlight areas of a photograph.

===Storage===
In general, the colder the storage, the longer the "life" of color photographs. Frost-free refrigeration, more commonly known as ''cold storage'' (below freezing) is one of the most effective ways to bring a halt to developing damage to color photographic materials. Selecting this type of storage environment is costly and requires special training to remove and return items. Therefore, ''cool storage'' (above freezing) is more common and less costly, which requires that the temperature is consistently between {{convert|10|–|15|C|F}} with 30–40% relative humidity with special attention to dew point to eliminate concerns for condensation. General ''dark storage'' in light tight enclosures and storage boxes is always advised for individual items. When materials are exposed to light during handling, usage, or display, light sources should be UV-filtered and intensity kept at minimum. In storage areas, 200–400&amp;nbsp;[[lux]] is recommended.

===Recommended storage===
The usage of enclosures is the easiest method of preserving photographic materials from being damaged through handling and light exposure. All protective materials should pass the ''[[Photographic Activity Test]]'' (PAT) as described both by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) in standard IT9.2–1988, and the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) in standard [[ISO 18916|18916:2007]](E), ''Photography&amp;nbsp;– Processed Photographic Materials – Photographic Activity Test for Enclosure Materials''&lt;!--Convert that to a reference citation with &lt;ref&gt;--&gt;. The PAT is an [[archival science]] test that determines what kind of enclosures will preserve, prevent, and/or prolong from further deterioration while in storage.

The recommended use of archival enclosures includes each item having its own enclosure and that each enclosure is of the appropriate size. Archival enclosures may come in two different forms: ''paper'' or ''plastic''. Choosing either option has its advantages and disadvantages.

*'''Paper enclosures''' should be non-acidic, lignin-free paper and may come in either buffered or non-buffered stock. An advantage of paper is that it is generally less costly than plastic enclosures. The opaque quality of paper protects photographs from light exposure, and the porous quality protects photographs from humidity and gaseous pollutants. However, for images to be viewed, they must be removed from the enclosure, putting the materials at risk for mishandling and/or vandalism.
*Archival quality '''plastic enclosures''' are made of uncoated polyester, polypropylene, or polyethylene. The transparent quality of plastic lends itself to easier access to the image because there is no extra step to remove the photograph. Plastic is also less resistant to tears in comparison to paper. Some disadvantages include being prone to static electricity and a risk of ferrotyping (the act of moisture becoming trapped between the enclosure and item, causing the materials to stick to one another).

After photographic materials are individually enclosed, '''housing or storage containers''' provide another protective barrier such as folders and boxes made from archival paperboard as addressed in ISO Standards [[ISO 18916|18916:2007]] and 18902. Sometimes these containers have to be custom-made in order to properly store odd sizes. In general, flat storage in boxes is recommended because it provides more stable support, particularly for materials that are in more fragile condition. Still, boxes and folders should never be over-filled with materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2803">The '''Contemporary Artists' Books Conference''' ('''CABC''') was started in 2008 by the New York Chapter of the Art Libraries Society of North America (ARLIS/NY) in collaboration with the [[NY Art Book Fair]]. It has been held annually during the Fair as part of its special programming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/about/ NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 2006, [[Printed Matter, Inc]], under the direction of its former Director and President [[AA Bronson]], launched the NY Art Book Fair (NYABF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://printedmatter.org/ Printed Matter.] website.&lt;/ref&gt; The Contemporary Artists' Books Conference (CABC) was started two years later by the New York Chapter of the Art Libraries Society of North America in collaboration with the NYABF. In subsequent years, the conference was held directly within the Fair as part of the Fair's public programming.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Lokke (2012). [http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/photobooth/2012/09/how-to-prep-for-the-ny-art-book-fair.html#slide_ss_0=1 "How to Prep for the NY Art Book Fair."] ''The New Yorker'' (September 27).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CABC was initially organized by a volunteer committee of art librarians from the New York area, including James Mitchell, formerly of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; Jennifer Tobias, Milan Hughston and David Senior of the [[Museum of Modern Art|Museum of Modern Art Library]]; Deirdre Donohue and Matthew Carson of the [[International Center of Photography]]; Ryan Haley of the [[New York Public Library]]; Deirdre Lawrence of the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Museum Library]]; and Tony White of the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]]. [[Stephen J. Bury]] of the [[Frick Art Reference Library]] joined the committee in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/conference/ Contemporary Artists' Books Conference at NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The CABC was also included in Printed Matter's LA Art Book Fair beginning in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;LA Art Book Fair website http://laartbookfair.net/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

Although the programming for the conference varies from year to year, all conferences are united by their focus on emerging practices and issues within art-book culture. In addition to organizing the annual conference, CABC's planning committee commissions a new artists’ book as part of its program. Previously commissioned artists include James Hoff, Eve Fowler, Dexter Sinister, [[David Horvitz]], Triin Tamm and Emily Roysdon, and the “assembled magazine” ''Adventures,'' produced by Aaron Flint Jamison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyartbookfair.com/conference/ Contemporary Artists' Books Conference at NY Art Book Fair.] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">'''Copyright formalities''' are legal (generally [[statutory law|statutory]]) requirements needed to obtain a [[copyright]] in a particular jurisdiction. Common copyright formalities include [[copyright registration]], [[copyright renewal]], [[copyright notice]], and [[copyright deposit]].

==Benefits and critiques==
Copyright formalities had certain benefits to users and holders of copyrights.  First, they made determination of copyright status fairly easy.  Copyright notice requirements—such as placing a notice of copyright on the work itself, along with the copyright holder, and the date of copyright—meant that any work could readily be determined to be in copyright simply by looking for the copyright notice.  Copyright registration and renewal requirements meant that records of copyright owners were centrally located and made available; this facilitated licensing arrangements, and contacting the holders.  It also provided authoritative records about who owned the copyright, in case of disputes. 

However, copyright formalities were viewed as an unnecessary burden on creators—mostly authors at the end of the 19th century.  Authors who failed to comply with some particular aspect of a formality—for instance, placing the notice in the wrong place or in the wrong order, or failing to renew a copyright in a timely fashion—would lose their copyright.  Consequently, [[Victor Hugo]] and other authors agitated for the elimination of copyright formalities toward the end of the 19th century.  In response to their efforts, the 1908 Berlin text of the [[Berne Convention]] forbade treaty signatories from conditioning copyright on formalities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=Paul |title=International Copyright: Principles, Law, and Practice |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195128850 |oclc=43411605 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; shifting copyright from a system of application (registration) to automatic copyright on fixation.

== Shift away from formalities==
Requirements for meeting copyright formalities were largely eliminated in many countries with the adoption of the [[Berne Convention]], which granted a copyright for a creative work automatically as soon as the work was "[[copyright fixation|fixed]]".  Berne was first adopted in 1886 by eight countries, mostly in Europe.  Acceptance grew over the course of the 20th century. (See [[List of parties to the Berne Convention]].)  The United States, a notable late holdout, joined Berne effective March 1, 1989, with the passage of the [[Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988]]; China, another notable holdout, joined Berne in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;See [[List of parties to the Berne Convention]].&lt;/ref&gt;  

With the adoption of Berne and its successor treaties, requiring formalities to obtain a copyright has fallen out of practice around the world.

== Renewed interest in formalities==
However, the system of automatic copyright on fixation has been cited as one of the factors behind the growth of the so-called "[[orphan works]]" problem.  For instance, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]]'s 2006 report on orphan works cited the shift away from formalities as one of the critical factors behind the creation of orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;United States Copyright Office, [http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat030806.html Copyright Office's Report on Orphan Works] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  

Consequently, some scholars and policy advocates (such as law professor and activist [[Lawrence Lessig]]&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'' by [[Larry Lessig]].&lt;/ref&gt; and U.S. [[Zoe Lofgren|Representative Zoe Lofgren]]) have called for returning to a system of registration requirements and possibly other formalities such as [[copyright notice]].  UC Berkeley's Law School held a conference in 2013 on the question of "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?", noting that &lt;blockquote&gt;"Formalities, which in the past three decades have largely disappeared from American copyright law, may be about to stage a comeback. ... [R]ecent research on formalities suggests that we can get many of the benefits that formalities promise for a more efficient and focused copyright law, without the problems that led us to do away with them in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.berkeley.edu/centers/bclt/past-events/2013-conferences/april013-copyright-formalities/ "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?"], [[Berkeley School of Law]], April 18–19, 2013, Claremont Hotel, Berkeley CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:José Jiménez Aranda A Pass in the Bullring 1870.jpg|thumb|right|[[José Jiménez Aranda]] (1837–1903): ''The Bullring'' (1870)]]
'''''Costumbrismo''''' (sometimes anglicized as '''Costumbrism''')  is the literary or pictorial interpretation of local everyday life, mannerisms, and customs, primarily in the [[Hispanic]] scene, and particularly in the 19th century. ''Costumbrismo'' is related both to artistic [[realism (arts)|realism]] and to [[Romanticism]], sharing the Romantic interest in expression as against simple representation and the romantic ''and'' realist focus on precise representation of particular times and places, rather than of humanity in the abstract.&lt;ref&gt;José Escobar, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/09250620855792739754480/p0000001.htm#I_0_ Costumbrismo entre Romanticismo y Realismo], Biblioteca Virtual Miguel Cervantes. Accessed online 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón"&gt;Antonio Reina Palazón, [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/portal/romanticismo/actas_pdf/romanticismo_6/reina.pdf El Costumbrismo en la Pintura Sevillana del Siglo XIX], Biblioteca Virtual Miguel Cervantes. Accessed online 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It is often satiric and even moralizing, but unlike mainstream realism does not usually offer or even imply any particular analysis of the society it depicts. When not satiric, its approach to quaint [[folklore|folkloric]] detail often has a romanticizing aspect.

''Costumbrismo'' can be found in any of the visual or literary arts; by extension, the term can also be applied to certain approaches to collecting folkloric objects, as well. Originally found in short essays and later in novels, ''costumbrismo'' is often found in the ''[[zarzuela]]s'' of the 19th century, especially in the ''género chico''. ''Costumbrista'' museums deal with folklore and local art and ''costumbrista'' festivals celebrate local customs and [[artisans]] and their work.

Although initially associated with Spain in the late 18th and 19th century, ''costumbrismo'' expanded to [[the Americas]] and set roots in the Spanish-speaking portions of the Americas, incorporating indigenous elements. Juan López Morillas summed up the appeal of ''costumbrismo'' for writing about Latin American society as follows: the ''costumbristas&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' "preoccupation with minute detail, local color, the picturesque, and their concern with matters of style is frequently no more than a subterfuge. Astonished by the contradictions observed around them, incapable of clearly understanding the tumult of the modern world, these writers sought refuge in the particular, the trivial or the ephemeral."&lt;ref&gt;Juan López Morillas, ''El Krausismo español'' (1980), p. 129, quoted by Enrique Pupo-Walker, "The brief narrative in Spanish America 1835–1915", 490:535 in Roberto González Echevarría, Enrique Pupo-Walker, ''The Cambridge History of Latin American Literature: Discovery to modernism'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-521-34069-1}}.

==Literary ''costumbrismo'' in Spain==

===Origins===
[[File:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Duelo a garrotazos.jpg|thumb|Some of the work of [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]] can be seen as prefiguring ''costumbrismo'', especially as practiced in [[Madrid]]. Here, the ''[[Fight with Cudgels]]'', one of Goya's [[Black Paintings]].]]
Antecedents to ''costumbrismo'' can be found as early as the 17th century (for example in the work of playwright [[Juan de Zabaleta]]) and the current becomes clearer in the 18th century ([[Diego de Torres Villarroel]], [[José Clavijo y Fajardo]], [[José Cadalso]], [[Ramón de la Cruz]], [[Juan Ignacio González del Castillo]]). All of these writers have, in at least some of their work, an attention to specific, local detail, an exaltation of the "typical" that would feed into both ''costumbrismo'' and Romanticism. In the 19th century ''costumbrismo'' bursts out as a clear genre in its own right, addressing a broad audience: stories and illustrations often made their first or most important appearance in cheap periodicals for the general public.&lt;ref name=Soria-1&gt;Andrés Soria, [http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura Costumbrismo I. Literatura Española] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114616/http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura |date=July 16, 2011 }}, Ediciones Rialp S.A. Gran Enciclopedia Rialp, 1991. Accessed online 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not easy to draw lines around the genre: [[Evaristo Correa Calderón]] spoke of its "extraordinary elasticity and variety".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Andrés Soria, [http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura Costumbrismo I. Literatura Española] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716114616/http://www.canalsocial.net/GER/ficha_GER.asp?id=9241&amp;cat=literatura |date=July 16, 2011 }}, Ediciones Rialp S.A. Gran Enciclopedia Rialp, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of it is almost reportorial and documentary, some simply folkloric; what it has in common is the effort to capture a particular place (whether rural or urban) at a particular time.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[File:Bartolomé Esteban Perez Murillo - Trauben- und Melonenesser.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Much as Goya influenced ''costumbrismo'' in Madrid, [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]] influenced ''costumbrismo'' in [[Seville]].]]
[[Sebastián de Miñano y Bedoya]] (1779–1845) is considered by some a ''costumbrista'', although arguably his writing is too political to properly fit the genre. According to Andrés Soria, the first incontestable ''costumbristas'' are the anonymous and pseudonymous contributors to ''La Minerva'' (1817), ''El Correo Literario y Mercantil'' (1823–33) and ''El Censor'' (1820–23). Later come the major figures of literary ''costumbrismo'': [[Serafín Estébanez Calderón]] (1799–1867), [[Ramón de Mesonero Romanos]] (1803–82), and [[Mariano José de Larra]] (1809–37) who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym "Fígaro". Estébanez Calderón (who originally wrote for the abovementioned ''Correo Literario y Mercantil'') looked for a "genuine" and picturesque Spain in the recent past of particular regions; Mesonero Romanos was a careful observer of the [[Madrid]] of his time, especially of the middle classes; Larra, according to [[José Ramón Lomba Pedraja]], arguably transcended his genre, using the form of ''costumbrismo'' for political and psychological ideas. An ''afrancesado''—a [[liberalism|liberal]] child of [[the Englightenment|the Enlightenment]]—he was not particularly enamored of the Spanish society that he nonetheless observed minutely.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

''Costumbrismo'' was by no means without foreign influences. The work of [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] nearly a century earlier in ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'' had influenced French writers, who in turn influenced the ''costumbristas''. Furthermore, Addison and Steele's own work was translated into Spanish in the early 19th century, and Mesonero Romanos, at least, had read it in French.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Still, an even stronger influence came by way of [[Victor-Joseph Étienne de Jouy]] (whose work appeared in translation in ''La Minerva'' and ''El Censor''), [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] (especially for ''Le Tableau de Paris'', 1781–88), [[Charles Joseph Colnet Du Ravel]], and [[Georges Touchard-Lafosse]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; In addition, there were the travelogues such as [[Richard Ford (writer)|Richard Ford]]'s ''[[A Handbook for Travellers in Spain]]'',  written by various foreigners who had visited Spain and, in painting, the foreign artists (especially, [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]) who had settled for a time especially in [[Seville]] and [[Granada]] and drew or painted local subjects.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;

While Estébanez Calderón, Mesonero Romanos, and (insofar as he fits the genre) Larra were the major ''costumbrista'' writers, many other Spanish writers of the 19th century devoted all or part of their careers to ''costumbrismo''. [[Antonio María Segovia]] (1808–74), who mainly wrote pseudonymously as "El Estudiante"&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; and who founded the satiric-literary magazine ''El Cócora'';&lt;ref&gt;Ángeles Ezama Gil, José Enrique Serrano Asenjo (editors), Juan Valera, ''Correspondencia, Vol. 2: Años 1862-1875'', Nueva biblioteca de erudición y crítica, Editorial Castalia, 2002, {{ISBN|84-9740-041-0}}. p. 39.

===''The Spanish Drawn By Themselves''===
[[File:Bookstore from Los Españoles pintados por sí mismos.jpg|thumb|left|An unsigned illustration from ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'': a book shop in Madrid.]]
Much as literary ''costumbrismo'' had been influenced by English models, often by way of France, the same occurred with the equivalent in the visual arts, but with far more recent models. In a period when [[physiognomy]] was in vogue, ''Heads of the People or Portraits of the English'' was serialized in London starting in 1838 and was published in its entirety in 1840–41. It combined essays by such "distinguished writers" (the volume's own choice of words) as [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] and [[James Henry Leigh Hunt|Leigh Hunt]] with pictures of individuals emblematic of different English "types". This was followed in France by a work first serialized as ''Les Français, Moeurs Contemporaines'' ("The French, Contemporary Manners", beginning in 1839) and published in a volume in 1842 as ''Les Français peints par eux-mêmes. Encyclopédie Morale du dixneuviéme siécle'' ("The French, drawn by themselves. Moral Encyclopedia of the 19th Century"). The Spanish soon followed with ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'' ("The Spanish Drawn By Themselves") serialized from 1842 and published in a volume in 1843.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An 1851 edition of ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos'' is [https://books.google.com/books?id=VMt198jfSqoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:El Coche Simon.jpg|thumb|right|upright|"El Coche Simón", unsigned illustration from ''Los españoles…'']]
A collective and hence, necessarily, uneven anthology of "types", ''Los españoles…'' was a mixture of verse and prose, and of writers and artists from various generations. Illustrators included [[Leonardo Alenza]] (1807–45), [[Fernando Miranda]], [[Francisco Lameyer]] (1825–1877), [[Vicente Urrabieta y Ortiz]], and [[Calixto Ortega]]. The writers included Mesonero and Estébanez as well as various less ''costumbrista'' writers and many not usually associated with the genre, such as [[Gabriel García Tassara]] (1817–75) or the conservative politician [[Francisco Navarro Villoslada]] (1818–95). Andrés Soria remarks that, except for the Andalusian "types", everything was from the point of view of Madrid. Unlike later ''costumbrismo'', the focus remained firmly on the present day. In some ways, the omissions are as interesting as the inclusions: no direct representation of the aristocracy, of prominent businessmen, of the high clergy, or of the army, and except for the "popular" classes, the writing is a bit circumspect and cautious. Still, the material is strong on ethnological, folkloric, and linguistic detail.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

In an epilogue to ''Los españoles…'', "Contrastes. Tipos perdidos, 1825, Tipos hallados, 1845" ("Contrasts. Types lost, 1825, types found, 1845"), Mesonero on the one hand showed that the genre, in its original terms, was played out, and on the other laid the ground for future ''costumbrismo'': new "types" would always arise, and many places remained to be written about in this fashion. The book had many descendants, and a major reissue in 1871. A particularly strong current came out of [[Barcelona]]: for example, [[José M. de Freixas]]'s ''Enciclopedia de tipos vulgares y costumbres de Barcelona'' ("Encyclopedia of vulgar types and customs of Barcelona", 1844) illustrated by Servat,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Josep Izquierdo, [http://librodenotas.com/laguillotinapiano/14263/goya-en-tiempos-de-guerrilla-artistica Goya en tiempos de guerrilla artística], Libro de Notas, 2008-07-25. Accessed online 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''El libro Verde de Barcelona'' ("The Green Book of Barcelona", 1848) by "José y Juan" ([[José de Majarrés]] and [[Juan Cortada y Sala]]. The very title of ''Los valencianos pintados por sí mismos'' ([[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] 1859) gave a nod of the hat to the earlier work,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[File:Pradilla - Woman from Montevideo - cropped to image.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A woman from [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], depicted by [[Francisco Pradilla Ortiz|Francisco Pradilla y Ortiz]] in ''Las mujeres españolas, portuguesas y americanas…'']]
A revival of collective works of ''costumbrismo'' in the time of the [[First Spanish Republic]] saw the reissue of ''Los españoles…'' (1872), as well as the publication of ''Los españoles de hogaño'' ("The Spanish these days", 1872), focused on Madrid, and the vast undertaking ''Las mujeres españolas, portuguesas y americanas…'' ("Spanish, Portuguese, and American Women…", published in Madrid, [[Havana]], and [[Buenos Aires]] in 1872–1873 and 1876).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.rice.edu/handle/1911/9251 A very nice online version of volume 3 of ''Las mujeres…''] can be found on the site of Rice University as part of the Rice Digital Scholarship Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; Also from this time was the satiric ''Madrid por dentro y por fuera'' ("Madrid from inside and outside, 1873) by Manuel del Palacio (1831–1906).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ángeles Ayala note"&gt;María de los Ángeles Ayala, [http://www.raco.cat/index.php/Scriptura/article/viewFile/94986/142847 ''Una docena de cuentos'', primera recopilación de cuentos de Narciso Campillo y Correa], ''Scriptura'' (University of Lleida), ISSN 1130-961X, Vol. 16, Number 16, 2001, 133:148. Accessed online 2010-01-20. p. 148, n. 39 (p. 16 of PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carlos Frontaura]] carried on ''costumbrismo'' in Madrid with ''Las tiendas'' ("Shops", 1886) and "Tipos madrileños" ("Madrid types", 1888). [[Ramón de Navarrete]] (1822–1897) writing variously as or "Asmodeo" (after [[Asmodeus]], king of the demons), broke with the history of the genre by writing of the upper classes in Madrid during the [[Spain under the Restoration|Restoration]], as in his ''Sueños y realidades ("Dreams and realities'', 1878). [[Enrique Sepúlveda]] wrote about&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; both Madrid&lt;ref name="Ángeles Ayala note" /&gt; and Barcelona, Narcís Oller (1846–1930) about Barcelona,&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; and [[Sabino de Goicoechea]] (1826–1901), known as "Argos", about the Basque Country.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bilbao.net/castella/residentes/vivebilbao/publicaciones/periodicobilbao/200504/pag08.pdf Antiguo edificio del Banco de España], ''Bilbao'' magazine, 2005-04, p. 8.

===''Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow''===
[[File:Doce Espanoles de Brocha Gorda - title page.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Doce españoles de brocha gorda…'', drawn by [[Fernando Miranda]].]]
Poet, journalist and pamphleteer [[Antonio Flores Algovia]] (1821–65), one of the contributors to ''Los españoles…'' followed up in 1846 with ''Doce españoles de brocha gorda, que no pudiéndose pintar a sí mismos, me han encargado a mí, Antonio Flores, sus retratos''&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Book is online at Google Books (in Spanish): [https://books.google.com/books?id=TesCAAAAYAAJ ''Doce españoles…'']&lt;/ref&gt; ("Twelve Spaniards with a broad brush, who not being able to portray themselves have put me, Antonio Flores, in charge of their portraits"), subtitled a "novel of popular customs" (''"novela de costumbres populares"''). Published in 1846 and reissued several times, the book merged the hitherto more essayistic ''costumbrista'' form with aspects of the [[novel]] (although not a particularly tightly plotted novel). Somewhat more novelistic was his ''Fe, Esperanza y Caridad'' ("Faith Hope and Charity"), published serially in ''La Nación''&lt;!-- many publications with this name; if we ever have an article on the right one, please link--&gt; in 1850–1851 and also much reprinted. Flores had been [[Eugène Sue]]'s translator into Spanish, and Sue's influence is strong in this work. Flores turned to again to ''custumbrismo'', of a sort, in 1853 with ''Ayer, hoy y mañana o la fe, el vapor y la electricidad (cuadros sociales de 1800, 1850 y 1899)'' ("Yesterday, today and tomorrow or faith, steam and electricity (social pictures of 1800, 1850, and 1899)") going Mesonero's "types lost" and "types found" one better by projecting a vision of the future influenced by the work of [[Émile Souvestre]]. His newspaper ''El Laberinto'' continued publishing his ''costumbrista'' work even posthumously, such as ''Tipos y costumbres españolas'' (1877).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[Eugenio de Ochoa]] (1815–72) carried ''costumbrismo'' in a different direction.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Born in the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque country]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/o/ochoa_eugenio.htm Eugenio de Ochoa], Biografías y Vidas. Accessed online 2010-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt; and moving often between Spain and France, his 1860 book ''Museo de las familias. París, Londres y Madrid'' ("Museum of families. Paris, London, Madrid") created a sort of cosmopolitan ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

Many of the great Spanish realist writers of the 19th century worked at times in the ''costumbrista'' mode, especially at the start of their careers. [[Fernán Caballero]] (pen name of  Cecilia Francisca Josefa Böhl de Faber) (1796–1877), for example, in the prose portions of her ''Cuentos y poesías populares andaluzas'' ("Popular Andalusian stories and poems", collected in 1859 from prior publication in magazines), writes within the genre, particularly in "Una paz hecha sin preliminares, sin conferencias y sin notas diplomáticas" ("A peace made without preliminaries, without conferences, and without diplomatic notes"), with its very specific setting in [[Chiclana de la Frontera]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The story is [https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;sig=bNbWBBn4Bw1X3DcEdSNjHS4nyCE&amp;ei=cZtXS4DFOY3mswPfxPjFBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=MiYRAAAAIAAJ&amp;ots=w9SNcmUnZ8#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false available online] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Antonio de Alarcón]] (1833–1891) issued a collection ''Cosas que fueron'', bringing together 16 ''costumbrista'' articles.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;
[[File:JMPereda.jpg|thumb|142px&lt;!--actual width of image--&gt;|left|[[José María de Pereda]]]]
Andrés Soria sees [[José María de Pereda]] (1833–1906) as the most successful fusion of ''costumbrista'' scenes into proper novels, especially his portrayals of ''La Montaña'', the mountainous regions of [[Cantabria]]. His ''Escenas montañesas'' (1864) is particularly in the ''costumbrista'' mode, with its mixture of urban, rural and seafaring scenes, and sections offering sketches of various milieus.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; Poet and novelist [[Antonio de Trueba]] (1819 or 1821–89) wrote squarely within the genre with ''Madrid por fuera'' and ''De flor en flor''. [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]] (1836–1870) portrayed Madrid, Seville, and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. [[José María Gabriel y Galán]] (1870–1905), best known as a poet, also wrote ''costumbrista'' pieces about [[Salamanca]]. [[Armando Palacio Valdés]] (1853–1938) also essayed the genre in newspaper articles, collected in ''Aguas fuertes'' ("Strong waters", 1884). The writer and diplomat [[Ángel Ganivet]] (1865–98),&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt; seen by some as a precursor to the [[Generation of '98]],&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Solalinde, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/40043365 review of Melchor Fernández Almagro's ''Vida y Obra de Ángel Ganivet''], 1927. Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; wrote ''costumbrista'' scenes of [[Granada]].&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

Elements of ''costumbrismo'', or even entire works in the genre, can be found among major Spanish writers of the 20th century, though to a lesser extent. [[Miguel de Unamuno]] (1864–1936) worked in the genre for ''De mi país'' ("Of my country", 1903) and some stories such as "Solitaña" in of ''El espejo de la muerte'' ("The Mirror of Death", 1913), as did [[Pío Baroja]] with ''Vitrina pintoresca'' ("Picturesque showcase", 1935) and in passages of his novels set in the Basque Country. [[Azorín]] (José Augusto Trinidad Martínez Ruíz, 1873–1967) often wrote in this genre; one could comb the works of [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]] (1888–1963) and [[Camilo José Cela]] (1916–2002) and find many passages that could come straight from a work of ''costumbrismo''. Although taken as a whole these writers are clearly not ''costumbristas'', they use the ''costumbrista'' style to evoke surviving remnants of Spain's past.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

===20th century literary ''costumbrismo'' in Spain===
The tradition of ''costumbrismo'' in Spain by no means ended at the turn of the century, but it simply did not play as important a role in 20th-century Spanish literature as it did in the century before. As noted [[#Costumbrismo by major Spanish realists|above]], several of the most important 20th-century Spanish writers at least dabbled in, or were influenced by, the genre. When we go beyond the first string of writers, we see more of a continuation of ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

In the course of the century, more and more Spanish regions asserted their particularity, allowing this now established technique of writing to be given new scope. In other regions—Madrid, Andalusia—''costumbrismo'' itself had become part of the region's identity. The magazine ''[[España (magazine)|España]]'', founded 1915, wrote about some new "types": the indolent ''golfo''; the lower class ''señorito chulo'' with his airs and exaggerated fashions; the ''albañil'' or construction worker, but with far less sympathy than ''costumbristas'' in the previous century had portrayed their predecessors. Other "types" were those who were a caricature of times past: ''el erudito'', with his vast but pointless book-learning, or ''El poeta de juegos florales'' ("the poet of floral games").&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

[[File:Blasco Ibañez.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]]]]
Andrés Soria describes 20th century regional ''costumbrismo'' as more serious, less picturesque, and more poetic than in the 19th century. Among his many examples of the 20th century continuation of ''costumbrismo'' are [[Santiago Rusiñol]] (1861–1931), writing in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] about [[Catalonia]] and [[Mallorca]]; numerous chroniclers of the Basque Country: [[José María Salaverría]] (1873–1940), [[Ricardo Baroja]] (1871–1953), [[Dionisio de Azkue]] ("Dunixi"), [[José María Iribarren]] (1906–1971), and, as mentioned above, Pío Baroja; [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] (1867–1928) writing about Valencia; and [[Vicente Medina Tomás]] (1866–1937), writing about Murcia.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

A strong current of ''costumbrismo'' continued in 20th-century Madrid, including in poetry ([[Antonio Casero]], 1874–1936) and theater ([[José López Silva (playwright)|José López Silva]], 1860–1925; [[Carlos Arniches Barreda]], 1866–1943). Other writers who continued the tradition were [[Eusebio Blasco]] (1844–1903), [[Pedro de Répide]] (1882–1947), [[Emiliano Ramírez Ángel]] (1883–1928), [[Luis Bello (writer)|Luis Bello]] (1872–1935), and [[Federico Carlos Sainz de Robles]] (1899–1983). Similarly, 20th century Andalusia saw work by [[José Nogales]] (1860?–1908), [[Salvador Rueda]] (1857–1933), [[Arturo Reyes]] (1864–1913), José Mas y Laglera (1885–1940), [[Ángel Cruz Rueda]] (1888–1961), and [[Antonio Alcalá Venceslada]] (1883–1955).&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

==''Costumbrismo'' in the visual arts in Spain==
[[File:JoaquinDominguezBecquer.jpg|thumb|An 1849 painting by [[Joaquín Domínguez Bécquer]] is typical of Andalusian costumbrismo.]]

Costumbrismo is an art form developed by Spanish painters. In the 19th-century, a wave of nationalistic fervour took hold, providing the stimulus for painters to focus on local customs (or ''costumbres''). &lt;ref&gt;Boone, E., ''Vistas de Espana,'' Yale University Press, 2007, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; As in literary ''costumbrismo'', Madrid and Andalusia (particularly Seville) were Spain's two great centers of ''costumbrismo'' in the visual arts. Andalusian ''costumbrista'' paintings were mainly romantic and folkloric, largely devoid of social criticism. Much of their market was to foreigners for whom Andalusia epitomized their vision of a Spain distinct from the rest of Europe. The ''costumbrista'' artists of Madrid were more acerbic, sometimes even vulgar, in portraying the life of lower class Madrid. More of their market was domestic, including to the often snobbish (and often Europeanizing and liberal) elite of the capital.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArteHist1&gt;[http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/8132.htm La pintura costumbrista] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002051251/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/artesp/contextos/8132.htm |date=2009-10-02 }}, ArteHistoria (Junta de Castilla y León). Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the School of Madrid often used large masses of solid color and painted with a broad brush, while the School of Seville painted more delicately. The Madrid paintings have a certain urgency, while the Seville paintings are typically serene, even misty. The Madrid painters focus more on unique individuals, the Sevillianos on individuals as representatives of a type.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;

[[File:Chorromujo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Costumbrismo'' can also be found in photography, as in this image of an Andalusian Gypsy wearing a ''[[sombrero de catite]]''.]]
Romantic Andalusian ''costumbrismo'' (''costumbrismo andaluz'') follows in the footsteps of two painters of the School of Cádiz, [[Juan Rodríguez y Jiménez]], "el Panadero" ("the Baker", 1765–1830) and [[Joaquín Manuel Fernández Cruzado]] (1781–1856), both associated with Romanticism. The trend was continued by the School of Seville, in a city much more on the path of a foreign clientele. The founding figure was [[José Domínguez Bécquer]] (1805–41), father of the poet Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer (see [[#Costumbrismo by major Spanish realists|above]]) and painter [[Valeriano Bécquer]] (1833–70), who moved to Madrid. Domínguez Bécquer's influence came as an art teacher, as well as an artist. His student and cousin [[Joaquín Domínguez Bécquer]] (1817–79) was known for his acute observation of light and atmosphere. Another of José Domínguez Bécquer's students, the bold and forceful [[Manuel Rodríguez de Guzmán]] (1818–67), may have been the genre's strongest painter.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Other important early figures were [[Antonio Cabral Bejarano]] (1788–1861), best known for paintings of individuals theatrically posed against rural backgrounds, and an atmosphere reminiscent of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], and [[José Roldán]] (1808–71), also very influenced by Murillo, known especially as a painter of children and urchins. One of Cabral Bejarano's sons, [[Manuel Cabral Bejarano]] (1827–91) began as a ''costumbrista'', but eventually became more of a [[realism (arts)|realist]]. Another son, [[Francisco Cabral Bejarano]] (1824–90), also painted in the genre.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Other painters of the School of Seville were [[Andrés Cortés]] (1810–79), [[Rafael García Hispaleto]] (1833–54), Francisco Ramos, and Joaquín Díez; history painter [[José María Rodríguez de Losada]] (1826–96); and portraitist [[José María Romero (artist)|José María Romero]] (1815–80).&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Typical subject matter included ''[[majo]]s'' (lower class [[Dandy|dandies]]) and their female equivalents, horsemen, bandits and smugglers, street urchins and beggars, Gypsies, traditional architecture, fiestas, and religious processions such as [[Holy Week in Seville]].

[[File:LEONARDO ALENZA - Sátira del suicidio romántico (Museo Romántico, Madrid, c. 1839).jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of [[Leonardo Alenza]]'s "Romantic Suicides".]]
The School of Madrid was united less by a common visual style than by an attitude, and by the influence of [[Francisco de Goya|Goya]] rather than Murillo.&lt;ref name="Reina Palazón" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt; Notable in this school were [[Leonardo Alenza|Alenza]] and [[Francisco Lameyer|Lameyer]], both contributors to ''Los españoles pintados por sí mismos''. Alenza, in particular, showed a strong influence from the [[Flanders|Flemish]] painters as well as from Goya. A fine portraitist who tended to take his subjects from among the common people, in some ways he epitomizes the difference between the School of Madrid and that of Seville. For him the "official" Romanticism was a topic to satirize, as in his series of paintings ''Suicidios románticos'' ("Romantic suicides").&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

[[File:Tercio de varas (Eugenio Lucas Velázquez).jpg|thumb|right|"Tercio de varas" ("[[Picador]]s"), [[Eugenio Lucas Velázquez]] c. 1850]]
Probably foremost in the School of Madrid was [[Eugenio Lucas Velázquez]] (1817–70). An artistic successor to Goya (though a more erratic painter than the master), Lucas Velázquez's work ranged from [[bullfighting]] scenes to [[Orientalism]] to scenes of [[witchcraft]]. His son [[Eugenio Lucas Villamil]] (1858–1918) and his students [[Paulino de la Linde]] (1837-?) and [[José Martínez Victoria]] followed in his tracks; he was also a strong influence on [[Antonio Pérez Rubio]] (1822–88) and [[Ángel Lizcano Monedero]] (1846–1929).&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

[[José Elbo]] (1804–44) was at least strongly akin to the School of Madrid. Although born in [[Úbeda]] in the Andalusian [[provinces of Spain|province]] of [[Jaén (Spanish province)|Jaén]], Elbo studied painting in Madrid under [[José Aparicio]] (1773–1838), and was influenced by Goya; he was also influenced by the [[Central Europe]]an equivalents of ''costumbrismo''. His painting is rife with social criticism, and often angrily populist.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

Also in Madrid, but not really part of the School of Madrid, was Valeriano Bécquer (transplanted son of José Domínguez Bécquer). Although also influenced by Goya (and by [[Diego Velázquez]]), his work in Madrid did partake of some of the socially critical aspects of the other painters of that city, but not of the satiric aspects: his portraits of common people emphasize their dignity, seldom their foibles.&lt;ref name=ArteHist1 /&gt;

The dark vision of 20th-century Madrid painter [[José Gutiérrez Solana]] (1886–1945) was influenced by ''costumbrismo'' and also directly by the [[Black Paintings]] of Goya that had so influenced the ''costumbristas''.&lt;ref name=Soria-1 /&gt;

==Visual ''costumbrismo'' in the Americas==
[[File:Arrietatertulia1.jpg|thumb|[[Agustín Arrieta|José Agustín Arrieta]], ''Tertulia de pulquería'', 1851]]
In nineteenth-century Mexico, colonial-era [[casta|casta paintings]], a type of secular [[genre painting]] depicting racial categories and hierarchy disappeared at independence when casta categories were abolished, but costumbrismo paintings resonated with the stereotypes of the earlier genre.&lt;ref&gt;Mey-Yen Moriuchi, "From Casta to Costumbrismo: Representations of Racialized Social Spheres" in ''Envisioning Others: Race: Color, and the Visual in Iberia and Latin America'', Pamela A. Patton, ed. Leiden: Brill 2016, pp. 213-240&lt;/ref&gt; A number of foreign visitors to Mexico produced images in the costumbrista tradition, including [[Claudio Linati]]&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Linati, ''Costumes, Civil, Militaires et Religieux du Mexique. Dessinés d;aorès Nature par C. Linati''. Bruxelles: Litographie Royal de Jobard 1828.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edouard Pingret]]. The most significant Mexican costumbrista painter is [[Agustín Arrieta|José Agustín Arrieta]], whose paintings of a market scene (''"La Sorpresa"''), a kitchen scene (''"La Cocina Poblana"''), and a tavern scene (''Tertulia de pulquería'') are well known.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny O.

==Literary ''costumbrismo'' in the Americas==

===Argentina===
[[File:Juan Bautista Alberdi.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]]]]
Some of [[Argentina]]'s most distinguished writers worked in the ''costumbrista'' genre in at least some of their writing, though few worked narrowly within the genre. [[Esteban Echeverría]] (1805–51) was a politically passionate Romantic writer whose work has strong ''costumbrista'' aspects; his ''[[El Matadero]]'' ("The Slaughterhouse") is still widely read. [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–84) and [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] (1811–1888) both wrote at times in the genre, as did [[José Antonio Wilde]] (1813–83), in ''Buenos Aires desde setenta años atrás'' ("Buenos Aires from seventy years ago"); [[Vicente G. Quesada]] (1830–1913), in ''Recuerdos de un viejo'' ("Memories of an old man"); [[Lucio V. López]] (1848–94), in the novela ''La gran aldea'' ("The big village"); [[Martín Coronado]] (1850–1919), playwright; [[Martiniano Leguizamón]] (1858–1935), in the novel ''Montaraz''; [[José S. Alvarez]] (1858–1903, "Fray Mocho"), in the story "Viaje al país de los matreros" ("A trip to bandit country"); [[Emma de la Barra]] (1861–1947), who wrote under the pseudonym [[César Duayen]], in ''Stella''; [[Joaquín V. González]] (1863–1923), in ''Mis montañas'' ("My Mountains"); [[Julio Sánchez Gardel]] (1879–1937), in numerous comedies; and [[Manuel Gálvez]] (1882–1962), in such novels as ''La maestra normal'' ("The [[normal school]] teacher") and ''La sombra del convento'' ("The sleep of the convent").&lt;ref name=Escudero&gt;Alfonso M.

===Bolivia===
[[Bolivia]]n ''costumbristas'' include [[Julio Lucas Jaimes]] (1845–1914), [[Lindaura Anzoátegui de Campero]] (1846–98), [[Jaime Mendoza]] (1874–1938), [[Alcides Arguedas]] (1879–1946), and [[Armando Chirveches]] (1881–1926).&lt;ref name=Escudero/&gt;

===Central America===
[[Guatemala]]n novelist and historian [[José Milla]] (1822–82) wrote several ''costumbrista'' works and created the character of ''[[Juan Chapín]]'', the emblematic Guatemalan. Other Central American ''costumbristas'' are [[José María Peralta Lagos]] (1875–1944, [[El Salvador]]), [[Ramón Rosa]] (1848–93, [[Honduras]]), [[Carlos Alberto Uclés]] (1854–1942, Honduras), and a distinguished line of [[Costa Rica]]n writers: [[Manuel de Jesús Jiménez]] (1854–1916), [[Manuel González Zeledón]] (1864–1936), the verse writer [[Aquileo Echeverría]] (1866–1909), and, in the 20th century, [[Joaquín García Monge]] (1881–1958).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Chile===
[[File:Jose Joaquin Vallejo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[José Joaquín Vallejo]] ("Jotabeche") ''The Chilean [[Mariano José de Larra|Larra]]'']]
''Costumbrismo'' enters [[Chile]]an literature in some of the writing of [[José Zapiola]] (1804–85), [[Vicente Pérez Rosales]] (1807–86), [[Román Fritis]] (1829–74), [[Pedro Ruiz Aldea]] (ca. 1833–70) and especially [[José Joaquín Vallejo]] (1811–58), who under the name "Jotabeche" was the supreme Chilean ''costumbrista''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

Strong aspects of ''costumbrismo'' can be seen in the novels and other works of [[Alberto Blest Gana]] (1830–1920). There are many ''costumbrista'' passages in the works of [[Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna]] (1831–86)  and [[Daniel Barros Grez]](1833–1904); [[Román Vial]] (1833–1896) entitled one of his books ''Costumbres chilenas''; [[Zorobabel Rodríguez (writer)|Zorobabel Rodríguez]] (1839–1901), [[Moisés Vargas]] (1843–98), [[Arturo Givovich]] (1855–1905), Daniel Riquelme (1854–1912), [[Senén Palacios]] (1858–1927), [[Egidio Poblete]] (1868–1940) all wrote in the mode at times. ''Costumbrismo'' figures particularly heavily in stage comedies: ''El patio de los Tribunales'' ("The courtyard of the tribunals [of justice]", by [[Valentín Murillo]] (1841–1896); ''Don Lucas Gómez'', by [[Mateo Martínez Quevedo]] (1848–1923); ''Chincol en sartén'' ("A sparrow in the pan") and ''En la puerta del horno'' ("In the [[gates of horn and ivory|gate of horn]]"), by [[Antonio Espiñeira]] (1855–1907); ''La canción rota'' ("The broken song"), by [[Antonio Acevedo Hernández]] (1886–1962); ''Pueblecito'' ("Little town") by [[Armando Moock]] (1894–1942). In prose, ''costumbrismo'' mixes eventually into realism, with [[Manuel J. Ortiz]] (1870–1945) and [[Joaquín Díaz García]] (1877–1921) as important realists with ''costumbrista'' aspects.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Colombia===
[[File:Fi 322 Isaacs, Jorge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jorge Isaacs]]]]
[[Colombia]] can claim one of the earliest antecedents to the ''costumbrismo'' in ''[[El Carnero]]'' (written 1636–38, but not published until 1859) by [[Juan Rodríguez Freile]] (1566–1638 or 1640),&lt;ref&gt;Escudero says 1638, Stephen M. Hart says 1640.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodríguez's work begins as a chronicle of the conquest of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]], but as it approaches his own time it becomes more and more detailed and quotidian, and its second half is a series of narratives that, according to Stephen M. Hart, give "lip service" to conventional morality while taking "a keen delight in recounting the various skullduggeries of witches, rogues, murderers, whores, outlaws, priests and judges."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Hart, ''A companion to Latin American literature'', Volume 243 of Colección Támesis. Serie A, Monografías, Tamesis Books, 2007, {{ISBN|1-85566-147-0}}. p. 50–51.

Colombia can also claim a particularly rich tradition of ''costumbrismo'' in the 19th century and into the 20th: [[José Manuel Groot]] (1800–78); novelists [[Eugenio Díaz]] (1803–65), [[José Manuel Marroquín]] (1827–1908), and [[José María Vergara y Vergara]] (1831–72), all of whom collaborated on the magazine ''El Mosaico, la revista bogotana del costumbrismo'' (1858–71); [[Luis Segundo Silvestre]] (1838–87); and [[Jorge Isaacs]] (1837–95), whose sole novel ''[[María (novel)|María]]'' was praised by Alfonso M. Escudero as the greatest Spanish-language romantic novel.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

Other Colombian ''costumbristas'' are [[José Caycedo Rojas]] (1816–1897), [[Juan de Dios Restrepo]] (1823–94), [[Gregorio Gutiérrez González]] (1826–72), [[Ricardo Carrasquilla]] (1827–86), [[Camilo A. Echeverri]] (1827–87), [[Manuel Pombo]] (1827–98), [[José David Guarín]] (1830–90), [[Ricardo Silva (writer 1836-87)|Ricardo Silva]] (1836–87), [[José María Cordovez Moure]] (1835–1918), [[Rafael María Camargo]] (1858–1926; wrote under the pseudonym [[Fermín de Pimentel y Vargas]]), and [[Tomás Carrasquilla]] (1858–1940).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Cuba===
[[Cuba]]'s leading ''costumbristas'' were [[Gaspar Betancourt Cisneros]] (1803–66, known as "El Lugareño"), [[Cirilo Villaverde]] (1812–94), and [[José María de Cárdenas y Rodríguez]] (1812–82). The patrician Betancourt published a series of ''Escenas cotidianas que abren camino al costumbrismo en Cuba'' ("Day-to-day scenes that open a road to ''costumbrismo'' in Cuba, 1838–40). His work focused often on what he found vulgar or ridiculous about Cuban life, but was written with a fatherly affection.  Villaverde, probably Cuba's greatest ''costumbrista'', wrote romantic novels, most notably ''[[Cecilia Valdés]]'' (the first part of which was published in 1839, although the definitive version was not published until 1882). This ''costumbrista'' [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] novel can be seen as an early realist work, and continues to be read in recent times. Villaverde also wrote the prologue for Cárdenas's 1847 collection of ''costumbrista''articles.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;
 
[[José Victoriano Betancourt]] (1813–75) was patron to many intellectuals in 1860s [[Havana]]; he later went into exile in Mexico. He is best remembered today as a ''costumbrista'' writer, as is another Betancourt, [[José Ramón Betancourt]] (1823–90), author of ''Una feria de caridad en 183…'' (ellipses in original title), set in [[Camagüey]] in the late 1830s.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;José Ramón Betancourt, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btdN-x8HzesC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Una feria de caridad en 183…]'', Third Edition, Barcelona, 1885.

===Dominican Republic===
In the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Francisco Gregorio Billini]] (1844–94) stands out for his novel ''Baní o Engracia y Antoñita'' (1892).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt; Still, in some ways, his vision was narrow. J. Alcántara Almánzar remarks that "black people are practically absent as important characters, and this absence is very significant in a country whose majority is 'mulatto'." Blacks are more present in the ''costumbrista'' works of [[Cesar Nicolas Penson]] (1855–1901), but he is far more sympathetic to his white characters, portraying [[Haiti]]ans as fierce beasts.&lt;ref name="Alcántara Almánzar"&gt;J.

===Ecuador===

[[Ecuador]]ians who wrote at least part of the time in the ''costumbrista'' mode include [[Pedro Fermín Cevallos]] (1812–93), [[Juan León Mera]] (1832–94), [[José Modesto Espinosa]] (1833–1915), [[Carlos R. Tobar]] (1854–1920), [[Honorato Vázquez]] (1855–1933), [[Víctor M. Rendón]] (1859–1940), [[J. Trajano Mera]] (1862–1919), and [[Luis A. Martínez]] (1868–1909).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt; Another Ecuadorian &lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt; was [[Alfredo Baquerizo Moreno]] (1859–1951), a novelist&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt; and later president of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo1/b1.htm Alfredo Baquerizo Moreno] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106002130/http://diccionariobiograficoecuador.com/tomos/tomo1/b1.htm |date=2010-01-06 }}, diccionariobiograficoecuador.com. Accessed online 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Mexican ''costumbrismo'' can claim one of the longest lineages to be found in the Americas. In the same era in which the genre was gaining an identity in Spain, [[José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi]] (1776–1827) Mexico's first novelist (and perhaps Latin America's first novelist) wrote works that had many similar aspects, including ''Periquillo Sarniento'' (1816), recently translated into English as ''[[The Mangy Parrot]]''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Tuck, [http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/277-mexico-s-voltaire-jos%C3%A9-joaqu%C3%ADn-fern%C3%A1ndez-de-lizardi-1776%E2%80%931827 Mexico's Voltaire: José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi (1776–1827)], Mexconnect.com, 2008-10-09. Accessed online 2010-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mexican ''costumbristas'' are [[Guillermo Prieto]] (1818–97) and  [[José Tomás de Cuéllar]] (1830–94). In addition, [[José López Portillo y Rojas]] (1850–1923), [[Rafael Delgado]] (1853–1914), [[Ángel del Campo]] (1868–1908) and [[Emilio Rabasa]] (1856–1930) can be seen as ''costumbristas'', but their work can also be considered realist.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Paraguay===
[[Paraguay]]an ''costumbristas'' include [[Teresa Lamas Carísimo de Rodríguez Alcalá]] (1887–1976) and [[Carlos Zubizarreta]] (1904–72).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Peru===
[[File:Palma1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ricardo Palma]]]]
[[Peru]]vian ''costumbrismo'' begins with [[José Joaquín de Larriva y Ruiz]] (1780–1832), poeta and journalist and his younger, irreverent, Madrid-educated collaborator [[Felipe Pardo y Aliaga]] (1806–68). A more festive and comic note was struck by [[Manuel Ascensio Segura]] (1805–71). [[Manuel Atanasio Fuentes]] (1820–29) wrote verse under the name ''El Murciélago'' ("the Bat"), a name which he also gave to a magazine he founded.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

[[Ricardo Palma]] (1833–1919), best known for the multi-volume ''[[Tradiciones peruanas]]'', was a man of letters, a former liberal politician and later the director of the [[National Library of Peru]], who rebuilt the collection of that library after the [[War of the Pacific]]. He referred to his works in this mode as ''tradiciones'', rather than ''costumbrismo''.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Conway, "Chronology of Ricardo Palma", p. ''xv.–xvii.'' of Helen Lane's translation of ''Tradiciones peruanas'', ''Peruvian Traditions'', Library of Latin America, Oxford University Press US, 2004, {{ISBN|0-19-515909-8}}.

Other Peruvian ''costumbristas'' are satirist and verse writer [[Pedro Paz Soldán y Unanue]] (1839–1895), [[Abelardo M. Gamarra]] (1850–1924), and the nostalgic [[José Gálvez (writer)|José Gálvez]] (1885–1957).&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

Alonso]] (1822–89) published ''El gibaro: cuadro de costumbres de la isla de Puerto Rico'' (The ''[[Jíbaro]]'' [modern spelling]: picture of customs of the island of Puerto Rico", 1849), Puerto Rico's most important contribution to the genre. [[Manuel Fernández Juncos]] (1846–1928), born in [[Asturias]], Spain, emigrated at age eleven to the island and wrote ''Tipos y caracteres y Costumbres y tradiciones'' ("Types and characters and customs and traditions").&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.educastur.princast.es/cp/manuelfe/Mfjuncos.htm Manuel Fernández Juncos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414032639/http://web.educastur.princast.es/cp/manuelfe/Mfjuncos.htm |date=2009-04-14 }}, educastur.princast.es (Consejería de Educación y Ciencia del Gobierno del Principado de Asturias).

Most of these writers also did significant work outside of the genre.&lt;ref name=Escudero /&gt;

===Venezuela===
Venezuelan ''costumbristas'' include [[Fermín Toro]] (c.1807–65),&lt;ref&gt;Escudero appears to have the wrong date of death (1868) and a questionable date of birth (1808) for this well-known figure.

[[File:WP DYN1.jpg|thumb|First issue of the magazine, [[Mexico]], 1942]]
[[File:Dyn 4-5, Mexico 1943.tif|thumb|Title page of ''DYN'' 4-5 (Amerindian Number), Mexico, 1943]]

'''''DYN''''' (derived from the Greek word ''κατὰ τὸ δυνατόν'', ''that which is possible'') was an [[list of art magazines|art magazine]] founded by the Austrian-Mexican [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Wolfgang Paalen]], published in [[Mexico City]], and distributed in [[New York City]], [[Paris]], and [[London]] between 1942 and 1944. Only six issues were produced.

== Background ==
With his journal Paalen in his work as Editeur gave himself the opportunity to fully develop his intellectual abilities with the evident but nevertheless for himself surprising result that he temporarily advanced to one of the most influential art theorists during the war. In seven large essays and countless smaller articles and reviews he discussed in detail all current hot topics that also concerned the young artists in New York, and in response received their full attention: the new image as potential picture-being; morality, deliberated of Marxist means-end thinking; plastic automatism – deliberated of the bondage of preconceived literary contents; dialectical materialism – unmasked as rooted in nothing else than a cleverly exploited mental weakness; microphysics -  as confirmation of the viewer-dependent, potential nature of all being;  the flat and rhythmical canvases of cubism - as true origin of a new spatial adventure overcoming the painting as window; and over all the female Totem as a mantra for a dialogical self-expression. One of the main underlying notions of DYN was the attempt to reconcile diverging materialist and mystical tendencies in [[Surrealism]] with a new art-philosophy of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingency]]. Breton, however, reacted as deeply offended, and in the preface of ''[[VVV (magazine)|VVV]]'' argued: "We reject the lie of an open surrealism, in which anything is possible".

== Contributors ==
Paalen dominated its contents as editor and contributed its major topics in seven large essays and numerous smaller reviews and articles. ''DYN'''s editorial board later enlisted a number of associated thinkers and artists, including [[Miguel Covarrubias]], [[César Moro]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] and [[Robert Motherwell]]. Each edition covered various subjects and themes, such as [[poetry]], [[visual arts]], [[anthropology]], [[science]], and [[philosophy]], and was illustrated by a wide range of artists, including [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]], [[Alice Rahon]], [[William Baziotes]], [[Robert Motherwell|Motherwell]], [[Roberto Matta]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Harry Holtzman]], and [[Henry Moore]].

== Numbers ==
In the first number (April-May 1942) Paalen emphasized his will to rediscuss some of the fundamentals in surrealist theory and publicly announced to his friend Breton his "farewell to surrealism." Paalen's main intention of this provocation was to tease the dogmatic attitudes implicit in surrealist theory. The number contained also his groundbreaking essay ''The New Image'', in which he tried to find criteria for true modernism in painting, which should have a "pre-figurative" essence and not stick to contents of the personal memory of the artist.

In the second issue (July-August) he published a survey on [[dialectical materialism]] which consisted of a set of three questions sent to two dozen outstanding scholars and writers, and the statements of those who responded. In a provocative and straightforward way Paalen enquires after the academic validity of the philosophy of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] as a science. Half of the addressees replied, amongst them [[Albert Einstein]], [[Clement Greenberg]], and [[Bertrand Russell]]. The majority answered all questions ''No''. Russell answered bluntly: "I think the metaphysics of both Hegel and Marx plain nonsense - Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than Mary Baker Eddy's." The number contained also Paalen´s pleading for a cognitive perception of inspiration (''Surprise and Inspiration'').

The third number was released already in autumn 1942 with Paalen´s essay "Art and Science" about the Goethe-Newton debate on light, adapted to the dangerous imbalance of scientific and artistic notions in the modern world in view of the atomical danger. It contained also essays and poetical texts by [[Gustav Regler]], Edward Renouf, [[Henry Miller]], [[Anais Nin]], [[Valentine Penrose]], [[César Moro]] and [[Alice Paalen]].

The fourth and fifth number were released together after Paalen´s long illness as the "Amer-Indian Number" (DYN 4-5) with Paalen´s long expected essay on "Totem Art" about his vision of the ancestor-art of the indigenous populations of British Columbia. It contained also critiques of famous anthropologists and archaeologists like [[Alfonso Caso]] ("The [[Codices of Azoyu]]"), [[Miguel Covarrubias]] ("[[Tlatilco]], Archaic Mexican Art and Culture"", on [[Olmecs]]), [[Maud Worcester Makemson]] ("The Enigma of Maya Astronomy"), Jorge Enciso ("Seals of the Ancient Mexicans"), Miguel Angel Fernandez ("New Discoveries in the Temple of the Sun in Palenque"), Carlos R. Margain Araujo ("The Painting in Mexican Codices") and [[Francisco Diaz de Leon]] ("Gabriel Vicente Gahona"). With his essay "Birth of Fire" Paalen provided the mythological discourse in surrealism with his interpretation of [[Prometheus]] as the primordial artists marking the epochal change from matriarchal to patriarchal cultures and the pyramid as the symbol of "Mother-Earth" derived from the appearance of a new [[volcano]]; together with [[Gordon Onslow Ford]] and Jacqueline Johnson he had visited the just rising volcano [[Paricutin]].

The sixth and last number was entirely dedicated to contemporary modern art, introduced by Paalen´s essay "On the Meaning of Cubism Today", in which he draws [[cubism]] as the model for the self-reflecting potential and the implicit spatiality of the pure means rhythm, light and colour in painting. [[Robert Motherwell]] published his essay "The Modern Painter´s World", other essays and poetical texts were added by Jacqueline Johnson ("The Earth" and "Exposition Alice Paalen"), [[Miguel Covarrubias]] ("[[La Venta]]"), [[Anais Nin]] ("The Eye´s Journey"), [[Gustav Regler]] ("L´Île à Deux Faces" and "Rencontre des Villes"), [[César Moro]] ("Le Temps") and Eva Sulzer ("Rêves de Papillons").

== Reception ==
Breton admitted in 1944 that Paalen´s criticism of Surrealism was justified and that "we (the Surrealists) have left the whole licence to Paalen, who could say whatever he liked, without having the means to say something against or at least put something at his level. Paalen is winning on the whole line."&lt;ref&gt;André Breton in his letters to [[Benjamin Péret]], 26 May and 31 May 1944 (Bibliothèque Doucet, Paris)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of Totem Art, all essays were republished in ''Form and Sense'' by Robert Motherwell in New York in 1945 in occasion of Paalen´s one-man-show at Peggy Guggenheim´s Art of This Century Gallery. The number ''Possibilities'', in which the young New York artists published their first statements, was the second number of this series.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Motherwell published Paalen´s collected essays as the first number of the series ''Problems of Contemporary Art'' in New York in 1945; ''Form and Sense'' has been re-published in 2013 by Deborah Rosenthal with a foreword by [[Martica Sawin]]. Wolfgang Paalen, Form and Sense, Meanings and Movements in Twentieth-Century Art, New York (Arcade Publishing/Artists and Art) 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The positive impact on New York's younger generation of artists and their first publications, such as ''Possibilities'' (ed. by Motherwell and Rosenblum in 1947) was crucial. Motherwell translated Paalen's programatical essay "Image Nouvelle" into English ("The New Image"). Motherwell's collage ''Surprise and Inspiration'' ([[Peggy Guggenheim Collection]]) was named after Paalen's essay with the same title. Motherwell had translated this article for ''DYN'' and the collage was published next to it.

'''Eric Newton''' (1893–1965) was an English artist, writer, broadcaster and art critic. He produced several books in addition to his newspaper and radio work and created mosaics for Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, mostly on a religious theme. His radio broadcasts made him well known to the British public in the 1930s.

==Career==
After gaining a BA from [[Manchester University]] in 1913, he worked as a designer at Ludwig Oppenheimer Ltd, the [[mosaic]] firm founded by his grandfather and based in Old Trafford, Manchester. His work, and that of the Oppenheimer firm is still to be seen in several churches in Britain and Ireland. He took part in the [[International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts|Paris exhibition]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=obittimes&gt;{{Cite news |title=Obituary. Mr. Eric Newton |newspaper=The Times |date=11 March 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is best known as an art critic and writer. He was appointed art critic of the [[Manchester Guardian]] in 1930, although he had provided copy for that paper for some years prior to this. He was art critic for [[The Times]] for three years from 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/newtone.htm | title=Dictionary of Art Historians. E. Newton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote frequently for the [[New York Times]], [[Time and Tide (magazine)|''Time and Tide'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Eric Newton, 71, London Art Critic.

Newton delivered radio lectures on art, notably the 1935 [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] 12 part series "The Artist and his Public" subsequently turned into the first of several books.&lt;ref name=Rfield&gt;{{cite web |title=''L.

In this programme, his Times Obituary states "his lucidity and critical sense were trenchantly displayed".&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt; The Oxford Dictionary of Art describes him as "a clear and polished writer and also an articulate lecturer and radio broadcaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1952 |title= Oxford Dictionary of Art |url= |location= |publisher=OUP |isbn=978-0-19-172762-7 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These broadcasts made his name well known and local newspaper archives reveal that Newton was clearly in demand, delivering public lectures across the country in the late 1930s and 1940s.

Newton undertook lecture tours to North America in 1937, 1953 and 1956, the 1937 tour of Canada was sponsored by the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. His diary of this tour was subsequently published (see below). The 1956 tour included the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] where he lectured on modern art. A photograph exists in the university archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eric Newton visits the University to lecture on Modern Art :: S.J. Carew Photograph Collection|url=http://collections.mun.ca/u?/sjcarew,843 |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton was lecturer in art history at the [[Central School of Art and Design|Central School of Art and crafts]] from 1963.&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt;

His MA, completed in 1951 at Manchester was on the subject of the renaissance artist [[Tintoretto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |degree=M.A. |first=Eric |last=Newton |title=Tintoretto and the Scuolo and Church of San Rocco, Venice.|publisher=Manchester University |year=1951 |docket=Th8458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently published in 1952 as a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |year= 1952 |title= Tintoretto |url= |location= |publisher=Longmans, Green |isbn=978-0-8371-4501-3 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton was [[Slade Professor of Fine Art#Slade Professors, Oxford University|Slade Professor of Fine Art]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] in 1959&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213123228/http://www.hoa.ox.ac.uk/fileadmin/hoa/documents/pdf/Oxford_Slade_Professors.pdf |archivedate=13 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 15 April 1958 p 8&lt;/ref&gt; and art adviser to the [[Commonwealth Institute]] from 1960 to 1963. He was president of the British Section of the [[International Association of Art Critics]] between 1949 and 1961.&lt;ref name=obittimes /&gt;

While he left the family firm, he continued to create mosaics for much of his life, those in the side chapels of [[Sacred Heart Church, Hillsborough|Sacred Heart Church]] Sheffield being installed in 1961. The [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] holds many designs of Newton Mosaics and theatre set designs in its Stella Newton Archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Courtauld Institute of Art Newsletter Feb 2010 |url=http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/booklibrary/collections_services/documents/2010-02Newsletter.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100921200623/http://courtauld.ac.uk/booklibrary/collections_services/documents/2010-02Newsletter.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Newton was born in 1893 to Lehmann James Oppenheimer and Edith née Newton. His mother was from [[Heaton Mersey]].&lt;ref&gt;1911 census&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908 he was awarded a Foundation Scholarship to [[Hulme Grammar School]] from [[William Hulme#Hulme.27s Charity|Hulme's Charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hulme's Charity |newspaper=Manchester Courier |date=1 October 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation from Manchester University, he served in the army during the [[First World War]], joining the [[Manchester Regiment]] as a 2nd Lieutenant from the Manchester University Contingent of the [[Officer Training Corps]] on 14 November 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=28973 |date=13 November 1914 |page=9276 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary captain in September 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=29312 |date=1 October 1915 |page=9664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His medal card suggests he served in France and was awarded the [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] and [[British War Medal]].&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] Catalogue Reference:WO/372/14&lt;/ref&gt;

His father (also a mosaic manufacturer in the family firm) served as a lieutenant in the London Regiment ([[Artists Rifles|Artists' Rifles]]) and died in 1916&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/regimentalrollof00highiala#page/10/mode/2up|title=The regimental roll of honour and war record of the Artists' Rifles (1/28th, 2/28th and 3/28th battalions, the London Regiment T.

Lehmann is buried in the [[Boulogne]] Eastern Cemetery (Grave ref VII. B. 11.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/48333/OPPENHEIMER,%20LEHMANN%20JAMES|title=CWGC - Casualty Details|author=Reading Room Manchester|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the [[London Gazette]] records the recruitment of "Eric Newton Oppenheimer", and promotion of "Eric N. Oppenheimer", it was after the war that he formally changed his name from Oppenheimer to his mother's maiden name of Newton, the latter sounding less German. He married his first wife, Isabel Aileen Vinicombe on 29 November 1915 at the Church of St James, Birch in [[Rusholme]],.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lan-opc.org.uk/Manchester/Rusholme/stjames/marriages_1896-1921.html|title=Lancashire OnLine Parish Clerk Project |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple divorced in 1934 after which Newton married the fashion designer [[Stella Mary Newton|Stella Mary Pearce]]. The couple moved to London, living at 3 Cumberland Gardens. Newton died in his London office in 1965.

[[File:Alison Carroll 6.jpg|thumb|Video game heroine [[Lara Croft]], here portrayed by [[Alison Carroll]], is a common example cited for the [[sexual objectification]] of women in games.]]

The portrayal of men and women in [[video games]], as in other media, is a subject of research in [[gender studies]] and is discussed in the context of [[sexism in video gaming]].

Although women make up about half of video game players, they are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, despite the prominence of iconic heroines such as [[Samus Aran]] or [[Lara Croft]]. The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]] or negative stereotypes, such as that of the "[[damsel in distress]]". Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and [[LGBT]] characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the [[heteronormativity]] of the medium.

Research indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do. On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.

A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that half of all American video game players were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both men and women play video games, but studies suggest differences in platform and game genre preference.&lt;ref name=Joystiq&gt;{{cite web|title=LReport: Men play more MMOs, FPSes; women rule mobile, RPG|author=Jessica Conditt|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/27/report-men-play-more-mmos-fpses-women-rule-mobile-rpg|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Entertainment Software Rating Board reports that in 2010, 80% of female console gamers played on Wii, 11% on Xbox360 and 9% on PS3. By comparison, 38% of male console gamers in the year 2014 played Xbox 360, 41% played Wii and 21% played PS3.&lt;ref name="Video Game Stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Do You Know About Video Games?|author=ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/video-game-industry-statistics.jsp|accessdate=2014-11-09|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]] looked at the different mobile gaming preferences between men and women. Women made up 60–80% of the solitaire, slots, social turn-based, match-three / bubble-shooter, management / simulation and quiz game markets. Men on the other hand, made up between 60–80% of the strategy, shooter, card battle, racing and action RPG markets.&lt;ref name="Furry App statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Love, Courtship and the Promiscuous Male Mobile Gamer |author=Dan Laughlin |url=http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer#.VIl21DGUfjU=2014-11-09 |date=2014-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125905/http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer |archivedate=2014-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres are attracting one gender more than the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; {{Clear}}

===As player characters===

====Prevalence====
Playable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivory, J. D. (2006). [http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf Still a man's game: Gender representation in online reviews of video games.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224015022/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf |date=2014-12-24 }} Mass Communication &amp; Society, 9(1), 103-114. The sample of reviews was taken from the "Top Rated" and "Most Popular" lists from [[GameSpot]] on March 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. K., &amp; Summers, A. (2007). [http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf Gender differences in video game characters' roles, appearances, and attire as portrayed in video game magazines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101083815/http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf |date=2015-01-01 }} Sex roles, 57(9-10), 733-742.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by Melinda C. R. Burgess et al. found that men are featured much more often than women on the covers of console video games.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Melinda C. R. |author2=Steven Paul Stermer |author3=Stephen R. Burgess|title=Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Portrayal of Male and Female Characters on Video Game Covers|journal=Sex Roles|date=30 June 2007|pages=419–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9250-0|volume=57|issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"/&gt;

According to Madeline Messer writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2015, among the top 50 [[Platform game#Endless running game|endless running]] games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. Only 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=Madeline|title=I’m a 12-year-old girl. Why don’t the characters in my apps look like me?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/04/im-a-12-year-old-girl-why-dont-the-characters-in-my-apps-look-like-me/|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
[[Samus Aran]], the heroine of ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and its successors, is often cited as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream video game".&lt;ref name="Guinness2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd | authorlink=Feature: Girl Power-Up | year=2012 | page=154 | isbn=9781904994954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other earlier games featured female player characters, such as Toby Masuyo ("Kissy") from ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/namcoxcapcom/namcoxcapcom2.htm#tobymasuyo | title=Obscure Namco characters | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Kurt Kalata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2009/10/nintendo_download_13_14_october_2009_japan | title=Nintendo Download: 13-14 October 2009 (Japan) | publisher=nintendolife.com | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Sean Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Kurumi-Hime from ''[[Sega Ninja]]'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-princess/ | title=Ninja Princess | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=12 September 2017 | author=Sam Derboo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in ''Psychological Record'' (Vol.29, No.1. Pp.&amp;nbsp;43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer).&lt;ref name=leroux&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''Revue des Sciences de l'Education''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, professor [[Sara Kiesler]] et al. published a study in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (Vol.17, No.3.

The year 2013 featured women in leading roles in a number of award-winning games such as ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013), ''[[BioShock Infinite|Bioshock Infinite]]'' (2013), the rebooted ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2013), and ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'' (2013). A study of these games found that although the leading female characters in these games were able to subvert predominant gender stereotypes, women were still limited by men in the narratives, in particular through benevolent sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perreault|first=Mildred F.|last2=Perreault|first2=Gregory Pearson|last3=Jenkins|first3=Joy|last4=Morrison|first4=Ariel|date=2016-12-16|title=Depictions of Female Protagonists in Digital Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412016679584|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|doi=10.1177/1555412016679584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'' became a focus of discussions in gaming media. This indicated, according to game industry professionals cited by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', a shift in the industry's attention towards issues of diversity in gaming, in conjunction with video games as a whole growing beyond their former core audience of younger men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crecente|first1=Brian|title=As game players diversify, developers start to rethink the stars of their games|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/23/5834628/women-in-video-games-heroines-e3-2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=Polygon|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of color or [[people of color]] as a whole are less likely to be represented by the popular games and more likely to be represented as a stereotype.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Video Games|last=Peng|first=Mou|publisher=IGI Global|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a higher chance of people of color, especially women, to be portrayed as villains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blonde hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the evil villain character Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games that Peach was not kidnapped in were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series or had the pattern altered.&lt;ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games"&gt;[http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games "Objectification of Women in Video Games"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518004756/http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games |date=2015-05-18 }}, Retrieved 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In video games, the major stereotyped myths of women are typically the damsel in distress, hyper-sexualized villain (Sylvia Christel from ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'') and the sexy/strong best friend ([[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''). ... In all of these instances, the female character is, more likely than not, in love with the male protagonist or trying desperately to bang him."&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of games feature a female character as an ally or [[sidekick]] to the male hero. Some of them, like [[Ada Wong]] of ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and [[Mona Sax]] of ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', were turned into [[player character]]s in later instances of their series. [[Alyx Vance]], a supporting protagonist of ''[[Half-Life 2]]'', was praised for her "stinging personality" and intelligence, developing a close bond with the player without simply being "eye candy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 Top 50 Videogame Hotties] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215002247/http://ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties/?cur=alyx-vance&amp;morepics=17 |date=2009-02-15 }}.

===Sexualization===
The portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexualization]] of female characters, done to appeal to a presumed male audience,&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"/&gt; as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. Research on exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines has asked whether it reduces male compassion toward women, and reduces women's perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

====Prevalence====
In their 2005 study, Dill and Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as "eroticized aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dill|first=Karen E.|author2=Thill K. P.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles: Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions|journal=Sex Roles|year=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociology professor and researcher Tracy Dietz, women are often depicted in stereotypical roles that typically pertain to sexuality in which the woman focuses upon beauty/physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; According to an analysis conducted by Downs and Smith, playable and plot relevant characters in the 60 best selling video games of 2003 were predominantly male. Females who were depicted were frequently sexualized. The female characters analyzed were depicted partially naked or with unrealistic proportions more often than the male characters were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|date=2 September 2009|volume=62|issue=11-12|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|language=en|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 225 video game covers found that both male and female character's physiques were over-exaggerated, but women were more "physically altered" (especially in the bust) than their male counterparts, and even more so if the female was the main character of the game.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

A 2016 study of 571 games released between 1984 and 2014&lt;ref name="Lynch et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynch|first1=Teresa|last2=Tompkins|first2=Jessica E.|last3=van Driel|first3=Irene I.|last4=Fritz|first4=Niki|title=Sexy, Strong, and Secondary: A Content Analysis of Female Characters in Video Games across 31 Years|journal=Journal of Communication|date=30 June 2016|doi=10.1111/jcom.12237}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the sexualization of female characters was at its height between 1990 and 2005, and then began to significantly decline. It also determined that there was no significant difference in sexualization between games rated as "Teen" (for ages 13 and up) and "Mature" (17 and up) by the [[ESRB]], indicating that sexualized women in games are so prevalent that they are not thought of as objectionable to children. Less sexualization was found in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], which are played more often by women, than in action and fighting games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survey of 31 years of video games shows a decline in sexualized female characters|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-survey-years-video-games-decline.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 reboot of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' drew controversy when ''[[Kotaku]]'' described it as using rape for Lara Croft's character development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You'll 'Want To Protect' The New, Less Curvy Lara Croft|url=http://kotaku.com/5917400/youll-want-to-protect-the-new-less-curvy-lara-croft |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers denied that the scene depicted an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Are No Longer Referring to Game's Attempted 'Rape' Scene As an Attempted Rape Scene|url=http://kotaku.com/5918193/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-attempted-rape-scene-as-an-attempted-rape-scene |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Say 'Rape' Is Not A Word In Their Vocabulary|url=http://kotaku.com/5922228/tomb-raider-creators-say-rape-is-not-a-word-in-their-vocabulary |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of men==
Men are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. A recurring depiction of male sexuality is the ''power fantasy,'' where an apparent sexualization as an object of desire and [[hypermasculinity]] are overruled by the character's agency as the protagonist and  avatar for the player’s power within the game world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames.html|title=The Three Modes of Male Sexuality in Videogames|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As powerful===
Men in games tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Virtual muscularity: a content analysis of male video game characters|date=2011|journal=Body Image|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–51|vauthors=Martins N, Williams DC, Ratan RA, Harrison K|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2010.10.002|pmid=21093394}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Following the releases of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, [[Trevor Philips]] and [[Michael De Santa]], have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as "liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=On Gender and 'GTA 5'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/09/26/on-gender-and-gta-5/|accessdate=April 24, 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as "the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/are-video-games-really-sexist/?page=2|title=Are video games really sexist?|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamin Warren]] on PBS Game/Show highlighted that video games could promote "unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader". He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.&lt;ref name= GameShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrActT_7X6U |title=Do Videogame Stereotypes Hurt Men? |accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As sexualized===
Multiple critics point out the "[[male gaze]]" as the reason why male characters are not overtly sexualized in the same way as female characters are, mentioning the assumption in the video game industry that a majority of [[gamer]]s are heterosexual men, to whom companies cater.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/151713-on-mens-sexualization-in-video-games/|title=On Mens Sexualization in Video Games|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante Douglas of [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]] identifies the "power fantasy" alongside two other stereotypes, men as ''gender performance'' and as ''fan interpretation'':&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In the interpretation as gender performance under an heteronormative perspective, a male being sexy is seen as an opposite of masculinity. In this view, depictions of males as objects of desire are coded by including feminine traits, vanity and attention to personal attires, or [[queer]] codes, often depicted as humorous.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.your-critic.com/2011/06/gamers-gaze-part-1.html|title=Your Critic is in Another Castle: The Gamer's Gaze, part 1|website=www.your-critic.com|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishōnen]] archetype is an example of this portrayal, as well as characters like [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]] from ''Street Fighter'', [[Mettaton]] from ''Undertale,'' [[Maxi (Soulcalibur)|Maxi]] and [[Raphael (Soulcalibur)|Raphael]] from ''Soul Calibur'', and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] from ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A different way of sexualizing male characters is that performed by players and fans communities, in particular for characters open to their own emotions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Douglas identifies as traits of these characters the space dedicated in the game to show their personality, shown through their interactions with other characters, and their agency through those interactions rather than pure displays of strength and power. Because of these traits, this category of characters occurs most often with non-player characters.

==Portrayal of LGBT characters==
{{main article|LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters in video games}}

[[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]]) characters have been included in video games as early as the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":rated m"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rated M for Mature : Sex and Sexuality in Video Games|last=Wysocki|first=Matthew|last2=Lauteria|first2=Evan W.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781628925760|location=New York, NY|pages=42–57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 4 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Laura Kate|title=The Video Game Characters You Never Knew Were LGBT|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/10/04/the-video-game-characters-you-never-knew-were-lgbt|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Kotaku]] UK|date=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]], in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. Companies [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]] and [[Maxis]] policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt; Some games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as [[Birdo|Birdo from Super Mario Bros]], [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison from the Final Fight series]], and Flea from Chrono Trigger. Due to adherence to Nintendo's quality standards and translations based on preserving gameplay rather than literal meaning, these characters' identities were altered or erased in translation.&lt;ref name=":rated m" /&gt;

The video game industry is regarded as having [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] bias by numerous analysts.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hot Dates and Fairytale Romances: Studying Sexuality in Video Games|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415965780|location=New York, NY|pages=172–191|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":gay in games"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2009-07-01|title=Putting the Gay in Games Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/4/3/228|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=228–253|doi=10.1177/1555412009339729|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to industry professionals interviewed by Shaw, reasons for this [[heteronormativity]] include the demographic of those who play games, the views of those who create games, the risk of backlash in the industry, and the storytelling limitations of the medium.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;

Choice based LGBT content, such as optional same sex romance in Bioware games,&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krobová|first=Tereza|last2=Moravec|first2=Ondřej|last3=Švelch|first3=Jaroslav|title=Dressing Commander Shepard in pink: Queer playing in a heteronormative game culture|url=http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2015081905&amp;article=3|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=9|issue=3|doi=10.5817/cp2015-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a low- risk&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; form of representation that occurs only in video games.&lt;ref name=":at the edge"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaming at the Edge: Sexuality and Gender at the Margins of Gamer Culture|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8166-9315-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=13–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When representation is included, it is often through these in-game choices, which place the responsibility for representation on players instead of developers.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; Because they afford the most opportunity for player choice and in game romance, genres such as [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] are the most LGBT representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/25/a-gay-history-of-gaming|title=A Gay History of Gaming|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|date=2012-01-25|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another low risk method of LGBT representation is "Gay window gaming," which is LGBT representation that is either subtle or avoidable in games that serves to appeal to LGBT players without alienating straight or homophobic players. This can occur in sandbox games such as [[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]].&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

In games with LGBT characters or the option of an LGBT avatar, some aspects of marginalization that occur in contemporary culture are depicted despite the game's overall adherence to reality.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; These real social constraints are imposed on a virtual world due to the way games are constructed and the community that inhabits them. Games are made on contemporary culture's heteronormative basis, and this shapes narrative and characters. In the popular [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', for example, this has "created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle", according to a 2013 assessment of the game's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulos|first=Alexis|date=2013-03-01|title=Confronting Heteronormativity in Online Games A Critical Discourse Analysis of LGBTQ Sexuality in World of Warcraft|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/8/2/77|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=77–97|doi=10.1177/1555412013478688|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both members of the industry&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; and LGBT players&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; prefer LGBT representation to be normalized in game narratives rather than made to seem abnormal or special. There are no games produced specifically to appeal to an LGBT audience.&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2012-02-01|title=Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/14/1/28|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=28–44|doi=10.1177/1461444811410394|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT players prefer this so they can avoid marginalization in the gaming community.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer" /&gt;

LGBT gamers use queer readings of media to compensate for their lack of representation in it.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; As concluded in a study by Moravec, this "imaginative play" is the most common method LGBT gamers use to relate to in game avatars&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; that are typically created for a presumed straight male player to relate to.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the Ubisoft blog, Lucien Soulband, who is openly gay and was the writer for ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]'', said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5456234/video-games-wont-feature-gay-protagonists-for-a-while-says-far-cry-3|title=Video games won't feature gay protagonists 'for a while,' says Far Cry 3 writer Lucien Soulban|author=Gera, Emily|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2014-02-28|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Dorian in [[Dragon Age: Inquisition]] was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.&lt;ref name="outDorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/7/13/dorian-dragon-age-inquisition-why-gamings-breakout-gay-character-matters|last=Baume|first=Matt|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|title=Dorian of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Why Gaming's 'Breakout' Gay Character Matters|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more video games featuring themes related to LGBT characters and themes, the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) will include a video game awards category, the "Outstanding Video Game Award" for games with "outstanding LGBTQ-inclusive content", starting in its 30th [[GLAAD Media Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/27/17909964/glaad-media-awards-video-game-category | title = GLAAD awards will spotlight video games for the first time | first=  Owen | last =Good | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of gender representation in games==

=== Effect on attitudes towards gender ===
A 2008 study found that males reported playing more violent video games than females. This exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with attitudes supportive of rape.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, Karen E., Brian P. Brown, and Michael A. Collins. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001005 Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment]." Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 44.5 (2008): 1402-1408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===
Canadian non-profit [[MediaSmarts]] writes that "video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others", and despite their impact on the youth, "there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization."&lt;ref name=MediaSmarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/video-games/concerns-about-video-games |title=The Concerns About Video Games |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Tracy|title=An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior|journal=Sex Roles|year=1998|volume=38|pages=425–442|doi=10.1023/A:1018709905920|issue=5/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;

==Players' preferences==
Although games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better review scores, they sold fewer copies than games with exclusively male protagonists. [[Penny Arcade Report]] attributed the difference to larger marketing budgets for games with male heroes.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Games with exclusively female heroes don't sell (because publishers don't support them)|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321064024/http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them||archivedate=21 March 2013|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Penny Arcade Report|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012" /&gt; Male-only games included popular sports and war franchises such as ''Madden'' and ''Call of Duty'', and EEDAR's Jesse Divnich stated in 2010, "The factors that drive sales are based more on brand licensing, marketing budgets, development budget and a thousand other factors that have little to do with the gender of playable avatars."&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103045-EEDAR-Says-the-Chicks-Are-Alright|last=Chalk|first=Andy|work=The Escapist|title=EEDAR Says the Chicks Are Alright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling in 2015 by Pew Research Center showed 16% of adults who play video games believe most games portray women poorly, compared to 26% who disagree, and 34% who say it depends on the game. Among those who do not play, 55% are unsure if games portray women poorly. Minimal differences were seen between male and female responses.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by [[Rosalind Wiseman]] and [[Ashly Burch]] indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 survey of 1,266 gamers by Quantic Foundry, 89% of female gamers considered the inclusion of female protagonist option in games somewhat, very or extremely important; 64% of male gamers expressed the same views. Self-identified "hardcore" gamers of both genders, on average, considered a female protagonist less important than "core" or "casual" gamers did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Just How Important Are Female Protagonists?|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/08/29/just-important-female-protagonists/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Graelent''''' is an [[Old French]] [[Breton lai]], named after its protagonist. It is one of the so-called [[:Category:Anonymous lais|anonymous lais]] and draws on [[Marie de France]]'s ''[[Lanval]]''.

==Synopsis==
The plot is similar to that of Marie de France's lai of ''[[Lanval]]''.{{sfnp|Stokoe|1948|p=395}}

Graelent, a knight of [[Brittany]], rebuffs amorous advances from the queen, who retaliates by manipulating the king against Lanval. Graelent's wages are suspended, reducing him to poverty. Graelent dejectedly rides into the forest, and while tracking a [[white hind]] (''bisse blance'' v. 201; [[Modern French|Mod. Fr.]]: ''{{linktext|biche |blanche}}''{{efn|Although rendered "white hart" in Mason tr., the original Old French term designates a female deer.}}), he stumbles upon a beautiful lady bathing in the fountain, attended by two maidens. Graelent sneaks up and clutches the articles of clothing she has disrobed upon a bush. The lady cries out his name, demanding their return. Graelent does not comply, and bargains for her to emerge from the fountain, and asks for her love.

She is at first scornful at the suggestion, but Graelent woos her with words, and in a quick turnabout she is more than willing to become his amour, and even reveals this was her design in the first place.{{efn|Though she was meeting Graelent for the first time, she knew his name, and their fateful encounter at the fountain was presaged: "She tells him that she has visited the fountain for the purpose of meeting him and that she has long known of his coming" ({{Harvnb|Cross|1915|pp=587–8}}).}} She would appear to him whenever he wills it, but the relationship must be kept a strict secret, and the couple are to abide in the country for one year while avoiding detection from comrades. Graelent receives from the lady a magnificent war horse, and large sums of gold and silver. He repays his debt to the burgess's hostel where he stayed, and begins entertaining many knights, regaling them with food and harpers' music. He spends other hours of the day and nights with his lady. Graelent is now extricated from financial difficulties, but another ordeal is awaiting.&lt;!--"looming"; Stokoe p. 395 --&gt;

A year goes by, and at the king's annual Pentecost feast, all present are expected to praise the beauty of the queen as being greater than any other that they know. Graelent refuses, blurting out that he knows a woman thirty times as beautiful. The enraged queen dares him to produce this woman on pain of punishment (on count of calumny), and the king orders him thrown in prison. The lady does not appear at his whim as she has always done before,&lt;!--"at his desire"; Cross p. 588 --&gt; and Graelent is struck by remorse, but gains no reprieve until the next Pentecostal feast, when he is given a last chance to ride out and find his lady. Graelent returns empty-handed, and resigns himself to trial, but just then beautiful damsels arrive in court, with the message that the lady will soon be present to  acquit Graelent of his veracity.

Unlike ''Lanval'', the "fairy mistress"{{efn|Commentators refer to the lady as "fairy mistress" in ''Lanval'' and ''Gralent'' (e.g. {{Harvnb|Stokoe|1948|p=395}}). She is designated "the lady of the fountain" in {{Harvnb|Cross|1915|p=58}}.}} here does not immediately take him back, and sets off on the journey back to her world beyond the river. Graelent follows mounted on the white horse she has given him, and ignoring her warning, begins to ford the river but is unhorsed and begins to drown. At the entreaty of her attendant damsel, the lady relents and pulls him up to safety. The couple disappear, never to be seen again. The horse left behind remains at the bank neighing after his master, and can still be heard at this time of year.{{sfnp|Mason|1911|pp=148–162}}{{sfnp|Cross|1915|pp=587–8}}{{sfnp|Stokoe|1948|p=395}}

==Related texts==
''Graelent'' is closely resembles the plotline to ''[[Lanval]]'' by [[Marie de France]], and the texts are considered interrelated. However, there has been considerable disagreement over the years among commentators regarding their authorship, the chronological order, and mutual relationship.

''Graelent'' was initially published by as a work by Marie de France by Jean-Baptiste-Bonaventure de Roquefort in 1820,{{sfnp|Schofield|1900|pp=122, 129}} and subsequently translated as one of her works by Eugene Masons (1911), but this attribution is considered erroneous.{{sfnp|Schofield|1900|pp=129–130}}{{sfnp|Stokoe|1948|p=392}}

Although some early scholars such as [[Gaston Paris]] (1889) considered ''Graelent'' to antedate ''Lanval'', {{sfnp|Stokoe|1948|p=393}} and later [[William Stokoe|William C. Stokoe, Jr.]] (1948) continued to argue it as the source of ''Lanval'', many have voiced dissent,{{efn|{{Harvnb|Stokoe|1948}} cites Lucien Foulet as considering ''Graelent'' to be later, and plagiarized partly from Marie; as well as Reinhard Köhler assinging a later date.}} and the contrary opinion is the recent consensus, according to Glynn S. Burgess:{{sfnp|Burgess|2011|p=155}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Illingworth |first=R. N. |title=The Composition of 'Graelent' and 'Guingamor' |journal=Medium Aevum |volume=44 |year=1975|pages=31, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The definitive view of these three lays (&lt;small&gt;the third being ''[[Guingamor]]''&lt;/small&gt;), chronologically and thematically, is that of R. N. Illingworth, who concluded that they were composed in the order ''Lanval'', ''Graelent'', and ''Guingamor'', with ''Graelent'' and ''Guingamor'' (both anonymous) drawing on ''Lanval'', but ''Guingamor'' also drawing on ''Graelent''. Moreover, although the narratives were taken largely from [[Marie de France|Marie]], the two anonymous lays integrated into their stories, independently of Marie, material stemming from "a nucleus of genuine Celtic tradition".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The protagonist robbing the bathing lady's garment is a common [[swan maiden]] folklore motif, and [[William Henry Schofield]] felt this was borrowed specifically from the story of [[Wayland the Smith]], which survive in the [[Middle High German]] ''Friedrich von Schwaben'' and the [[Poetic Edda|Eddic]] poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]''.{{efn|Wayland the Smith is called "Galant" in French sources and "Wieland" in German.}}{{efn|The protagonist of ''Friedrich von Schwaben'' states "I am called Wieland".}}{{sfnp|Schofield|1900|pp=122, 129, 136-137}}{{sfnp|Cross|1915|p=621, note4}} Schofield also discerned borrowings from the Irish narrative ''Noinden Ulad'' ("Debility of the Ulstermen").{{sfnp|Schofield|1900|pp=165-168}}

===Medieval adaptations===
''Graelent'' was translated into [[Old Norse]] as ''Grelent'', one of the ''[[Strengleikar]]''; this text has value for tracing the textual history of the French ''lai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kalinke |first1=Marianne |last2=Mitchell |first2=P. M. |title=Bibliography of Old Norse–Icelandic Romances |series=Islandica |volume=44 |place=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1985 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its turn, this translation seems to have influenced the Icelandic [[Chivalric sagas|romance-saga]] ''Samsonar saga fagra'' and the ''[[rímur]]'' ''[[Skíðaríma]]'', both of which include characters called Grelent.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|editor=Aðalheiður Guðmundsdóttir |title=Strengleikar |series=Íslensk rit |volume=14 |place=Reykjavík |publisher=Bókmenntafræðistofnun Háskóla Íslands |year=2006 |pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Middle English]] ''Sir Launfal'' by [[Thomas Chestre]] is considered a composite, based on ''Lanval'' with elements added from ''Graelent''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Kittredge |first=George Lyman |authorlink=George Lyman Kittredge |title=Launfal |journal=The American Journal of Philology |volume=1 |number=10 |year=1889 |pages=1–33 |jstor=287039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Krakauer describes the events leading up to his eventual decision to participate in an Everest expedition in May 1996, despite having mostly given up mountain-climbing years before. The 1996 expedition season recorded 8 deaths, including that of Krakauer's guide Andy Harris. This was the third-highest recorded number of deaths on the mountain in a single day; the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]] caused the most at 21.

Krakauer, a journalist for the adventure magazine ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', initially said his intentions to climb Everest were purely professional. The original magazine story was to have Krakauer climb only to [[Everest Base Camp|base camp]], and report on the commercialization of the mountain. However, the idea of Everest reawakened his childhood desire to climb the mountain. Krakauer asked his editor to put off the story for a year so that he could train for a climb to the summit. From there, the book moves between events that take place on the mountain, and the unfolding tragedy, which takes place during the push to the summit. In the book, Krakauer alleges that essential safety methods adopted over the years by experienced guides on Everest are sometimes compromised by the competition between rival guiding agencies, in order to get their clients to the summit.

==Controversy==
Krakauer's recounting of certain aspects of the ill-fated climb has generated criticism, both from some of the climb's participants and from renowned mountaineers such as [[Galen Rowell]].  Much of the disputed material centers on Krakauer's accounting of the actions of Russian climber and guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]].  An experienced high-altitude climber and guide for Scott Fischer, Boukreev descended the summit prior to his clients, ostensibly out of concern for their safety and in preparation for potential rescue efforts. Boukreev later mounted repeated solo rescue efforts, saving several lives. In his book, Krakauer acknowledged Boukreev's heroism in saving two climbers' lives, but questions his judgment,  his decision to descend before clients, not using supplementary oxygen, his choices of gear on the mountain, and his interaction with clients. Boukreev provides a rebuttal to these allegations in his book, ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]''.

[[Galen Rowell]] criticized Krakauer's account, citing numerous inconsistencies in his narrative while observing that Krakauer was sleeping in his tent while Boukreev was rescuing other climbers.  Rowell argued that Boukreev's actions were nothing short of heroic, and his judgment prescient: "[Boukreev] foresaw problems with clients nearing camp, noted five other guides on the peak [Everest], and positioned himself to be rested and hydrated enough to respond to an emergency. His heroism was not a fluke."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Climbing to Disaster|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB864852385619851000|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-09-06|issn = 0099-9660|first = Galen|last = Rowell|date = 29 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The account has also been criticized for not informing the reader that the team members were receiving accurate daily weather forecasts and knew about the storm in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ratcliffe MBE|first=Graham|title=A Day to Die For|year=2011|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|location=UK|isbn=9781845966386|url=http://adaytodiefor.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Krakauer's 1999 paperback edition of ''Into Thin Air'', he addresses some of the criticism in a lengthy postscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Krakauer|first=Jon|title=Into Thin Air|year=1999|publisher=Turtleback|location=USA|isbn=9780613663618|url=https://www.amazon.com/Turtleback-School-Library-Binding-Edition/dp/0613663616/ref=tmm_hrd_title_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373839576&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: This book puts forward evidence that detailed weather forecasts were being received by several groups well in advance of their teams' summit attempts. These forecasts highlighted clearly the oncoming strong storm that struck the mountain on 10th/11th May causing the tragedy. While most of Ratcliffe's comments are directed towards the two expedition leaders for ignoring the forecasts and continuing on the summit attempts, thereby exposing clients to such high risk, he also makes clear that in his view, Krakauer and many others' description of the storm as "sudden and unexpected" is wholly inaccurate. Furthermore, Ratcliffe suggests that Krakauer, by not mentioning the forecasts, did not produce an accurate or adequately researched account.

'''Jacob van Huysum''' (c. 1687 &amp;ndash; 1740) was an 18th-century botanical painter from the Northern Netherlands.

Van Huysum was born in [[Amsterdam]].  Both his father [[Justus van Huysum]] (1659–1716), and his brother [[Jan van Huysum]] (1682–1749), were celebrated flower painters. His manner of painting was very like that of his brother. His approach to botanical illustration, while preserving botanical accuracy, captured a more painterly aspect of his subject. This contrasts with the meticulously exact mode of [[Georg Dionysius Ehret]], his contemporary colleague.

Jacob arrived in England in about 1721, and for a while lived in the house of his patron, Mr. Lockyear of [[South Sea House]]. Later he enjoyed the patronage of Sir [[Robert Walpole]], who befriended him, and commissioned him to paint decorative works for his house at [[Houghton, Norfolk|Houghton]] in [[Norfolk]]. More importantly he produced most of the 50 illustrations for [[John Martyn (botanist)|John Martyn's]] ''Historia Plantarum Rariorum'' (London: 1728-38), and all the drawings for  ''Catalogus Plantarum'',  an index of trees, shrubs, plants and flowers (London: 1730). His pupil was [[Louis Fabritius Dubourg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/40848 Jacob van Huysum] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Historia Plantarum Rariorum'' depicted plants from the [[Chelsea Physic Garden]] and the [[Cambridge Botanic Garden]]. These plants had come from the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[North America]], the [[West Indies]], and [[Mexico]]. Elisha Kirkall produced the mezzotint engravings. Each plate was dedicated to a patron and showed an engraved coat-of-arms or monogram. Besides van Huysum, other artists were [[William Houstoun (botanist)|William Houstoun]], Massey, G. Sartorys, and R. Sartorius. The work was published in five parts of ten plates each between 1728 and 1737, and was sold by subscription. The venture was not a financial success and publication ceased in 1737.

'''Jørgen Valentin Sonne''' (24 June 1801, [[Birkerød]] – 24 September 1890, [[Copenhagen]]) was a Danish [[Genre art|genre]] painter; known primarily for his battle scenes.

== Biography ==
His father, Jeppe (1771–1833), was a [[copperplate engraver]] for the [[Royal Mint (Denmark)|Royal Mint]]. He originally intended to pursue a military career and enrolled at the [[Royal Danish Military Academy]], but left after a year and went to the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] instead.&lt;ref name="S"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/J%C3%B8rgen_Sonne Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he began to work in the studios of [[Christian David Gebauer]], mostly making copies of the old [[Dutch Masters]].&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=1116 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted some original pictures and had a small showing in 1818. 
[[File:Jørgen V. Sonne - Rural Scene - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|185px|left|Rural Scene (1848)]]
In 1828, he received a travel stipend from the Academy that allowed him to visit Munich, where he became an apprentice of the history painter, [[Peter von Cornelius]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He stayed there for three years and made several trips into the mountains to do landscapes, which are not among his best works.

When he left Munich, he was able to obtain further support for studies in Rome. While there, he made numerous hunting trips as an excuse to observe the rural peasants and their daily habits. During these trips he made sketches that he would use as inspiration throughout his career.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

He returned to Denmark in 1841; producing works based on his Italian studies as well as ones depicting the Danish peasantry. In 1848, following the start of the [[First Schleswig War]], he was given permission to accompany the army to [[Southern Jutland]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; Many of the soldiers were impressed by the way he calmly sketched while bullets flew around him. During the [[Second Schleswig War]], despite being sixty-three years old, he was with the army again, at the [[Battle of Dybbøl]] and in [[Sønderborg]] when the city was under bombardment. 
[[File:Dybbol Skanse.jpg|thumb|325px|Scene from the Battle of Dybbøl]] 
In 1865, he was awarded the {{ill|Anckerske Legat|da|Det anckerske Legat}} (a scholarship for writers, artists and composers) and was able to return to Italy for a year.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt; In addition to his canvases, he is known for designing a large mural on the exterior walls of the [[Thorvaldsen Museum]] and illustrations for a Danish translation of the Hindu play, ''[[Shakuntala]]''.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; He was appointed [Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog]] in 1852, and received the [[Dannebrogordenens Hæderstegn]] in 1881.

During his last decade, he began having eye problems and became too weak to paint for long periods. To the end, his artistic outlook was conservative; believing that the latest trends were simply a way to hide lack of content. He never married.&lt;ref name="S" /&gt;

'''Kustom Kulture''' is a [[neologism]] used to describe the [[art]]works, [[vehicle]]s, [[hairstyle]]s, and [[fashion]]s of those who drove and built [[custom car]]s and [[Custom (motorcycle)|motorcycles]] in the [[United States of America]] from the 1950s through today. 
It was born out of the hot rod culture of Southern California of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="DutchTurner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Von Dutch|author2=Ron Turner|author3=Ed Roth|author4=Robert Williams|title=Custom Culture: Von Dutch, Ed "Big Daddy" Roth,Robert (Bob) Bond, Robert Williams and Others|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=10di738DvjoC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=15 December 2012|date=1 November 1993|publisher=Last Gasp|isbn=978-0-86719-405-0|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of [[hot rod]]ding, many fashions and styles developed. Over time, each of these distinct styles of customizing have blended and reshaped our everyday life. Artists such as [[Kenny Howard|Von Dutch (Kenny Howard)]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and  custom car builder [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]]; along with Lyle Fisk, [[Dean Jeffries]]; hot rod and [[lowrider]] customizers such as the [[Barris Brothers]] (Sam and [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]]);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2265319/Batmobile-Man-paid-1-original-sells-auction-4-6M.html|title=George Barris with Batmobile: Photos|publisher=Daily Mail | location=London|date=20 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with numerous [[tattoo]] artists, automobile painters, and movies and television shows such as ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and ''[[The Munsters]]'' ([[The Munster Koach]], [[DRAG-U-LA]]) have all helped to form what is known as Custom Culture.

Custom Culture is usually identified with the [[Greaser (subculture)|greaser]]s of the 1950s, the [[drag racing|drag racers]] of the 1960s, and the [[lowrider]]s of the 1970s. Other subcultures that have had an influence on Custom Culture are the [[Skinhead]]s, [[mods and rockers]] of the 1960s, the [[punk rock|punk]] rockers of the 1970s, the metal and [[rockabilly]] music, along with the [[scooterboy]]s of the 1980s, and [[psychobilly]] of the 1990s. Each separate culture has added their own customizations to the cars, their own fashions, influenced the music, and added their own ideas of what is cool, what is acceptable, and what is not. Everything from wild pinstriped paintjobs, to choptop [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]]s, to custom [[Harley-Davidson]] and [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycles, to [[metallic paint|metal-flake]] and black [[Primer (paint)|primer]] paint jobs, along with music, cartoons, and monster movies have influenced what defines anyone and anything who is part of this automobile subculture.

In the 1990s and 2000s, Kustom Kulture had taken on a rebirth of American subcultures from the 1950s and 1960s with  [[DIY]] activities. Each style is distinct, and has its roots in American automobile history. Many styles that would not have tolerated each other in the past now come together in large car shows.

==Kustom Graphics==
The rebirth of Kustom Kulture has seen the  use of the term “Kustom Graphics” to describe the style of artwork associated with the subculture when applied to posters, flyers, T-shirts and logos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kustom Graphics|date=2008|publisher=Korero Books|isbn=9780955339868|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden and Finland ==
[[File:60's car with lots of raggare on the roof at Power Big Meet.jpg|thumb|right|Swedish hot rodders with a 1960s American car at Power Big Meet]]
Locals in these countries, influenced by American culture, have created a local hot rod culture which is vibrant in [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]  where enthusiasts gather at meetings such as [[Power Big Meet]] and clubs like Wheels and Wings in [[Varberg]], Sweden have established themselves in Hot Rod culture. Since there is very little "vintage tin" the hot rods in Sweden are generally made with a home made chassis (usually a Model T or A replica), with a Jaguar (or [[Volvo 240]]) rear axle, a [[Small-block#Small block|small block]] [[V8 engine|V8]], and [[fiberglass]] tub, but some have been built using for instance a [[Volvo Duett]] chassis. Because the Swedish regulations required a crash test even for custom-built passenger cars between 1969 and 1982, the Duett option was preferred, since it was considered a rebodied Duett rather than a new vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070228060401/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/artiklar/duettrod/Duettrodden.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070129040558/http://hem.passagen.se/stur/pages/galleri/duetter/Duettrods.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930003248/http://amazon.forum.bilia.se/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?p=25500&amp;sid=e89d2d537977372aa45c4d0c5b7b9598]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319][http://www.garaget.org/?car=16701][http://www.garaget.org/?car=19319]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some 1950s and 1960s cars are also hot rodded, like [[Morris Minor]], [[Ford Anglia]], [[Volvo Amazon]], [[Ford Cortina]], [['57 Chevy]], to name but a few. These are known as [[custom cars]] (sometimes spelled Kustom).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2765">'''Magonia''' is the name of the cloud realm whence felonious aerial sailors were said to have come according to the [[polemic]]al treatise by [[Carolingian]] bishop [[Agobard]] of [[Lyon]] in 815, where he argues against weather magic. The treatise is titled ''De Grandine et Tonitruis'' ("On Hail and Thunder").

==Description==
The inhabitants of this realm were said to travel the clouds in ships and worked with Frankish ''[[tempestarii]]'' ("tempest-raisers" or weather-magi) to steal grain from the fields during (magically raised) [[storm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k58288830/f11.image.r=agobard.langFR.swf ''De Grandine et Tonitruis''] pp. 8-10: "Plerosque autem vidimus et audivimus tanta dementia obrutos, tanta stultitia alienatos, ut credant et dicant quandam esse regionem, quæ dicatur Magonia, ex qua naves veniant in nubibus, in quibus fruges, quæ grandinibus decidunt, et tempestatibus pereunt, vehantur in eamdem regionem, ipsis videlicet nautis aëreis dantibus pretia tempestariis, et accipientibus frumenta vel ceteras fruges. Ex his item tam profunda stultitia excoecatis, ut haec posse fieri credant, vidimus plures in quodam conventu hominum exhibere vinctos quatuor homines, tres viros, et unam feminam, quasi qui de ipsis navibus ceciderint; quos scilicet per aliquot dies in vinculis detentos, tandem collecto conventu hominum exhibuerunt, ut dixi, in nostra præsentia, tanquam lapidandos. Sed tamen vincente veritate, post multam ratiocinationem, ipsi qui eos exhibuerant, secundum propheticum illud confusi sunt, ''sicut confunditur fur quando deprehenditur''".

An English translation can be found at the [https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/source/Agobard-OnHailandThunder.asp Internet Medieval Sourcebook].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Document history==
Agobard's works were lost until 1605, when a manuscript was discovered in Lyons and published by [[Papirius Masson]], and again by [[Baluze]] in 1666. For later editions see [[August Potthast]], ''Bibliotheca Historica Medii Aevi''. The life of Agobard in [[Friedrich Adolf Ebert|Ebert]]'s ''Allgemeine Geschichte der Literatur des Mittelalters im Abendlande'' (1880), Band ii., is still the best one to consult. For further indications see [[A. Molinier]], ''Sources de l'histoire de France'', i. p.&amp;nbsp;235.

==Popular culture==
Magonia is featured in [[Jacques Vallee]]'s book ''Passport to Magonia'', which explores the link between modern UFO visitations and reports from antiquity of contact with these "space beings" where he quotes Agobard's description.

[[Maria Dahvana Headley]]'s young adult novel ''Magonia'' also references the mythological realm.

{{Medieval and Renaissance literature}}
{{History of literature by era}}
'''Medieval literature''' is a broad subject, encompassing essentially all written works available in [[Europe]] and beyond during the [[Middle Ages]] (that is, the one thousand years from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] ca. AD 500 to the beginning of the Florentine [[Renaissance]] in the late 15th century).  The literature of this time was composed of religious writings as well as [[secular]] works. Just as in modern literature, it is a complex and rich field of study, from the utterly sacred to the exuberantly profane, touching all points in-between.  Works of literature are often grouped by place of origin, language, and genre.

==Languages==
Since [[Latin]] was the language of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], which dominated [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], and since the Church was virtually the only source of education, Latin was a common language for medieval writings, even in some parts of Europe that were never Romanized. However, in [[Eastern Europe]], the influence of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] made [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Old Church Slavonic]] the dominant written languages.

The common people continued to use their respective [[vernacular]]s. A few examples, such as the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''[[Beowulf]]'', the [[Middle High German]] ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the [[Medieval Greek]] ''[[Digenis Acritas]]'', the [[Old East Slavic]] ''[[The Tale of Igor's Campaign|Tale of Igor's Campaign]]'', and the [[Old French]] ''[[Chanson de Roland]]'', are well known to this day. Although the extant versions of these [[epic poetry|epics]] are generally considered the works of individual (but [[Anonymity|anonymous]]) poets, there is no doubt      that they are based on their peoples' older oral traditions. [[Celt]]ic traditions have survived in the [[Breton lai|lais]] of [[Marie de France]], the ''[[Mabinogion]]'' and the [[King Arthur#The Arthurian romance|Arthurian cycles]]. Another host of vernacular literature has survived in the [[Old Norse literature]] and more specifically in the [[Saga]] literature of [[Iceland]].

==Anonymity==
A notable amount of medieval literature is [[Anonymity|anonymous]]. This is not only due to the lack of documents from a period, but also due to an interpretation of the [[author]]'s role that differs considerably from the [[romanticism|romantic]] interpretation of the term in use today. Medieval authors often deeply respected the [[classical antiquity|classical]] writers and the [[Church Fathers]] and tended to re-tell and embellish stories they had heard or read rather than invent new stories. And even when they did, they often claimed to be handing down something from an [[auctor]] instead. From this point of view, the names of the individual authors seemed much less important, and therefore many important works were never attributed to any specific person.

==Types of writing==

===Religious===
Theological works were the dominant form of literature typically found in libraries during the Middle Ages. [[Catholic]] clerics were the intellectual center of society in the Middle Ages, and it is their literature that was produced in the greatest quantity.

Countless [[hymn]]s survive from this time period (both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and paraliturgical).  The liturgy itself was not in fixed form, and numerous competing missals set out individual conceptions of the order of the [[Mass (Liturgy)|mass]].  Religious scholars such as [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Pierre Abélard]] wrote lengthy [[theology|theological]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] treatises, often attempting to reconcile the teachings of the Greek and Roman pagan authors with the doctrines of the Church.  [[Hagiography|Hagiographies]], or "lives of the saints", were also frequently written, as an encouragement to the devout and a warning to others.

The ''[[Golden Legend]]'' of [[Jacobus de Voragine]] reached such popularity that, in its time, it was reportedly read more often than the [[Bible]].  [[Francis of Assisi]] was a prolific poet, and his [[Franciscan]] followers frequently wrote poetry themselves as an expression of their piety. ''[[Dies Irae]]'' and ''[[Stabat Mater]]'' are two of the most powerful Latin poems on religious subjects. [[Goliardic poetry]] (four-line stanzas of satiric verse) was an art form used by some clerics to express dissent.  The only widespread religious writing that was not produced by clerics were the [[mystery play]]s: growing out of simple [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] re-enactments of a single Biblical scene, each mystery play became its village's expression of the key events in the [[Bible]].  The text of these plays was often controlled by local [[guild]]s, and mystery plays would be performed regularly on set feast-days, often lasting all day long and into the night.

During the Middle Ages, the [[Jew]]ish population of Europe also produced a number of outstanding writers. [[Maimonides]], born in [[Cordoba, Spain]], and [[Rashi]], born in [[Troyes]], [[France]], are two of the best-known and most influential of these Jewish authors.

===Secular===
[[File:Beowulf.firstpage.jpeg|thumb|The first page of ''Beowulf'']]

[[Secular]] literature in this period was not produced in equal quantity as religious literature. The earliest tales are based on oral traditions: the British ''[[Y Goddoddin]]'' and ''[[Preiddeu Annwfn]]'', along with the Germanic [[Beowulf]] and ''[[Nibelungenlied]]''. They relate to myths or certain 6th-century events, but the surviving manuscripts date from centuries later—''Y Goddoddin'' from the late 13th century, ''Preiddu Annwfn'' from the early 14th century, ''Beowulf'' from c. 1000, and the ''Nibelungenlied'' from the 13th century. The makers and performers were ''[[bard]]s'' (British/Welsh) and ''[[scop]]s'' (Germanic), elite professionals attached to royal or noble courts to praise the heroes of legendary history.

Prose tales first emerged in Britain: the intricate [[Four Branches of the Mabinogi|''Mabinogi'' quartet]] about princely families, notably anti-war in theme, and the romantic adventure ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', famous for the earliest mention of [[King Arthur]]. (The ''Mabinogi'' is not the same as the ''[[Mabinogion]]'', a collection of disconnected prose tales, which does, however, include both the ''Mabinogi'' and ''Culhwch and Olwen''.) These works were compiled from earlier oral tradition c. 1100.

At about the same time a new poetry of "[[courtly love]]" became fashionable in Europe. Traveling singers—[[troubadour]]s and [[trouvère]]s—made a living from their love songs in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Galician-Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Occitan language|Provençal]], and [[Greek language|Greek]]. Germanic culture had its  [[Minnesinger|Minnesänger]] tradition. The songs of courtly love often express unrequited longing for an ideal woman, but there are also [[aubade]]s (dawn farewells by lovers) and humorous ditties.

Following the earliest epic poems, prose tales, and romances, more long poems were crafted—the ''[[Chanson de geste|chansons de geste]]'' of the late 11th and early 12th centuries. These extolled conquests, as in ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' (part of the [[Matter of France]]) and ''[[Digenis Acritas]]'' (one of the [[Acritic songs]]). The rather different [[chivalric romance]] tradition concerns adventures about marvels, love, and chivalry. They tell of the [[Matter of Britain]] and the [[Matter of Rome]].

[[Political poetry]] threads throughout the period from the very early ''[[Armes Prydein]]'' (10th-century Britain) to the [[goliard]] rebels of 12th and 13th centuries, who were church trained clerics unable or unwilling to be employed in the church.

Travel literature was highly popular in the Middle Ages, as fantastic accounts of far-off lands (frequently embellished or entirely false) entertained a society that supported sea voyages and trading along coasts and rivers, as well as [[pilgrimage]]s to such destinations as [[Jerusalem]]; [[Canterbury]] and [[Glastonbury]] in England; [[St. David's]] in Wales; and [[Santiago de Compostela]] in Spain. [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' became popular at the end of the 14th century.

The most prominent authors of [[Jewish]] secular poetry in the Middle Ages were [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]] and [[Yehuda Halevi]], both of whom were also renowned religious poets.

===Women's literature===
While it is true that women in the medieval period were never accorded full equality with men, some women were able to use their skill with the written word to gain renown.  Religious writing was the easiest avenue&amp;mdash;women who would later be canonized as [[saint]]s frequently published their reflections, revelations, and prayers.  Much of what is known about [[women in the Middle Ages]] is known from the works of [[nun]]s such as [[Clare of Assisi]], [[Bridget of Sweden]], and [[Catherine of Siena]].

Frequently, however, the religious perspectives of women were held to be unorthodox by those in power, and the mystical visions of such authors as [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], and [[Hildegard of Bingen]] provide insight into a part of the medieval experience less comfortable for the institutions that ruled Europe at the time.  Women wrote influential texts in the secular realm as well&amp;mdash;reflections on courtly love and society by [[Marie de France]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] continue to be studied for their glimpses of medieval society.

For modern historical reflection, D.H. Green's (2007) historical work entitled, ''Women Readers of the Middle Ages'' explores literacy and literature in terms of women in medieval society.&lt;ref&gt;Green, D.H. "Women Readers of the Middle Ages". Cambridge University Press, England. {{ISBN|978-0-52187-9422}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been reviewed as "a radical reassessment of women's contribution to medieval literary culture." &lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicola. [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/studies_in_the_age_of_chaucer/v031/31.mcdonald.html " Women Readers in the Middle Ages (review)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegory===
{{main|Allegory in the Middle Ages}}

While medieval literature makes use of many [[literary device]]s, [[allegory]] is so prominent in this period as to deserve special mention.  Much of medieval literature relied on allegory to convey the morals the author had in mind while writing—representations of abstract qualities, events, and institutions are thick in much of the literature of this time. Probably the earliest and most influential allegory is the ''[[Psychomachia]]'' (''Battle of Souls'') by [[Aurelius Clemens Prudentius]]. Other important examples include the ''[[Romance of the Rose]]'', ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''[[Roman de Fauvel]]'', and ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.

'''Mostar Youth Theatre''' (locally known as ''Mostarski Teatar Mladih'' or '''MTM''') is a city-sponsored [[community theatre]] located in [[Mostar]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It was founded on February 24, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120731050327/http://www.geocities.ws/mostarskiteatarmladih/mtmeng.htm/ Mostar Youth Thetare (Mostarski Teatar Mladih - MTM)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostm.weebly.com/index.html/ Mostar Youth Thetare Website (Mostarski Teatar Mladih - MTM)]&lt;/ref&gt; The work of MTM includes a practical drama education for children and young people as well as production of theatre shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kulturmanager.bosch-stiftung.de/content/language2/html/12611.asp/Robert Bosch Stifung: The Mostar Youth Theatre (Mostarski Teatar Mladih – MTM), Bosnia and Herzegovina ]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MTM offers its members training in acting, [[improvisation]], acting games, physical theatre, movement, voice, pantomime, dance, masks, and various styles of acting. Theatre is divided into following subdivisions: a children's drama studio, youth drama group and the group for adults.

The Mostar Youth Theatre used to organize the “Days of Youth Theatre” IFAP (International Festival of Authorial Poetics), which also included the educational part called "[[Alternative Academy]]". However, this segment has been abandoned in 2012 and partially continued by a private theatre group called [[Mostar Youth Theatre 1974]].&lt;ref&gt;Christina Mouratidou, International Festival of Authorial Poetics 1 (IFAP) “Days of Youth Theatre”, August 2003.{{where|date=June 2011}} Mostar (Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina): persistence for culture in a culturally hostile age.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the Mostar Youth Theatre has founded an International award called the “[[Grozdanin Kikot]]” award.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120426025452/http://www.iti-germany.de/cgi-bin/doc.py?id=2033/ ITI / Impuls / 2007 - 01 / announcements]&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually awarded to  the five individuals or organizations who have made significant contributions to the development of drama education. The award organization was later taken over by the Centre for Drama Education (CDO) which was also initiated by the MTM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kulturmanager.bosch-stiftung.de/content/language2/html/12611.asp/Robert Bosch Stifung: The Mostar Youth Theatre (Mostarski Teatar Mladih – MTM), Bosnia and Herzegovina ]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mostar Youth Theatre is one of the Mostar theaters with the largest number of productions and their headquarters are located in the City Bath building at Mostar's Musala Square.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nileguide.com/destination/mostar-bosnia-and-herzegovina/things-to-do/mostarski-teatar-mladih/1182154 : Mostar info]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On January 24, 2011, Izida Sakić was named a temporary director of the MTM while the former director and co-founder Sead Đulić underwent an investigation concerning financial mismanagement of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120322233719/http://www.novasloboda.ba/clanak/citaj/13095/izida-sakic-nemile-scene-pokvarile-dan-teatra/Newspaper Article: Nemile scene pokvarile dan teatra].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevni-list.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17618:poslovanje-mtm-a-e-u-cijelosti-biti-ispitano&amp;catid=7:kultura&amp;Itemid=8/ Dnevni List: ''Business Practices of MTM to be Fully Examined'' by Anrijana Kopf (In Croatian) &amp;#91;cited April 23, 2012&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mostar Youth Theatre Entrance.jpg|thumb|left|Mostar Youth Theatre Entrance]]

Sead Dulic accused the City of Mostar of not granting sufficient funds for MTM's management while the City of Mostar claimed that in 2005 MTM independently chose to become a city-sponsored institution and that their funds were misused. 

This has resulted in unpaid late tax fees which amounted to around 50.000 BAM. City of Mostar also claimed that Đulic served as a director illegally since he never underwent official selection process and because he lacks necessary professional qualifications. In addition to this, the City also accused a former director of submitting false financial reports as well as illegally transferring MTM funds to the accounts of Centre for Drama Education whose president is also Sead Dulic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnevni-list.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17618:poslovanje-mtm-a-e-u-cijelosti-biti-ispitano&amp;catid=7:kultura&amp;Itemid=8/ Dnevni List: ''Business Practices of MTM to be Fully Examined'' by Anrijana Kopf (In Croatian) &amp;#91;cited April 23, 2012&amp;#93;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these accusations Sead Đulić, along with several former members of the theatre, formed a new company called [[Mostar Youth Theatre 1974]] which continued producing and touring shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mess.ba/2011/en/program/catalogue_entry/184/MESS Catalogue: In Search of the Color of Chestnut] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120729043948/http://mess.ba/2011/en/program/catalogue_entry/184/MESS |date=2012-07-29 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://intermezzo.ba/2011/11/mostarski-teatar-mladih-1974-gostovao-na-sceni-sarajevskoj-kamernog-teatra-55//Mostar Youth Theatre 1974 Performs on the Stage of Sarajevo Kamerni Theatre - In local language].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Tanja Miletić Oručević]] was appointed a Mostar Youth Theatre director post in the summer of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mostm.weebly.com/staff.html// Mostar Youth Theatre Official Website - Staff ].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NB''''' is a British television programme about the arts that was broadcast in Scotland. It debuted in 1989 and aired until it ended in 1997. Produced by [[Scottish Television]], it was largely conceived by its producer Donny O'Rourke, and presented by a young, all-Scottish cast.&lt;ref&gt;David Belcher, [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19890808&amp;id=SWFAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=MFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5500,2398272&amp;hl=en "NB: young-thinking popular cultural programme that's OK"], ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 8 August 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11948876.Man_who_put_NB_on_map/ "Man who put NB on map"], ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 8 June 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' television critic Paul English wrote that the show "helped shape the taste of Scotland's clubbers, gig-goers, opera lovers and theatre-buffs too".&lt;ref&gt;Paul English, [https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-191318076.html "Scotland's Top Viewing; From Wash-House Wifies To Classic Cops And A Talking Lamp, Legendary Programmes Kept Our Families Entertained Record.

[[Image:Rousseau theRepastOfTheLion.jpg|thumbnail|400px|[[Henri Rousseau]]'s ''[[The Repast of the Lion]]'' (circa 1907), is an example of naïve art.]]

'''Naïve art''' is any form of [[visual art]] that is created by a person who lacks the formal education and training that a professional artist undergoes (in anatomy, [[art history]], technique, [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], ways of seeing).&lt;ref name="Roberto"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Roberto |editor-first=K.

One particularly influential painter of "naïve art" was [[Henri Rousseau]] (1844–1910), a French [[Post-Impressionist]] who was discovered by [[Pablo Picasso]].

==Characteristics==
Naïve art&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaïa ''L'Art naïf'' éd. Parkstone International {{ISBN|9781859956687}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often seen as [[outsider art]] that is by someone without formal (or little) training or degree.  While this was true before the twentieth century, there are now [[Art school|academies]] for naïve art. Naïve art is now a fully recognized art genre, represented in art galleries worldwide.

The characteristics of naïve art are an awkward relationship to the formal qualities of painting, especially not respecting the three rules of the perspective (such as defined by the ''Progressive Painters of the Renaissance''):
# Decrease of the size of objects proportionally with distance,
# Muting of colors with distance,
# Decrease of the precision of details with distance,
The results are:
# Effects of perspective geometrically erroneous (awkward aspect of the works, children's drawings look, or medieval painting look, but the comparison stops there)
#  Strong use of pattern, unrefined color on all the plans of the composition, without enfeeblement in the background,
# An equal accuracy brought to details, including those of the background which should be shaded off.
Simplicity rather than subtlety are all supposed markers of naïve art. It has, however, become such a popular and recognizable style that many examples could be called ''pseudo-naïve''.

Whereas naïve art ideally describes the work of an artist who did not receive  formal education in an [[art school]] or [[academy]], for example [[Henri Rousseau]] or [[Alfred Wallis]], 'pseudo naïve' or 'faux naïve' art describes the work of an artist working in a more imitative or self-conscious mode and whose work can be seen as more imitative than original.

Strict naïvety is unlikely to be found in contemporary artists, given the expansion of [[Autodidactism]] as a form of education in modern times. Naïve categorizations are not always welcome by living artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Geller|first1=Amy|title=Lure of the Naïve|url=http://amygellerillustration.com/assets/thesis.pdf|website=amygellerillustration.com/|accessdate=July 12, 2016|ref=page 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[translation|first1=[text] Natalia Brodskaia ;|last2=Darton]|first2=adaptation Mike|title=Naïve art|date=2000|publisher=Parkstone Press|location=New York|isbn=1859953352|page=74|url=https://www.amazon.com/Naive-Schools-Movements-Natalia-Brodskaya/dp/1859953352|accessdate=July 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is likely to change as dignifying signals are known. Museums devoted to naïve art now exist in  [[Kecskemét]], [[Hungary]]; [[Riga, Latvia]]; [[Jaen, Spain]]; [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brasil]]; [[Musée d’art naïf de Vicq en Île-de-France|Vicq]] [[France]] and [[Paris]].

"Primitive art" is another term often applied to art by those without formal training, but is historically more often applied to work from certain cultures that have been judged socially or technologically "primitive" by Western academia, such as Native American, subsaharan African or Pacific Island art (see [[Tribal art]]). This is distinguished from the self-conscious, "primitive" inspired movement [[primitivism (art)|primitivism]]. Another term related to (but not completely synonymous with) naïve art is [[folk art]].

There also exist the terms "naïvism" and "[[primitivism]]" which are usually applied to professional painters working in the style of naïve art (like [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Paul Klee]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zagraevsky.com/article2_engl.htm Irina Arnoldova. Painter Sergey Zagraevsky: the view of an art critic]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movements ==
Nobody knows exactly when the first naive artists appeared on the scene, as from the very first manifestations of art right up to the days of the "Modern Classic", naive artists quite unconsciously bequeathed us unmistakable signs of their creative activity. At all events, naive art can be regarded as having occupied an "official" position in the annals of twentieth-century art since - at the very latest - the publication of the ''Der Blaue Reiter'', an almanac in 1912. Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc, who brought out the almanac, presented 6 reproductions of paintings by ''le Douanier' Rousseau (Henri Rousseau)'', comparing them with other pictorial examples. However, most experts agree that the year that naive art was "discovered" was 1885, when the painter Paul Signac became aware of the talents of Henri Rousseau and set about organizing exhibitions of his work in a number of prestigious galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/Articles/Martens/naive_intro.html|title=WetCanvas: Articles: Jan and Adrie Martens: An Introduction to Naive Art|website=www.wetcanvas.com|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Earth Group ===
The [[Earth Group]] (''Grupa Zemlja'') were Croatian artists, [[architect]]s and intellectuals active in Zagreb from 1929 to 1935. The group was [[Marxist]] in orientation and was partly modelled on "[[Neue Sachlichkeit]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to more stylized forms, and the emergence of [[Naive painting]]. The group included the painters [[Krsto Hegedušić]], [[Edo Kovačević]], [[Omer Mujadžić]], [[Kamilo Ružička]], [[Ivan Tabaković]], and [[Oton Postružnik]], the sculptors [[Antun Augustinčić]], [[Frano Kršinić]], and the architect [[Drago Ibler]]. The Earth group searched for answers to social issues.  Their program emphasised the importance of independent creative expression, and opposed the uncritical copying of foreign styles. Rather than producing art for art's sake, they felt it ought to reflect the reality of life and the needs of the modern community. Activities at the group's exhibitions were increasingly provocative to the government of the day, and in 1935 the group was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.c3.hu/ican.artnet.org/ican/text811a.html?id_text=60|title=I_CAN - Texts - page sent at 2005/04/13 17:54|website=www.c3.hu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hlebine School ===
A term applied to Croatian naive painters working in or around the village of Hlebine, near the Hungarian border, from about 1930. At this time, according to the World Encyclopedia of Naive Art (1984), the village amounted to little more than ‘a few muddy winding streets and one-storey houses’, but it produced such a remarkable crop of artists that it became virtually synonymous with Yugoslav naive painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hlebine School - oi|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095939383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hlebine]] is a small picturesque municipality in the North of Croatia that in 1920s became a setting against which a group of self-taught peasants began to develop a unique and somewhat revolutionary style of painting. This was instigated by leading intellectuals of the time such as the poet [[Antun Gustav Matoš]] and the biggest name in Croatian literature, [[Miroslav Krleža]], who called for an individual national artistic style that would be independent from Western influences. These ideas were picked up by a celebrated artist from Hlebine – [[Krsto Hegedušić]] and he went on to found the Hlebine School of Art in 1930 in search of national “rural artistic expression”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moonproject.co.uk/hlebine-school-of-art-more-than-peasant-doodles/|title=Hlebine School of Art: More than peasant doodles|website=MoonProject|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivan Generalić]] was the first master of the Hlebine School, and the first to develop a distinctive personal style, achieving a high standard in his art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hmnu.org/en/vodic.asp|title=The Croatian Museum of Naive Art - Guide to the Permanent Display|last=Otvorena.hr|first=Otvorena mreza -|website=www.hmnu.org|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, the next generation of Hlebine painters tended to focus more on stylized depictions of country life taken from imagination. Generalić continued to be the dominant figure, and encouraged younger artists, including his son Josip Generalić.

The Hlebine school became a worldwide phenomenon with the 1952 Venice Biennale and exhibitions in Brazil and Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QujBgAAQBAJ|title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Croatia|date=2015-04-07|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9781465441737|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the best known naive artists are   [[Dragan Gaži]],  [[Ivan Generalić]],  [[Josip Generalić]],  [[Krsto Hegedušić]],  [[Mijo Kovačić]], [[Ivan Lacković-Croata]],  [[Franjo Mraz]],  [[Ivan Večenaj]] and [[Mirko Virius]].

[[File:NoHo14.JPG|thumb|right|200px|New condominium buildings along a North Hollywood street]]
[[File:Spumante in NoHo.JPG|thumb|right|Mixed-use apartment and restaurant on Magnolia Blvd.]]

The '''NoHo Arts District''' is a community in [[North Hollywood]], [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], that is home to contemporary theaters, art galleries, cafes, and shops. The community is generally bounded by Hatteras Street to the north, Cahuenga Blvd to the east, Tujunga Ave to the west, and Camarillo Street to the south. The area features more than twenty professional theaters, producing new work and classics, diverse art galleries, public art, and professional dance studios. The district also features the largest concentration of music recording venues west of the Mississippi. A Metro Rail station is located here, the [[North Hollywood station]] of the Red Line, and serves as the terminus of the Metro Orange Line busway.

Business and theater owners in the Universal City/North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce established a theater and arts district in 1992 with support from the Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs. They chose "NoHo", a play off the well-known [[SoHo|SoHo Arts District]] neighborhood of New York City.

Today, The NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with greater [[North Hollywood]], is being transformed into a regional center, in large part as a result of the construction of Metro Stations for the [[LACMTA Red Line|Red Line]] and the [[LACMTA Orange Line|Orange Line]], two lines that have made the neighborhood into a regional hub for the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Medium- and high-density developments are being built around the Metro Station, making the Arts District a center of citywide development, with the intent of creating a walkable [[New Urbanism|urban village]]. North Hollywood's landscape (and the Art's District as a result) has been transformed in recent years, with condominium towers (including a fifteen-story building on [[Lankershim Boulevard]] being built in the midst of older one-story bungalows and small apartment complexes.

The theater district includes two new large venues that expand upon existing theaters, the newly redesigned NoHo Arts Center (formerly the American Renegade Theatre) and the redesigned Historical El Portal. They add to the existing 31 theaters located in and around the NoHo Arts District. NoHo Commons, developed by J.H. Snyder Company, is located near the NoHo Arts District's commercial core and subway station. The $100-million, 292-unit loft apartment project by Snyder was the first segment to be completed of NoHo Commons, part of a "transit village" taking form at the terminus of the Metro Red Line subway and the Orange Line busway. The NoHo Commons construction and development consisted of three phases, completing with the construction of a [[Laemmle Theatres|Laemmle Theatre]]. Phase III also consisted of the construction of an eight-story office on the corner of Lankershim and Weddington in 2009. The building's primary tenant is currently the Art Institute of California-Hollywood. NoHo 14, a 180-unit, fourteen-story apartment building, was built in 2004 as one of the first large-scale developments in the neighborhood.

The historic North Hollywood train depot at Lankershim and Chandler Boulevards was restored in 2014 for $3.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segura|first1=Daniella|title=Metro finishes $3.6 million makeover of Lankershim Depot|url=http://www.scpr.org/news/2014/10/30/47757/metro-finishes-3-6-million-makeover-of-lankershim/|accessdate=July 25, 2016|work=Southern California Public Radio|date=October 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific Railroad]] standard design, a One Story Combination Depot No. 15 or 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Southern Pacific Lines Standard-Design Depots|last=Bender|first=Henry E., Jr.|publisher=Signature Press|year=2013|isbn=9781930013339|location=Berkeley and Wilton, California|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The train depot, dating to 1896, sits on land owned by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], across from the Metro Red Line subway station and next to the terminus of the Orange Line bus line.

Currently the NoHo Arts District, in conjunction with the Community Redevelopment Agency-Los Angeles, is working on beautification efforts to make the area more appealing to businesses. The current focus is primarily on revamping store fronts on Lankershim Blvd and Magnolia Blvd with Burbank Blvd to follow.

In the future, North Hollywood plans a $1 billion [[mixed-use development]] at Lankershim and Chandler, surrounding the Metro Red and Orange line terminals. The project would re-develop {{convert|15.6|acre|m2}} with {{convert|1720000|sqft|m2}} of commercial and residential space, including 562 residential units and three high-rise office towers. The project was awarded to Lowe Enterprises by the Los Angeles Metro board and will be designed by architects AC Martin Partners.

[[File:Pre-Columbian Stone Balls at Palmar Sur, Costa Rica.jpg|thumb|right|Several [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]]]]
In archaeology, a '''petrosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πέτρα (''petra''), "stone", and σφαῖρα (''sphaira''), "ball") is the name for any spherical man-made object of any size that is composed of stone. These mainly prehistoric artifacts may have been created or selected, but altered in some way to perform their specific function, including carving and painting.

Several classes of petrospheres exist, such as the [[stone spheres of Costa Rica]]; [[Pictish painted pebbles|painted pebbles]] from Scotland; stone charms from Scotland; sandstone balls from such sites as [[Traprain Law]];&lt;ref name="Rees and Hunter"&gt;Rees, Thomas &amp; Hunter, Fraser (2000). Archaeological excavation of a medieval structure and an assemblage of prehistoric artefacts from the summit of [[Traprain Law]], East Lothian. 1996 - 7. P.S.A.S. 130, P. 413 - 440.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Carved Stone Balls]], which are mainly from Scotland, although they have also been found in [[Cumbria]] and [[Ireland]]; and carved [[round shot|stone shot]] for cannons and [[trebuchet]]s.

Naturally formed [[stone balls]], such as [[concretion]]s and [[spherulite]]s, have been at times misidentified as petrospheres. For example, fringe archaeologists and advocates of prehistoric extraterrestrial visitors have repeatedly argued that the stone balls, which range in diameter from 0.61 to 3.35 m, found around Cerro Piedras Bola in the Sierra de Ameca, between Ahualulco de Mercado and Ameca, in Jalisco, Mexico, are petrospheres. However, these natural stone balls are megaspherulites that have been released by erosion from a 20- to 30-million-year-old ash flow tuff, which originally enclosed them and in which they formed. The proponents of these stone balls being petrospheres base their arguments on the false claims that all of these spheres are perfectly round, they are composed of granite, and natural processes cannot produce stone balls. Similarly, cannonball concretions, i.e. those found along the [[Cannonball River]] in [[North Dakota]] and near [[Moeraki]], [[South Island]], New Zealand, also have been misidentified as petrospheres.

'''Pitcher, with a ritual hunt scene''', is a polished, black, convex, short-neck pitcher. It is kept in the [[History Museum of Armenia]] under the number 1919-1.

== History ==
With the pitcher's dot design and engraving decoration, the body's top part is presented as a ritual procession plot. On the hood of the two-wheeled chariot, there is a human figure standing with his arms wide open, and in his hand a whip-shaped object. The chariot is drawn by two horses. In front of them, there is another human figure with his hands in the air, either praying or performing sorcery. A little further from them, around the perimeter of the container, there are six rows of animals. In the front, there is an animal walking with a long tail, snout, and long ears resembling a dog, who is followed by goats with similar posture and features, and one baby goat. The goats have long and curved horns, with standing short tails. While all the goats are facing one way, there is one goat facing the opposite, with a stretched neck.

The picture is linked to animal worship, fertility, and the beliefs of conception.

[[Image:Frith A Private View.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[A Private View at the Royal Academy, 1881]]'' by [[William Powell Frith]] (1883).]]

A '''private view''' is a special viewing of an [[art exhibition]] by invitation only, normal at the start of a public exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Alice-Azania Jarvis, [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art-and-architecture/features/how-to-behave-at-a-private-view-956358.html How to behave at a private view...], ''[[The Independent]], 10 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically wine and light refreshments are served on the form of a reception. If the artworks are by a living artist, it is normal for them to attend the private view.

An opening of an art exhibition which is open to the public is known as a [[vernissage]].

In visual media such as television and film, '''sexposition''' is the technique of providing [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] against a backdrop of sex or nudity.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hann|first=Michael|title=How 'sexposition' fleshes out the story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama?newsfeed=true|accessdate=March 29, 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' defined sexposition as "keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on".&lt;ref name=ft_lunch /&gt; Its purpose, according to [[James Poniewozik]], is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt&lt;ref&gt;Originally in: {{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title=Game of Thrones – "You Win or You Die"|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die/ |work=cultural-learnings.com |date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe scenes in the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author [[George R. R. Martin]] said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show.&lt;ref name=ft_lunch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexposition" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]''. According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have  disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_fails_the_female_gaze_why_does_prestige_tv_refuse_to_cater_erotically_to_women |title="Game of Thrones" fails the female gaze: Why does prestige TV refuse to cater erotically to women? |publisher=Salon |accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Marshall]], director of the second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that "[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience", an experience that Marshall described as "pretty surreal" to happen on the set of a major network production.&lt;ref name="plumb20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34164 | title=Neil Marshall Game Of Thrones Podcast | work=Empire | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Marshall, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does "pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes", while co-creator [[D. B. Weiss]] disagreed, countering that "Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss | title="Game of Thrones" Creators on Shark, Sexposition, and Season 3 | work=Mother Jones | issue=March/April 2013 |date=March 5, 2013 | accessdate=March 7, 2013 | author=Mechanic, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say "Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO."&lt;ref name="egner20130329"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/your-game-of-thrones-questions-answered/ | title=Your ‘Game of Thrones’ Questions, Answered | work=The New York Times | date=2013-03-29 | accessdate=March 29, 2013 | author=Egner, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported before the seventh season in 2017 that "Even if Benioff and Weiss don’t always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back".&lt;ref name="daddario2017"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=D'Addadio |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-10 |title='Game of Thrones': Inside the World's Most Popular Show |url=http://time.com/game-of-thrones-2017/ |magazine=Time |access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire==
Fan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when discussing Marshall's anecdote.&lt;ref name="wic20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/blackwater-director-neil-marshall-on-nudity-and-creating-the-battle/ | title="Blackwater" director Neil Marshall on nudity and creating the battle | work=Winter is Coming | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Ours is the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of ''[[HBO First Look]]'' featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old "creative consultant" to ''Game of Thrones''. Played by [[Andy Samberg]], the teenage boy was proud of "mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin ([[Bobby Moynihan]]) called Friedberg "a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it."&lt;ref name="snl20120414"&gt;{{cite episode | title=HBO First Look: Game of Thrones | series=Saturday Night Live | url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones | credits=Samberg, Andy; Moynihan, Bobby; Killam, Taran | network=NBC | airdate=April 14, 2012 | number=721  | season=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sims20120415"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/josh-brolingotye,71972/ | title=Josh Brolin/Gotye, S37/E19 | work=A.V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2991">[[File:Antikensammlung-Kykladenmuseum 0034.JPG|thumb|Late Mycenaean or Sub-Mycenaean small [[stirrup jar]]]]
'''Submycenaean pottery''' is a style of [[ancient Greek pottery]]. It is transitional between the preceding [[Mycenaean pottery]] and the subsequent styles of [[Greek vase painting]], especially the [[Protogeometric pottery|Protogeometric style]]. The vases date to between 1030 and 1000 BC. 

Submycenaean pottery is not very well researched, as only few sites from the period have been discovered so far. The style was first recognised in 1939 by [[Wilhelm Kraiker]] and [[Karl Kübler]], based on finds from the [[Kerameikos]] and Pompeion cemeteries in [[Athens]] and on [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The existence of the style remained disputed among archaeologists until later discoveries in [[Mycenae]] clearly showed the existence of separate Late Mycenaean and Submycenaean [[stratigraphy|strata]]. 

Submycenaean pottery occurs primarily in contexts such as [[inhumation]]s and stone-built cist graves. Find locations are widely distributed, suggesting a settlement pattern of hamlets and villages. Apart from the sites mentioned above, Submycenaean pottery is known from locations such as [[Corinth]], [[Asine]], [[Kalapodi]], [[Lefkandi]] and [[Tiryns]].

The quality of the vases varies widely. Only few shapes were produced, especially [[stirrup jar]]s with a pierced shoulder, [[Belly Amphora|belly amphora]]e and [[neck amphora]]e, ''[[lekythos|lekythoi]]'' as well as jars, some with trefoil-shaped mouths. By the end of the Submycenaean period, the stirrup jar was replaced by the ''lekythos''.  Submycenaean decoration is rather simple, the hand-painted motifs are limited to horizontal or vertical wavy lines, single or double hatched and overlapping triangles, as well as single or multiple concentric semicircles. The shoulders of ''lekythoi'', amphorae and stirrup jars bore ornamental decoration. Amphorae, ''[[amphoriskos|amphoriskoi]]'' and jugs were usually painted with one or several thick wavy lines. In general, the style was much shorter and less carefully made than the previous types of pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19124">The '''Synod of Elvira''' ({{lang-la|Concilium Eliberritanum}}, {{lang-es|Concilio de Elvira}}) was an ecclesiastical [[synod]] held at Elvira in the [[Western Roman Empire|Roman province]] of [[Hispania Baetica]], now [[Granada]] in southern Spain.&lt;ref name = "Hennecke"&gt;{{Citation | first = Edgar | last = Hennecke | author-link = Edgar Hennecke | contribution = Elvira, Synod of | title = [[Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]] | edition = 3rd}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its date has not been exactly determined but is believed to be in the first quarter of the [[Christianity in the 4th century|fourth century]], approximately 305–6. It was one of three councils, together with the [[Synod of Arles (314)]] and the [[Synod of Ancyra]], that first approached the character of general councils and prepared the way for the first [[ecumenical council]]. It was attended by nineteen bishops and twenty-six presbyters, mostly resident in [[Hispania Baetica|Baetica]]. Deacons and laymen were also present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Schaff | title = History of the Christian Church}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-one canons are recorded, although it is believed that many were added at later dates. All concern order, discipline and conduct among the Christian community.  Canon 36, [[Aniconism in Christianity|forbidding the use of images in churches]], became a bone of contention between Catholic and Protestant scholars after the [[Protestant Reformation]].

It is one of a number of [[Ancient church councils (pre-ecumenical)|pre-ecumenical ancient church councils and synods]].  The 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia refers to this as a "council," conveying a wider scope than a synod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05395b.htm | publisher = New Advent | title = Catholic encyclopedia | year = 1913}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican refers to it using both terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cclergy/documents/rc_con_cclergy_doc_31011994_directory_en.html | publisher = Roman curia | place = The Vatican | title = Congregation of the clergy}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Grenade, Puerta de Elvira.jpg|thumb|If the ancient Roman city of Elvira was located in the Albaicín district of Granada, as some think, the synod may have taken place just inside the Puerta de Elvira (eleventh-century), seen here.]]

==Place and purpose==
The place of meeting, Eliberri, rendered as Elvira,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Eliberri]], Elimberri'' or ''Ilumberri'' was an ancient cognate of today Basque ''Hiriberri'' or ''Irunberri'' that mean 'new domain', 'new town.&lt;/ref&gt; was not far from the modern [[Granada]], if not, as A.W. Dale&lt;ref&gt;Dale 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; and Edgar Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; think, actually identical with it. There the nineteen bishops and twenty-four presbyters, mostly  from [[Hispania Baetica]] and [[Carthago Nova]],{{Efn | Hennecke noted that Legio (Leon) and Saragoza were represented, but not Tarragona.}} assembled, probably at the instigation of [[Hosius of Córdoba]], but under the presidency of Felix of Accitum ([[Guadix]]) in Baetica, probably by virtue of his being the oldest bishop present,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Hosius%20(1),%20a%20confessor%20under%20Maximian | first = Henry | last = Wace | title = Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature | contribution = Hosius (1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with a view to restoring order and discipline in the church. The canons which were adopted reflect with considerable fullness the internal life and external relations of the Spanish Church of the 4th century. The reputation of this council drew to its canons further canons that came to be associated with the Synod of Elvira.

Victor De Clercq&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = De Clercq | first = Victor | type = review | contribution = Samuel Laeuchli, ''Power and Sexuality: The Emergence of Canon Law at the Synod of Elvira | title = Vigiliae Christianae | volume = 29 | issue = 1 |date=March 1975 | page = 76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; notes "that except for [[Hosius of Córdoba]], we know practically nothing about these men, nor do we know with certainty when and why the council was held, and that the church of Spain is one of the least known in pre-constantinian [sic] times". 

==The canons==
Maurice Meigne&lt;ref&gt;"Concile ou collection d'Elvire," ''[[Revue d'histoire ecclésiastique]]'' '''70''' (1975) pp 361-387&lt;/ref&gt; considers that only the first twenty-one canons in the list that has been transmitted&lt;ref&gt;Problems of the textual transmission of the canons are discussed in Hamilton Hess, ''The Early Development of Canon Law and the Council of Serdica'' (Oxford Early Christian Studies, Oxford: 2002) pp 40-42.&lt;/ref&gt; were promulgated at Elvira; the remainder having been added to the collection.

The social environment of [[Christian]]s in Hispania may be inferred from the canons prohibiting [[Interfaith marriage|marriage]] and other intercourse with [[Jew]]s, [[paganism|pagans]] and [[heretics]], closing the offices of [[flamen]] and [[duumvir]] to Christians, forbidding all contact with [[idolatry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Robert | last = Grigg | contribution = Aniconic Worship and the Apologetic Tradition: A Note on Canon 36 of the Council of Elvira | title = Church History | volume = 45 | issue = 4 |date=December 1976 | pages = 428–33}} finds that the hostility to [[icon]]s, forbidding the introduction of images into the churches is based on Christian [[apologist]]s' use of pagan sources denouncing the veneration of images, rather than on the prohibition in ''[[Book of Exodus|Exodus]]'', which it fails to cite. He instances the contemporaneous apologists [[Arnobius]] and [[Lactantius]].&lt;/ref&gt; and likewise participation in pagan festivals and public games. The state of morals is mirrored in the canons denouncing prevalent vices. The canons respecting the clergy exhibit the clergy as already a special class with particular privileges, as acting under a more exacting moral standard, with heavier penalties for delinquency. The [[bishop]] has acquired control of the [[Sacraments (Catholic Church)|sacraments]], [[presbyter]]s and [[deacons]] acting only under his orders; the episcopate appears as a unit, bishops being bound to respect one another's disciplinary decrees.

The canons (which are available in English and Latin online) are almost entirely concerned with the conduct of various elements of the Christian community, and have no theological content as such.  Sanctions include long delays before baptism, exclusion from the [[Eucharist]] for periods of months or years, or indefinitely, sometimes with an exception for the death-bed, though this is also specifically excluded in some cases. Periods of [[penance]], often for sexual offences, extend to 5 or 10 years:  "Canon 5. If a woman beats her servant and causes death within three days, she shall undergo seven years' penance if the injury was inflicted on purpose and five years' if it was accidental.  She shall not receive communion during this penance unless she becomes ill.  If so, she may receive communion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Fordham | title = Canon 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the canons which pertain to Jews served to maintain a separation between the two communities. Canon 15 prohibited marriage with pagans, while Canon 16 prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with [[ostracism]]. Canon 49 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and Canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.

Among the early canons (which are possibly the only original ones), Canon 1 forbade giving holy communion to lapsed Christians even ''in articulo mortis'', an unusually severe application of [[Novatianism|Novatianist principles]], which had divided the church since the recovery from mid 3rd-century persecutions: compare the severity of [[Cyprian of Carthage]]. The subject of this leading canon is a major indication for a date following recent persecution.

Among the later canons, of especial note are Canon 33, enjoining [[celibacy]] upon all clerics, married or not, and all who minister at the altar (the most ancient canon of [[clerical celibacy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Charles A | last = Frazee | title = The Origins of Clerical Celibacy in the Western Church | journal = Church History | volume = 57 | issue = Supplement Centennial | year = 1988 | pages = 108–26 | doi=10.2307/3165654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also relating to the subject of clerical celibacy is Canon 27, which calls for bishops and other clergy to refrain from living with women unless they are of relation.&lt;ref&gt;Hefele, Karl Joseph von, Joseph Hergenröther, Alois Knöpfler, and Henri Leclercq. 1907. Histoire des conciles d'après les documents originaux. 236. Paris: Letouzey et Ané. http://www.llmcdigital.org/default.aspx?redir=87181.&lt;/ref&gt; This canon is believed to be condemning the practice of [[Syneisaktism]], or spiritual marriage, which was growing more and more popular among ascetic men and women.

Canon 36 states, "It has seemed good that images should not be in churches so that what is venerated and worshiped not be painted on the walls."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | quote = Placuit picturas in ecclesia esse non debere, ne quod colitur et adoratur in parietibus depingatur | title = Elvira canons | publisher = Cua | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm | archivedate = 2012-09-05 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The Catholic Encyclopedia | quote = This canon has often been urged against the veneration of images as practised in the Catholic Church. [[Anton Joseph Binterim|Binterim]], De Rossi, and [[Karl Josef von Hefele|Hefele]] interpret this prohibition as directed against the use of images in overground churches only, lest the pagans should caricature sacred scenes and ideas; [[Franz Xaver von Funk|Von Funk]], Termel, and [[Henri Leclercq|Dom Leclerq]] opine that the council did not pronounce as to the liceity or non-liceity of the use of images, but as an administrative measure simply forbade them, lest new and weak converts from paganism should incur thereby any danger of relapse into idolatry, or be scandalized by certain superstitious excesses in no way approved by the ecclesiastical authority.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Efn | A possible translation is also: "There shall be no pictures in the church, lest what is worshipped and adored should be depicted on the walls."}}  It allegedly [[Aniconism|forbids pictures]] in churches (compare the [[Iconoclastic Controversy]] in the East); according to [[Philip Schaff]] this canon "has often been quoted by Protestants as an argument against image worship as idolatrous; while Roman Catholic writers explain it either as a prohibition of representations of the deity only, or as a prudential measure against heathen desecration of holy things".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Schaff | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/hcc2.v.vi.xv.html | title = History | volume = II | chapter = 55 | publisher = The Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Canon 36 was the first official statement on art by the Christian Church and so of special interest in the history of Early Christian and medieval art, even if it represents Church policy only within the limits of the synod's jurisdiction of Spain.  Recent scholarship argues that, rather than read the canon as a simple prohibition against the use of Christian art as idolatrous as has traditionally been done, its purpose was to counter a disturbing culture of apostasy and loss of communal identity that had arisen in the Spanish Church through the strong integration of the Christian subculture within the dominant pagan culture (the result of a peaceful period of social integration followed by an unusually bloody persecution).[[:File:///C:/Users/Rackdude/Google Drive/Riverside/2015-2016/Winter/Wikipedia Project/Basic Files/Synod of Elvira.docx# edn1|[i]]]  In this, Canon 36 was a compromise solution in its silence on the subject of private Christian art.  Never adopted outside of Spain (although many other canons of the Synod of Elvira were), Canon 36 is tacit evidence of a significant point of transition in the development of a distinctly Christian artistic culture, one that was leaving the venerable Judaic precedent of the Second Commandment behind as the Church cautiously accepted its increasingly mainstream status and the powerful socio-political dynamic that was a part of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1999-03-01|title=In the Beginning: Theories and images of creation in Northern Europe in the twelfth century|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8365.00138/abstract|journal=Art History|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=3–55|doi=10.1111/1467-8365.00138|issn=1467-8365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canon 38, permits lay [[baptism]] under certain conditions, and Canon 53, forbids one bishop restoring a person [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by another.

Other provisions relating to images forbade Christian slave-owners from allowing their pagan slaves to keep their personal idols, or "if this is impossible to enforce, they must at least avoid the idols and remain pure.  If this does not happen, they are alienated from the church" (Canon 41).  Canon 60 says "If someone smashes an idol and is then punished by death, he or she may not be placed in the list of martyrs, since such action is not sanctioned by the Scriptures or by the apostles."  Canon 34 says "Candles are not to be burned in a cemetery during the day.  This practice is related to paganism and is harmful to Christians.  Those who do this are to be denied the communion of the church".  Other canons imposed "the rigorous form of fasting" every Saturday (Canon 26), forbade the baptism of chariot racers or stage performers (Canon 62), and many tightly control the reception of former pagan priests into the Christian church and clergy (Canons, 2,3,4,55).

Several canons relate only to the behaviour of women, such as Canon 67: "A woman who is baptized or is a catechumen must not associate with hairdressers or men with long hair..."  Canon 81 reads: "A woman may not write to other lay Christians without her husband's consent.  A woman may not receive letters of friendship addressed to her only and not to her husband as well."  However married former prostitutes are not to suffer delays in baptism on that account (Canon 44).

==Date of the synod==
The solution of the question of the date hinges upon the interpretation of the canons, that is, upon whether they are to be taken as reflecting a recent persecution, or as redacted in a time of peace, that is either after or before the [[Diocletianic Persecution|persecution under Diocletian]]. Thus the earliest investigators, [[Louis Duchesne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Duchesne | first = Louis | author-link = Louis Duchesne | title = Le concile d'Elvira et les flamines chrétiennes | language = French |trans-title=The Elvira council and the Christian… | journal = Mélanges Renier | place = Paris | year = 1887 | pages = 159–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Victor De Clercq,&lt;ref&gt;De Clercq (1954), ''Ossius of Cordova''.&lt;/ref&gt; argue for a date between 300 and 303, i.e. before the persecution under [[Diocletian]]; others for a date between 303 and 314, after the persecution, but before the [[Synod of Arles (314)]]; a few others argue for a date between the synod of Arles and the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]], (325).  [[Karl Josef von Hefele]] and [[Robert William Dale]] follow early compilers of the canons [[Giovanni Domenico Mansi]] and [[Jean Hardouin]] in agreement upon 305 or 306, while Hennecke&lt;ref name = "Hennecke" /&gt; concludes that "the whole attitude points to a time of peace, not to one immediately following a persecution; the complete absence of any provisions as to the case of the lapsed is enough to preclude the modern theory as to the date".

==Documentation==
The scanty documentation of the Synod of Elvira was first assembled by  Ferdinand de Mendoza, ''De confirmando Concilio IIIiberitano ad Clementem VIII'', 1593.

The canons are available online [https://www.webcitation.org/6AS7rgB7f?url=http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/canon%20Law/ElviraCanons.htm in English] and [http://www.earlychurchtexts.com/main/elvira/canons_of_elvira_01.shtml in Latin (with dictionary lookup links)]

'''UK Theatre''' (formerly the '''Theatrical Management Association''') was founded in 1894 as the Theatrical Managers Association, with Sir [[Henry Irving]] as its first president.[http://uktheatre.org/who-we-are-what-we-do/about-uk-theatre/history/] There are however records of the activity of a Theatrical Managers Association going back to at least 1866.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatres v. Music Halls", ''Illustrated Weekly News,'' 3 November 1866 p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Era'', 22 October 1871,  p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Irving was still president in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;‘Chit Chat’, ''The Stage,'' 31 January 1901 p. 11. Irving is described here as the chairman.&lt;/ref&gt;

== UK Theatre today ==
UK Theatre is the UK’s association for companies and organisations involved professionally in the production and presentation of the [[performing arts]]. The association has presented the [[TMA Awards]] annually since 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4121">'''Warmed-over flavor''' is an unpleasant characteristic usually associated with [[meat]] which has been cooked and then refrigerated.  The deterioration of meat flavor is most noticeable upon reheating.  As cooking and subsequent refrigeration is the case with most [[convenience food]]s containing meat, it is a significant challenge to the [[Food processing|processed food]] [[Food industry|industry]]. The flavor is variously described as "rancid," "stale," and like "cardboard," and even compared to "damp dog hair."&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{ cite journal | author = Frank, P. | title = Warmed-over flavor: a processing challenge | journal = Refrigerated &amp; Frozen Foods |date=March 2003 | volume = 2003 | issue = 3 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-100074391.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Warmed-over flavor is caused by the [[oxidation|oxidative]] [[decomposition]] of [[lipids]] (fatty substances) in the meat into chemicals (short-chain [[aldehydes]] or [[ketones]]) which have an unpleasant taste or odor.  This decomposition process begins after cooking or processing and is aided by the release of naturally occurring [[iron]] in the meat.&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;

==Appearance of warmed-over flavor==
The appearance of warmed-over flavor begins as lipids, primarily lipids from the [[cell membrane]] of cells in the meat, are attacked by [[oxygen]].  This process is aided by the release of [[iron]] from iron-containing proteins in the meat, including [[myoglobin]] and [[hemoglobin]].  The iron is released by the heat of cooking, or by mechanical grinding. The free iron then acts as a [[catalyst]], or promoter, of oxidation reactions.  The reactions break down some of the fats in the meat to form primary oxidation products.  These chemicals are not directly responsible for the objectionable taste.  Instead, they subsequently further decompose to secondary oxidation products including "[[alcohol]]s, [[acid]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[lactone]]s and [[unsaturated hydrocarbon]]s which produce the [warmed-over flavor]."  Many of these compounds, including [[pentanal]], [[hexanal]], [[pentylfuran]], [[2-pentylfuran]], [[2-octenal]] and [[2,3-octanedione]] have a strong odor and can be tasted at concentrations as low as 1 part per billion.&lt;ref name="Trout"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jf00093a017 | title = Prevention of warmed-over flavor in cooked beef: effect of phosphate type, phosphate concentration, a lemon juice/phosphate blend, and beef extract | year = 1990 | last1 = Trout | first1 = G. R. | last2 = Dale | first2 = S. | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry | volume = 38 | issue = 3| pages = 665–669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Warmed-over flavor can be prevented by the addition of [[preservatives]] to processed meat.  Many of the preservatives are [[antioxidant]]s, ranging from [[tocopherol]]s (related to vitamin E) to [[plum]] juice to industrial additives such as [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT), [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[propyl gallate]].&lt;ref name="Frank" /&gt;  Other preservatives such as [[sodium pyrophosphate]] and [[sodium hexametaphosphate]] may work by binding iron and preventing it from catalyzing the chemical reactions which lead to warmed-over flavor; as these compounds are generally more soluble in water than the fat-soluble antioxidant preservatives, they may be more readily used to prevent oxidative decomposition in meat.&lt;ref name="Trout" /&gt; [[Nitrite]]s, a curing agent for meat, may prevent the development of warmed-over flavor by preventing the release of iron during cooking.&lt;ref name="Igene"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0308-8146(85)90099-8 | title = Mechanisms by which nitrite inhibits the development of warmed-over flavour (WOF) in cured meat | year = 1985 | last1 = Igene    | first1 = J. | last2 = Yamauchi | first2 = K.   | last3 = Pearson  | first3 = A.

'''The looting of Polish cultural artifacts during World War II''' was carried out by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] side by side after the [[invasion of Poland]] of 1939. A significant portion of Poland's cultural heritage, estimated at about half a million art objects, was plundered by the occupying powers. Cataloged pieces are still occasionally recovered elsewhere and returned to Poland.

Priceless pieces of art still considered missing or found in Russian museums include works by [[Bernardo Bellotto|Canaletto]], [[Anna Bilińska-Bohdanowicz]]owa, [[Józef Brandt]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Frans Luycx]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], [[Veit Stoss]], [[Alfred Wierusz-Kowalski]], [[Leon Wyczółkowski]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Henri Gervex]], [[Ludwig Buchhorn]], [[Józef Simmler]], [[Henri-Pierre Danloux]], [[Jan Miense Molenaer]] and many others.&lt;ref name="sural"&gt;{{cite journal | author =Agnieszka Sural | year =2013 | month = | title =Najcenniejsze dzieła zaginione podczas II wojny światowej |trans-title=The most precious pieces of art missing since WWII | journal =culture.pl | volume = | issue =2013-08-13 | pages = | issn = | url =http://www.culture.pl/baza-sztuki-pelna-tresc/-/eo_event_asset_publisher/eAN5/content/najcenniejsze-dziela-zaginione-podczas-ii-wojny-swiatowej# | publisher=[[Adam Mickiewicz Institute]] | location=Warsaw | accessdate =2013-08-22 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the efforts to locate and retrieve the missing pieces of art, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] founded the Database of War Losses, as of 2013 containing over 63,000 entries.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"&gt;{{cite web | author=Muzeum Utracone (corporate author) | title=About The Lost Museum | publisher=Muzeum Utracone | year=2013 | work= muzeumutracone.pl| url=http://muzeumutracone.pl/o-muzeum/ | accessdate=2013-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The list is periodically sent to over 100 auction houses around the world, published by the Ministry and also submitted to the National Institute of Museology and Collections Protection, Polish embassies, and the Central Registry of Information on Looted Cultural Property 1933-1945 (lootedart.com).&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt; In addition, the Ministry also founded the Lost Museum website, a virtual museum containing historic photographs of many pieces of art still missing.&lt;ref name="muzeum-o"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

==Background==
At the beginning of the [[1939 invasion of Poland]], the Polish interwar government attempted to conceal the nation's most valued cultural heritage such as the royal treasures of the [[Wawel Castle]] in [[Kraków]]. The royal accessories including the [[Jagiellonian tapestries]] were secretly shipped to Western Europe and then to Canada among other places. At the end of the war, two parallel Polish governments, the Western-supported [[Polish government-in-exile]] and the Soviet-backed government in [[Communist Poland]] laid claims to these national treasures. The cultural artifacts were released by Canada to the [[People's Republic of Poland]] in February 1961.&lt;ref name="university"/&gt;&lt;ref name="treasures"/&gt;

==Nazi Germany==
Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 and the [[occupation of Poland]] by German forces, the Nazi regime attempted to [[Polish culture during World War II|suppress Polish culture]].&lt;ref name="JOG_quote"/&gt; As part of that process, the Nazis confiscated Polish national heritage assets and much private property.&lt;ref name="Knuth2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Madajczyk122"/&gt; Acting on the legal decrees of October 19 and December 16 (''Verordnung über die Beschlagnahme Kunstgegeständen im Generalgouvernement''), several German agencies began the process of looting Polish museums and other collections, ostensibly considered necessary for the "securing" of German national interests.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;

Thousands of art objects were plundered, as the Nazis carried out a plan put in place before the start of hostilities.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The looting was supervised by experts of the ''[[SS]]''-''[[Ahnenerbe]]'', ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' units, who were responsible for art; and, by experts of ''[[Haupttreuhandstelle Ost]]'', who were responsible for confiscating businesses and more mundane objects.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Nazi officials responsible for carrying-out the plan included [[Hans Posse]], [[Josef Mühlmann]] and his half-brother [[Kajetan Mühlmann|Kajetan]] (a.k.a. Kai, both from the [[SS]]),&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="miastospoleczne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |title=Warszawa Oskarża |publisher=Drukarnia Narodowa, M-01526 |work=Przewodnik po wystawie urządzonej przez Biuro Odbudowy Stolicy wespół z Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie |accessdate=August 4, 2012 |author1=Ministerstwo Kultury i Sztuki |author2=i Ministerstwo Odbudowy Kraju |language=Polish |format=PDF direct download, 91.8 KB |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715001132/http://miastospoleczne.pl/web/uploads/docs/2c834dc21a2f465b4e247e85ad18e19de4332fc2.pdf |archivedate=July 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zab"/&gt; overseen by [[Dagobert Frey]], an SS historian originally also from Austria, selected by Berlin to validate Poland as a "Teutonic land" without Jews.&lt;ref name="dictionaryofarthistorians"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/freyd.htm | title=Frey, Dagobert | publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians | accessdate=August 4, 2012 | author=Department of Art, Art History, and Visual Studies of Duke University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the official looting by Nazi authorities, some looting was also carried out by individuals acting on their own initiative; in fact Mühlmann complained as early as on October 6, 1939, that many items he was tasked to secure had already been moved or simply stolen.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; While the Nazis kept extensive documentation of newly acquired looted art pieces, the system was not foolproof, and they lost track of much of the looted goods during the increasingly haphazard evacuation of Polish territories in 1944.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

Most of the important art pieces had been "secured" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that "over 90%" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned ''[[Führermuseum]]'' in [[Linz]], while other art became the private property of Nazi officials.&lt;ref name=Madajczyk122/&gt; In 1940, Hitler received a "gift" from [[Hans Frank]], governor of [[General Government|occupied Poland]] - a collection, prepared by Mühlmann, of 521 of the most valuable art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Frank aided by ''Oberführer'' Mühlmann, an art connoisseur, amassed a large collection of Polish art pieces.&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The total cost of the Nazi theft and destruction of Polish art is estimated at 11.14 billion dollars (value in 2001 dollars).&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt;

Over 516,000 individual art pieces were taken.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The exact number is uncertain as not all art was registered, and much of that documentation was lost as well.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt;&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; Assessment of losses began during World War II under the auspices of the [[Polish government in exile]] and the [[Polish Underground State]]; in 1944, [[Karol Estreicher (junior)|Karol Estreicher]] published in London the first work on this subject, ''Cultural Losses of Poland''.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; A 2010 estimate gave a figure of 75% for the percentage of cultural heritage lost by Poland during the war&lt;ref name="gp"/&gt; (though that estimate covers both destroyed and lost cultural heritage).&lt;ref name="jasinski"/&gt; The looted art included 11,000 paintings by Polish painters; 2,800 paintings by other European painters; 1,400 sculptures; 75,000 manuscripts; 25,000 maps, 22,000 books printed before 1800 (''starodruki''); 300,000 graphics, and hundreds of thousands of other items of artistic and historical value.&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; The number of looted or destroyed books is estimated at 1.5 million&lt;ref name="Matelski2005-160"/&gt; to as high as 15&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; or 22 million.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; Even exotic animals were taken from the [[zoo]]s.&lt;ref name="Kisling2000"/&gt;

During the genocidal campaign against the [[Polish Jews]] culminating in the ''[[Aktion Reinhard]]'' of 1942, extortion and mass looting became part of German economics, not only Nazi policy towards Poland's heritage.&lt;ref name="arc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en-CA&amp;q=cache:_OoZLk7G3wAJ:http://www.deathcamps.org/reinhard/areconomics.html%2Bwww.death-camps.org/reinhard/areconomics&amp;gbv=2&amp;&amp;ct=clnk |title=Aktion Reinhard Economics |publisher=Aktion Reinhard |work=Google's cache |year=2006 |accessdate=30 July 2014 |author=ARC}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Robbery of Polish Jews and looting of their property became the norm. In every town and village, Jews were forced to hand over not merely gold, currency and other valuables, but virtually anything consumable, including furniture and clothing. Even items such as birdcages, door handles and hot-water bottles were looted. Any excuse, or none at all, became the pretext for extortion.&lt;ref name="arc"/&gt;}}

==Soviet Union==
[[File:Пл. Ринок, 4.JPG|thumb|upright|Holdings of ''Lwów Historical Museum'' were taken to the basement of Black House and smashed behind closed doors.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;]]
After the [[Soviet invasion of Poland|Soviet Union invaded Poland]] on September 17, 1939, it similarly engaged in the looting and destruction of the Polish cultural heritage.&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;&lt;ref name="nimoz"/&gt; It is estimated that soon after the invasion, about half of Polish museums and similar public institutions were dismantled in the territories occupied by the Soviets. Many items were shipped to Soviet museums such as the [[Moscow Museum of History]] and the [[Central Anti-Religious Museum]] (also in Moscow).&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt; Other collections were simply done away with. For instance, during the liquidation of the Poland's ''Lwów Historical Museum'' in the early 1940, its holdings were transported to the basement of the Black (''Czarna'') [[Kamienica (architecture)|Kamienica]] ''(pictured)'', away from public eye, and deliberately destroyed there.&lt;ref name="nimoz-2000"/&gt;

Following the Soviet advance across the German-occupied Polish lands, the looting and plunder of anything of value continued&lt;ref name=jasinski/&gt;  up to 1947 even though the looted territories were theoretically assigned to its own ally, the [[Polish People's Republic|communist Poland]] already.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raack" /&gt; The Soviet forces engaged in particularly extensive plunder in the [[former eastern territories of Germany]] that were to be transferred to Poland, stripping them of any piece of equipment left behind.&lt;ref name="jasinski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSZ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-MM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IPN-Ś" /&gt; Even the [[History of Poland (1945–1989)#Stalinist era (1948–1956)|Polish Communists]] felt uneasy about the scope of their crimes. In 1945, the future Chairman of the [[Polish Council of State]], Gen. [[Aleksander Zawadzki]], worried that "raping and looting of the Soviet army would provoke a civil war"&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

{{see also|Rape during the liberation of Poland|Soviet war crimes}}

The operations of these "war trophy brigades" were regulated by detailed orders issued by Soviet vice-minister of defence [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in early 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ВОЕННАЯ ЛИТЕРАТУРА --[ Первоисточники ]-- Приказы народного комиссара обороны СССР (1943-1945)|url = http://militera.lib.ru/docs/da/nko_1943-1945/14.html|website = militera.lib.ru|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1948 these brigades sent at least 239'000 [[Railroad car|freight cars]] to USSR transporting natural resources, complete factories and individual machines. Town of [[Bydgoszcz]] lost 30 complete factories and 250 ships, from [[Grudziądz]] the army confiscated all machinery from factories, regardless of their size. From [[Toruń]] all [[gristmill]]s were taken, causing temporary deficit of bread. Blachownia Śląska lost a large, German-built [[synthetic fuel]] producing installation, transported to USSR on 10,000 train cars. A similar production line in [[Police, West Pomeranian Voivodeship|Police]] was transported using 14,000 cars. [[Gliwice]] lost a pipe factory, [[Bobrek, Cieszyn|Bobrek]] and Łabędy - iron furnaces. Complete power stations were taken from Miechowice, [[Zabrze]], [[Zdzieszowice]], Mikulczyce, Blachownia Śląska i Chełmsk Śląski. Smaller industries were also confiscated in [[Sosnowiec]], [[Dąbrowa Górnicza]], [[Częstochowa]], Zgoda, [[Chorzów]], [[Siemianowice Śląskie|Siemianowice]], [[Poznań]], [[Bydgoszcz]], [[Grudziądz]], [[Toruń]], [[Inowrocław]], [[Włocławek]], [[Chojnice]], [[Łódź]], Dziedzice and [[Oświęcim]].

Farming animals were also significant target of looting: until 1 September 1945 the [[Red Army]] confiscated 506,000 cows, 114,000 sheep and 206,000 horses. In February 1945 alone over 72,000 tons of sugar was taken. In Toruń region alone 14,000 tons of grain, 20,000 of potatoes and 21,000 beetroots were taken during that period. These number represent looting alone, as the Polish government also supplied food to the Red Army officially at that time (150,000 tons of grains, 250,000 tons of potatoes, 25,000 tons of meat and 100,000 tons of straws).

Individual Red Army soldiers were also allowed to send home "war trophies", with the weight depending on their rank, which resulted in widespread looting of private houses of anything valuable, including food, clothes, shoes, radios, jewelry, utensils, clothes, bicycles, and even ceramic toilet bowls. Scale of individual looting can be estimated by the example of Russian town of [[Kursk]], which received only 300 personal parcels from soldiers in January 1945 but till May their number reached 87,000.

After these transports were finished, the Red Army also started looting the train infrastructure itself—repair yards, signalling installations and the rails themselves: around 5,500&amp;nbsp;km of rails were looted.

In 1946 the scale of looting was estimated by Polish authorities at 2.375 billions of 1938 dollars (equivalent of $54 billion in 2015 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ŁUPY WOJENNE|url = http://www.polska-zbrojna.pl/home/articleinmagazineshow/13006?t=LUPY-WOJENNE|website = www.polska-zbrojna.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Największy rabunek w dziejach Pomorza i Kujaw - Express Bydgoski - Bydgoszcz, Kujawy i Pomorze - aktualności, informacje, artykuły, wydarzenia.|url = http://express.bydgoski.pl/990,Najwiekszy-rabunek-w-dziejach-Pomorza-i-Kujaw.html|website = express.bydgoski.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Znienawidzona Armia Czerwona w Łodzi - Dzienniklodzki.pl|url = http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/artykul/516739,znienawidzona-armia-czerwona-w-lodzi,id,t.html?cookie=1#!|website = www.dzienniklodzki.pl|accessdate = 2015-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rosja jest nam winna 54 miliardy dolarów.

==Efforts to locate and reclaim the lost art==
After the war, the Polish [[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Ministry of Culture and Art]] took over efforts to compile a list of lost art, locate it and recover it.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The Bureau of Revindication and Damages (''Biuro Rewindykacji i Odszkodowań'') operated from 1945 to 1951.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; The realities of the [[Cold War]] made retrieval of looted cultural heritage difficult, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that the situation changed.&lt;ref name="MSZ2"/&gt; In 1991, a new body was formed for that purpose, the Bureau of the Government Representative for Polish Cultural Heritage Abroad (''Biuro Pełnomocnika Rządu ds. Polskiego Dziedzictwa Kulturalnego Za Granicą''), operating at the Ministry of Culture and Art.&lt;ref name="MSZ"/&gt; In 1999, the initiative received support from the Polish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name="MSZ3"/&gt; Once a looted piece of art is located, the Polish government issues a request for its restoration, and as noted on the Ministry website, all requests to date have been successful.&lt;ref name=MSZ3/&gt; {{As of|October 2012}}, the Ministry listed 30 objects which had been retrieved in the years 2001-2012.&lt;ref name="MSZ4"/&gt; Among the recovered art is the [[Aleksander Gierymski]]'s ''Jewish Woman''—found by surprise at the ''Eva Aldag'' auction house in [[Buxtehude]] in November 2010, returned to [[National Museum, Warsaw]] at the end of July 2011 and restored.&lt;ref name="gierymski"/&gt;

[[File:Raphael missing.jpg|thumb|[[Raphael]]'s ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'' reported hidden in a secret bank vault]]
On 1 August 2012, the [[Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] announced that one of the most famous pieces of Polish art, [[Raphael]]'s painting ''[[Portrait of a Young Man (Raphael)|Portrait of a Young Man]]'', had been found "in a bank vault in an undisclosed location"; a ministry spokesman was confident that the painting would eventually be returned to Poland.&lt;ref name="panarmenian"/&gt; In April 2014, [[Francesco Guardi]]'s ''Palace Stairs'' was recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/45012/germany-returns-stolen-polish-art-from-1939/|title=Germany Returns Stolen Polish Art from 1939|last=Fry|first=Maddy|date=2014-04-01|website=Time.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, Poland is planning to build a [[virtual museum]], the [[Lost Museum]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Muzeum Utracone|pl}}), which would feature the lost art.&lt;ref name=gp/&gt;

Both Germany and the [[post-Soviet states|countries of the former Soviet Union]] still have much Polish material looted during World War II.&lt;ref name="GW2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rękopis Słowackiego odnaleziony w Rosji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="onet"/&gt; In particular, recovering looted art from the former states of the Soviet Union, such as Russia, is proving difficult.&lt;ref name="wprost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="przeglad-tygodnik"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2002/spring/spoils-of-war-1.html | title=Spoils of War Returned: U.S. Restitution of Nazi-Looted Cultural Treasures to the USSR, 1945 - 1959, Part 1 | author=[[Patricia Kennedy Grimsted]] | journal=[[Prologue (magazine)|Prologue]] | year=Fall 2002 | volume=34 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
