In [[anthropology]], '''anthropopoiesis''' is the self-building process of social man and of a whole culture, particularly referred to what concerns modifications of socialized body. The concept found applications mainly in French and Italian contemporary literatures.

In accordance with theoretic background which supports the idea, man is an unfinished being or better his behaviour is not strongly prefixed by genetic heritage. Human beings become fully finished only by means of culture acquisition.

Anthropopoiesis is both anthropogenesis (man “reborn” as social creature) and manufacturing of ”mankind patterns and fictions”. Therefore social and cultural practices build up the man by means of ritual and institutional constraints.

An example could be circumcision, a practice widely existing in many rites of passage amongst Islamic and Jewish believers and also amongst traditional cultures and communities. Besides, Christians ascribe a clear meaning to the sacred garment and to the tonsure; they are convinced that some sacramental rites mark indelible dispositions. All that affects the body and through this one the perception of one’s own identity and social status.

'''Attraction to disability''' is a sexualised interest in the appearance, sensation and experience of [[disability]].&lt;ref name="limoncin" /&gt; It may extend from normal [[human sexuality]] into a type of [[sexual fetishism]]. [[Sexology|Sexologically]], the pathological end of the attraction tends to be classified as a [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="Money &amp; Simcoe 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = J. | last2 = Simcoe | first2 = K.

==History==
Until the 1990s, it tended to be described mostly as [[acrotomophilia]], at the expense of other disabilities, or of the wish by some to pretend or acquire disability. Bruno (1997) systematised the attraction as factitious disability disorder.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt; A decade on, others argue that [[erotic target location error]] is at play, classifying the attraction as an identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Lawrence 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawrence 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lawrence | first1 = A. A. | title = Erotic Target Location Errors: An Underappreciated Paraphilic Dimension | doi = 10.1080/00224490902747727 | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 46 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 194–215 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19308843 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the standard psychiatric reference ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'', text revision (DSM-IV-tr), the fetish falls under the general category of "Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders" and the more specific category of [[paraphilia]], or sexual fetishes;&lt;ref name="McRuer &amp; Mollow 2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=McRuer, Robert |author2=Anna Mollow |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Sex and Disability|year=2012|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822351542|pages=360–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; this classification is preserved in DSM-5.&lt;ref name="Blanchard 2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://individual.utoronto.ca/ray_blanchard/index_files/WAS_DSM.html |author=Blanchard, Ray |title=Paraphilias and the DSM-V: General Diagnostic Issues and Options Exemplified with Pedohebephilic Disorder. Paper presented at 19th WAS World Congress for Sexual Health, June 25, 2009, Göteborg, Sweden |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As fetish subculture==
Desires to pretend to be disabled and acquire a disability are extensions of the pathological disorder. About half of all devotees occasionally pretend (43 percent of Nattress [1996], sample of 50). Avowed "[[Body integrity identity disorder|wannabes]]" seem to number not more than five percent of the devotee-wannabe population, though Nattress (1996) found 22 percent of his sample of 50 had wanted to become disabled. Accordingly, Bruno (1997) puts those afflicted with versions of the paraphilia under the broad heading of Devotees, Pretenders, and Wannabes ('''DPW'''s), as used here.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt;

Well over half of DPWs have felt this pathological attraction since childhood, as typical in paraphilias. ''The Amelotatist'' (see References) found that 75 percent of its sample of 195 were aware of the attraction by age fifteen. Those attracted often cherish early memories of a sexuoerotic tragedy (a "first sighting") involving an object of their future attention, often an older member of the opposite sex, as stereotypical in paraphilic [[etiology]]. About a quarter report discovering the paraphilia in puberty and a few in maturity.

The aforesaid has given grounds for the attraction to disability to be represented as the continuum Bruno (1997) termed factitious disability disorder.&lt;ref name="Bruno 1997"/&gt; At its less-intense devotee end, there is sexualised fascination with the existential aspects of disability and its appearance. In its middle pretending area is strong desire to reproduce the sensations of disability. At its intense wannabe end is an imperative to acquire a disability which may prompt self-harm.

According to DPW fetishists, their attraction does not appear to pose dangers to DPWs' partners or third parties. However, it can be noted that the DSM-IV includes this paraphilia within the diagnostic criteria of psychiatric pathology. Fetishists raise objections to the characterization of their preference as an aberrant pathology. However, objections have also been raised by members of the disabled community on the grounds that such fetishes objectify and dehumanize them. Some people with disabilities willingly participate in the fetish subculture, for example, contributing model photos (e.g., [[Debbie van der Putten]]).

==In relationships==
''The Amelotatist'' found that 55 percent of a sample of 195 DPWs had dated disabled people, 40 percent had been sexually intimate with disabled partners, and 5 percent had current disabled spouses. Nattress (1993) found that 41 percent of a sample of 50 DPWs had, or were in, relationships with disabled partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disableddating4u.co.uk Disabled Dating]&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between DPWs and disabled people tend to be reported as being ordinary, the attraction being sated by the fact of the partner's disability. It appears that the attraction to disability is undisclosed in a proportion of DPW-disabled relationships. DPWs may press disabled partners to put their disabilities to the fore in intimate situations and exhibit them in social ones. Sexually, some DPWs have been reported to engage in active tactile observation as much as in intercourse.

That DPWs find it hard to satisfy both sexual and emotional needs is borne out in findings by both Nattress (1996) and Dixon (1983).&lt;ref name="Dixon 1983"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dixon | first1 = D. | doi = 10.1007/BF01119844 | title = An erotic attraction to amputees | journal = Sexuality and Disability | volume = 6 | pages = 3–6 | year = 1983 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They report that, despite reasonable success in obtaining sexual contact with disabled people, just 21 percent of DPWs had had long-term relationships with disabled partners.

About half of DPWs fail to establish relationships with disabled people. "Second-best" options for them are relationships with pretenders and wannabes. Practically all DPWs have experience of relationships with able-bodied partners. Such relationships are also reported to be ordinary despite the (mostly undisclosed) attraction to disability on the part of one partner.

Although it is not common knowledge within mainstream communities, the internet has revolutionized the process by which DPWs can meet each other while pursuing meaningful relationships. Some of these individuals, however, have expressed a level of concern when it comes to their first face to face encounters. While most of these encounters are completely safe, there are important guidelines to provide a sense of security to either party who may feel vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amputeedating.net/guide/meeting/ Safe Amputee Dating] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628205920/http://www.amputeedating.net/guide/meeting/ |date=June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==
[[Psychology]] views sadism and masochism as interchangeable, with voyeurism and exhibitionism as their respective aspects. Devotees’ observation-based behavior and preference for display-minded partners seem to support explanations 2 to 4. Devotee pornography tends to display the appearance of disability across a range of activities rather than focus on sexual situations.

Recent neuroscientific research suggests that apotemnophilia has a neurological basis.&lt;ref name="Brang et al. 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brang | first1 = D. | last2 = McGeoch | first2 = P.

===Sexological===
Contemporary [[sexology]] does not consider the attraction problematic unless exercising it infringes the rights of one of the parties and/or those of third parties. Explanations include:

#[[Imprinting (psychology)|Imprinting]] or the influence of influential events on behaviour. Encountering visibly disabled people in childhood awakes strong emotions which may give rise to quasi-logical reasoning and a desire for people with the type of trauma encountered. Care received during hospital stays may awaken a wish to become disabled (as a way of ensuring continuous care), later projected onto others. Freud is credited with discovering [[Classical conditioning|conditioning]] ("imprinting" in sexology) in the context of fetishism; {{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
#Implied parental approval: if, on encountering someone disabled, a future DPW’s parents express admiration, the child may conclude that disability inspires regard, later ranking it among sexual preferences. This is among explanations mentioned by Dr [[John Money]] in ''Lovemaps'';
#Flight from pressure: strict parenting and/or onerous peer environments may cause the future devotee to seek respite in sickness and disability. With time, the wish to become disabled is "[[Psychological projection|projected]]" onto others. The analogy with [[Munchausen Syndrome]] (simulating or inducing illness as a route to compassion and benefits) here is reasonably clear in wannabes. In them, projection has failed, leaving them to see themselves as more attractive if disabled. The fact that most DPWs feel the attraction since childhood also backs the above explanations. There are also suggestions that there are more DPWs in America, Europe, and the Far East due to specific parent/peer-driven achievement models there. This is another explanation mentioned in ''Lovemaps'';
#[[Inferiority complex]] causing [[psychological projection|projection]]: DPWs may have been made to feel inferior in childhood and may project their ambitions onto disabled people, who perforce have to overcome many barriers;
#'[[Darwinism]]': DPWs see disabled people as proven in natural selection, having cheated death and overcome adversity;
#The unknown: children experience fascination with and fear of the unknown when encountering a disabled person. As adolescents, they may experience similar emotions when first approaching the opposite sex. This fascination with alienness may become associated with arousal over time through [[classical conditioning]]. Eventually, arousal will be triggered by the emotion;
#"The missing phallus": When exposed to the nude female body, some men are fascinated by the fact that "the penis is missing", and there is an alternative and sexual organ (in fact, one reminiscent of a wound) in its place. This feeling of surprise may become a part of sexual attraction. The sight of a missing limb may evoke a similar feeling. Similar to 6 above, this explanation was proposed by Dr Anne Hooper in 1978;
#[[Attention seeking]] and [[envy]]: Since disabled people tend to draw more than average attention, children observing them may conclude that one has to be disabled to enjoy attention. In puberty, disability would be included in their attractiveness criteria.
#[[Erotic target location error]]: The desire of some male transvestites and transsexuals to assume the appearance of their sexual ideal was transposed by analogy to amputee wannabes by First (2005), who backs his claim with research by himself and others since 2000.&lt;ref name="First 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = First | first1 = M. B. | title = Desire for amputation of a limb: Paraphilia, psychosis, or a new type of identity disorder | doi = 10.1017/S0033291704003320 | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = 919–928 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15997612| pmc = }} {{cite web|url=http://biid-info.org/images/d/d8/Desire-for-amputation-of-a-limb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120050006/http://biid-info.org/images/d/d8/Desire-for-amputation-of-a-limb.pdf |archivedate=2008-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the condition of some wannabes appears not to be primarily sexual (except by association), the explanation defines the attraction to disability as an identity disorder. It is put forward within the narrow context of amputee wannabes, and the author does not address the DPW continuum discussed above. The wannabe community has always defined itself in terms very similar to those First and Lawrence (2006) use, with the indigenous label "transabled" gaining ground by 2005 at the expense of "wannabe."

===By DPWs===
The DPW community constantly debates the origins of the attraction ("the Why?"). ''The Amelotatist'', reporting a poll of 195 devotees was a community contribution and the first synthesis of explanations. A 2005 straw poll in two DPW fora revealed that in childhood many respondents (often first or only children) felt alienated from peers, forming solitary interests in ''inter alia'', transportation, or collecting. This may indicate that [[empathy]] with the disabled, subject to exclusion in most cultures, is among the motivations for the attraction. It may also indicate that admiration is at play in the attraction, inasmuch as the disabled perforce overcome inhibitions similar to those many DPWs face, as hinted above.{{request quotation|date=October 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">'''Author profiling''' is a method of analyzing a given number of texts to try to uncover various characteristics of the [[author]] (e.g. age and gender) based on stylistic- and content-based features.

== Overview ==
&lt;p&gt;
Automatic Authorship Identification (AAI) has existed for almost 120 years. [[Thomas Corwin Mendenhall]] was the first to examine works of [[Francis Bacon]], [[William Shakespeare]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]] aiming to detect quantitative stylistic differences using word length.&lt;ref&gt;Mendenhall, Thomas Corwin. "The characteristic curves of composition." Science (1887): 237-249. &lt;/ref&gt; Since then, things have changed rapidly due to the development of technology.
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
There are three major fields in AAI: authorship attribution, author identification, and author profiling. In the first two, the goal is to recognize the author from a set of authors, while in author profiling, the goal is to find specific characteristics of the author, based on stylistic- or content-based features.&lt;ref&gt;Mikros, George K., and Kostas Perifanos. "Authorship Attribution in Greek Tweets Using Author's Multilevel N-Gram Profiles." 2013 AAAI Spring Symposium Series. 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stamatatos, Efstathios. "A survey of modern authorship attribution methods." Journal of the American Society for information Science and Technology 60.3 (2009): 538-556. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
The author profiling task is a yet unsolved problem, due to its difficulty. It has been studied by many researchers and, while some show great progress and good results, it still has many unexplored areas and room for improvement. Through the organizational efforts of PAN,{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=December 2017}} many teams around the globe try every year to find the characteristics of authors.&lt;ref name="PAN2015"&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 3rd Author Profiling Task at PAN 2015." CLEF. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the 2nd author profiling task at pan 2014." CEUR Workshop Proceedings. Vol. 1180. CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rangel, Francisco, et al. "Overview of the author profiling task at pan 2013." CLEF Conference on Multilingual and Multimodal Information Access Evaluation. CELCT, 2013. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;
Characteristics vary between approaches, but age and gender are usually among them.&lt;ref name="argamon"&gt;Argamon, Shlomo, et al. "Mining the blogosphere: Age, gender and the varieties of selfexpression." First Monday 12.9 (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, Dong-Phuong, et al. "" How old do you think I am?" A study of language and age in Twitter." (2013). &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schler_blog"&gt;Schler, Jonathan, et al. "Effects of Age and Gender on Blogging." AAAI Spring Symposium:Computational Approaches to Analyzing Weblogs. Vol. 6. 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Argamon, Shlomo, et al. "Gender, genre, and writing style in formal written texts." TEXT-THE HAGUE THEN AMSTERDAM THEN BERLIN- 23.3 (2003): 321-346. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koppel, Moshe, Shlomo Argamon, and Anat Rachel Shimoni. "Automatically categorizing written texts by author gender." Literary and Linguistic Computing 17.4 (2002): 401-412. &lt;/ref&gt; Other personality traits have included the [[zodiac]] and the [[Job|occupation]] of the author.&lt;ref name="PAN2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schler_blog" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1633">The "'''Azes era'''" (also known as the Aja/Ajasa era), was named after the [[Indo-Scythian]] king, "King Azes the Great" or [[Azes I]]. As a number of inscriptions are dated in this era it is of great importance in dating the reigns of several kings and events in early [[Indian history]].

Earlier, some scholars believed that the Azes era was same as the [[Vikrama Samvat]] (57 BCE) used in India. However, this was disputed by Robert Bracey following discovery of an inscription of [[Vijayamitra]], which is dated in two eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alf Hiltebeitel |title=Reading the Fifth Veda: Studies on the Mahābhārata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lLfHSOWKB-sC |date=2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-18566-6 |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research by Falk and Bennett (2009) shows that these two were indeed separate eras, and that the Azes era can be dated with a high degree of likelihood to c. 48/47 or 47/46 BCE, depending on whether it began in the spring or the autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Falk and Bennett (2009), pp. 197-215.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6788">The building of '''[[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]]-wood bridges''' is very often used as an [[educational technology]]. It may be accompanied by a larger project involving varying areas of study.

Typically classes which would include a balsa wood bridge cover the subject areas of [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[static equilibrium]], or building trades, although it may be done independently of any of these subjects. Building a balsa wood bridge can be done after completing a section or unit covering a related topic or the process of design and building can be used to guide students to a better understanding of the desired subject area.

[[Image:Balsa Bridge2.JPG|thumb|right|Building balsa wood bridges as a part of a unit on [[statics]], structures, forces, or construction trades is used by teachers to make the learning environment hands-on and to give students a real-world example of material covered in class]]

==Requirements==
Although there is great variety between different balsa wood bridge projects, students are in general trying to build a bridge that can withstand the greatest weight before it fails. Other restrictions are often applied, but these vary widely from one contest to another.
Sample requirements include:
*restricting the maximum [[mass]] of the [[bridge]]
*requiring a minimum [[Span (architecture)|span]]
*requiring a minimum height of the [[roadway]]
*restricting the physical dimensions of the bridge
*restricting the size of individual pieces of [[balsa]] wood
*limiting the amount of glue or balsa wood that can be used
*requiring a driveable roadway that allows passage of a vehicle of specified size
*restricting the way pieces are placed on the bridge (for example no parallel joining pieces)

[[Image:BalsaBridge Break.jpg|thumb|right|A balsa bridge breaks after holding a [[mass]] of  89 pounds (40.4 kg). Note that the [[failure]] of the entire [[bridge]] was a result of the failure of just the [[roadway]].]]

==Testing==
Bridges are usually tested by applying a downward force on the bridge. How and where the [[force]] is applied varies from one contest to the next. There are two common methods of applying the test force to the bridge:
*By hanging a container (such as a [[trash can]]) from the bridge and loading known weights into the container until the bridge breaks.  The tester could also slowly add water or sand to the container until the bridge breaks and then weigh the container, providing a more accurate way to find the breaking force.
*By using a [[machine|mechanical]] or [[pneumatic]] testing device that pushes down on the bridge with increasing force until the bridge breaks. If such a testing device is used it is often equipped with a method of automatically gathering force data, such as a [[pressure sensor]] or [[load cell]] connected to a computer.  This approach is more accurate at measuring bridges that have secondary structure that proves to be stronger than the primary structure.  This method is also less damaging to the bridge, whose structure usually remains intact since the load is automatically relieved at failure.

Of the two, the hanging container method provides by far the greater dramatic effect. Testing with a pneumatic press or ram is often complete in matter of seconds. Exceptionally strong bridges may take up to thirty minutes to test as weight (a combination of steel weights and sand is often used) is added to the suspended container.&lt;ref&gt;[http://balsabridge.com Physics Balsa Bridge Building Contest]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring and Grading==

===Scoring===
There are two chief ways that balsa wood bridge competitions may be scored. One way is simply by measuring how much weight each bridge can support.  The second way is by structural efficiency, often expressed as a strength to weight ratio.  The weight-only method is most effective where competitors are all building from a specified set of materials and are expected to use all the available materials.  The strength-to-weight method is better when competitors are expected to use their materials as efficiently as possible.

===Competitive Grading===
Competitive grading compares how well each bridge does against bridges built by other participants to determine a grade.  The top scoring bridge is assigned a maximum numeric grade (say, 100%) while the lowest scoring bridge that still meets all basic specifications is assigned a minimum grade (say, 70%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/bridge_project/index.html |title=Canyon High School Balsa Bridge Competition |access-date=2008-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070719/http://staff.hartdistrict.org/glyle/projects/bridge_project/index.html |archive-date=2008-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method guarantee that some scores will be high even if the overall quality of bridges is low. Conversely, it also guarantees that some scores will be low, even in situations where all bridges are of high quality.

===Standards-Based Grading===
Standards-based grading sets certain standards that need to be met in order to earn a certain grade. An example of standards-based scoring would be to say that all bridges that hold 50&amp;nbsp;kg earn full credit; bridges that hold 25&amp;nbsp;kg earn half credit, and bridges that hold less than 10&amp;nbsp;kg earn no credit.

This method allows every bridge to potentially earn full credit if the standards are met.  In situations where competition is weak, this method runs the risk of having many competitors receive no credit.

The "bow shock" shown is the shock caused by the sun as it moves through the [[interstellar medium]]; the Earth is too small to be seen on this scale. Note that the intensity of this shock is greatly exaggerated.]] --&gt;

[[bow shock (aerodynamics)|Bow shocks]] form the boundary between a [[magnetosphere]] and an ambient (or at least surrounding) magnetized medium. This occurs when the magnetic field of an astrophysical object interacts with the nearby flowing ambient [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. For example, when the [[solar wind]], flowing with a relative speed of order 400&amp;nbsp;km/s, encounters the magnetic field of Earth, a bow shape boundary forms. For Earth and other magnetized planets, it is the boundary at which the speed of the stellar wind abruptly drops as a result of its approach to the [[magnetopause]]. For stars, this boundary is typically the edge of the [[astrosphere]], where the [[stellar wind]] meets the [[interstellar medium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Sparavigna|first1=A.C.|last2=Marazzato|first2=R.|title=Observing stellar bow shocks|date=10 May 2010|eprint=1005.1527|class=physics.space-ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The defining criterion of a [[shock wave]] is that the bulk velocity of the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] drops from "[[Supersonic speed|supersonic]]" to "subsonic", where [[plasma physics|the speed of sound]] c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is defined by
&lt;math&gt;c_s^2 = \gamma p/ \rho &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]], &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]], and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the plasma.

A common complication in astrophysics is the presence of a magnetic field. For instance, the charged particles making up the [[solar wind]] follow spiral paths along magnetic field lines. The velocity of each particle as it gyrates around a field line can be treated similarly to a thermal velocity in an ordinary gas, and in an ordinary gas, the mean thermal velocity is roughly the speed of sound. At the bow shock, the bulk forward velocity of the wind (which is the component of the velocity parallel to the field lines about which the particles gyrate) drops below the speed at which the particles are gyrating.

==Around the Earth==

The best-studied example of a bow shock is that occurring where the Sun's wind encounters [[Earth]]'s magnetopause, although bow shocks occur around all planets, both unmagnetized, such as 
[[Mars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mazelle|first1=C.|last2=Winterhalter|first2=D.|last3=Sauer|first3=K.|last4=Trotignon|first4=J.G.|last5=et al.|title=Bow Shock and Upstream Phenomena at Mars|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume=111|pages=115|date=2004|url=https://doi.org/10.1023/B:SPAC.0000032717.98679.d0|doi=10.1023/B:SPAC.0000032717.98679.d0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Venus]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martinecz|first1=C.|last2=et al.|title=Location of the bow shock and ion composition boundaries at Venus - initial determinations from Venus express ASPERA-4|journal=Planetary and Space Science|volume=56|pages=780|date=2008|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2007.07.007|doi=10.1016/j.pss.2007.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and magnetized, such as [[Jupiter#Magnetosphere|Jupiter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szego|first1=Karoly|title=Cassini plasma spectrometer measurements of Jovian bow shock structure|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Space Physics|volume=108|pages=1287|date=18 July 2003|url=http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/81775/|bibcode=2003JGRA..108.1287S|doi=10.1029/2002JA009517|access-date=2013-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206004146/http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/81775/#|archive-date=2013-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Saturn#Magnetosphere|Saturn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cassini encounters Saturn's bow shock|date=|year=|url=http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/space-audio/cassini/bow-shock/|newspaper=Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Iowa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth's bow shock is about {{convert|17|km}} thick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals Earth's bow shock is remarkably thin|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=49637|newspaper=[[European Space Agency]]|date=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and located about {{convert|90,000|km}} from the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cluster reveals the reformation of the Earth's bow shock|url=http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=40994|newspaper=European Space Agency|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At comets==

Bow shocks form at [[Comet|comets]] as a result of the interaction between the solar wind and the cometary ionosphere. Far away from the Sun, a comet is an icy boulder without an atmosphere. As it approaches the Sun, the heat of the sunlight causes gas to be released from the cometary nucleus, creating an atmosphere called a [[Coma (cometary)|coma]]. The coma is partially ionized by the sunlight, and when the solar wind passes through this ion coma, the bow shock appears.

The first observations were made in the 1980s and 90s as several spacecraft flew by comets [[21P/Giacobini–Zinner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D. E.|last2=Smith|first2=E.

These observations were all made near [[Perihelion_and_aphelion|perihelion]] when the bow shocks already were fully developed.

The [[Rosetta_(spacecraft)|Rosetta]] spacecraft followed comet [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]] from far out in the solar system, at a heliocentric distance of 3.6 [[Astronomical_unit|AU]], in toward perihelion at 1.24 AU, and back out again. This allowed Rosetta to observe the bow shock as it formed when the outgassing increased during the comet's journey toward the Sun. In this early state of development the shock was called the "infant bow shock".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gunell|first1=H.|last2=Goetz|first2=C.|last3=Simon Wedlund|first3=C.|last4=Lindkvist|first4=J.|last5=Hamrin|first5=M.|last6=Nilsson|first6=H.|last7=LLera|first7=K.|last8=Eriksson|first8=A.|last9=Holmström|first9=M.|title=The infant bow shock: a new frontier at a weak activity comet|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=619|pages=L2|date=2018|url=https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201834225|doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201834225}}&lt;/ref&gt; The infant bow shock is asymmetric and, relative to the distance to the nucleus, wider than fully developed bow shocks.

==Around the Sun==
{{main article|Heliosphere#Bow shock}}

For several decades, the solar wind has been thought to form a bow shock at the edge of the [[heliosphere]], where it collides with the surrounding interstellar medium. Moving away from the Sun, the point where the solar wind flow becomes subsonic is the [[termination shock]], the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is the [[heliopause (astronomy)|heliopause]], and the point where the flow of the interstellar medium becomes subsonic would be the bow shock. This solar bow shock was thought to lie at a distance around 230 AU&lt;ref&gt;http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap020624.html&lt;/ref&gt; from the Sun – more than twice the distance of the termination shock as encountered by the Voyager spacecraft. However, data obtained in 2012 from NASA's [[Interstellar Boundary Explorer]] (IBEX) indicates the lack of any solar bow shock.&lt;ref name=bow&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ibex/news/nobowshock.html NASA - IBEX Reveals a Missing Boundary At the Edge Of the Solar System]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with corroborating results from the [[Voyager program|Voyager spacecraft]], these findings have motivated some theoretical refinements; current thinking is that formation of a bow shock is prevented, at least in the galactic region through which the Sun is passing, by a combination of the strength of the local interstellar magnetic-field and of the relative velocity of the heliosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McComas|first1=D. J.|last2=Alexashov|first2=D.|last3=Bzowski|first3=M.|last4=Fahr|first4=H.|last5=Heerikhuisen|first5=J.|last6=Izmodenov|first6=V.|last7=Lee|first7=M.

==Around other stars==

In 2006, a far infrared bow shock was detected near the [[asymptotic giant branch|AGB star]] [[R Hydrae]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/nph-data_query?bibcode=2006ApJ...648L..39U&amp;db_key=AST&amp;link_type=ABSTRACT&amp;high=45ba3a9f6d12619 Detection of a Far-Infrared Bow Shock Nebula around R Hya: The First MIRIAD Results]&lt;/ref&gt;[[Image:Red Giant Plunging Through Space.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The bow shock around R Hydrae&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/images/2183-sig06-029-Red-Giant-Plunging-Through-Space Spitzer Science Center Press Release: Red Giant Plunging Through Space]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Bow shocks are also a common feature in [[Herbig Haro objects]], in which a much stronger [[collimated light|collimated]] outflow of gas and dust from the star interacts with the interstellar medium, producing bright bow shocks that are visible at optical wavelengths.

The following images show further evidence of bow shock existence from dense gases and plasma in the [[Orion Nebula]].

== Around massive stars ==
If a massive star is a [[Stellar kinematics#Runaway stars|runaway star]], it can form an [[infrared]] bow-shock that is detectable in 24 μm and sometimes in 8μm of the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] or the W3/W4-channels of [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]]. In 2016 Kobulnicky et al. did create the largest spitzer/WISE bow-shock catalog to date with 709 bow-shock candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR-3?-source=J/ApJS/227/18/table1&amp;-out.max=50&amp;-out.form=HTML%20Table&amp;-out.add=_r&amp;-out.add=_RAJ,_DEJ&amp;-sort=_r&amp;-oc.form=sexa|title=VizieR|website=vizier.u-strasbg.fr|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get a larger bow-shock catalog the [[The Milky Way Project]] (a [[Citizen Science]] project) aims to map infrared bow-shocks in the galactic plane. This larger catalog will help to understand the stellar wind of massive stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/povich/milky-way-project/about/research|title=Zooniverse|website=www.zooniverse.org|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epsilon Persei]] does not belong to this [[stellar association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://melinasworldblog.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/close-bowshocks/|title=Close Bowshocks|last=melinasworldblog|date=2017-04-26|website=Melina's World|access-date=2017-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic draping effect==
A similar effect, known as the magnetic draping effect, occurs when a super-Alfvenic plasma flow impacts an unmagnetized object such as what happens when the solar wind reaches the ionosphere of Venus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lyutikov|first1=M.|title=Magnetic draping of merging cores and radio bubbles in clusters of galaxies|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=2006|volume=373|pages=73–78|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10835.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0604178 |bibcode = 2006MNRAS.373...73L }}&lt;/ref&gt; the flow deflects around the object draping the [[magnetic field]] along the wake flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shore|first1=S. N.|last2=LaRosa|first2=T. N.|title=The Galactic Center Isolated Non-thermal Filaments as Analogs of Cometary Plasma Tails|journal=Astrophysical Journal|date=1999|volume=521|issue=2|pages=587–590|arxiv = astro-ph/9904048 |bibcode = 1999ApJ...521..587S |doi = 10.1086/307601 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The condition for the flow to be super-Alfvenic means that the relative velocity between the flow and object, &lt;math&gt; v&lt;/math&gt;, is larger than the local [[Alfven velocity]] &lt;math&gt;V_A&lt;/math&gt; which means a large Alfvenic Mach number: &lt;math&gt; M_A \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;. For unmagnetized and [[electrically conductive]] objects, the ambient field creates [[electric currents]] inside the object, and into the surrounding plasma, such that the flow is deflected and slowed down as the time scale of magnetic [[dissipation]] is much longer than the time scale of magnetic field [[advection]]. The induced currents in turn generate magnetic fields that deflect the flow creating a bow shock. For example, the [[ionosphere]]s of Mars and Venus provide the conductive environments for the interaction with the solar wind. Without an ionosphere, the flowing magnetized plasma is absorbed by the non-conductive body. The latter occurs, for example, when the solar wind interacts with [[Moon]] which has no ionosphere. In magnetic draping, the field lines are wrapped and draped around the leading side of the object creating a narrow sheath which is similar to the bow shocks in the planetary magnetospheres. The concentrated magnetic field increases until the [[ram pressure]] becomes comparable to the [[magnetic pressure]] in the sheath:
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_0 v^2 = \frac{B_0^2}{2\mu_0},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the density of the plasma, &lt;math&gt;B_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the draped magnetic field near the object, and &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; is the relative speed between the plasma and the object. Magnetic draping has been detected around planets, moons, solar coronal mass ejections, and galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pfrommer|first1=Christoph|last2=Dursi|first2=L. Jonathan|title=Detecting the orientation of magnetic fields in galaxy clusters|journal=Nature Physics|date=2010|volume=6|issue=7|pages=520–526|doi=10.1038/NPHYS1657|arxiv = 0911.2476 |bibcode = 2010NatPh...6..520P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''C. N. Yang Institute of Theoretical Physics (YITP)''' is a research center at [[Stony Brook University]]. In 1965, it was the vision of then University President [[John S. Toll|J.S. Toll]] and Physics Department chair T.A. Pond to create an institute for theoretical physics and invite the famous physicist [[Chen Ning Yang]] from [[Institute for Advanced Study]] to serve as its director with the Albert Einstein Professorship of Physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~yang/yangbio.pdf Biography of C.N. Yang]&lt;/ref&gt; While the center is often referred to as "YITP", this can be confusing as YITP also stands for the [[Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in Japan.  

The active research areas of the institute include: [[Quantum Field Theory]], [[String Theory]], [[Mathematical Physics]] and [[Statistical Mechanics]]. The YITP is situated on top of the Math Tower, home to the Department of Mathematics which is connected to the Department of Physics and the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] -- therefore the physicists enjoy intimate interactions with the mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.sunysb.edu/html/rtgrtg.shtml RTG Program in Geometry and Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; This close relationship dates back to the friendship of [[C.N. Yang]] and the mathematician [[James Harris Simons]].

Founded in 1967, YITP celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017. During the time span, the YITP has produced significant results in different areas, most notably was the discovery of [[Supergravity]] in 1976 by [[Peter van Nieuwenhuizen]], [[Daniel Z. Freedman]], and [[Sergio Ferrara]], who were all working there at the time. 

==Directors==

*[[Chen Ning Yang]] - first director (1967-1999) and 1957 Nobel Laureate.
*[[Peter van Nieuwenhuizen]] - second director (1999-2002) and co-discoverer of supergravity.
*[[George Sterman]] - third director (2002-) and noted field theorist

The '''Central Highlands''', '''Central High Plateau''', or '''Hauts-Plateaux''' are a mountainous [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region in central [[Madagascar]]. They include the contiguous part of the island's interior above 800&amp;nbsp;m (2600&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;871&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Highlands are separated from the [[Northern Highlands]] of the northern tip of Madagascar by a low-lying valley, the [[Mandritsara Window]], which has apparently acted as a barrier to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] for species in the highlands, leading to [[species pair]]s such as ''[[Voalavo gymnocaudus]]'' and ''[[Voalavo antsahabensis]]'' in the Northern and Central Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;872&lt;/ref&gt; Species restricted to the Central Highlands include the bats ''[[Miniopterus manavi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Miniopterus sororculus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1216&lt;/ref&gt; the rodents ''[[Brachyuromys betsileoensis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;949&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Voalavo antsahabensis'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;867&lt;/ref&gt; the tenrecs ''[[Hemicentetes nigriceps]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bronner and Jenkins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Oryzorictes tetradactylus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; and the lemur ''[[Cheirogaleus sibreei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the continuous habitat of the Central Highlands, there is little local [[endemism]], unlike the Northern Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
Prescod-Weinstein's research has focused on various topics in [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[theoretical physics]], including the [[axion]] as a [[dark matter]] candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28632-tiny-dark-matter-stars-would-harbour-particles-that-act-as-one/|title=Tiny dark matter stars would harbour particles that act as one|work=New Scientist|first=Anna|last= Nowogrodzki|date= 2015-12-07|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], and [[Classical field theory|classical]] and [[Quantum field theory|quantum fields]] in the [[Chronology of the universe|early universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/videos/meet-scientist-chanda-prescod-weinstein|title=Meet a Scientist - Chanda Prescod-Weinstein {{!}} Perimeter Institute|website=www.perimeterinstitute.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 2004 to 2007 Prescod-Weinstein was a named [[National Science Foundation]] Graduate Research Fellow.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After Prescod-Weinstein's Ph.D., she was a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow in the Observational Cosmology Lab at [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/curriculum-vitae/|title=Curriculum Vitae|website=Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, PhD|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/chanda-prescod-weinstein|title=Chanda Prescod-Weinstein {{!}} Perimeter Institute|website=www.perimeterinstitute.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, she won a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Postdoctoral Fellowship at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where she was jointly appointed to the Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and the Department of Physics.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mlkscholars.mit.edu/cprescod-weinstein/|title=Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, Physics – Martin Luther King Jr. Scholars|website=mlkscholars.mit.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[MIT]], Prescod-Weinstein worked in [[Alan Guth]]'s group in the Centre for Theoretical Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cprescodweinstein.com/how-i-got-here-1/|title=How I Got Here|website=Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, PhD|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, she became the Principal Investigator on a $100,522 [[FQXI]] grant to study “Epistemological Schemata of Astro | Physics: A Reconstruction of Observers” seeking to answer questions regarding how to re-frame who is an "observer", to acknowledge those existing outside of the European Enlightenment framework, and how that might change knowledge production in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fqxi.org/grants/large/awardees/view/__details/2016/prescod-weinstein|title=FQXi - Foundational Questions Institute|website=fqxi.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crash Test Danny''''' was a series of 13 educational science sketch television shows for the [[Discovery Kids]] channel in the UK.

Danny, played by Ben Langley, is a [[crash test dummy]] who goes the extra mile to put the fizz into [[physics]]. He is both motivated and hindered by the Professor, played by [[Gary Carpenter]] (who also co-wrote the program).

The shows were directed by Justin Rhodes, narrated by [[Jon Holmes]], and series produced by Mark Robson at Initial Television.

[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|260px|[[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar the Great]] (r. 1556-1605) holds a religious assembly in the [[Ibadat Khana]] (House of Worship) in [[Fatehpur Sikri]]; the two men dressed in black are the [[Jesuit]] missionaries [[Rodolfo Acquaviva]] and [[Francisco Henriques (missionary)|Francisco Henriques]].  Illustration to the [[Akbarnama]], miniature painting by [[Nar Singh]], ca. 1605]]
The '''''Dabestān-e Mazāheb''''', also transliterated as '''''Dabistān-i Mazāhib''''' ({{lang-fa|دبستان مذاهب}}) "School of Religions", is an examination and comparison of [[South Asia]]n religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work is written in Persian, probably having been composed in about 1655 CE.

The ''Dabistan-e Madahib'' is best known for its chapter on the [[Din-i Ilahi|Dīn-i Ilāhī]], the [[Syncretism|syncretic]] religion propounded by the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar|Jalāl ud-Dīn Muḥammad Akbar]] ("Akbar the Great") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the [[Ibadat Khana|''Ibādat Khāna'']] discussions that led up to this.

This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the ''Asiatic Researches'', xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by [[David Shea (linguist)|David Shea]] and Anthony Troyer under the title, ''The Dabistan or School of Manners'' (1843) in three volumes from London.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, M. Athar (2008). ''Mughal India'', New Delhi: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-569661-1}}, pp.216-28&lt;/ref&gt; 

The critical English-language edition by David Shea and Anthony Troyer in 1843 is slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, suggest a certain Muhsin Fani and propose 1670 as his date of death. They furthermore stated that he was "of the philosophic sect of [[Sufi]]s", but the 1993 edition of the ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'' suggests that the author was most likely a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The present [[Persian language|Persian]] edition of the text by Rezazadeh Malik attributes it to the son and successor of [[Azar Kayvan]], '''Kay Khosrow Esfandiyar'''. The author may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sipásíán) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.

The author describes that he spent time in [[Patna]], [[Kashmir]], [[Lahore]], [[Surat]] and [[Srikakulam]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dīn-i Ilāhī.

According to ''The Jew in the Lotus'' by Rodger Kamenetz, a ''Dabistan'' was commissioned by a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] mystic prince, [[Dara Shikoh]]. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, [[Sarmad Kashani]], and his Hindu disciple from [[Sindh]].&lt;ref&gt;Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Fischel notes: {{Quote|Through the medium of the ''Dabistan'' Sarmad thus became the channel through which Jewish ideas, though with a Sufic blending, penetrated into the religious fabric of the India of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Kamenetz p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;}} An English version of the ''Dabistan'' by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=/data/upload/0010/694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719101952/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/scripts/FullindexDefault.htm?path1=%2Fdata%2Fupload%2F0010%2F694&amp;first=1&amp;last=320&amp;barcode=2990110010689 |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author's perspective==

Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a [[Persian people|Persian]]. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:&lt;ref&gt;DABISTÁN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843.&lt;/ref&gt;

:As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees.

:... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Naráyan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: “The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.” ...

: Rai Manuhar Kuchwáhhah has said:

::“O Moslem! if the Kâbah be the object of thy worship,
::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?”

He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the [[Jainism|Jains]] he writes:

:The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras &lt;ref&gt;Sevada implies a Jain monk of the [[Shvetambara]] order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata.&lt;/ref&gt; and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a Lúnú,&lt;ref&gt;Lunia means someone belonging to the [[Lonka Gachchha]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dotárah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur Márawár, he found also Síva rama, a Pujári, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in Ráwel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings.

:[[Hafez|Hafiz]] Shirázi says:

::“Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest,
::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.”

[[File:Persians (Parsees) in Bombay 1873.jpg|thumb|200px|right|"Parsis of [[Bombay]]" with traditional [[Parsi hat]]s, a wood engraving, ''ca.'' 1878]]
He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret:

:... there are Samradíán, Khodaníán, Radián, Shíderangíán, Pâikeríán, Mílánían, Aláríán, Shídábíán, Akhshían, and [[Mazdak]]ían, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans.

He describes the disputations in [[Akbar]]'s [[Ibadat Khana]] in detail, as if he had been there:

:A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher.The latter opened the discussion in this manner: “The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Pharâoh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings.

:... Now the Christian said: “The Messiah was born without a father.” The doctor replied: “You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?” The Nazarene was reduced to silence.

He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar:

:His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezdánian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5974">In [[biology]], a deme in the strict sense is a group of individuals that belong to the same [[taxonomic group]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt; Gilmour, J. S., &amp; Heslop-Harrison, J. (1955). The deme terminology and the units of micro-evolutionary change. ''Genetica, 27''(1), 147-161.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when biologists, and especially zoologist, use the term ‘deme’ they usually refer to it as the definition of a gamodeme&lt;ref&gt; Winsor, M. P. (2000). Species, Demes, and the Omega Taxonomy: Gilmour and The NewSystematics. ''Biology and Philosophy, 15''(3), 349-388.&lt;/ref&gt;: a local group of individuals (from the same taxon) that interbreed with each other and share a [[gene pool]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The latter definition of a deme is only applicable to [[Sexual reproduction|sexual reproducing]] species, while the former is more neutral and also takes [[Asexual reproduction|asexual reproducing]] species into account, such as certain plant species. In the following sections the latter (and most frequently used) definition of a deme will be used.

In [[evolutionary computation]], a "deme" often refers to any isolated [[subpopulation]] subjected to [[natural selection|selection]] as a unit rather than as individuals.

== Local adaptation ==
A [[population]] of a species usually has multiple demes. Environments between these demes can differ. Demes could, therefore, become [[Local adaptation|locally adapted]] to their environment. A good example of this is the Adaptive Deme Formation (ADF) hypothesis in [[Insect|insects]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt; Zandt, P. A. V., &amp; Mopper, S. (1998). A meta-analysis of adaptive deme formation in phytophagous insect populations. ''The American Naturalist, 152''(4), 595-604.&lt;/ref&gt; The ADF hypothesis states that herbivorous insects can become adapted to specific host plants in their local environment because local plants can have unique nutrient patches to which insects may become adapted. This hypothesis predicts that less mobile insect demes are more likely to become locally adapted than more dispersive insect. However, a [[meta-analysis]], based on 17 studies on this subject, showed that dispersive insect demes were as likely to become locally adapted as less mobile insects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreover, this study found a small indication that feeding [[Behavior|behaviour]] might stimulate the local adaptation of demes. Endophagous insects were more likely to become locally adapted than exophagous insects. The explanation for this could be that endophagous insects come in more close and continuous contact to the plant’s mechanical, chemical and phenological [[Plant defense against herbivory|defensive mechanisms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Speciation and demes ==
[[Speciation]] could occur at the level of demes. When a deme gets geographically isolated from other demes of the same species, [[Gene flow|gene-flow]] between these demes will stop which could lead to speciation after a long time. This is called [[allopatric speciation]] and is generally a slow process.&lt;ref&gt; Carson, H. L. (1987). The genetic system, the deme, and the origin of species. ''Annual review of genetics, 21''(1), 405-423.&lt;/ref&gt;  

On the contrary, [[sympatric speciation]] can be more rapid when a species has multiple small demes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt; Bush, G. L., Case, S. M., Wilson, A. C., &amp; Patton, J. L. (1977). Rapid speciation and chromosomal evolution in mammals. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 74''(9), 3942-3946.&lt;/ref&gt; This rapid speciation is both observed in plants&lt;ref&gt; Levin, D. A., &amp; Wilson, A. C. (1976). Rates of evolution in seed plants: net increase in diversity of chromosome numbers and species numbers through time. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of sciences, 73''(6), 2086-2090.&lt;/ref&gt; and vertebrates&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. Rapid speciation is explained by the [[ecology]] and [[Mating system|social structure]] of demes. Species that behave more territorial, live in patchy environments and/or have a [[Polygyny in animals|polygynous]] breeding system with only one reproductive male tend to have smaller deme sizes. Interbreeding between small demes is rare due to these factors. Furthermore, [[Allele|alleles]] fixate more rapid in smaller demes. Small demes could, therefore, become genetically distinct from each other.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Primate|Primates]], for example, have the second highest speciation rate among mammals, with one speciation event per lineage every 3 million years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, not all primate species have a high speciation rate and this is seen back in there deme size and social structure. Geunons (''[[Guenon|Cercopithecus]]''), for example, live together in small polygynous troops and are a quite diverse [[genus]]. On the other hand, baboons (''[[Baboon|Papio]]'') have a much lower speciation rate. Baboons have larger deme sizes because they live in polygynous multi-male troops. These baboon demes are usually allopatric but gene-flow still exists between demes with [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] being common.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8350">In genetics and cell biology, repression is a mechanism often used to decrease or inhibit the expression of a gene. Removal of repression is called '''derepression'''. This mechanism may occur at different stages in the expression of a gene, with the result of increasing the overall RNA or protein products. Dysregulation of derepression mechanisms can result in altered gene expression patterns, which may lead to negative phenotypic consequences such as disease.

== Derepression of transcription ==
[[Transcription (biology)|Transcription]] can be repressed in a variety of ways, and therefore can be derepressed in different ways as well. A common mechanism is [[allosteric regulation]]. This is when a [[Enzyme substrate|substrate]] binds a [[Repressor|repressor protein]] and causes it to undergo a [[conformational change]]. If the repressor is bound upstream of a gene, such as in an operator sequence, then it would be repressing the gene's expression. This conformational change would take away the repressor’s ability to bind DNA, thus removing its repressive effect on transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Mitchell|date=June 2005|title=The lac repressor|journal=Comptes Rendus Biologies|volume=328|issue=6|pages=521–548|doi=10.1016/j.crvi.2005.04.004|issn=1631-0691|pmid=15950160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of transcriptional derepression uses [[chromatin remodeling]] complexes. For transcription to occur, [[RNA polymerase]] needs to have access to the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] sequence of the gene or it cannot bind the DNA. Sometimes these sequences are wrapped around [[nucleosome]]s or are in condensed [[heterochromatin]] regions, and are therefore inaccessible. Through different chromatin remodeling mechanisms these promoter sequences can become accessible to the RNA polymerase, and transcription becomes derepressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Urnov|first=F. D.|last2=Wolffe|first2=A. P.|date=2001-05-28|title=Chromatin remodeling and transcriptional activation: the cast (in order of appearance)|journal=Oncogene|volume=20|issue=24|pages=2991–3006|doi=10.1038/sj.onc.1204323|issn=0950-9232|pmid=11420714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transcriptional derepression may also occur at the level of [[transcription factor]] activation. Certain families of transcription factors are non-functional on their own because their [[Active site|active domains]] are blocked by another part of the protein.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shingler|first=V.|date=February 1996|title=Signal sensing by sigma 54-dependent regulators: derepression as a control mechanism|journal=Molecular Microbiology|volume=19|issue=3|pages=409–416|issn=0950-382X|pmid=8830233|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2958.1996.388920.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Substrate binding to this second, regulatory domain causes a conformational change in the protein to allows access to the active domain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This lets the transcription factor bind to DNA and serve its function, thus derepressing the transcription factor.

== Derepression of translation ==
Derepression of [[Translation (biology)|translation]] increases protein production without altering the levels of [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] in the cell. [[MicroRNA|miRNA]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are a common mechanism of translation repression, binding to the mRNA through complimentary base pairing to silence them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McManus|first=Michael T.|last2=Petersen|first2=Christian P.|last3=Haines|first3=Brian B.|last4=Chen|first4=Jianzhu|last5=Sharp|first5=Phillip A.|date=June 2002|title=Gene silencing using micro-RNA designed hairpins|journal=RNA|volume=8|issue=6|pages=842–850|issn=1355-8382|pmc=1370301|pmid=12088155|doi=10.1017/s1355838202024032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[RNA-binding protein|RNA binding proteins]] have been shown to target [[untranslated region]]s of the mRNAs and upregulate the translation initiation rates by alleviating the repressive miRNA effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=T|last2=Yap|first2=NL|last3=Roberts|first3=R|last4=Stewart|first4=AF|date=2012|title=Mechanisms of Translational Derepression During Ischemia|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Cardiology|volume=28|issue=|pages=S193-S194|via=|doi=10.1016/j.cjca.2012.07.256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of derepression ==

=== Auxin signalling ===
An example is the [[auxin]] mediated derepression of the auxin response factor family of transcription factors in plants. These auxin response factors are repressed by Aux/IAA repressors. In the presence of auxin, these Aux/AII proteins undergo [[ubiquitin]]ation and are then degraded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rogg|first=L. E.|last2=Bartel|first2=B.|date=November 2001|title=Auxin signaling: derepression through regulated proteolysis|journal=Developmental Cell|volume=1|issue=5|pages=595–604|issn=1534-5807|pmid=11709180|doi=10.1016/s1534-5807(01)00077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delker|first=Carolin|last2=Raschke|first2=Anja|last3=Quint|first3=Marcel|date=April 2008|title=Auxin dynamics: the dazzling complexity of a small molecule's message|journal=Planta|volume=227|issue=5|pages=929–941|doi=10.1007/s00425-008-0710-8|issn=0032-0935|pmid=18299888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This derepresses the auxin response factors so they may carry out their functions in the cell.

== Altered derepression causing diseases ==

=== [[Familial Alzheimer's Disease|Familial Alzheimer’s disease]] ===

[[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] is a [[Neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] disease involving progressive memory loss and other declines in brain function. One common cause of familial Alzheimer’s is mutation in the ''[[PSEN1]]'' gene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gene encodes a protein that cleaves certain intracellular peptides which, once free in the [[cytoplasm]], promote [[CREB-binding protein|CBP]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;degradation. Mutations in ''PSEN1'' decrease its production or ability to cleave proteins. This derepresses the CBP proteins, and allows them to perform their function of upregulating transcription of their target genes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabellini|first=Davide|last2=Green|first2=Michael R.|last3=Tupler|first3=Rossella|date=June 2004|title=When enough is enough: genetic diseases associated with transcriptional derepression|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=14|issue=3|pages=301–307|doi=10.1016/j.gde.2004.04.010|issn=0959-437X|pmid=15172674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Rett syndrome|Rhett syndrome]] ===

Rhett syndrome is a [[neurodevelopmental disorder]] involving deterioration of learned language and motor skills, [[autism]], and seizures starting in infancy. Many cases of Rhett syndrome are associated with mutations in ''[[MECP2]]'', a gene encoding a transcriptional repressor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mutations in this gene decrease the levels of MeCP2 binding to different promoter sequences, resulting in their overall derepression. The increased expression of these MeCP2 regulated genes in [[neuron]]s contribute to the Rhett syndrome phenotype.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabellini|first=Davide|last2=Tupler|first2=Rossella|last3=Green|first3=Michael R.|date=June 2003|title=Transcriptional derepression as a cause of genetic diseases|journal=Current Opinion in Genetics &amp; Development|volume=13|issue=3|pages=239–245|issn=0959-437X|pmid=12787785|doi=10.1016/s0959-437x(03)00050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome|Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] ===

This syndrome is associated with an increased susceptibility of tumors and growth abnormalities in children. A common cause of this syndrome is a mutation in an [[Imprinting (genetics)|imprint control region]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;near the [[Insulin-like growth factor 2|''Igf2'' gene]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This imprint control region is normally bound by an [[Insulator (genetics)|insulator]] on the maternal [[allele]], which represses an [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] from acting on the ''Igf2'' gene. This insulator is absent on the paternal allele and allows it access to the gene. Mutations in this imprint control region inhibit the insulator from binding, which derepresses enhancer activity on the maternal Igf2 gene. This abnormal derepression and increase in gene expression can result in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6341">'''Deterministic global optimization''' is a branch of numerical [[optimization]] which focuses on finding the global solutions of an optimization problem whilst providing theoretical guarantees that the reported solution is indeed the global one, within some predefined tolerance. The term "deterministic global optimization" typically refers to '''complete''' or '''rigorous''' (see below) optimization methods. Rigorous methods converge to the global optimum in finite time. Deterministic global optimization methods are typically used when locating the global solution is a necessity (i.e. when the only naturally occurring state described by a mathematical model is the global minimum of an optimization problem), when it is extremely difficult to find a feasible solution, or simply when the user  desires to locate the best possible solution to a problem.

== Overview ==
Neumaier&lt;ref&gt;Complete Search in Continuous Global Optimization and Constraint Satisfaction, Acta Numerica 2004 (A. Iserles, ed.), Cambridge University Press 2004&lt;/ref&gt; classified global optimization methods in four categories, depending on their degree of rigour with which they approach the optimum, as follows:

* An '''incomplete''' method uses clever intuitive heuristics for searching but has no safeguards if the search gets stuck in a local minimum
* An '''asymptotically complete''' method reaches a global minimum with certainty or at least with probability one if allowed to run indefinitely long, but has no means to know when a global minimizer has been found.
* A '''complete''' method reaches a global minimum with certainty, assuming exact computations and indefinitely long run time, and knows after a finite time that an approximate global minimizer has been found (to within prescribed tolerances).
* A '''rigorous''' method reaches a global minimum with certainty and within given tolerances even in the presence of rounding errors, except in near-degenerate cases, where the tolerances may be exceeded.

Deterministic global optimization methods typically belong to the last two categories. Note that building a rigorous piece of software is extremely difficult as the process requires that all the dependencies are also coded rigorously.

Deterministic global optimization methods require ways to rigorously bound function values over regions of space. One could say that a main difference between deterministic and non-deterministic methods in this context is that the former perform calculations over regions of the solution space, whereas the latter perform calculations on single points. This is either done by exploiting particular functional forms (e.g. McCormick relaxations&lt;ref&gt;Computability of global solutions to factorable nonconvex programs: Part I – Convex underestimating problems, Mathematical Programming, 1976, 1(10), 147–175&lt;/ref&gt;), or using [[interval analysis]] in order to work with more general functional forms. In any case bounding is required, which is why deterministic global optimization methods cannot give a rigorous result when working with [[black-box]] code, unless that code is explicitly written to also return function bounds. For this reason, it is common for problems in deterministic global optimization to be represented using a [[Directed acyclic graph|computational graph]], as it is straightforward to overload all operators such that the resulting function values or derivatives yield interval (rather than scalar) results.

== Classes of deterministic global optimization problems ==
=== [[Linear programming]] problems (LP) ===
Linear programming problems are a highly desirable formulation for any practical problem. The reason is that, with the rise of interior-point algorithms, it is possible to efficiently solve very large problems (involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of variables) to global optimality. Linear programming optimization problems strictly fall under the category of deterministic global optimization.

=== [[Linear programming#Integer unknowns|Mixed-integer linear programming]] problems (MILP) ===
Much like linear programming problems, MILPs are very important when solving decision-making models. Efficient algorithms for solving complex problems of this type are known and are available in the form of solvers such as [[CPLEX]] or [[Gurobi]].

=== [[Non-linear programming]] problems (NLP) ===
Non-linear programming problems are extremely challenging in deterministic global optimization. The order of magnitude that a modern solver can be expected to handle in reasonable time is roughly 100 to a few hundreds of non-linear variables. It should be noted that, at the time of this writing, there exist no parallel solvers for the deterministic solution of NLPs, which accounts for the complexity gap between deterministic LP and NLP programming.

=== Mixed-integer non-linear programming problems (MINLP) ===
Even more challenging than their NLP counterparts, deterministically solving an MINLP problem can be very difficult. Techniques such as [[Cutting-plane method|integer cuts]], or branching a problem on its integer variables (hence creating NLP sub-problems which can in turn be solved deterministically), are commonly used.

== Zero-order methods ==
Zero-order methods consist of methods which make use of zero-order [[interval arithmetic]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, E.R. Global optimization using interval analysis, Marcel Dekker Inc, New York 1992&lt;/ref&gt; A representative example is interval bisection.

== First-order methods ==
First-order methods consist of methods which make use of first-order information, e.g., interval gradients or interval slopes.

== Second-order methods ==
Second-order methods make use of second-order information, usually eigenvalue bounds derived from interval [[Hessian matrices]]. One of the most general second-order methodologies for handling problems of general  type is the [[αΒΒ]] algorithm.

[[Image:Swordfish skeleton.jpg|thumb|200px|Endoskeleton of a [[swordfish]]]]

An '''endoskeleton''' (From Greek ἔνδον, éndon = "within", "inner" + σκελετός, skeletos = "skeleton") is an internal support structure of an [[animal]], composed of [[mineralized tissues|mineralized tissue]].

==Overview==
An endoskeleton is a skeleton that is on the inside of a body. The endoskeleton develops within the skin or in the deeper body tissues. The vertebrate endoskeleton is basically made up of two types of tissues ([[bone]] and [[cartilage]]). During early embryonic development the endoskeleton is composed of [[notochord]] and cartilage. The notochord in most vertebrates is replaced by the vertebral column and cartilage is replaced by bone in most adults. In three [[phylum|phyla]] and one [[Class (biology)|subclass]] of animals, endoskeletons of various complexity are found: [[Chordata]], [[Echinoderm]]ata, [[Porifera]], and [[Coleoidea]]. An endoskeleton may function purely for support (as in the case of [[Porifera|sponges]]), but often serves as an attachment site for muscle and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from [[Germ layer#Mesoderm|mesodermal]] tissue. Such a [[skeleton]] is present in echinoderms and chordates. The poriferan 'skeleton' consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous [[spicule (sponge)|spicule]]s or a [[spongin]] network. The Coleoidae do not have a true endoskeleton in the evolutionary sense; there, a [[mollusk]] [[exoskeleton]] [[evolution|evolved]] into several sorts of internal structure, the "cuttlebone" of [[cuttlefish]] being the best-known version. Yet they do have cartilaginous tissue in their body, even if it is not mineralized, especially in the head, where it forms a primitive cranium.The endoskeleton gives shape, support, and protection to the body and provides a means of locomotion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1782">'''Enterocoely''' (adjective forms: '''enterocoelic''' and '''enterocoelous''') is a process by which some animal [[embryonic development|embryos develop]]. In enterocoely, a [[mesoderm]] (middle layer) is formed in a developing [[embryo]], in which the [[coelom]] forms from pouches "pinched" off of the digestive tract (also known as the embryonic gut, or [[archenteron]]). This type of coelom formation occurs in [[deuterostome]] animals, which for this reason are also known as '''enterocoelomates'''.

Enterocoelous development begins once the embryo reaches the [[gastrula]] phase of development. At this point, there are two layers of cells: the [[ectoderm]] (outermost) and the [[endoderm]] (innermost) layers. The mesoderm begins to form as two "pockets" of tissue (one above the endoderm, and one below) are formed via folding of the endoderm. These "pockets" begin to grow larger, and as they do so, they extend towards each other. When the two "pockets" of cells meet, the mesoderm is formed – a complete layer of tissue right in between the endoderm and ectoderm layers. This then leads to the formation of a coelom.

Enterocoelous development is the stage of embryological development of deuterostomes in which the coelom forms. The stage starts with the gastrula; as the archenteron forms, pockets of migrating cells also form, creating another layer between the endoderm and ectoderm, the mesoderm. These pockets gradually expand to form the coelom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mhhe.com/biosci/pae/glossarye.html PAE Virtual Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[protostome]]s, the body cavity is formed by [[schizocoely]].

'''Epigeal''', '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' and '''epigeous''' are [[biological]] terms describing an [[organism]]'s activity above the [[soil]] surface.

In [[botany]], a [[seed]] is described as showing '''[[epigeal germination]]''' when the [[cotyledon]]s of the [[germinate|germinating]] seed expand, throw off the seed shell and become [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] above the ground. The opposite kind, where the cotyledons remain non-photosynthetic, inside the seed shell, and below ground, is [[hypogeal germination]].

The terms '''epigean''', '''epigeic''' or '''epigeous''' are used for organisms that crawl (epigean), creep like a [[vine]] (epigeal), or grow (epigeous) on the soil surface: they are also used more generally for [[animal]]s that neither burrow nor swim nor fly. The opposite terms are [[hypogean]], [[hypogeic]] and [[hypogeous]].

An epigeal nest is a term used for a termite mound, the above ground nest of a [[Colony (biology)|colony]] of [[termite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Soil Ecology |last=Lavelle |first=P. |last2=Spain |first2=A. |year=2001 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9780792371236 |page=503 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCC1sOmFTSMC&amp;pg=PA503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extragalactic cosmic rays''' are very-high-energy particles that flow into the [[Solar System]] from beyond the [[Milky Way]] galaxy. The energies these particles possess are in excess of 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]].

==Origin==

Unlike [[solar cosmic ray|solar]] or [[galactic cosmic ray]]s, little is known about the origins of extragalactic cosmic rays. This is largely due to a lack of statistics: only about 1&amp;nbsp;extragalactic cosmic ray particle per square meter per year reaches the Earth's surface (see figure).
[[image:M87_jet.jpg|right|thumb|Image of an [[active galactic nucleus]] of the active [[Elliptical galaxy M87|galaxy M87]].]]
There are many ideas about which processes may be responsible for cosmic rays with such high energies. In the 'bottom-up' approach, cosmic rays gain more and more energy through electromagnetic processes. Bouncing randomly back and forth in the [[shock wave]]s of some violent object allows some of the particles to gain energy. Eventually they may build up enough speed that the object can no longer contain them, and they escape. Proposed sites for this type of acceleration include [[gamma ray burst]]s and [[active galactic nuclei]].{{ref|1}} Indeed, recent analysis of cosmic ray measurements with the [[Pierre Auger Observatory]] suggests a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays of the highest energies of more than 5×10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] and the positions of nearby active galaxies.{{ref|2}}

There are many more possible sources scientists are considering. These include colliding galaxy systems, accretion flow shocks to clusters of galaxies, and more exotic processes from the [[timeline of the Big Bang#Very early universe|very early universe]], such as the decay of [[relic particles|superheavy particles]] trapped in the [[galactic halo]], or [[topological defect]]s.{{ref|3}}

==Composition==
Due to the very low flux of extragalactic cosmic particles received on Earth, little is known about their composition. Most estimates, based on theoretical and numerical models, predict that light atomic nuclei such as [[proton]]s are the dominant particle type.{{ref|4}}

'''Decision making''' ('''DM''') can be seen purposeful choice of action sequences. It also covers control, a purposeful choice of input sequences. As a rule, it runs under randomnes, uncertainty and incomplete knowledge. A range of prescriptive theories have been proposed how to make optimal decisions under these conditions. They optimise sequence of decision rules, mappings of the available knowledge on possible actions. This sequence is called strategy or policy. Among various theories, Bayesian DM is broadly accepted axiomatically based theory that solves the design of optimal decision strategy. It describes random, uncertain or incompletely known quantities as random variables, i.e. by their joint probability expressing belief in their possible values. The strategy that minimizes expected loss (or equivalently maximises expected reward) expressing decision-maker's goals is then taken as the optimal strategy. While the probabilistic description of beliefs is uniquely and deductively driven by rules for joint probabilites, the composition and decomposition of the loss function have no such universally applicable formal machinery.

Fully probabilistis design (of decision strategies or control, FPD) removes the mentioned drawback and expresses  also the DM goals of by the ``ideal" [[probability]], which assigns high (small) values to desired (undesired) behaviours of the closed DM loop formed by the influenced world part and by the used strategy. FPD has axiomatic basis and has Bayesian DM as its restricted subpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1 = Miroslav | last1=Kárný | first2=Tomáš | last2=Kroupa | year=2012 | title=Axiomatisation of fully probabilistic design | journal=Information Sciences | volume =186| issue =1 | pages =105–113 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025511004750 | doi=10.1016/j.ins.2011.09.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin (2013-2016)===

GlamSci originally started as a blog for the Royal Society of Chemistry (RSC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/reading-survey-response-amy-king|title=reading experiment survey response - amy king - Edinburgh International Science Festival - Edinburgh International Science Festival|website=Edinburgh International Science Festival|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as 'The Life and Times of a Chemistry Nerd', it documented the experiences of GlamSci Co-Founder Amy King through College and University as a young disabled woman in STEM after being 
"[[Women in STEM fields|repeatedly told "pure science isn’t for girls]]".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unialliance.ac.uk/2018/06/06/amy-king-bsc-hons-natural-sciences/|title=Amy King, BSc (Hons) Natural Sciences {{!}} University Alliance|website=www.unialliance.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-29}}

GlamSci was unofficially founded in 2013, following a number of requests for female speakers, and workshops from the founding members of GlamSci. &lt;/ref&gt; Members have attended "educational events for educators and educational leaders, such as WorldTeachIn, and Athena Swan and Bett events".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; GlamSci founding members worked for 3 years offering speakers for these types of educational events and built up a portfolio of other events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.1851trust.org.uk/1851-trusts-next-generation-roadshow-inspires-girls-science-technology/|title=1851 Trust’s #Next Generation Roadshow inspires girls in Science and Technology - 1851 Trust|date=2017-11-17|work=1851 Trust|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support that turned into official GlamSci Events and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techtalentcharter.co.uk/another-look-techs-diversity-problem/|title=Another look at tech’s diversity problem - Tech Talent Charter|website=techtalentcharter.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Growth (2016-Present)===
On November 2, 2017, the UK Department of Education recognized Amy King of GlamSci for "inspiring young people to work in science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/twitter/educationgovuk?year_from=2012&amp;year_to=2017&amp;amount=30&amp;sort=desc&amp;from=990|title=The National Archives - Department for Education {{!}} Twitter Archive - UK Government Web Archive|last=Archives|first=The National|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heart of Europe Bio-Crystallography Meeting''' (short '''HEC-Meeting''') is an annual [[academic conference]] on [[structural biology]], in particular [[protein crystallography]]. Researchers from universities, other research institutions and industry from [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]] and [[Poland]] meet to present and discuss current topics of their research. The talks are predominantly given by PhD students (doctoral students). An exception is the invited HEC lecture, which is held by a renowned scientist of the research field. The format of the HEC meeting has been adopted from the eleven years older [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology].

== History of the HEC-Meeting ==
The HEC-Meeting dates back to an initiative in the year 1998 of Manfred Weiss and Rolf Hilgenfeld, who were researchers at the Institute for Molecular Biotechnology (IMB) in [[Jena]] and intended to establish a meeting format similar to the [http://regiomeeting.eu/ Rhine-Knee Regional Meeting on Structural Biology] in the [[New states of Germany|New Länder]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariusz Jaskolski und Michal M. Sikorski: ''15 Years of Heart of Europe bio-Crystallography Meetings – Reminiscences.'' Poznan 2013, {{ISBN|978-83-927740-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both conferences are regional meetings of German scientists together with scientific research groups of the neighbouring countries. Nine groups from Germany (the new states and West-Berlin), Poland and Czech Republic participated in the first HEC-Meeting from 8 to 10 October 1998. Later also groups from Austria and the Old Federal States participated.

In human anatomy, the '''hilum''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|ə|m}}; plural '''hila'''), sometimes formerly called a '''hilus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aɪ|l|ə|s}}; plural '''hili'''), is a depression or fissure where structures such as [[blood vessel]]s and [[nerve]]s enter an [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]]. Examples include:
* [[Hilum of kidney]], admits the [[renal artery]], [[renal vein|vein]], [[ureter]], and nerves
* [[Splenic hilum]], on the surface of the [[spleen]], admits the [[splenic artery]], [[splenic vein|vein]], [[lymph vessel]]s, and nerves
* [[Hilum of lung]], a triangular depression where the structures which form the [[root of the lung]] enter and leave the [[viscus]]
* [[Hilum of lymph node]], the portion of a [[lymph node]] where the [[Efferent lymphatic vessel|efferent vessels]] exit
* [[Region IV of hippocampus proper|Hilus of dentate gyrus]], part of [[hippocampus]] that contains the [[Mossy fiber (hippocampus)|mossy cells]].

[[Image:Greek hoplite.png|right|thumb|A Greek hoplite, armed with spear and shield]]
'''Hoplology''' is a science that studies human combative behavior and performance.

==Etymology and history of the term==
The word ''hoplology'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms ''hoplos'' (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ὅπλον ''hóplon'', a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece.  The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.&lt;ref name="hacc1" /&gt;  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F. Draeger]].&lt;ref name="hacc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoplology.com/articles_detail.asp?id=9|title=Hoplology and Combative Culture: Part 1|accessdate=2009-03-07|last=Wiley|first=Mark V.|publisher=The International Hoplology Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of "arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial" (Burton, 1884),&lt;ref&gt;Richard Francis Burton - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MGmbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=History+of+swords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAGoVChMI6e-j2pL8xgIVAu8UCh2lYglG#v=onepage&amp;q=History%20of%20swords&amp;f=false The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of ''Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons''] published by [[Skyhorse Publishing]], Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, {{ISBN|1628738472}} [Retrieved 2015-07-27]&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently as "the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity" (Draeger, 1982).&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"&gt;International Hoplology Society - [http://www.hoplology.com/about.htm home-page] published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Sid Campbell, a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] level, [[tenth dan]]-ranked in [[karate]], defines hoplology as "the study of the evolution and development of human combatitive behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;Sid Campbell - [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZHdRcezT3bwC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgeahUKEwitmv7B2YHHAhVC1hQKHUIMDg8#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i] Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, {{ISBN|1583941606}} [Retrieved 2015-07-30]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The International Hoplology Society==
Founded by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) (1922-1982), the International Hoplology Society ("IHS") exists to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, carries on the hoplological tradition as director of IHS. He is a leading authority on combative behavior and performance. He has trained in numerous Asian and Western martial arts from a young age. He has spent a lifetime studying hoplology and related areas, including functional conditioning for combat. He currently trains military and law enforcement around the world in these areas. He works closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP).

In recent years, with the advent of the [[Modern Army Combatives]] (MAC) Program in the [[US Army]] and the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP), there has been a rapid growth in both scientific and academic research. With [[Matt Larsen]], the father of the MAC program, as a catalyst, research departments are growing at universities across the United States. One of the first such programs was at [[Kansas State University]]; the program is currently defunct.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegian - [http://www.kstatecollegian.com/news/modern-combatives-program-cancelled-due-to-budget-concerns-1.2165227 Modern combatives program cancelled due to budget concerns] published by The Collegian Feb 23, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Hoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accouterments and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.

* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.
*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.
* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human’s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man’s evolution as a group-social animal.

There are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.&lt;ref name="hoplology.com"/&gt;

* human combative behavior is rooted in man’s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. 
* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. 
* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.

A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.&lt;ref name="Meron Langsner"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=hoplology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI7uLa-eaKxwIVSNEUCh0JCAfT#v=onepage&amp;q=hoplology&amp;f=false|author=Meron Langsner|title=Text &amp; Presentation, 2006|publisher=McFarland, 5 Feb 2007, 260 pages, (edited by Stratos E. Constantinidi), {{ISBN|0786455411}}, ''Volume 3 of The Comparative Drama Conference Series''|accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While hoplology is still in its infancy, it has become an accepted area of study by scholars in several related disciplines such as [[combative psychology]], [[killology]], [[anthropology]], and [[military history]].

==The hoplological view on violence==
The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side "…the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy." (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.&lt;ref&gt;Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law''' or '''ITM''' ({{lang-de|'''Institut für Informations-, Telekommunikations- und Medienrecht'''}}) is a research &amp; educational organisation located in [[Münster]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] in [[Germany]]. All major research projects conducted by ITM are ordered by [[European Commission]]. Scientific Council of the Institute is presented by Prof. Dr.Dr. Gunnar Bender, Wilhelm Berneke, [[Jon Bing]], Santiago Cavanillas, [[:de:Herbert Fiedler|Herbert Fiedler]], [[:de:Heinz Lothar Grob|Heinz Lothar Grob]], [[:de:Fritjof Haft|Fritjof Haft]], Bernt Hugenholtz, [[:de:Hans D. Jarass|Hans Jarass]], [[:de:Wolfgang Kilian (Jurist)|Wolfgang Kilian]], [[Miriam Meckel]], [[Ernst J. Mestmaecker|Ernst-Joachim Mestmäcker]], [[:de:Ursula Nelles|Ursula Nelles]] and other prominent scientists.

== Research objective ==
[[File:Institut für Informations-, Telekommunikations- und Medienrecht (emblem).png|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;ITM logo&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Institute for Information, Telecommunication and Media Law (ITM) aims to explore the legal framework conditions of the information society. To learn from the experiences of other countries, comparative law is to be granted a special position. Furthermore the tasks of the institute members content the representation of information, telecommunication and media law in academic teaching and further training. The institute members busy themselves barycentricly with the application possibilities of interactive media in academic teaching and further topics of legal information.

The law of information, telecommunication and media is a cross-section matter which cannot even approximately be covered by any of the traditional legal disciplines – [[Civil law (area)|civil]], [[criminal law|criminal]] and [[public law]]. The ITM therefore strives for interdisciplinary research and teaching activities. For that reason the board of directors of the Institute is supposed to content each a professor for civil law, criminal law and public law. This institute structure is so far without archetype in the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Area of researches ==

=== Information law ===
Information law deals with legal problems arising from [[electronic data processing]] (EDP). Whereas formerly goods and services were in the main focus, today intangible assets like [[know-how]], [[data collection]]s, experience and ideas gain more and more economic importance. "Information Society" is a current term in order to describe our modern world where images, texts and sounds are linked in a digital way. No matter how significant information has become to our society, its legal classification is still open. Most notably in terms of [[Civil law (area)|civil law]], we have great difficulties in determining the person certain data belong to as well as in defining the individual rights involved in that ownership. These issues serve as the basic approach concerning the department’s research activities.

=== Telecommunication law ===
Research is especially required in the following fields: 
* The right of way in terms of para. 50 and 57 TKG (German Telecommunications Act)
* Telecommunications business and [[consumer protection]]
* Competition and [[anti-trust law]]

=== Media law ===
[[Media law]] comprises film and music law, more precisely legal issues of creation and utilisation of films and music. Particular emphasis is put on copyright aspects and legal problems in film and music distribution.

=== Informatics in legal profession ===
This area deals with changes in the legal professions (e.g. judges, lawyers on the private sector and those in public administration) due to the application of electronic data processing.

== Scientific activities ==
[[File:A lecture at the ITM.jpg|thumb|right|320px|&lt;center&gt;A lecture on the legal matters of [[Data protection]]&lt;br&gt;held at the ITM&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Current research projects ===
* '''CONSENT''' (''Consumer sentiment regarding privacy on user generated content services in the digital economy'') is a medium scale research project that is promoted by the Commission of the [[European Union]]. 19 partners from 13 European countries, including interdisciplinary institutes, research centres, universities and [[NGO]]´s, are participating in this project. ''CONSENT'' aims to examine consumer sentiment regarding privacy on [[user generated content]] (''UGC'') services such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]] and [[MySpace]] in the digital economy. This project seeks to examine how consumer behaviour, and commercial practices are changing the role of consent in the processing of personal data and whether the recent changes to consumer and commercial practices lead to consumers (in)voluntarily signing away their fundamental right to privacy. ''CONSENT''´s multidisciplinary team intends to carry out a status quo analysis of commercial practices, legal position and consumer attitudes, identifying criteria for fairness and best practices, and then create a toolkit for policy makers and corporate counsel which will enable them to address problems identified in the analysis. ''CONSENT'' begins in May 2010 and ends in April 2012.
* '''LAPSI''' (''Legal Aspects of Public Sector Information'') is a research project promoted by the [[European Commission]] and deals with the legal problems regarding Public Sector Information. 20 partners from 13 European countries are participating in this project. The main aim is to identify and discuss legal barriers to access and re-use of Public Sector Information in the digital environment and suggest ways to overcome them. Additionally, the ''LAPSI'' project intends to build a network apt to become the main European point of reference for high-level policy discussions and strategic action on all legal issues related to the access to and the re-use of Public Sector Information in the digital environment. The LAPSI project will have a duration of 30 months.
* '''E-Learning'''. The competence-centre for E-Learning is part of the European Research Centre for Information Systems (''ERCIS''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ercis.de/home Official Web-site of the ''ERCIS'' project]&lt;/ref&gt;) of the [[University of Muenster]]. It is funded by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research with a focus on “New Media and Education”. The aim of this project is the development of a technology-driven model for organizing promotion and integration of E-Learning-Projects at universities. The Civil Law Department is in charge of the issue „Legal Aspects of E-Learning“. The ITM turns its attention mainly on problems regarding data protection and copyright in the field of teaching at universities.
* '''History of Information Law'''. The project is sponsored by the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|German Research Foundation]] (''DFG'') and constitutes a scientific attempt to reveal the origin and evolution of the field of law called information law. From the very beginning of the use of electronic data processing by the public administration and the business community many legal problems emerged and had to be solved. The question to be answered is, if information law is just a generic term describing a loose selection of topics dealing with the legal review of problems concerning information, or if there is a common theoretical foundation to constitute a legal discipline of its own. The analysis of this question concentrates on the development of privacy protection, freedom of information, legal informatics and IT-law. Besides the review of significant publications and court decisions it is also part of the project to interview the prominent jurists who worked in the field of information law in the beginning.
* '''Law &amp; ICT Shared Virtual Campus'''. The ITM is a member of the Law&amp;ICT Shared Virtual Campus, a project of the ''LEFIS'' networks. The project aims to offer online based courses to provide the possibility of gaining different degrees. Thereby the head of the Project is Fernando Galindo of the [[University of Zaragoza]].
* '''Matters of Law in the German Research Network (DFN)'''. [[Deutsches Forschungsnetz|The German Research Network]] (''DFN'') supports communication and the exchange of information or data between representatives of science, research, education and culture in national and international networks. In this context, the DFN also operates as an online-provider. With reference to legal questions of liability, telecommunications and data protection, the DFN-members are faced with increasing problems. As recent dispensation on liability of providers and the new German multimedia acts could not resolve the legal uncertainty in this area, practical and efficient assistance is required. Therefore the ITM functions as a legal consultant in terms of information and communication services.
* '''Research Centre for Industrial Property Rights'''. Industrial property rights play a significant role in many sectors of economy. An effective legal protection of inventions and technical advances is an unalterable condition for a working political economy. Someone who has set up in business would quickly lose the advantage of competitors, if industrial property rights did not exist. But also many law graduates are faced with an increasing demand for skills in industrial property rights, though hardly any curriculum covers this branch of law. Since its establishment in 1998, the Research Centre for Industrial Property Rights tries to supply this need by offering additional training besides its research activities on this sector.

=== Completed research projects ===
[[File:File-ITM Library.jpg|thumb|right|200px|&lt;center&gt;ITM Library&lt;/center&gt;]]
* '''ECLIP''' (''Electronic Commerce Legal Issues Platform''). The ITM was coordinating partner of this major research project initiated by the [[European Commission|Commission of the EU]]. In cooperation with four other research institutes in [[Belgium]], [[Great Britain]], [[Norway]] and [[Spain]], questions of law with reference to electronic commerce were investigated from 1998 to 2000. The contribution of the ITM was focussed on legal aspects of copyright and taxation. Besides their extensive cross-border research activities, the ''ECLIP'' partners assisted other EU-projects by giving legal advice on technical or economic matters of electronic commerce. Furthermore ''ECLIP'' aimed at enriching the scientific debate and raising general consciousness concerning legal issues of electronic commerce. For this reason, the project partners organised specific workshops, participated in international conferences and published many works on this topic.
* '''Interactive Media (PISA)'''. This project was founded by the federal state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and aimed at the creation of an interactive teaching system on immovable property law (''PISA'' stands for a practical approach to immovable property law). The students should be enabled to deepen and practice their knowledge by the use of personal computers. Within the scope of these do-it-yourself studies, time, place and speed of the learning process can be appointed by the users themselves. The concept of the programme is based on new findings in educational psychology. Another objective of the project was the development of general standards for a juristic learning software (''EuLe'') which could be used in academic teaching.
* '''MOF-project''' (''Moderated online case study on business economics and private law''). MOF-project aimed at the development of a modular system for the moderation of interactive case studies on the internet. Then the system was applied to case studies in particular disciplines and also on an interdisciplinary level.
* '''ZAP-Project'''. Project dealt with electronic presentation of juristic information. As a main target even jurists who have only limited knowledge of EDP should be enabled to find the relevant information without greater difficulties. New technologies like the internet and the possibilities of electronic commerce were in the foreground of the project.
* '''IPR-HD'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipr-helpdesk.org/ IPR-Helpdesk]&lt;/ref&gt; (''The IPR-Helpdesk'') is a European network consisting of several research institutes, law firms and consultancies. The project is promoted by the Commission of the EU and aims at supporting the use and commercialization of intellectual property rights by SMEs (small and medium-sized entities) and research institutes, particularly on a European level. The work includes, for example, assistance in finding advisory boards for registration, protection and utilization of copyrights, patents and trademarks. The ''IPR-HD'' operates with various instruments like websites, newsletters, [[CD-ROM]]s, a helpline, seminars and workshops. The project is headed by the [[Universidad de Alicante]] ([[Spain]]) and the ''Global Europe Consulting Group'' ([[Brussels]]). The ITM serves as a content provider for the German speaking area. Further partners in the field of science are the ''Centre de Recherches Informatiques et Droit'' in [[Namur (city)|Namur]] ([[Belgium]]), the ''Institute of Commercial Protection of Law'' at the [[Universidad de Alicante]] and the ''[[Centre for Commercial Law Studies]]'' in [[London]] ([[Great Britain]]).
* '''RESPECT'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.respectproject.org/main/index.php Official Website of the ''RESPECT'' project]&lt;/ref&gt; is another project initiated by the Commission of the EU. Within the scope of the [[Information Society Technologies]] (IST) programme, ''RESPECT'' is an interdisciplinary cooperation of several institutes in [[Great Britain]], [[Belgium]], [[Hungary]], [[Austria]] and [[Germany]]. The project aims at drawing up a set of professional and ethical rules for socio-economic research within the EU. As the German partner, the ITM is developing guidelines for the use of intellectual property in compliance with copyright provisions of the Member States. For this, great emphasis is put on recent EU copyright directives and changes in national laws.

== The genre of invective ==
The "genre of invective" or "invective (genre)" or "''vituperatio''" in Latin is a form of classical libel used in [[Greek literature|Greek]] and [[Latin literature|Roman]] polemical verse as well as in prose, but its primary context is rhetoric.

The rhetorical genre of ''vituperatio'' belongs to the ''genus demonstrativum'', which is composed by the praise and blame.

During the Roman Republic, personal invectives and character assassination were widely used during the forensic speeches as well as orations. Cicero made a large use of the invectives against his political foes such as Clodius, Catilina (Catilinarian speeches) or Mark Antony (Philippics). The commonly charges are avarice, cupidity, cowardice, effeminacy, drunkenness, low writing and speaking skills, luxury, disapproved sexual habits, tyrannical behaviour, etc.

Between 44 BC and 30 BC, the invective became a tool during the propaganda war between Octavian and Mark Antony&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Le conflit propagandiste entre Octavien et Marc Antoine. De l'usage politique de la uituperatio entre 44 et 30 a. C. n.|last=Borgies|first=Loïc|publisher=Latomus|year=2016|isbn=978-90-429-3459-7|location=Brussels|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among many other slanders, Mark Antony was accused to have married a foreign queen Cleopatra, to be the submissive subject of her and to have lose his Roman identity. According to this propaganda, Cleopatra would plan to invade Italia. This propaganda before the battle of Actium in 31 BC permits to Octavian to present his campaign as a legitimate war for the safe of the Roman Republic.

The preferred literary term for invective of the [[Renaissance]] is [[Libel (poetry)|libel]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6788">'''Jeremy Paul Axford Commons''' (born 17 December 1933)&lt;ref name="MCreg"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900-1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[New Zealand]] [[opera]] historian, scholar, [[impresario]] and [[librettist]]. He is an authority on nineteenth-century Italian opera and has published major works on the composers [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Nicola Vaccai|Nicola Vaccaj]].

== Academic career ==

Commons was born in [[Auckland]] in 1933. After graduating MA in English from [[Auckland University]] and [[Merton College, Oxford]],&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; he spent a year in [[Italy]] as an Italian Government scholarship-holder studying early nineteenth century opera.

He returned to New Zealand in 1959 and worked for the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (New Zealand)|Department of External Affairs]] as a junior [[diplomat]], with postings at New Zealand's [[Embassy]] in [[Paris]]&lt;ref name=MCreg /&gt; and the [[High Commission of New Zealand in London|High Commission in London]].

He joined the English Department at [[Victoria University Wellington]] in 1967 as a [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] and taught English literature, specialising in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan]] period. Since retiring in 1989, he has devoted his attention full-time to opera-related projects.

In 2006, he was awarded an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctorate]] of Literature from Victoria University for his revival of, and research into, nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Research and publications ==

He has spent many years in Italian libraries and archives, uncovering not only neglected opera composers and their scores, but also collections of their letters and papers, contemporary accounts and reviews, thus building up an invaluable picture of their lives and productions.

Among other forgotten works he has been instrumental in rediscovering, he has edited in collaboration with the Milanese conductor Daniele Ferrari the opera ''Il convitato di pietra'' (1832), a version of the [[Don Giovanni]] story written by the Italian composer [[Giovanni Pacini]]. The work was given its first modern-day performance at the 2008 [[Rossini in Wildbad]] Festival. The work has been recorded by [[Naxos Records]].

His first major scholarly work was the 1,652 page volume ''The First Performances of the Operas of Donizetti'', produced in collaboration with Annalisa Bini and published in Italian in 1997. On his own he subsequently published in 2008 a collection of more than 2000 letters he has transcribed and edited that were written by or to the composer Nicola Vaccaj, a contemporary of [[Rossini]] and Donizetti, whose singing exercises are used by singers to this day.

At various times during his career, he has been commissioned to write essays, introductions and notes by opera companies in various parts of the world including [[Opera Australia]], San Francisco and [[English National Opera]]. He has worked with leading exponents of Italian opera such as [[Dame Joan Sutherland]] and conductor [[Richard Bonynge]] on articles to accompany their recordings for [[Decca Records]]. Since 1975, he has been a researcher and writer for the London-based company [[Opera Rara]], which has issued award-winning recordings of neglected nineteenth-century Italian operas.

== Opera productions ==

As a producer, Commons has focused on small-scale salon operas, suitable for performance by small groups operating on limited budgets.

He collaborated with the [[Waikato]] Opera Group (later Opera Waikato) in presenting operas by [[Giuseppe Balducci]], whose works he had found in the library of the [[Naples]] [[Conservatorium]]. These included ''I gelosi'' (1993), ''Il noce di Benevento'' (1995) and ''Scherzo'' (1996). He also collaborated with [[Dunedin|Dunedin’s]] Marama Opera  on a production of [[Chabrier|Chabrier’s]] ''[[Une éducation manquée|Une Education manquée]]'' (1996).

In 1995, he branched out on his own with a production of [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]]'s ''La Laitière de Trianon''. Three other Weckerlin salon operas followed: ''Entre deux Feux!'' (1997) ''Le Mariage en poste'' (1999) and ''Carmontel'' (2001), as well as [[Gustave Nadaud]]'s ''Le Docteur Vieuxtemps'' (1998).

In 2002 he established the Sirius Opera label. It ceased operations in 2006.

== Libretti ==

From 1997, he has written libretti for small-scale works in collaboration with several New Zealand composers.

With [[Dorothy Quita Buchanan]] he wrote ''The Mansfield Stories'' (''The Woman at the Store'', ''Miss Brill'' and ''The Daughters of the Late Colonel''). He mounted the first of these in 1998. Orchestrated versions of all three were presented in 1999. He also collaborated with Buchanan on ''It Began with a Pony'' (2003).

With [[John Drummond (musicologist)|John Drummond]] he has produced six operas: ''Mr Polly at the Potwell Inn'' (2000), ''A Beleaguered City'' (2002), ''Marriage à la Mode'' (2004), ''Impersonating Maurice'' (2005), ''Mrs Windermere'' (2006) and ''The Genteel Pigeons'' (2006).

He was the co-librettist with [[Ivan Bootham]] for ''The Death of Venus'' (2002).

He also adapted [[Ian Cross]]'s novel ''[[The God Boy]]'' as a libretto for composer [[Anthony Ritchie]]. The resulting opera was premiered by the [[Dunedin]] Opera Company (Opera Otago) at the 2004 Otago Festival of the Arts, and was subsequently given at the 2006 [[Canterbury University]] Platform Arts Festival.

== Other activities ==

He was president of the New Zealand Opera Society from 1981-1988, and from 1985–1989 he also edited its magazine ''Opera News''. He remains the society's Patron.

He lives in [[Wellington]].

'''Joint Forest Management''' often abbreviated as '''JFM''' is the official and popular term in [[India]] for partnerships in [[forest]] [[Social movement|movement]] involving both the state forest departments and local communities. The policies and objectives of Joint Forest Movement are detailed in the Indian comprehensive National Forest Policy of 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moef.nic.in/downloads/about-the-ministry/introduction-nfp.pdf|title=National Forest Policy, 1988|last=|first=|date=|website=Ministry of Environment, Forests and climate change|access-date=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.manage.gov.in/managelib/extdig/Untitled-1.pdf#search=%22%22joint%20forest%20management%22%22&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joint Forest Management Guidelines of 1990 of the [[Government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.uni-freiburg.de/iffn/country/in/in_6.htm Lessons from Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although schemes vary from state to state and are known by different names in different [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], usually a village committee known as the Forest Protection Committee (FPC) and the Forest Department enter into a JFM agreement. Villagers agree to assist in the safeguarding of forest resources through protection from fire, grazing, and illegal harvesting in exchange for which they receive [[non-timber forest product]]s and a share of the revenue from the sale of [[timber]] products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html Study on Joint Forest Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111095120/http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/forprt/terijfm.html |date=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Joint Forest Management originated in [[West Bengal]] in 1980's in Asia and Africa  . The major hardwood of Arabari is [[Sal tree|sal]], a commercially profitable forest crop. Ajit Kumar Banerjee, a [[Silviculture|silviculturalist]], working for the Forest Department as the Divisional Forest Officer, was conducting trials which were constantly being disturbed by grazing and illegal harvesting by the local populace. At the time there were no initiatives for sharing of forest resources between the government and the locals, with the government considering many of the locals no more than "thieves".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldbank.org/wbi/sourcebook/sb0207.pdf#search=%22arabari%20banerjee%22&lt;/ref&gt; The forest official, against the suggestions of his co-workers, sought out representatives of eleven local villages and negotiated the terms of a contract with an ''ad hoc'' Forest Protection Committee. The initial program involved 612 families managing 12.7 square kilometres of forests classified as "degraded". 25% of profits from the forests were shared with the villagers. The experiment was successful and was expanded to other parts of the state in 1987. JFM is still in force at Arabari.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

A few years later, Joint Forest Management was employed in the state of [[Haryana]] to prevent [[soil erosion]] and [[deforestation]]. In 1977, villagers were persuaded that instead of grazing on erosion-prone hills, building small dams would help agricultural output on areas currently under cultivation. The program led to reforestation of many hills in the state.However,officially the state of Odisha remains the first to pass the first resolution for JFM&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/1998/98sep27/haryana.htm#3 tribuneindia... Haryana&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status==
After the initial successes in West Bengal and Haryana, the JFM schemes received national importance in the legislation of 1988 and thrust in the Guidelines of 1998. As of 2000 27 states of the Indian Union had various JFM schemes with over 63,000 FPCs involved in the joint management of over 140,000&amp;nbsp;km² of forested land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rupfor.org/jfm.asp Resource Unit for Participatory Forestry (RUPFOR) - Joint Forest Management]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book derived from his doctoral thesis, ''Numen, Old Men: Contemporary Masculine Spiritualities and the Problem of Patriarchy'' (Equinox Publishers, 2009) proposed that masculine spirituality tends to perpetuate a patriarchal spirituality, and that gay spirituality and queer theory can be a useful way to think about masculinities for all men, gay or straight. He has published extensively on how masculinity functions in contemporary society and, more specifically,  in contemporary religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="183734">This '''list of traditional territories of the original peoples of North America''' gives an overview of the names of the indigenous "countries" of North America. In this sense, "country" refers to the name of the ''land''...the ''ground''...the ''territory'' of a nation, rather than the name of the nation ("tribe") itself.  This article is only about the name for the ''land'' of a nation.

For example, the traditional territory (country/land) of the Ho-Chunk (Winnebago) Nation is called ''Waaziija'', meaning "the Grand Pinery". In English, the land of an indigenous nation was historically, and sometimes still is, referred to as a "country", such as "(the) Winnebago country". Some Latinate forms exist in English such as "Iroquoia", "Huronia", and "Apacheria".

The distinction between nation and land is like the French people versus the land of ''France'', the Māori people versus ''Aotearoa'', or the Saami people versus ''[[Sápmi]]'' (Saamiland).

Ideally such Wikipedia articles would include a composite map which showed how each indigenous national territory is portrayed in all of these:
*key maps from scholars, such as the national boundaries from the ''Handbook of North American Indians'', Alfred Kroeber's culture area maps, and Sturtevant's 1967 "Early Indian Tribes, Culture Areas, &amp; Linguistic Stocks" map.
*key maps from general sources, such as the tribal boundaries from National Geographic's ''Indians of North America'' map from 1972.
*a map of all treaty lands which that nation is a party, as documented in the Royce land cession maps and the Canadian numbered treaties.
*the map(s) submitted by each U.S. Indian Nation during the Indian Claims Commission.
*the final ICC "judicially established" map.
*the NAGPRA "area of interest" map from each U.S. Indian Nation.
*a map showing the location of all former reservation lands.
*a map of current reservation and trust lands.
*the location of national sites and diasporic populations situated outside of those lands—for example, outlying historic villages (such as the [[Bulltown, West Virginia|Bulltown]] Lenape village in what's now West Virginia, which was never a part of Lenape treaty lands) and modern "satellite" communities (for example, the "at-large" Community Groups of the Cherokee Nation).
*a map of the State Designated Tribal Statistical Area (SDTSA) for state-recognized Indian Nations.
*and most importantly, "tribally-interpreted", "indigenous-approved" maps, such as the traditional territory maps from the ongoing British Columbia Treaty Process, and depictions of legendary boundaries from oral history.&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1) an identity which encompasses six ethno-linguistic communities: the [[Dehcho First Nations|Dehcho (South Slavey) Nation]], [[Chipewyan people|Dënesųłiné (Chipewyan) Nation]], [[Gwich'in|Dinjii Zhuu (Gwich'in) Nation]], [[Sahtu|Sahtúot’ine (North Slavey) Nation]], [[Yellowknives|T'atsaot'ine (Yellowknives) Nation]], and [[Tli Cho|Tłı̨chǫ (Dogrib) Nation]]. These six historic nations—or at least those portions dwelling in the Northwest Territories—prefer to be called the ''Dene Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denenation.com/dene_declaration.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906023851/http://www.denenation.com/dene_declaration.html |date=September 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2) In a wider sense, the name ''[[Dene]]'' encompasses all of the [[Northern Athabaskan]] peoples of Canada and Alaska.
{{extent}}The name "Denendeh", though now confined to the NWT, could conceivably be employed as a supra-national name for all the Northern Athabaskan traditional territories as a whole, in a similar way that "Anishinaabewaki" transcends modern political boundaries.

There is also [[NunatuKavut]] ("Our Ancient Land"), the traditional territory of the [[NunatuKavut people|NunatuKavummuit]] (Inuit-Metis) of southern Labrador.

The existing Inuit-affiliated political divisions and regional corporations only partially reflect the traditional cultural and linguistic diversity of the Inuitic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[[Inuit languages#Geographic distribution and variants]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the boundaries of the Danish political entity ''[[Kalaallit Nunaat]]'' are bigger than the traditional territory of the [[Kalaallit]] proper (West Greenland Inuit).

{{extent}}The national name ''Nēhiyaw'' is from the Plains Cree, but serves as a pan-Cree name (see for example the [[Cree|Cree Wikipedia article]]). So ''Nēhiýānāhk'' serves as a default name for Cree country as a whole, in a similar way that ''Anishinaabewaki'' is based on an Ojibwe spelling, but serves as common name for the entire supra-national Aninishinaabe traditional territory. The traditional territory of the East Crees is called [[Eeyou Istchee (territory)|''Eeyou Istchee'']] and ''Iynu Asci'' ("Land of the People"). ''Eeyou'' or ''Iyyu'' is the spelling in northern East Cree, while ''Iynu'' in southern East Cree. The traditional territory of the Plains Cree in particular is ''Paskwāwiýinīnāhk'' ("In the Land of the Plains Cree").&lt;ref name="Arok Wolvengrey 2001"/&gt;

==Criteria for inclusion==
For the purpose of this list, "nation" refers to the historic, whole national identities, rather than to the fragmented "reservation nations" or "bands". The whole nations are what John Beaucage, Grand Council Chief of the Anishinabek Nation, refers to as "true nations" in contrast with the fragmented "First Nations":

{{quote box|quote = “First Nations must work towards the restoration of our own model of nationhood made up of our '''true nations'''. In essence, moving away from '''633''' '''First Nations'''—from Aamjiwnaang to Zhiibhaasing—to governance based on the nearly '''60''' '''indigenous nations''', from the Abenaki Nation to the Wendat Nation and all those in between.”|source = —John Beaucage, “A Vision of a New Assembly of First Nations” (emphasis added), 2009&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.straight.com/news/john-beaucage-vision-new-assembly-first-nations John Beaucage: A vision of a new Assembly of First Nations]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720160156/http://www.straight.com/news/john-beaucage-vision-new-assembly-first-nations |date=July 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Or what the Government of Quebec calls "the 11 aboriginal nations of Québec" in contrast with their component "55 aboriginal communities".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autochtones.gouv.qc.ca/relations_autochtones/profils_nations/profil_en.htm Profile of the Nations]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726032728/http://www.autochtones.gouv.qc.ca/relations_autochtones/profils_nations/profil_en.htm |date=July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
And so the criteria for inclusion is not the same as what are named "Indian tribes" by the U.S. Federal Register and the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), or what are called "First Nations" by the Canadian government and Assembly of First Nations (AFN). It would be interesting to compile the names for the "band territories" of the 633 fragmented First Nations of the AFN, or the names of the "reservation territories" of the 632 fragmented Indian Nations of the NCAI, but that is beyond the scope of this article, except as side notes in the "further information" column.

So this list does not include the names for reservations or reserves, but only of the entire national homeland (or the homeland of a confederated identity such as the Haudenosaunee Confederacy or Colville tribes). For example, this list wouldn't give the Cherokee name for the Qualla Boundary reservation, but only the name for "the Cherokee country" as a whole. Ideally a single name could conceivably encompass not only the Contact-era ancestral territory, but also any area which at some time or another was conceived to be part of the national domain, such as post-Removal lands.

The names do not have to be from olden days. The names could be recently coined and still be included in this list.

Compiling a list such as this can be a difficult and controversial process, as it requires some discernment as to what are the "whole nations" — the "true nations" in Beaucage's words.

A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information|publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mental representation is the mental imagery of things that are not actually present to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mckellar|first1=Peter|title=Imagination and thinking: A psychological analysis|date=1957|publisher=Oxford, England|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1958-00258-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], specifically in fields of [[metaphysics]] such as [[philosophy of mind]] and [[ontology]], a mental representation is one of the prevailing ways of [[explanation|explaining]] and [[description|describing]] the nature of [[idea]]s and [[concept]]s.

Mental representations (or mental imagery) enable representing things that have never been experienced as well as things that do not exist.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert J. Sternberg|url = https://books.google.com/?id=la6mSK9vyIgC|title = Cognitive Psychology|year = 2009|isbn = 9780495506294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Think of yourself traveling to a place you have never visited before, or having a third arm. These things have either never happened or are impossible and do not exist, yet our brain and mental imagery allows us to imagine them. Although visual imagery is more likely to be recalled, mental imagery may involve representations in any of the sensory modalities, such as hearing, smell, or taste. [[Stephen Kosslyn]] proposes that images are used to help solve certain types of problems. We are able to visualize the objects in question and mentally represent the images to solve it.&lt;ref name="sternberg2009" /&gt;

Mental representations also allow people to experience things right in front of them—though the process of how the brain interprets the [[Mental content|representational content]] is debated.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

== Representational theories of mind ==

[[Representationalism]] (also known as [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) is the view that representations are the main way we access external reality. Another major prevailing [[philosophical theory]] posits that concepts are entirely [[abstract object]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Ontology of Concepts—Abstract Objects or Mental Representations?|url=http://philosophy.dept.shef.ac.uk/papers/OntologyofConcepts.pdf|format=PDF|last1=Margolis|first1=Eric|last2=Laurence|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen Laurence|journal=Noûs|volume=41|issue=4|date=December 2007|pages=561–593|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0068.2007.00663.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The representational theory of mind attempts to [[explanation|explain]] the nature of [[idea]]s, [[concept]]s and other [[mental content]] in [[contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive science]] and [[experimental psychology]]. In contrast to theories of naive or [[direct realism]], the representational theory of mind postulates the actual existence of mental representations which act as intermediaries between the [[observation|observing]] subject and the [[object (philosophy)|objects]], processes or other entities observed in the external world. These intermediaries stand for or represent to the mind the objects of that world.

For example, when someone arrives at the belief that his or her floor needs sweeping, the representational theory of mind states that he or she forms a mental representation that represents the floor and its state of cleanliness.

The original or "classical" representational theory probably can be traced back to [[Thomas Hobbes]] and was a dominant theme in classical [[empiricism]] in general. According to this version of the theory, the mental representations were images (often called "ideas") of the objects or states of affairs represented. For modern adherents, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and many others, the representational system consists rather of an internal [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] (i.e., mentalese). The contents of thoughts are represented in symbolic structures (the formulas of Mentalese) which, analogously to natural languages but on a much more abstract level, possess a [[syntax]] and [[semantics]] very much like those of natural languages. For the Spanish logician and cognitive scientist Luis M. Augusto, at this abstract, formal level, the syntax of thought is the set of symbol rules (i.e., operations, processes, etc. on and with symbol structures) and the semantics of thought is the set of symbol structures (concepts and propositions). Content (i.e., thought) emerges from the meaningful co-occurrence of both sets of symbols. For instance, "8 x 9" is a meaningful co-occurrence, whereas "CAT x §" is not; "x" is a symbol rule called for by symbol structures such as "8" and "9", but not by "CAT" and "§".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Unconscious representations 2: Towards an integrated cognitive architecture.|last = Augusto|first = Luis M.|date = 2014|journal = Axiomathes |volume=24|pages=19–43|doi = 10.1007/s10516-012-9207-y|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strong vs weak, restricted vs unrestricted ===
There are two types of representationalism, strong and weak. Strong representationalism attempts to reduce phenomenal character to intentional content. On the other hand, weak representationalism claims only that phenomenal character supervenes on intentional content. Strong representationalism aims to provide a theory about the nature of phenomenal character, and offers a solution to the hard problem of consciousness. In contrast to this, weak representationalism does not aim to provide a theory of consciousness, nor does it offer a solution to the hard problem of consciousness.

Strong representationalism can be further broken down into restricted and unrestricted versions. The restricted version deals only with certain kinds of phenomenal states e.g. visual perception. Most representationalists endorse an unrestricted version of representationalism. According to the unrestricted version, for any state with phenomenal character that state’s phenomenal character reduces to its intentional content. Only this unrestricted version of representationalism is able to provide a general theory about the nature of phenomenal character, as well as offer a potential solution to the hard problem of consciousness. The successful reduction of the phenomenal character of a state to its intentional content would provide a solution to the hard problem of consciousness once a physicalist account of intentionality is worked out.

=== Problems for the unrestricted version ===
When arguing against the unrestricted version of representationalism people will often bring up phenomenal mental states that appear to lack intentional content. The unrestricted version seeks to account for all phenomenal states. Thus, for it to be true, all states with phenomenal character must have intentional content to which that character is reduced. Phenomenal states without intentional content therefore serve as a counterexample to the unrestricted version. If the state has no intentional content its phenomenal character will not be reducible to that state’s intentional content, for it has none to begin with.

A common example of this kind of state are moods. Moods are states with phenomenal character that are generally thought to not be directed at anything in particular. Moods are thought to lack directedness, unlike emotions, which are typically thought to be directed at particular things e.g. you are mad ''at'' your sibling, you are afraid ''of'' a dangerous animal. People conclude that because moods are undirected they are also nonintentional i.e. they lack intentionality or aboutness. Because they are not directed at anything they are not about anything. Because they lack intentionality they will lack any intentional content. Lacking intentional content their phenomenal character will not be reducible to intentional content, refuting the representational doctrine.

Though emotions are typically considered as having directedness and intentionality this idea has also been called into question. One might point to emotions a person all of a sudden experiences that do not appear to be directed at or about anything in particular. Emotions elicited by listening to music are another potential example of undirected, nonintentional emotions. Emotions aroused in this way do not seem to necessarily be about anything, including the music that arouses them.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kind|first = Amy|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses&lt;!--'Directedness' redirects here--&gt; ===
In response to this objection a proponent of representationalism might reject the undirected nonintentionality of moods, and attempt to identify some intentional content they might plausibly be thought to possess. The proponent of representationalism might also reject the narrow conception of intentionality as being directed at a particular thing, arguing instead for a broader kind of intentionality.

There are three alternative kinds of '''directedness'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;/[[intentionality]] one might posit for moods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Outward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content.
* Inward directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
* Hybrid directedness: What it is like to be in mood M is to have both a certain kind of outwardly focused representational content and a certain kind of inwardly focused representational content.
In the case of outward directedness moods might be directed at either the world as a whole, a changing series of objects in the world, or unbound emotion properties projected by people onto things in the world. In the case of inward directedness moods are directed at the overall state of a person’s body. In the case of hybrid directedness moods are directed at some combination of inward and outward things.

=== Further objections ===
Even if one can identify some possible intentional content for moods we might still question whether that content is able to sufficiently capture the phenomenal character of the mood states they are a part of. Amy Kind contends that in the case of all the previously mentioned kinds of directedness (outward, inward, and hybrid) the intentional content supplied to the mood state is not capable of sufficiently capturing the phenomenal aspects of the mood states.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the case of inward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood does not seem tied to the state of one’s body, and even if one’s mood is reflected by the overall state of one’s body that person will not necessarily be aware of it, demonstrating the insufficiency of the intentional content to adequately capture the phenomenal aspects of the mood. In the case of outward directedness, the phenomenology of the mood and its intentional content do not seem to share the corresponding relation they should given that the phenomenal character is supposed to reduce to the intentional content. Hybrid directedness, if it can even get off the ground, faces the same objection.

== Philosophers ==
There is a wide debate on what kinds of representations exist. There are several philosophers who bring about different aspects of the debate. Such philosophers include Alex Morgan, Gualtiero Piccinini, and Uriah Kriegel—though this is not an exhaustive list.

=== Alex Morgan ===

There are "job description" representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; That is representations that (1) represent something—have [[intentionality]], (2) have a special relation—the represented object does not need to exist, and (3) content plays a causal role in what gets represented:  e.g. saying "hello" to a friend, giving a glare to an enemy.

Structural representations are also important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations are basically mental maps that we have in our minds that correspond exactly to those objects in the world (the intentional content). According to Morgan, structural representations are not the same as mental representations—there is nothing mental about them:  plants can have structural representations.

There are also internal representations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These types of representations include those that involve future decisions, episodic memories, or any type of projection into the future.

=== Gualtiero Piccinini ===

In [[Gualtiero Piccinini]]'s forthcoming work, he discusses topics on natural and nonnatural mental representations. He relies on the natural definition of mental representations given by Grice (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Meaning|last = Grice|first = H.P.|date = 1957|journal = Philosophical Review |volume=66|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where ''P entails that P''. e.g. Those spots mean measles, entails that the patient has measles. Then there are nonnatural representations:  ''P does not entail P''. e.g. The 3 rings on the bell of a bus mean the bus is full—the rings on the bell are independent of the fullness of the bus—we could have assigned something else (just as arbitrary) to signify that the bus is full.

=== Uriah Kriegel ===

There are also objective and subjective mental representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Controversies in Philosophy of Mind|last = Kriegel|first = Uriah|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = |location = |pages = 161–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Objective representations are closest to tracking theories—where the brain simply tracks what is in the environment. If there is a blue bird outside my window, the objective representation is that of the blue bird. Subjective representations can vary person-to-person. For example, if I am colorblind, that blue bird outside my window will not ''appear'' blue to me since I cannot represent the blueness of blue (i.e. I cannot see the color blue). The relationship between these two types of representation can vary.

&lt;ol type="a"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Objective varies, but the subjective does not:  e.g. brain-in-a-vat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subjective varies, but the objective does not:  e.g. color-inverted world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in objective and none in the subjective:  e.g. thermometer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All representations found in subjective and none in the objective:  e.g. an agent that experiences in a void.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Eliminativists think that subjective representations don't exist. Reductivists think subjective representations are reducible to objective. Non-reductivists think that subjective representations are real and distinct.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

''''Miller v. Skumanick'''' was a 2010 [[Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] case regarding the practice of [[sexting]] and its legal relationship to [[child pornography]].

==Background==
In October 2008, [[Tunkhannock Area School District]] officials confiscated several students' cellphones and found photographs of three female students, two were in their underwear and one was topless. No photos were exposed below the waist and no sexual acts were portrayed. He gave those photos as to [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming County]] District Attorney George Skumanick, Jr.  Skumanick promised to file charges against those posing in the photographs for production of child pornography unless they agreed to probation, completed a six to nine month educational program which would require participants to submit an essay explaining why their actions were wrong.  No actions were proposed against the male students possessing and distributing the images. The three families collectively filed for a [[Injunction#Temporary restraining orders|temporary restraining order]] in [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania|district court]] to prevent the prosecution from taking place while they seek an injunction.  The restraining order was granted, and Skumanick appealed.

==Decision==
The plaintiffs argued that prosecution would amount to retaliation against their children's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] right to free expression and against compelled speech, and the parents' [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] substantive due process right to direct the upbringing of their children.  The appellate court upheld the temporary restraining order based on the second and third claims.  Specifically, the court affirmed that the students' First Amendment right against compelled speech would be violated by the program's requirement that the student involve explain why their actions were wrong, and the parents' Fourteenth Amendment rights would be violated by the program's moral nature.

The appellate court opinion in this matter did not address whether the pictures in question were pornographic in nature, as it instead ruled that there was no evidence that the plaintiffs ever possessed or distributed the photos.

Scott's innovation in literary criticism was to reject the [[New Criticism|New Critics']] idea that poems should be studied as autonomous objects and to remind scholars that authors' personal beliefs are crucial for understanding their texts; in this way, he also returned criticism to a study of the way literature represents the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;Hesla, David H.

{{cquote|Along with [[Stanley Romaine Hopper]] at Drew University, [[Preston Roberts]] and '''Nathan A. Scott Jr.''' at the University of Chicago established the emerging interdisciplinary field that became known variously as religion and literature, theology and literature, or Christianity and literature. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, theologians found themselves looking to the literature of the post-World War II period for articulate expressions of theological themes such as despair, alienation, redemption, and revelation. Drawing primarily on Paul Tillich’s theology of culture—which defined religion as the substance of culture and culture as the form of religion—Scott eloquently explored the crisis of faith in modern literature, the climate of faith in Kafka, Camus, and Bellow, and the themes of alienation and reconciliation in modern plays, poetry, and novels. Scott taught several generations of students that a dialogue with the literary imagination of the age would provide rich rewards for Christian theology by offering a deepening awareness of itself and the time in which it finds itself. In one of his most eloquent and astute observations, Scott pointed out that the sense that the anchoring center of life is broken and that the world is abandoned and adrift is a basic premise underlying most of our literature.}}

The '''pelvic thrust''' is the thrusting motion of the [[pelvis|pelvic]] region, which is used for a variety of activities, such as dance or [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].

==Sexual activity and innuendo==
The pelvic thrust is used during [[sexual intercourse]] by many species of [[mammal]]s,&lt;ref name="Estes1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. D.

== Dance ==
[[File:Elvis Presley Jailhouse Rock2.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley performing [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]]]
One of the first to perform this move on stage was [[Elvis Presley]], which was quite controversial due to its obvious sexual connotations.  Due to this controversy, he was sometimes shown (as seen on his third appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'') from the waist up on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvisinfonet.com/spotlight_edsullivan.html |title=Welcome to EIN |publisher=Elvisinfonet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the pelvic thrust also became one of the signature moves of [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.businessinsider.in/HappyBirthdayMJ-Top-5-iconic-steps-Michael-Jackson-flooredus-with/articleshow/48743020.cms|title=#HappyBirthdayMJ – Top 5 iconic steps Michael Jackson floored us with|work=[[Business Insider]]| accessdate =3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twerking]] is also used as a dance move. The sideways pelvic thrust is a famous female dance move in Indian [[Bollywood]] films. Called Thumka, it appears in the lyrics of various songs.

== Infants ==
Pelvic thrusting is observed in infant monkeys, apes, and humans. These observations led ethologist John Bowlby (1969) to suggest that [[child sexuality|infantile sexual behavior]] may be the rule in mammals, not the exception. Thrusting has been observed in humans at eight to 10 months of age and may be an expression of affection. Typically, the infant clings to the parent, then nuzzles, thrusts, and rotates the pelvis for several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Rathus, Spencer: ''Human sexuality in a world of diversity''  (2007) p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Polymelia''' (from Greek πολυ- "many", μέλεα "limbs"), also known as ''hydra syndrome'', is a [[birth defect]] involving limbs (a type of [[dysmelia]]), in which the affected individual has more than the usual number of [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s. In humans and most land-dwelling animals, this means having five or more limbs. The extra limb is most commonly shrunken and/or deformed.

Sometimes an embryo started as [[conjoined twins]], but one twin degenerated completely except for one or more limbs, which end up attached to the other twin.

Sometimes small extra legs between the normal legs are caused by the body axis forking in the [[dipygus]] condition.

==Notable cases==
===In humans===
[[File:Female child with polymelia.jpg|thumb|right|A six-month old child with an extra leg]]
*In the summer of 2005, a baby girl named Destiny was born with a fully formed extra leg in [[Detroit]]. This was the result of a [[conjoined twin]] scenario.
*In March 2006, a baby boy identified only as [[Jie-jie]] was born in [[Shanghai]] with a fully formed third arm: he had two full-sized left arms, one ventral to the other. This is the only documented case of a child born with a fully formed supernumerary arm. It is an example of an extra limb on a normal body axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/5153292.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | first=Quentin | last=Sommerville | title=Three-armed boy 'recovering well' | date=2006-07-06|accessdate=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In July 2007 a child was born with four legs at the [[Lebowakgomo]] hospital outside [[Polokwane]] (South Africa)
* On November 6, 2007, doctors at Bangalore's Sparsh Hospital in Bangalore, India successfully completed surgery on a two-year-old girl named [[Lakshmi Tatma]] who was born with 4 arms and 4 legs; but this was not true polymelia but a case of ischiopagus [[Siamese twin]]ning where one twin's head had disappeared during development.
*[[Frank Lentini]] had a third leg, as well as a fourth foot and two sets of genitals.

===In other animals===
[[File:Deformed steer (1).JPG|thumb|100px|A grown steer with five legs.]]
[[Image:Kiev-UkrainianNationalChernobylMuseum 15.jpg|thumb|200px|Piglet with [[dipygus]] at Ukrainian National Chernobyl Museum in Kiev]]

*A four-legged [[chicken]] was born at Brendle Farms in [[Somerset, Pennsylvania]], in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=29&amp;art_id=qw115894188473B221|title=''Pennsylvania farm discovers a four-legged chicken|agency=Associated Press|date=2006-09-22 | accessdate=2006-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was carried on the major TV network news programs and ''[[USAToday]]''. The bird was found living normally among the rest of the chickens after 18 months.  She was adopted and named Henrietta by the farm owner's 13-year-old daughter, Ashley, who refuses to sell the chicken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14960695/ |title=This quadruped has feathers and clucks - US news - Weird news - Animal weirdness &amp;#124; NBC News |website=MSNBC.com |date=2006-09-22 |accessdate=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second (hind) legs are fully formed but non-functional.
*Four-legged [[duck]]s are occasionally hatched, such as 'Stumpy', an individual born in February 2007 on a farm in [[Hampshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-07/07/content_4806500.htm |title=Xinhua - English |website=News.xinhuanet.com |date=2006-07-07 |accessdate=2016-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223132953/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2006-07/07/content_4806500.htm |archivedate=2016-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Frog]]s in the USA sometimes are affected by polymelia when attacked in the [[tadpole]] stage by the ''[[Ribeiroia]]'' parasite.
*A puppy, known as Lilly, was recently born in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/20/five-legged-dog-lilly-sav_n_240992.html|date=2009-08-20| accessdate=2015-03-12 | work=Huffington Post|title=Five-Legged Dog Saved From Coney Island Freakshow}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a fully formed fifth leg jutting out between her hind legs.  She was initially set to be sold to a freak show, but was instead bought by a dog lover who had the leg removed.

==In mythology==
Many mythological creatures like [[dragon]]s, [[Pegasus|winged horse]]s, and [[griffin]]s have six limbs: four legs and two wings. The dragon's science is discussed in ''[[The Last Dragon (2004 TV series)|Dragons: A Fantasy Made Real]]''.

In [[Greek Mythology]], the [[Hekatonkheires]] were said to each have one hundred hands.  The [[Gegenees]] were a race of giants with six arms.

[[Sleipnir]], Odin's horse in [[Norse mythology]], has eight normal horse legs, and is usually depicted with limbs twinned at the shoulder or hip.

Several [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deities are depicted with multiple arms and sometimes also multiple legs.

==In popular culture==
*[[Edward Albee]]'s stage play ''[[The Man Who Had Three Arms]]'' tells the story of a fictional individual who was normal at birth but eventually sprouted a third functional arm, protruding from between his shoulder blades. After several years of living with three arms, the extra limb was reabsorbed into his body and the man became physically normal again. In Albee's play, the title character is extremely angry that we (the audience) seem to be much more interested in the period of his life when he had three arms, rather than his normal life before and after that interval.
*''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' performed a skit about a man with three buttocks. He believes that he has been invited to be interviewed on television because he is a nice person, and is dismayed to learn that he has only been invited because the interviewer is curious about his unusual condition.
*''[[The Dark Backward]]'' is a 1991 comedy film directed and written by Adam Rifkin, which features Judd Nelson as an unfunny garbage man who pursues a stand-up comedy career.  When the "comedian" grows a third arm out of his back, he becomes an overnight hit.
*[[Afro Samurai#Justice|Justice]], the main antagonist in the [[cartoon]] ''[[Afro Samurai]]'', has a fully formed arm protruding from his right shoulder.
*
*[[Brawlout]], playable Character in [[Paco (disambiguation)|Paco]] creature [[frog]]-like and [[Shark]]-like 4-armed.
*[[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]], character in the [[X-Men]] stories of [[Marvel Comics]], has six arms.
*A 6-armed [[Spider-Man]] frequently appears as an alternate reality incarnation of the character, and is sometimes referred to as "Polymelian".
*In the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' series, the Shokan is a race of humanoids known to have four arms.
*''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is a fictional biography of Jonathan Blashette, a man with three legs.

'''[[Project]]-based learning''' ('''PBL''') is a [[Student-centred learning|student-centered]] [[pedagogy]] that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/project-based-learning ''Project-Based Learning,'' Edutopia, March 14, 2016].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bie.org/about/what_pbl ''What is PBL?'' Buck Institute for Education].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a style of [[active learning]] and [[inquiry-based learning]].  PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.

Thomas Markham (2011) describes project-based learning (PBL) thus: "PBL integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum, but also apply what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum—a shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and resiliency. These cannot be taught out of a textbook, but must be activated through experience."&lt;ref&gt;Markham, T. (2011). Project Based Learning. Teacher Librarian, 39(2), 38-42.&lt;/ref&gt;  James G. Greeno (2006) has associated project-based learning with the "situated learning" perspective&lt;ref&gt;Greeno, J. G. (2006). Learning in activity. In R. K. Sawyer (Ed.), The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences (pp. 79-96). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the [[Constructivism_(philosophy_of_education)|constructivist]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]]. Blumenfeld ''et al.'' elaborate on the processes of PBL: "Project-based learning is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data, drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts."&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld et al 1991, EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST, 26(3&amp;4) 369-398 "Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning." Phyllis C. Blumenfeld, Elliot Soloway, Ronald W. Marx, Joseph S. Krajcik, Mark Guzdial, and Annemarie Palincsar.&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of PBL lies in the authenticity or real-life application of the research. Students working as a team are given a "driving question" to respond to or answer, then directed to create an artifact (or artifacts) to present their gained knowledge. Artifacts may include a variety of media such as writings, art, drawings, three-dimensional representations, videos, photography, or technology-based presentations.

Proponents of project-based learning cite numerous benefits to the implementation of its strategies in the classroom –  including a greater depth of understanding of concepts, broader knowledge base, improved communication and interpersonal/social skills, enhanced [[leadership]] skills, increased [[creativity]], and improved writing skills. Another definition of project-based learning includes a type of instruction, where students work together to solve real-world problems in their schools and communities. Successful problem-solving often requires students to draw on lessons from several disciplines and apply them in a very practical way. The promise of seeing a very real impact becomes the motivation for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education World|url=http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/problem-based-learning-tips-ideas.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dewey]] initially promoted the idea of "learning by doing". In ''My Pedagogical Creed'' (1897) Dewey enumerated his beliefs regarding education: "The teacher is not in the school to impose certain ideas or to form certain habits in the child, but is there as a member of the community to select the influences which shall affect the child and to assist him in properly responding to these.......I believe, therefore, in the so-called expressive or constructive activities as the centre of correlation."&lt;ref&gt;John Dewey, Education and Experience, 1938/1997. New York. Touchstone.&lt;/ref&gt;(Dewey, 1897) Educational research has advanced this idea of teaching and learning into a methodology known as "project-based learning". Blumenfeld &amp; Krajcik (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, R. K. (2006) The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; cite studies by Marx ''et al.'', 2004, Rivet &amp; Krajcki, 2004 and William &amp; Linn, 2003 state that "research has demonstrated that students in project-based learning classrooms get higher scores than students in traditional classroom".
[[File:John Dewey in 1902.jpg|thumbnail|John Dewey in 1902]]

In ''Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?'', Hye-Jung &amp; Cheolil (2012) describe "social loafing" as a negative aspect of collaborative learning. Social loafing may include insufficient performances by some team members as well as a lowering of expected standards of performance by the group as a whole to maintain congeniality amongst members. These authors said that because teachers tend to grade the finished product only, the social dynamics of the assignment may escape the teacher's notice.&lt;ref&gt;
Hye-Jung Lee1, h., &amp; Cheolil Lim1, c. (2012). Peer Evaluation in Blended Team Project-Based Learning: What Do Students Find Important?. Journal of Educational Technology &amp; Society, 15(4), 214-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
Project-based learning emphasizes learning activities that are long-term, interdisciplinary and student-centered. Unlike traditional, teacher-led classroom activities, students often must organize their own work and manage their own time in a project-based class. Project-based instruction differs from traditional inquiry by its emphasis on students' collaborative or individual artifact construction to represent what is being learned.

Project-based learning also gives students the opportunity to explore problems and challenges that have real-world applications, increasing the possibility of long-term retention of skills and concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crane|first1=Beverley|title=Using Web 2.0 Tools in the K-12 Classroom|date=2009|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-1-55570-653-1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements==
The core idea of project-based learning is that real-world problems capture students' interest and provoke serious thinking as the students acquire and apply new knowledge in a problem-solving context. The teacher plays the role of facilitator, working with students to frame worthwhile questions, structuring meaningful tasks, coaching both knowledge development and social skills, and carefully assessing what students have learned from the experience. Typical projects present a problem to solve (What is the best way to reduce the pollution in the schoolyard pond?) or a phenomenon to investigate (What causes rain?). PBL replaces other traditional models of instruction such as lecture, textbook-workbook driven activities and inquiry as the preferred delivery method for key topics in the curriculum. It is an instructional framework which allows teachers to facilitate  and assess  deeper understanding  rather than stand and deliver factual  information. PBL intentionally develops students' problem solving and creative making of products to communicate deeper understanding of key concepts and mastery of 21st Century essential learning skills such as critical thinking. Students become active digital researchers and assessors of their own learning when teachers guide student learning so that students learn from the project making processes. In this context, PBLs are units of self-directed learning from students' doing or making throughout the unit. PBL is not just "an activity" (project) that is stuck on the end of a lesson or unit.

Comprehensive project-based learning:
* needs a climate or collaborative culture of mutual respect in the classroom in order to work well.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;http://Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools/MindQuest21&lt;/ref&gt;
* begins with an entry activity that serves as the advanced organizer to capture and inspire student interest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* is organized around an authentic, open-ended driving question or challenge.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Although projects are the primary vehicle for instruction in project-based learning, there are no commonly shared criteria for what constitutes an acceptable project. Projects vary greatly in the depth of the questions explored, the clarity of the learning goals, the content and structure of the activity, and guidance from the teacher. The role of projects in the overall curriculum is also open to interpretation. Projects can guide the entire curriculum (more common in charter or other alternative schools) or simply consist of a few hands-on activities. They might be multidisciplinary (more likely in elementary schools) or single-subject (commonly science and math). Some projects involve the whole class, while others are done in small groups or individually. For example, Perrault and Albert&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Albert|first2=Cindy A.|date=2017-10-04|title=Utilizing project-based learning to increase sustainability attitudes among students|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1533015X.2017.1366882|journal=Applied Environmental Education &amp; Communication|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–10|doi=10.1080/1533015x.2017.1366882|issn=1533-015X}}&lt;/ref&gt; report the results of a PBL assignment in a college setting surrounding creating a communication campaign for the campus' sustainability office, finding that after project completion in small groups that the students had significantly more positive attitudes toward sustainability than prior to working on the project.

When PBL is used with [[21st century skills|21st century tools/skills]], students are expected to use technology in meaningful ways to help them investigate, collaborate, analyze, synthesize and present their learning. The term IPBL (Interdisciplinary PBL) has also been used to reflect a pedagogy where an emphasis on technology and/or an interdisciplinary approach has been included.

An example of a school that utilizes a project-based learning curriculum is [[Think Global School]]. In each country [http://www.thinkglobalschool.org (THINK Global School)] visits, students select an interdisciplinary, project-based learning module designed to help them answer key questions about the world around them. These projects combine elements of global studies, the sciences, and literature, among other courses. Projects from past years have included recreating Homer's The Odyssey by sailing across Greece and exploring the locations and concepts central to the epic poem, and while in Kerala, India, students participated in a project-based learning module centered around blending their learning and travels into a mock business venture. The interdisciplinary project was designed to enable students to engage in the key areas of problem solving, decision making and communication — all framed by the demanding parameters of a "[[Shark Tank]]", or "[[Dragons' Den (UK TV series)|Dragon's Den]]" style competition.

Another example of applied PBL is [[Muscatine High School]], located in Muscatine, Iowa. The school started the [http://www.g-squared.info G2 (Global Generation Exponential Learning)] which consists of middle and high school "Schools within Schools" that deliver the four core subject areas. At the high school level, activities may include making water purification systems, investigating service learning, or creating new bus routes. At the middle school level, activities may include researching trash statistics, documenting local history through interviews, or writing essays about a community scavenger hunt. Classes are designed to help diverse students become college and career ready after high school.

In 2009, The Illinois Consortium for 21st Century Schools lead by Deeper Learning author Jim Bellanca, initiated a 5-year deeper learning research project to identify the best practices and conditions among existing PBL models. In 6 pilot schools with students from the low performing to the highest performing, they piloted their findings. The goal was to test if all school/all day public schools could be transformed by  PBL as initiated in schools such as Manor New Tech, 
This would test if traditional schools with established faculty could make such this deep shift.

As a result of the all school adoption of PBL in  collaborative school wide cultures, several pilot schools earned accolades as P21 Exemplar schools
([http://www.p21.org/exemplar-program-case-studies/1301-case-study-franklin-elementary-school http://www.p21exemplars/Franklin]) with raised achievement results and obvious evidence of teacher practice change.  The model calls for all  teachers and administrators to engage in a multi-year professional development effort which changed school culture, teachers re designing their units of study, teachers  vetting all units and deciding which to contribute to a school based digital PBL library of unit plans and student artifacts, revisions in RTI,  revisions in teacher evaluation and in student "grading".as well as an upgrading of grade level PLCs. The model empowers teachers to change how they deliver instruction so that MindQuest21 PBL is the dominant model of instruction in every classroom. The model was assessed in one three school public district with a rising "free and reduced,lunch"  population.  Following the pilot years, the Consortium initiated this change program in Chicago Public Schools, Atlanta Public Schools, and in a rural Illinois statewide network. The P21 Exemplar school site provides videos and descriptions of the Illinois projects as well as other PBL projects across the country. 
 
The [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]] has provided funding to start holistic PBL schools across the United States. These organizations include,

Another example is [[Manor Independent School District|Manor New Technology High School]], a public high school that since opening in 2007 is a 100 percent project-based instruction school. Students average 60 projects a year across subjects. It is reported that 98 percent of seniors graduate, 100 percent of the graduates are accepted to college, and fifty-six percent of them have been the first in their family to attend college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/stw-project-based-learning-best-practices-new-tech-high-school#more|What Makes Project-Based Learning a Success?]. Retrieved 2013-10-29&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] has also providing funding for project-based learning projects within the [[Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013]]. For example, [http://www.popullar.eu/ PopuLLar - Music and language learning], [http://www.clohe-movingtoys.eu/ Moving toys in the classroom] and [http://www.artined.eu/ ARTinED - A new approach to education using the arts].

According to Terry Heick on his blog, Teach Thought, there are three types of project-based learning. The first is Challenge-Based Learning/Problem-Based Learning, the second is Place-Based Education, and the third is Activity-Based learning. Challenge-Based Learning is "an engaging multidisciplinary approach to teaching and learning that encourages students to leverage the technology they use in their daily lives to solve real-world problems through efforts in their homes, schools and communities." Place-based Education "immerses students in local heritage, cultures, landscapes, opportunities and experiences; uses these as a foundation for the study of language arts, mathematics, social studies, science and other subjects across the curriculum, and emphasizes learning through participation in service projects for the local school and/or community." Activity-Based Learning takes a kind of constructivist approach, the idea being students constructing their own meaning through hands-on activities, often with manipulatives and opportunities to. As a private school provider [[Nobel Education Network]] combines PBL with the [[International Baccalaureate]] as a central pillar of their strategy.

==Roles==
PBL relies on learning groups. Student groups determine their projects, in so doing, they engage [[student voice]] by encouraging students to take full responsibility for their learning. This is what makes PBL [[constructivist learning|constructivist]]. Students work together to accomplish specific goals.

When students use technology as a tool to communicate with others, they take on an active role vs. a passive role of transmitting the information by a teacher, a book, or broadcast. The student is constantly making choices on how to obtain, display, or manipulate information. Technology makes it possible for students to think actively about the choices they make and execute. Every student has the opportunity to get involved either individually or as a group.

Instructor role in Project Based Learning is that of a facilitator. They do not relinquish control of the classroom or student learning but rather develop an atmosphere of shared responsibility. The Instructor must structure the proposed question/issue so as to direct the student's learning toward content-based materials. The instructor must regulate student success with intermittent, transitional goals to ensure student projects remain focused and students have a deep understanding of the concepts being investigated. The students are held accountable to these goals through ongoing feedback and assessments. The ongoing assessment and feedback are essential to ensure the student stays within the scope of the driving question and the core standards the project is trying to unpack. According to Andrew Miller of the Buck Institute of Education, formative assessments are used "in order to be transparent to parents and students, you need to be able to track and monitor ongoing formative assessments, that show work toward that standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Andrew|title=Edutopia|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/effective-assessment-project-based-learning-andrew-miller|publisher=© 2013 The George Lucas Educational Foundation|accessdate=22 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instructor uses these assessments to guide the inquiry process and ensure the students have learned the required content. Once the project is finished, the instructor evaluates the finished product and learning that it demonstrates

Student role is to ask questions, build knowledge, and determine a real-world solution to the issue/question presented. Students must collaborate expanding their active listening skills and requiring them to engage in intelligent focused communication. Therefore, allowing them to think rationally on how to solve problems. PBL forces students to take ownership of their success.

==Outcomes==
More important than learning science, students need to learn to work in a community, thereby taking on social responsibilities. The most significant contributions of PBL have been in schools languishing in poverty stricken areas; when students take responsibility, or ownership, for their learning, their self-esteem soars. It also helps to create better work habits and attitudes toward learning. In standardized tests, languishing schools have been able to raise their testing grades a full level by implementing PBL.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Although students do work in groups, they also become more independent because they are receiving little instruction from the teacher. With Project-Based Learning students also learn skills that are essential in higher education. The students learn more than just finding answers, PBL allows them to expand their minds and think beyond what they normally would. Students have to find answers to questions and combine them using critically thinking skills to come up with answers.

PBL is significant to the study of (mis-)conceptions; local concepts and childhood intuitions that are hard to replace with conventional classroom lessons. In PBL, project science ''is'' the community culture; the student groups themselves resolve their understandings of phenomena with their own knowledge building. Technology allows them to search in more useful ways, along with getting more rapid results.

Opponents of Project Based Learning warn against negative outcomes primarily in projects that become unfocused and tangential arguing that underdeveloped lessons can result in the wasting of precious class time. No one teaching method has been proven more effective than another. Opponents suggest that narratives and presentation of anecdotal evidence included in lecture-style instruction can convey the same knowledge in less class time. Given that disadvantaged students generally have fewer opportunities to learn academic content outside of school, wasted class time due to an unfocused lesson presents a particular problem. Instructors can be deluded into thinking that as long as a student is engaged and doing, they are learning. Ultimately it is cognitive activity that determines the success of a lesson. If the project does not remain on task and content driven the student will not be successful in learning the material. The lesson will be ineffective. A source of difficulty for teachers includes, "Keeping these complex projects on track while attending to students' individual learning needs requires artful teaching, as well as industrial-strength project management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/projects-partnerships-pbl-suzie-boss|title=Projects and Partnerships Build a Stronger Future - Edutopia|author=|date=|website=edutopia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like any approach, Project Based Learning is only beneficial when applied successfully.

[[Problem-based learning]] is a similar pedagogic approach, however, problem-based approaches structure students' activities more by asking them to solve specific (open-ended) problems rather than relying on students to come up with their own problems in the course of completing a project.

A meta-analysis conducted by Purdue University found that when implemented well, PBL can increase long-term retention of material and replicable skill, as well as improve teachers' and students' attitudes towards learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/ijpbl/vol3/iss1/4/|title=When is PBL More Effective?

==Overcoming obstacles and criticisms==
A frequent criticism of PBL is that when students work in groups some will "slack off" or sit back and let the others do all the work.  Anne Shaw recommends that teachers always build into the structure of the PBL curriculum an organizational strategy known as Jigsaw and Expert Groups.  This structure forces students to be self-directed, independent and to work interdependently.

This means that the class is assigned (preferably randomly, by lottery) to Expert Groups.  Each of the Expert Groups is then assigned to deeply study one particular facet of the overall project.  For example, a class studying about environmental issues in their community may be divided into the following Expert Groups:

#  Air
#  Land
#  Water
#  Human impact on the environment

Each Expert Group is tasked with studying the materials for their group, taking notes, then preparing to teach what they learned to the rest of the students in the class.  To do so, the class will "jigsaw", thus creating Jigsaw Groups.  The Jigsaw Groups in the above example would each be composed of one representative from each of the Expert Groups, so each Jigsaw Group would include:

#  One expert on Air
#  One expert on Land
#  One expert on Water
#  One expert on "Human impact on the environment"

Each of these experts would then take turns teaching the others in the group.  Total interdependence is assured.  No one can "slack off" because each student is the only person in the group with that "piece" of the information.  Another benefit is that the students must have learned the concepts, skills and information well enough to be able to teach it and must be able to assess (not grade) their own learning and the learning of their peers.  This forces a much deeper learning experience.

Anne Shaw recommends that when students are teaching each other they also participate collaboratively in creating a concept map as they teach each other. This adds a significant dimension to the thinking and the learning.  The students may build upon this map each time they Jigsaw.  If a project is scheduled to last over the time period of six weeks the students may meet in their Expert Groups twice a week, and then Jigsaw twice a week, building upon their learning and exploration of the topics over time.

Once all the experts have taught each other, the Jigsaw Group then designs and creates a product to demonstrate what they now know about all four aspects of the PBL unit – air, land, water, human's impact.  Performance-based products may include a wide range of possibilities such as dioramas, skits, plays, debates, student-produced documentaries, web sites, Glogsters, VoiceThreads, games (digital or not), presentations to members of the community (such as the City Council or a community organization), student-produced radio or television program, a student-organized conference, a fair, a film festival.

Students are assessed in two ways:

#  Individual assessments for each student – may include research notes, teaching prep notes and teacher observation.  Other assessments may include those assigned by the teacher, for example, each student in the class must write an individual research paper for a topic of their choice from within the theme of the overall PBL.
#  Group assessments – each Jigsaw group creates and presents their product, preferably to an audience other than the teacher or their class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.21stCenturySchools.com 21st Century Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One concern is that PBL may be inappropriate in mathematics, the reason being that mathematics is primarily skill-based at the elementary level. Transforming the curriculum into an over-reaching project or series of projects does not allow for necessary practice of particular mathematical skills. For instance, factoring quadratic expressions in elementary algebra requires extensive repetition.

On the other hand, a teacher could integrate a PBL approach into the standard curriculum, helping the students see some broader contexts where abstract quadratic equations may apply. For example, Newton's law implies that tossed objects follow a parabolic path, and the roots of the corresponding equation correspond to the starting and ending locations of the object.

Another criticism of PBL is that measures that are stated as reasons for its success are not measurable using standard measurement tools, and rely on subjective rubrics for assessing results.

In PBL there is also a certain tendency for the creation of the final product of the project to become the driving force in classroom activities. When this happens, the project can lose its content focus and be ineffective in helping students learn certain concepts and skills. For example, academic projects that culminate in an artistic display or exhibit may place more emphasis on the artistic processes involved in creating the display than on the academic content that the project is meant to help students learn.

{{Manufacturing}}
'''Supervisory control and data acquisition''' ('''SCADA''') is a [[control system]] architecture that uses computers, networked data communications and [[graphical user interface]]s for [[high-level]] process [[supervisory management]], but uses other peripheral devices such as [[programmable logic controller]] (PLC) and discrete [[PID controller]]s to interface with the process plant or machinery. The operator interfaces that enable monitoring and the issuing of process commands, such as controller set point changes, are handled through the SCADA computer system. However, the real-time control logic or controller calculations are performed by networked modules that connect to the field sensors and [[actuators]].

The SCADA concept was developed as a universal means of remote access to a variety of local control modules, which could be from different manufacturers allowing access through standard automation [[List of automation protocols|protocols]]. In practice, large SCADA systems have grown to become very similar to [[distributed control system]]s in function, but using multiple means of interfacing with the plant. They can control large-scale processes that can include multiple sites, and work over large distances as well as small distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfxr5DikdP0 |title=Back to Basics: SCADA |author=Boys, Walt |publisher=Automation TV: Control Global - Control Design |date=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most commonly-used types of [[industrial control system]]s, however there are concerns about SCADA systems being vulnerable to cyberwarfare/cyberterrorism attacks.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The SCADA concept in control operations==
[[File:Functional levels of a Distributed Control System.svg|thumb|500px|Functional levels of a manufacturing control operation]]

The key attribute of a SCADA system is its ability to perform a supervisory operation over a variety of other proprietary devices.

The accompanying diagram is a general model which shows functional manufacturing levels using computerised control.

Referring to the diagram,

* Level 0 contains the field devices such as flow and temperature sensors, and final control elements, such as [[control valve]]s.
* Level 1 contains the industrialised input/output (I/O) modules, and their associated distributed electronic processors.   
* Level 2 contains the supervisory computers, which  collate information from processor nodes on the system, and provide the operator control screens. 
* Level 3 is the production control level, which does not directly control the process, but is concerned with monitoring production and targets.
* Level 4 is the production scheduling level.

Level 1 contains the [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLCs) or [[remote terminal unit]]s (RTUs).

Level 2 contains the SCADA software and computing platform. The SCADA software exists only at this supervisory level as control actions are performed automatically by RTUs or PLCs. SCADA control functions are usually restricted to basic overriding or supervisory level intervention. For example, a PLC may control the flow of cooling water through part of an industrial process to a set point level, but the SCADA system software will allow operators to change the set points for the flow. The SCADA also enables alarm conditions, such as loss of flow or high temperature, to be displayed and recorded. A [[feedback control]] loop is directly controlled by the RTU or PLC, but the SCADA software monitors the overall performance of the loop.

Levels 3 and 4 are not strictly process control in the traditional sense, but are where production control and scheduling takes place.

[[Data acquisition]] begins at the RTU or PLC level and includes [[instrumentation]] readings and equipment status reports that are communicated to level 2 SCADA as required. Data is then compiled and formatted in such a way that a control room operator using the HMI ([[Human Machine Interface]]) can make supervisory decisions to adjust or override normal RTU (PLC) controls. Data may also be fed to a [[Operational historian|historian]], often built on a commodity [[database management system]], to allow trending and other analytical auditing.

SCADA systems typically use  a ''tag database'', which contains data elements called ''tags'' or ''points'', which relate to specific instrumentation or actuators within the process system according to such as the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]]. Data is accumulated against these unique process control equipment tag references.

==Examples of use==
[[File:Freer Water Control and Improvement District - Diana Adame.jpg|thumb|Example of SCADA used in office environment to remotely monitor a process]]

Both large and small systems can be built using the SCADA concept. These systems can range from just tens to thousands of [[control loop]]s, depending on the application. Example processes include industrial, infrastructure, and facility-based processes, as described below:

* [[Industrial process]]es include  [[manufacturing]], [[Process control]],  [[power generation]], [[Fabrication (metal)|fabrication]], and refining, and may run in continuous, batch, repetitive, or discrete modes.
* [[Infrastructure]] processes may be public or private, and include [[water treatment]] and distribution, wastewater collection and [[waste water treatment|treatment]], [[Fossil gas pipeline|oil and gas pipeline]]s, [[electric power transmission]] and [[Electric power distribution|distribution]], and [[wind farm]]s.
* Facility processes, including buildings, airports, [[Ship#Today|ship]]s, and [[space station]]s. They monitor and control [[heating, ventilation, and air conditioning]] systems (HVAC), [[Access control|access]], and [[Efficient energy use|energy consumption]].

However, SCADA systems may have security vulnerabilities, so the systems should be evaluated to identify risks and solutions implemented to mitigate those risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyer|first= Stuart A.|title= SCADA Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition|year=2010 |publisher= ISA - International Society of Automation |location= USA |isbn=978-1-936007-09-7 |page= 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCADA system components==
[[Image:Scada std anim no lang.gif|thumb|Typical SCADA mimic shown as an animation. For process plant, these are based upon the [[piping and instrumentation diagram]].]]

A SCADA system usually consists of the following main elements:

===Supervisory computers===
This is the core of the SCADA system, gathering data on the process and sending control commands to the field connected devices. It refers to the computer and software responsible for communicating with the field connection controllers, which are RTUs and PLCs, and includes the HMI software running on operator workstations.  In smaller SCADA systems, the supervisory computer may be composed of a single PC, in which case the HMI is a part of this computer. In larger SCADA systems, the master station may include several HMIs hosted on client computers, multiple servers for data acquisition, distributed software applications, and disaster recovery sites. To increase the integrity of the system the multiple servers will often be configured in a [[Dual modular redundancy|dual-redundant]] or [[Hot spare|hot-standby]] formation providing continuous control and monitoring in the event of a server malfunction or breakdown.

===Remote terminal units===
{{Further information|Remote terminal unit}}
[[Remote terminal unit]]s, also known as (RTUs),  connect to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory computer system.  RTUs are "intelligent I/O" and often have embedded control capabilities such as [[ladder logic]] in order to accomplish [[Boolean expression|boolean]] logic operations.&lt;ref name="Hieb2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeff Hieb|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA  Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A-_PPgAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=University of Louisville}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programmable logic controllers===
{{Further information|Programmable logic controller}}
Also known as PLCs, these are connected to sensors and actuators in the process, and are networked to the supervisory system in the same way as RTUs. PLCs have more sophisticated embedded control capabilities than RTUs, and are programmed in one or more [[IEC 61131-3]] programming languages. PLCs are often used in place of RTUs as field devices because they are more economical, versatile, flexible and configurable.

===Communication infrastructure===
This connects the supervisory computer system to the RTUs and PLCs, and may use industry standard or manufacturer proprietary protocols.
Both RTU's and PLC's operate autonomously on the near-real time control of the process, using the last command given from the supervisory system. Failure of the communications network does not necessarily stop the plant process controls, and on resumption of communications, the operator can continue with monitoring and control. Some critical systems will have dual redundant data highways, often cabled via diverse routes.

===Human-machine interface===
{{Further information|Graphical user interface}}
[[File:Scada_Animation.ogv|thumb|right|More complex SCADA animation showing control of four batch cookers]]
The human-machine interface (HMI) is the operator window of the supervisory system. It presents plant information to the operating personnel graphically in the form of mimic diagrams, which are a schematic representation of the plant being controlled, and alarm and event logging pages. The HMI is linked to the SCADA supervisory computer to provide live data to drive the mimic diagrams, alarm displays and trending graphs. In many installations the HMI is the graphical user interface for the operator, collects all data from external devices, creates reports, performs alarming, sends notifications, etc.

Mimic diagrams consist of line graphics and schematic symbols to represent process elements, or may consist of digital photographs of the process equipment overlain with animated symbols.

Supervisory operation of the plant is by means of the HMI, with operators issuing commands using mouse pointers, keyboards and touch screens. For example, a symbol of a pump can show the operator that the pump is running, and a flow meter symbol can show how much fluid it is pumping through the pipe. The operator can switch the pump off from the mimic by a mouse click or screen touch. The HMI will show the flow rate of the fluid in the pipe decrease in real time.

The HMI package for a SCADA system typically includes a drawing program that the operators or system maintenance personnel use to change the way these points are represented in the interface. These representations can be as simple as an on-screen traffic light, which represents the state of an actual traffic light in the field, or as complex as a multi-projector display representing the position of all of the elevators in a skyscraper or all of the trains on a railway.

A '''"historian",''' is a software service within the HMI which accumulates time-stamped data, events, and alarms in a database which can be queried or used to populate graphic trends in the HMI.  The historian is a client that requests data from a data acquisition server.&lt;ref name="Raul2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aquino-Santos, Raul|title=Emerging Technologies in Wireless Ad-hoc Networks: Applications and Future Development: Applications and Future Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UN2eBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=30 November 2010|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-60960-029-7|pages=43–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alarm handling==
{{Further information|Alarm management}}
An important part of most SCADA implementations is [[alarm management|alarm handling]]. The system monitors whether certain alarm conditions are satisfied, to determine when an alarm event has occurred. Once an alarm event has been detected, one or more actions are taken (such as the activation of one or more alarm indicators, and perhaps the generation of email or text messages so that management or remote SCADA operators are informed). In many cases, a SCADA operator may have to acknowledge the alarm event; this may deactivate some alarm indicators, whereas other indicators remain active until the alarm conditions are cleared.

Alarm conditions can be explicit—for example, an alarm point is a digital status point that has either the value NORMAL or ALARM that is calculated by a formula based on the values in other analogue and digital points—or implicit: the SCADA system might automatically monitor whether the value in an analogue point lies outside high and low- limit values associated with that point.

Examples of alarm indicators include a siren, a pop-up box on a screen, or a coloured or flashing area on a screen (that might act in a similar way to the "fuel tank empty" light in a car); in each case, the role of the alarm indicator is to draw the operator's attention to the part of the system 'in alarm' so that appropriate action can be taken.

==PLC/RTU programming==
"Smart" RTUs, or standard PLCs, are capable of autonomously executing simple logic processes without involving the supervisory computer. They employ standardized control programming languages  such as under, [[IEC 61131-3]] (a suite of 5 programming languages including function block, ladder, structured text, sequence function charts and instruction list), is frequently used to create programs which run on these RTUs and PLCs.  Unlike a procedural language such as the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] or [[FORTRAN]], IEC 61131-3 has minimal training requirements by virtue of resembling historic physical control arrays. This allows SCADA system engineers to perform both the design and implementation of a program to be executed on an RTU or PLC.

A [[programmable automation controller]] (PAC) is a compact controller that combines the features and capabilities of a PC-based control system with that of a typical PLC. PACs are deployed in SCADA systems to provide RTU and PLC functions. In many electrical substation SCADA applications, "distributed RTUs" use information processors or station computers to communicate with [[digital protective relay]]s, PACs, and other devices for I/O, and communicate with the SCADA master in lieu of a traditional RTU.

==PLC commercial integration==
Since about 1998, virtually all major PLC manufacturers have offered integrated HMI/SCADA systems, many of them using open and non-proprietary communications protocols.  Numerous specialized third-party HMI/SCADA packages, offering built-in compatibility with most major PLCs, have also entered the market, allowing mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and technicians to configure HMIs themselves, without the need for a custom-made program written by a software programmer.
The Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) connects to physical equipment. Typically, an RTU converts the electrical signals from the equipment to digital values such as the open/closed status from a switch or a valve, or measurements such as pressure, flow, voltage or current. By converting and sending these electrical signals out to equipment the RTU can control equipment, such as opening or closing a switch or a valve, or setting the speed of a pump.

==Communication infrastructure and methods==
SCADA systems have traditionally used combinations of radio and direct wired connections, although  [[Synchronous optical networking|SONET/SDH]] is also frequently used for large systems such as railways and power stations. The remote management or monitoring function of a SCADA system is often referred to as [[telemetry]]. Some users want SCADA data to travel over their pre-established corporate networks or to share the network with other applications. The legacy of the early low-bandwidth protocols remains, though.

SCADA protocols are designed to be very compact. Many are designed to send information only when the master station polls the RTU. Typical legacy SCADA protocols include [[Modbus]] RTU, [[RP-570]], [[Profibus]] and Conitel. These communication protocols, with the exception of Modbus (Modbus has been made open by Schneider Electric), are all SCADA-vendor specific but are widely adopted and used. Standard protocols are [[IEC 60870-5|IEC 60870-5-101 or 104]], [[IEC 61850]] and [[DNP3]]. These communication protocols are standardized and recognized by all major SCADA vendors. Many of these protocols now contain extensions to operate over [[TCP/IP]]. Although the use of conventional networking specifications, such as [[TCP/IP]], blurs the line between traditional and industrial networking, they each fulfill fundamentally differing requirements.&lt;ref name=GallowayIntro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Introduction to Industrial Control Networks|journal=IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials|year=2012|url=http://www.rfidblog.org.uk/Preprint-GallowayHancke-IndustrialControlSurvey.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Network simulation]] can be used in conjunction with SCADA simulators to perform various 'what-if' analyses.

With increasing security demands (such as [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[critical infrastructure protection]] (CIP) in the US), there is increasing use of satellite-based communication. This has the key advantages that the infrastructure can be self-contained (not using circuits from the public telephone system), can have built-in encryption, and can be engineered to the availability and reliability required by the SCADA system operator.  Earlier experiences using consumer-grade [[Very-small-aperture terminal|VSAT]] were poor. Modern carrier-class systems provide the quality of service required for SCADA.&lt;ref name=berganELP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bergan|first=Christian|title=Demystifying Satellite for the Smart Grid: Four Common Misconceptions|journal=Electric Light &amp; Powers|date=August 2011|volume=16|series=Utility Automation &amp; Engineering T&amp;D|issue=8|url=http://www.elp.com/index/display/article-display/5666163079/articles/utility-automation-engineering-td/volume-16/issue-8/features/demystifying-satellite-for-the-smart-grid-four-common-misconceptions.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|at=Four|publisher=PennWell|location=Tulsa, OK|quote=satellite is a cost-effective and secure solution that can provide backup communications and easily support core smart grid applications like SCADA, telemetry, AMI backhaul and distribution automation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTUs and other automatic controller devices were developed before the advent of industry wide standards for interoperability. The result is that developers and their management created a multitude of control protocols. Among the larger vendors, there was also the incentive to create their own protocol to "lock in" their customer base. A [[list of automation protocols]] is compiled here.

[[OLE for process control]] (OPC) can connect different hardware and software, allowing communication even between devices originally not intended to be part of an industrial network.

Standardisation in the field of mySCADA protocols resulted into the vendor independent protocol called OPC UA (Unified Architecture). OPC UA is starting to be widely adopted among multiple SCADA vendors. 

==SCADA architecture development==
[[File:SCADA C4ISR Facilities.pdf|thumb|The [[United States Army]]'s Training Manual 5-601 covers "SCADA Systems for [[C4ISTAR|C4ISR]] Facilities"]]
SCADA systems have evolved through four generations as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scadahacker.com/library/Documents/ICS_Basics/SCADA%20Basics%20-%20NCS%20TIB%2004-1.pdf |title=Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) Systems |publisher=NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM |author=OFFICE OF THE MANAGER NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMctober 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersgarage.com/articles/scada-systems |title=SCADA Systems april 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scadahistory.com/ |title=A Brief History of SCADA/EMS (2015) |author=J. Russel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811051350/http://scadahistory.com/ |archivedate=11 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First generation: "monolithic"===
Early SCADA system computing was done by large [[minicomputers]]. Common network services did not exist at the time SCADA was developed. Thus SCADA systems were independent systems with no connectivity to other systems. The communication protocols used were strictly proprietary at that time. The first-generation SCADA system redundancy was achieved using a back-up mainframe system connected to all the [[Remote Terminal Unit]] sites and was used in the event of failure of the primary mainframe system.&lt;ref name="Proquest-text"&gt;{{cite book|title=Security Hardened Remote Terminal Units for SCADA Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5O5N1vjbQgC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=978-0-549-54831-7|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some first generation SCADA systems were developed as "turn key" operations that ran on minicomputers such as the [[PDP-11]] series made by the [[Digital Equipment Corporation]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.

===Second generation: "distributed"===
SCADA information and command processing was distributed across multiple stations which were connected through a LAN. Information was shared in near real time. Each station was responsible for a particular task, which reduced the cost as compared to First Generation SCADA. The network protocols used were still not standardized. Since these protocols were proprietary, very few people beyond the developers knew enough to determine how secure a SCADA installation was. Security of the SCADA installation was usually overlooked.
===Third generation: "networked"===

Similar to a distributed architecture, any complex SCADA can be reduced to the simplest components and connected through communication protocols. In the case of a networked design, the system may be spread across more than one LAN network called a [[Process control network|process control network (PCN)]] and separated geographically. Several distributed architecture SCADAs running in parallel, with a single supervisor and historian, could be considered a network architecture. This allows for a more cost-effective solution in very large scale systems.

===Fourth generation: "Internet of things"===
With the commercial availability of [[cloud computing]], SCADA systems have increasingly adopted [[Internet of things]] technology to significantly improve interoperability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduce infrastructure costs and increase ease of maintenance and integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scada.com/verticals/internetofthings/ SCADA and the Internet of Things] Retrieved May 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, SCADA systems can now report state in near real-time and use the horizontal scale available in cloud environments to implement more complex control algorithms &lt;ref&gt;{{cite | title=SCADA as a service approach for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | doi=10.1016/j.segan.2016.08.001 | newspaper=Sustainable Energy, Grids and Network | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; than are practically feasible to implement on traditional [[programmable logic controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms/ How The "Internet Of Things" Is Turning Cities Into Living Organisms] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021181958/http://www.fastcompany.com/biomimicry/how-the-internet-of-things-is-turning-cities-into-organisms |date=21 October 2013 }} Retrieved September 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the use of open network protocols such as [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]] inherent in the Internet of things technology, provides a more readily comprehensible and manageable security boundary than the heterogeneous mix of proprietary network protocols typical of many decentralized SCADA implementations.

This decentralization of data also requires a different approach to SCADA than traditional PLC based programs. When a SCADA system is used locally, the preferred methodology involves binding the graphics on the user interface to the data stored in specific PLC memory addresses. However, when the data comes from a disparate mix of sensors, controllers and databases (which may be local or at varied connected locations), the typical 1 to 1 mapping becomes problematic. A solution to this is [[data modeling]], a concept derived from object oriented programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The History of Data Modeling | url=http://www.exforsys.com/tutorials/data-modeling/the-history-of-data-modeling.html | newspaper=Exforsys Inc. | date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a data model, a virtual representation of each device is constructed in the SCADA software. These virtual representations (“models”) can contain not just the address mapping of the device represented, but also any other pertinent information (web based info, database entries, media files, etc.) that may be used by other facets of the SCADA/IoT implementation. As the increased complexity of the Internet of things renders traditional SCADA increasingly “house-bound,” and as communication protocols evolve to favor platform-independent, service-oriented architecture (such as [[OPC UA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=CIM and OPC UA for interoperability of micro-grid platforms | url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01368458/ | newspaper=Proceedings of the IEEE ISGT 2016 Conference. | date=6 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is likely that more SCADA software developers will implement some form of data modeling.

==Security issues==
SCADA systems that tie together decentralized facilities such as power, oil, gas pipelines, water distribution and wastewater collection systems were designed to be open, robust, and easily operated and repaired, but not necessarily secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Boyes|first= Walt|title=Instrumentation Reference Book, 4th Edition|year=2011 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location= USA|isbn=0-7506-8308-2|page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move from proprietary technologies to more standardized and open solutions together with the increased number of connections between SCADA systems, office networks and the [[Internet]] has made them more vulnerable to types of [[Attack (computing)#Types of attacks|network attacks]] that are relatively common in [[computer security]]. For example, [[ICS-CERT|United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)]] released a vulnerability advisory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-11-231-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-231-01—INDUCTIVE AUTOMATION IGNITION INFORMATION DISCLOSURE VULNERABILITY |accessdate=21 Jan 2013|date=19 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; warning that unauthenticated users could download sensitive configuration information including [[Cryptographic hash function#File or data identifier|password hashes]] from an [[Inductive Automation]] [[Ignition SCADA|Ignition]] system utilizing a standard [[Semantic URL attack|attack type]] leveraging access to the [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] [[Embedded Web server]]. Security researcher Jerry Brown submitted a similar advisory regarding a [[buffer overflow]] vulnerability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/pdf/ICSA-11-094-01.pdf|title=ICSA-11-094-01—WONDERWARE INBATCH CLIENT ACTIVEX BUFFER OVERFLOW|accessdate=26 Mar 2013|date=13 Apr 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a [[Wonderware]] InBatchClient [[ActiveX control]]. Both vendors made updates available prior to public vulnerability release. Mitigation recommendations were standard [[Software patching|patching]] practices and requiring [[VPN]] access for secure connectivity. Consequently, the security of some SCADA-based systems has come into question as they are seen as potentially vulnerable to [[cyber attack]]s.&lt;ref name=NGF-CA-GT-01&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyberthreats, Vulnerabilities and Attacks on SCADA  Networks |url=http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |work=Rosa Tang, berkeley.edu |accessdate=1 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813015252/http://gspp.berkeley.edu/iths/Tsang_SCADA%20Attacks.pdf |archivedate=13 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-federal-06/BH-Fed-06-Maynor-Graham-up.pdf |title=SCADA Security and Terrorism: We're Not Crying Wolf |author=D.

In particular, security researchers are concerned about
* the lack of concern about security and authentication in the design, deployment and operation of some existing SCADA networks
* the belief that SCADA systems have the benefit of [[security through obscurity]] through the use of specialized protocols and proprietary interfaces
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are physically secured
* the belief that SCADA networks are secure because they are disconnected from the Internet

SCADA systems are used to control and monitor physical processes, examples of which are transmission of electricity, transportation of gas and oil in pipelines, water distribution, traffic lights, and other systems used as the basis of modern society.  The security of these SCADA systems is important because compromise or destruction of these systems would impact multiple areas of society far removed from the original compromise.  For example, a blackout caused by a compromised electrical SCADA system would cause financial losses to all the customers that received electricity from that source.  &lt;!-- Removed FUD --&gt;How security will affect legacy SCADA and new deployments remains to be seen.

There are many threat vectors to a modern SCADA system. One is the threat of unauthorized access to the control software, whether it is human access or changes induced intentionally or accidentally by virus infections and other software threats residing on the control host machine. Another is the threat of packet access to the network segments hosting SCADA devices. In many cases, the control protocol lacks any form of [[Cryptography|cryptographic security]], allowing an attacker to control a SCADA device by sending commands over a network. In many cases SCADA users have assumed that having a VPN offered sufficient protection, unaware that security can be trivially bypassed with physical access to SCADA-related network jacks and switches. Industrial control vendors suggest approaching SCADA security like [[Information security|Information Security]] with a [[Defense in depth#Information security|defense in depth]] strategy that leverages common IT practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockwellautomation.com/resources/downloads/rockwellautomation/pdf/products-technologies/security-technology/securat001aene.pdf|title=Industrial Security Best Practices|publisher=Rockwell Automation |accessdate=26 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reliable function of SCADA systems in our modern infrastructure may be crucial to public health and safety. As such, attacks on these systems may directly or indirectly threaten public health and safety. Such an attack has already occurred, carried out on Maroochy Shire Council's sewage control system in Queensland, Australia.&lt;ref name=SlayMiller&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slay|first1=J.|last2=Miller|first2=M.|title=Critical infrastructure protection|date=November 2007|publisher=Springer Boston|isbn=978-0-387-75461-1|pages=73–82|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m1100j53q348x053/|edition=Online-Ausg.|accessdate=2 May 2012|chapter=Chpt 6: Lessons Learned from the Maroochy Water Breach}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after a contractor installed a SCADA system in January 2000, system components began to function erratically. Pumps did not run when needed and alarms were not reported.  More critically, sewage flooded a nearby park and contaminated an open surface-water drainage ditch and flowed 500 meters to a tidal canal. The SCADA system was directing sewage valves to open when the design protocol should have kept them closed. Initially this was believed to be a system bug.  Monitoring of the system logs revealed the malfunctions were the result of cyber attacks. Investigators reported 46 separate instances of malicious outside interference before the culprit was identified.  The attacks were made by a disgruntled ex-employee of the company that had installed the SCADA system.  The ex-employee was hoping to be hired by the utility full-time to maintain the system.

In April 2008, the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack issued a Critical Infrastructures Report  which discussed the extreme vulnerability of SCADA systems to an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) event. After testing and analysis, the Commission concluded: "SCADA systems are vulnerable to an EMP event. The large numbers and widespread reliance on such systems by all of the Nation’s critical infrastructures represent a systemic threat to their continued operation following an EMP event. Additionally, the necessity to reboot, repair, or replace large numbers of geographically widely dispersed systems will considerably impede the Nation’s recovery from such an assault."&lt;ref name="Critical Infrastructures Report, Congressional EMP Commission, 2008"&gt;http://www.empcommission.org/docs/A2473-EMP_Commission-7MB.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vendors of SCADA and control products have begun to address the risks posed by unauthorized access by developing lines of specialized industrial [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[VPN]] solutions for TCP/IP-based SCADA networks as well as external SCADA monitoring and recording equipment.&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!-- Removed Vendor Advertisement, replaced with neutral tone --&gt;&lt;!--Removed Marketing Magazine article, you can add it as a reference at the bottom to support a set of statements--&gt;
The [[International Society of Automation]] (ISA) started formalizing SCADA security requirements in 2007 with a working group, WG4. WG4 "deals specifically with unique technical requirements, measurements, and other features required to evaluate and assure security resilience and performance of industrial automation and control systems devices".&lt;ref name=InTechViaISA&gt;{{cite news|title=Security for all|url=http://www.isa.org|accessdate=2 May 2012|newspaper=InTech|authorlink=Security for all|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased interest in SCADA vulnerabilities has resulted in vulnerability researchers discovering vulnerabilities in commercial SCADA software &lt;!-- removed vendor names --&gt; and more general offensive SCADA techniques presented to the general security community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |title=SCADA Security – Generic Electric Grid Malware Design |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107085040/http://www.c4-security.com/SCADA%20Security%20-%20Generic%20Electric%20Grid%20Malware%20Design%20-%20SyScan08.pps |archivedate=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- citations as support of the statements are fine --&gt; In electric and gas utility SCADA systems, the vulnerability of the large installed base of wired and wireless serial communications links is addressed in some cases by applying [[bump-in-the-wire]] devices that employ authentication and [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] encryption rather than replacing all existing nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal   | author = KEMA, Inc.

In June 2010, anti-virus security company [[VirusBlokAda]] reported the first detection of malware that attacks SCADA systems (Siemens' [[WinCC]]/PCS 7 systems) running on Windows operating systems. The malware is called [[Stuxnet]] and uses four [[zero-day attack]]s to install a [[rootkit]] which in turn logs into the SCADA's database and steals design and control files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-27080_3-20011159-245.html|title=Details of the first-ever control system malware (FAQ)|last=Mills|first=Elinor|date=21 July 2010|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.automation.siemens.com/WW/llisapi.dll?func=cslib.csinfo&amp;lang=en&amp;objid=43876783&amp;caller=view|title=SIMATIC WinCC / SIMATIC PCS 7: Information concerning Malware / Virus / Trojan|date=21 July 2010|publisher=[[Siemens]]|quote=malware (trojan) which affects the visualization system WinCC SCADA.|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The malware is also capable of changing the control system and hiding those changes.

The '''satire boom''' is a general term to describe the emergence of a generation of English [[satirical]] writers, journalists and performers at the end of the 1950s. The  satire boom is often regarded as having begun with the first performance of ''[[Beyond the Fringe]]'' on 22 August 1960 and ending around December 1963 with the cancellation of the TV show ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''. The figures most closely identified with it are [[Peter Cook]], [[John Bird (actor)|John Bird]], [[John Fortune]], [[David Frost]], [[Bernard Levin]] and [[Richard Ingrams]]. Many of the figures who found initial celebrity through the satire boom went on to establish subsequently more serious careers as writers including [[Alan Bennett]] ([[drama]]), [[Jonathan Miller]] ([[polymath]]ic), and [[Paul Foot (journalist)|Paul Foot]] ([[investigative journalism]]).

In his book ''The Neophiliacs'' [[Christopher Booker]], who as a founding editor of ''[[Private Eye]]'' was a central figure of the satire boom, charts the years  1959 to 1964. He begins with the [[Cambridge Footlights]] student [[revue]] ''The Last Laugh'' written by Bird and Cook. It transferred to a [[West End theatre]]. Booker ends the period with the cancellation of the television series ''That Was The Week That Was'', and the closing  of the [[The Establishment (club)|Establishment]] Club.

The boom was driven by well-connected graduates from first the [[University of Cambridge]], and then the [[University of Oxford]]. Booker argues that, with the response to the [[Suez Crisis]] which effectively marked the end of the [[British Empire]] as a [[great power]], an [[upper middle class]] generation with [[independent school (UK)|public school]] and Oxbridge educations who had grown up with certain expectations &amp;mdash; of following a career in colonial administration or the [[British Civil Service|civil service]] &amp;mdash; suddenly found themselves surplus. Peter Cook had already entered for a [[Foreign Office]] entrance exam, before his stage career took off. At the same time the emergence of the "[[angry young men]]" and "[[kitchen sink realism]]" in drama were signs that the democratisation of British culture was increasingly dominated by the concerns of the "common man". The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was proving to be an ineffective opposition to a [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Conservative government.{{cn|date=March 2017}} The satire-boom generation were in general apolitical or had (at that time) left-of-centre tendencies.

In [[computer science]], '''synchronization''' refers to one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of [[Process (computer science)|processes]], and synchronization of [[Dataset|data]]. ''Process synchronization'' refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or [[Handshaking|handshake]] at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. ''[[Data synchronization]]'' refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain [[data integrity]]. Process synchronization primitives are commonly used to implement data synchronization.

== The need for synchronization ==
The need for synchronization does not arise merely in multi-processor systems but for any kind of concurrent processes; even in single processor systems. Mentioned below are some of the main needs for synchronization:

''[[Fork-join model|Forks and Joins]]:'' When a job arrives at a fork point, it is split into N sub-jobs which are then serviced by n tasks. After being serviced, each sub-job waits until all other sub-jobs are done processing. Then, they are joined again and leave the system. Thus, in parallel programming, we require synchronization as all the parallel processes wait for several other processes to occur.

''[[Producer–consumer problem|Producer-Consumer:]]'' In a producer-consumer relationship, the consumer process is dependent on the producer process till the necessary data has been produced.

''Exclusive use resources:'' When multiple processes are dependent on a resource and they need to access it at the same time the operating system needs to ensure that only one processor accesses it at a given point in time.This reduces  concurrency.

==Thread or process synchronization==
[[File:Multiple Processes Accessing the shared resource.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Three processes accessing a shared resource ([[critical section]]) simultaneously.]]

Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent [[process (computer science)|processes]] or [[thread (computer science)|threads]] do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as [[critical section]]. Processes' access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques. When one thread starts executing the [[critical section]] (serialized segment of the program) the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes. If proper synchronization techniques&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not applied, it may cause a [[race condition#Software|race condition]] where the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of [[context switch]]es of the processes or threads.

For example, suppose that there are three processes, namely 1, 2, and 3. All three of them are concurrently executing, and they need to share a common resource (critical section) as shown in Figure 1. Synchronization should be used here to avoid any conflicts for accessing this shared resource. Hence, when Process 1 and 2 both try to access that resource, it should be assigned to only one process at a time.  If it is assigned to Process 1, the other process (Process 2) needs to wait until Process 1 frees that resource (as shown in Figure 2).

[[File:Shared Resource access in synchronization environment.png|thumb|'''Figure 2''': A process accessing a shared resource if available, based on some synchronization technique.]]

Another synchronization requirement which needs to be considered is the order in which particular processes or threads should be executed. For example, we cannot board a plane until we buy a ticket.  Similarly, we cannot check e-mails without validating our credentials (i.e., user name and password). In the same way, an ATM will not provide any service until we provide it with a correct PIN.

Other than mutual exclusion, synchronization also deals with the following:
* [[deadlock]], which occurs when many processes are waiting for a shared resource (critical section) which is being held by some other process. In this case, the processes just keep waiting and execute no further;
* [[Resource starvation|starvation]], which occurs when a process is waiting to enter the critical section, but other processes monopolize the critical section, and the first process is forced to wait indefinitely;
* [[priority inversion]], which occurs when a high-priority process is in the critical section, and it is interrupted by a medium-priority process. This violation of priority rules can happen under certain circumstances and may lead to serious consequences in real-time systems;
* [[busy waiting]], which occurs when a process frequently polls to determine if it has access to a critical section. This frequent polling robs processing time from other processes.

==Minimizing synchronization==
One of the challenges for exascale algorithm design is to minimize or reduce synchronization. 
Synchronization takes more time than computation, especially in distributed computing. Reducing synchronization drew attention from computer scientists for decades. Whereas it becomes an increasingly significant problem recently as the gap between the improvement of computing and latency increases. Experiments have shown that (global) communications due to synchronization on a distributed computers takes a dominated share in a sparse iterative solver.&lt;ref&gt;

===Classic problems of synchronization===
The following are some classic problems of synchronization:
* [[Producer–consumer problem|The Producer–Consumer Problem]] (also called The Bounded Buffer Problem);
* [[Readers–writers problem|The Readers–Writers Problem]];
* [[Dining philosophers problem|The Dining Philosophers Problem]].

These problems are used to test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme or primitive.

===Hardware synchronization===
Many systems provide hardware support for [[critical section]] code.

A single processor or [[uniprocessor system]] could disable [[interrupt]]s by executing currently running code without [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]], which is very inefficient on [[Multiprocessing|multiprocessor]] systems.&lt;ref name="Wiley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=July 11, 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-0-470-12872-5|edition=Eighth|chapter=Chapter 6: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The key ability we require to implement synchronization in a multiprocessor is a set of hardware primitives with the ability to atomically read and modify a memory location. Without such a capability, the cost of building basic synchronization primitives will be too high and will increase as the processor count increases. There are a number of alternative formulations of the basic hardware primitives, all of which provide the ability to atomically read and modify a location, together with some way to tell if the read and write were performed atomically. These hardware primitives are the basic building blocks that are used to build a wide variety of user-level synchronization operations, including things such as [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] and [[Barrier (computer science)|barriers]]. In general, architects do not expect users to employ the basic hardware primitives, but instead expect that the primitives will be used by system programmers to build a synchronization library, a process that is often complex and tricky."&lt;ref name="Morgan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennessy|first1=John L.|last2=Patterson|first2=David A.|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|date=September 30, 2011|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-123-83872-8|edition=Fifth|chapter=Chapter 5: Thread-Level Parallelism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instructions by either [[test-and-set]] the memory word or [[compare-and-swap]] contents of two memory words.

===Synchronization strategies in programming languages===
In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors, blocks of code are wrapped into '''synchronized''' ''(lock_object)'' sections. This forces any thread to acquire the said lock object before it can execute the block. The lock is automatically released when the thread which acquired the lock, and is then executing the block, leaves the block or enters the waiting state within the block. Any variable updates, made by a thread in a synchronized block, become visible to other threads when they similarly acquire the lock and execute the block.

Java ''synchronized'' blocks, in addition to enabling mutual exclusion and memory consistency,  enable signaling—i.e., sending events from threads which have acquired the lock and are executing the code block to those which are waiting for the lock within the block. This means that Java synchronized sections combine functionality of mutexes and events. Such primitive is known as [[Monitor (synchronization)|synchronization monitor]].

Any object may be used as a lock/monitor in Java. The declaring object is a lock object when the whole method is marked with ''synchronized''.

The [[.NET framework]] has synchronization primitives. "Synchronization is designed to be cooperative, demanding that every thread or process follow the synchronization mechanism before accessing protected resources (critical section) for consistent results." In .NET, locking, signaling, lightweight synchronization types, spinwait and interlocked operations are some of mechanisms related to synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronization Primitives in .NET framework|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228964%28v=vs.110%29.aspx|website=MSDN, The Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation of Synchronization ===

==== Spinlock ====
{{Main article|Spinlock}}
Another effective way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor checks a flag. If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is set (locked), the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep checking if the flag is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise it can lead to performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Embedded Software Development with ECos|last=Massa|first=Anthony|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2003|isbn=0- 13-035473-2|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barriers ====
{{Main article|Barrier (computer science)}}
Barriers are simple to implement and provide good responsiveness. They are based on the concept of implementing wait cycles to provide synchronization. Consider three threads running simultaneously, starting from barrier 1. After time t, thread1 reaches barrier 2 but it still has to wait for thread 2 and 3 to reach barrier2 as it does not have the correct data. Once all the threads reach barrier 2 they all start again. After time t, thread 1 reaches barrier3 but it will have to wait for threads 2 and 3 and the correct data again.

Thus, in barrier synchronization of multiple threads there will always be a few threads that will end up waiting for other threads as in the above example thread 1 keeps waiting for thread 2 and 3. This results in severe degradation of the process performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meng, Chen, Pan, Yao, Wu|first=Jinglei, Tianzhou, Ping, Jun. Minghui|date=2014|title=A speculative mechanism for barrier sychronization|url=|journal=2014 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), 2014 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS) and 2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems (ICESS)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier synchronization wait function for i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; thread can be represented as:

(Wbarrier)i = f ((Tbarrier)i, (Rthread)i)

Where Wbarrier is the wait time for a thread, Tbarrier is the number of threads has arrived, and Rthread is the arrival rate of threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.

Experiments show that 34% of the total execution time is spent in waiting for other slower threads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Semaphores ====
{{Main article|Semaphore (programming)}}
Semaphores are signalling mechanisms which can allow one or more threads/processors to access a section. A Semaphore has a flag which has a certain fixed value associated with it and each time a thread wishes to access the section, it decrements the flag. Similarly, when the thread leaves the section, the flag is incremented. If the flag is zero, the thread cannot access the section and gets blocked if it chooses to wait.

Some semaphores would allow only one thread or process in the code section. Such Semaphores are called binary semaphore and are very similar to Mutex. Here, if the value of semaphore is 1, the thread is allowed to access and if the value is 0, the access is denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems|last=Li, Yao|first=Qing, Carolyn|publisher=CMP Books|year=2003|isbn=1578201241|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical foundations ===
Synchronization was originally a process-based concept whereby a lock could be obtained on an object. Its primary usage was in databases. There are two types of (file) [[File locking|lock]]; read-only and read–write. Read-only locks may be obtained by many processes or threads. Readers–writer locks are exclusive, as they may only be used by a single process/thread at a time.

Although locks were derived for file databases, data is also shared in memory between processes and threads. Sometimes more than one object (or file) is locked at a time. If they are not locked simultaneously they can overlap, causing a deadlock exception.

[[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] only have exclusive locks because they are thread based and rely on the [[compare-and-swap]] processor instruction.

An abstract mathematical foundation for synchronization primitives is given by the [[history monoid]]. There are also many higher-level theoretical devices, such as [[process calculi]] and [[Petri net]]s, which can be built on top of the history monoid.

===Synchronization examples===
Following are some synchronization examples with respect to different platforms.&lt;ref name="Wiley2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=December 7, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-1-118-06333-0|edition=Ninth|chapter=Chapter 5: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Synchronization in Windows====
[[Windows]] provides:
* [[Interrupt|interrupt masks]], which protect access to global resources (critical section) on uniprocessor systems;
* [[spinlock]]s, which prevent, in multiprocessor systems, spinlocking-thread from being preempted;
* [[dispatcher]]s, which act like [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]es, [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], [[Event (computing)|event]]s, and [[timer]]s.

====Synchronization in Linux====
[[Linux]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[spinlock]];
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s
* [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]
* [[readers–writer lock]]s, for the longer section of codes which are accessed very frequently but don't change very often.
* [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/|title=What is RCU, Fundamentally? [LWN.net]|author=|date=|website=lwn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enabling and disabling of kernel preemption replaced spinlocks on uniprocessor systems. Prior to kernel version 2.6, [[Linux]] disabled interrupt to implement short critical sections. Since version 2.6 and later, Linux is fully preemptive.

====Synchronization in Solaris====
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[condition variable]]s;
* [[adaptive mutex]]es, binary semaphores that are implemented differently depending upon the conditions;
* readers–writer locks:
* [[turnstiles]], queue of threads which are waiting on acquired lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-08-1999/swol-08-insidesolaris.html|title=Turnstiles and priority inheritance - SunWorld - August 1999|first=Jim|last=Mauro|date=|website=sunsite.uakom.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pthreads synchronization====
[[Pthreads]] is a platform-independent [[API]] that provides:
* mutexes;
* condition variables;
* readers–writer locks;
* spinlocks;
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s.

==Data synchronization ==
{{main article|Data synchronization}}
[[File:Data Synchronization.png|thumb|'''Figure 3: '''Changes from both server and client(s) are synchronized.]]

A distinctly different (but related) concept is that of [[data synchronization]]. This refers to the need to keep multiple copies of a set of data coherent with one another or to maintain [[data integrity]], Figure 3. For example, database replication is used to keep multiple copies of data synchronized with database servers that store data in different locations.

Examples include:
* [[File synchronization]], such as syncing a hand-held MP3 player to a desktop computer;
* [[Cluster file system]]s, which are [[file system]]s that maintain data or indexes in a coherent fashion across a whole [[computing cluster]];
* [[Cache coherency]], maintaining multiple copies of data in sync across multiple [[cache (computing)|cache]]s;
* [[RAID]], where data is written in a redundant fashion across multiple disks, so that the loss of any one disk does not lead to a loss of data;
* [[Database replication]], where copies of data on a [[database]] are kept in sync, despite possible large geographical separation;
* [[Journaling file system|Journaling]], a technique used by many modern file systems to make sure that file metadata are updated on a disk in a coherent, consistent manner.

===Challenges in data synchronization===
Some of the challenges which user may face in data synchronization:
* data formats complexity;
* real-timeliness;
* data security;
* data quality;
* performance.

==== Data formats complexity ====
Data formats tend to grow more complex with time as the organization grows and evolves. This results not only in building simple interfaces between the two applications (source and target), but also in a need to transform the data while passing them to the target application. [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] (extraction transformation loading) tools can be helpful at this stage for managing data format complexities.

====Real-timeliness====
In real-time systems, customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery—a real time parcel tracking—, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.

====Data security====
There are no fixed rules and policies to enforce data security. It may vary depending on the system which you are using. Even though the security is maintained correctly in the source system which captures the data, the security and information access privileges must be enforced on the target systems as well to prevent any potential misuse of the information. This is a serious issue and particularly when it comes for handling secret, confidential and personal information. So because of the sensitivity and confidentiality, data transfer and all in-between information must be encrypted.

====Data quality====
Data quality is another serious constraint. For better management and to maintain good quality of data, the common practice is to store the data at one location and share with different people and different systems and/or applications from different locations. It helps in preventing inconsistencies in the data.

====Performance====  
There are five different phases involved in the data synchronization process:
* [[data extraction]] from the source (or master, or main) system;
* [[data transfer]];
* [[data transformation]];
* data load to the target system.
* data updation

Each of these steps is critical. In case of large amounts of data, the synchronization process needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid any negative impact on performance.

'''Synthetic morphology''' is a sub-discipline of the broader field of [[synthetic biology]].

In standard [[synthetic biology]], artificial [[gene networks]] are introduced into [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s, inputs (e.g. chemicals, light) are applied to those networks, and the networks perform logical operations on them and output the result of the operation as the activity of an [[enzyme]] or as the amount of [[green fluorescent protein]]. Using this approach, synthetic biologists have demonstrated the ability of their gene networks to perform [[Boolean logic|Boolean]] [[computation]], to hold a memory, and to generate pulses and [[oscillation]]. 

Synthetic morphology extends this idea by adding output modules that alter the shape or social behaviour of cells in response to the state of the artificial gene network. For example, instead of just making a fluorescent protein, a [[gene network]] may switch on an [[adhesion molecule]] so that cells stick to each other, or activate a [[motility]] system so that cells move. It has been argued that the formation of properly-shaped tissues by mammalian cells involves mainly a set of about ten basic cellular events (cell proliferation, cell death, cell adhesion, differential adhesion, cell de-adhesion, cell fusion, cell locomotion, chemotaxis, haptotaxis, cell wedging).&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;Davies JA (2008) Synthetic morphology: prospects for engineered, self-constructing anatomies. J Anat. 2008 Jun;212(6):707-19. {{PMID|18510501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly similar lists exist for tissues of plants, fungi etc. In principle, therefore, a fairly small set of output modules might allow biotechnologists to 'program' cells to produce artificially-designed arrangements, shapes and eventually 'tissues'. 

The term synthetic morphology was introduced to the [[peer review]]ed scientific literature in 2008 &lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; and is now becoming more widely used both in peer-reviewed literature &lt;ref name="Tanaka"&gt;Tanaka H, Yi TM (2009) Synthetic morphology using alternative inputs. PLoS One. 2009 Sep 10;4(9):e6946. {{PMID|19746161}}&lt;/ref&gt; and texts.&lt;ref name="Meyer"&gt;Meyer, Meyer, Handschel, Wiesmann (2009) Fundamentals of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine.

===Environmental Litigation===

====Kanhar Dam====

Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan exposed the illegalities in environment clearance and forest clearance surrounding the controversial Kanhar Dam Project in [[Sonbhadra district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] on [[Kanhar River]]. The information collected by Vindhya Bachao using [[Right to Information Act, 2005]] was the basis of challenging the construction of the dam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/kanhar-project-in-up-another-unwanted-dam/ |title=Kanhar Project in UP: Another unwanted dam |publisher=South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, 29 December 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryasia.com/magazines/conservation/10065-neglected-and-unprotected.html |title=Neglected And Unprotected |publisher= Sanctuary Asia  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Vindhya Bachao and [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] challenged the project in [[National Green Tribunal Act|National Green Tribunal]], New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/articles/abandoned-dams-abandoned-people |title=Abandoned dams; abandoned people |publisher= India Water Portal, 19 May 2015 |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/why-villagers-protesting-against-up-dam-project-are-living-in-fear/story-uKHKOyg0lPP7qS1W167tlN.html |title=Why villagers protesting against UP dam project are living in fear |publisher= Hindustan Times, 17 May 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of the dam was thereafter stayed by the National Green Tribunal in December, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naidunia.jagran.com/chhattisgarh/raipur-kanhar-dam-making-start-in-chhattisgarh-border-279906-1|title=छत्तीसगढ़ सीमा पर संगीनों के साए में कनहर बांध का निर्माण | publisher=Nai Duniya, 3 January 2015 |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/uttar-pradesh-police-opens-fire-on-antikanhar-dam-protestors-49391 |title=Uttar Pradesh police opens fire on anti-Kanhar dam protestors | publisher= Down to Earth, 14 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theecologist.org/News/news_round_up/2831366/india_police_shoot_eight_indigenous_protestors_against_illegal_dam.html |title=India: police shoot eight indigenous protestors against illegal dam | publisher= The Ecologist, 15 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]] of [[Chhattisgarh]] government in April 2015 took note of the irregularities highlighted by Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan and asked the Uttar Pradesh government to stop the construction until the survey and compensation for the affected villages are completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmo.cg.gov.in/hindi/user/News_Updates.aspx?guid=4486 |title=Chhattisgarh farmers' interests will be protected: Dr.Raman Singh : Kanhar dam construction on Uttar Pradesh border | publisher= The Chief Minister's Office, Chhattisgarh, 30 April 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Green Tribunal passed its final judgement on 7 May 2015 staying any new construction to be undertaken but allowed the construction already underway. The court also formed a high-level committee under chairmanship of [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]], Uttar Pradesh to report on the directions issued in the judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greentribunal.gov.in/Writereaddata/Downloads/521-2014(PB-I-Judg)OA7-5-2015.pdf |title= Final Judgment: Om Dutt Singh &amp; Anr versus State of U.P. &amp; Ors | publisher= National Green Tribunal Website, 7 May 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/kanhar-project-ngt-lets-work-on-continue-stays-new-construction-115050701276_1.html |title=Kanhar project: NGT lets work on continue, stays new construction. | publisher= Business Standard, 7 May 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/lucknow/kanhar-irrigation-project-a-lot-invested-cant-stop-work-now-says-ngt/ |title=Kanhar Irrigation Project: A lot invested, can’t stop work now, says NGT| publisher= Indian Express, 8 May 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members filed a review petition against the judgment passed by the Tribunal, following which the court gave a direction on 7 July 2015 that ''This Application is disposed of with an observation that upon filing of the report by High Power Committee; constituted under the Judgment of the Tribunal, the Tribunal will pass further directions after hearing the parties in regard to all matters as mentioned in the Judgment including Environmental Clearance and Forest Clearance.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greentribunal.gov.in/Writereaddata/Downloads/14-2015(PB-I)RA7-7-2015.pdf |title= Order: Om Dutt Singh &amp; Anr versus State of U.P. &amp; Ors | publisher= National Green Tribunal Website, 7 July 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribunal through its order dated 21 September 2015 issued a show cause notice to the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, Uttar Pradesh for not submitting the report within the deadline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greentribunal.gov.in/Writereaddata/Downloads/14-2015(PB-I)OA21-9-2015.pdf |title= Order: Om Dutt Singh &amp; Anr versus State of U.P. &amp; Ors | publisher= National Green Tribunal Website, 21 September 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one of the article published by Vindhya Bachao Abhiyan on its portal in December, 2015 states that the petitioners are unsatisfied with the report submitted by the committee and alleged that the State government is violating the judgment passed by the Tribunal in its 7 May 2015 order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vindhyabachao.org/activities/environment/272-kanhar-dam-petitioners-unsatisfied-by-the-high-level-committee-report-ngt-calls-pccf-u-p-to-present-before-court |title= Kanhar Dam: Petitioners Unsatisfied with the High Level Committee Report, NGT calls PCCF-U.P. to present before court| publisher= Vindhya Bachao Website, 10 December 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private Limited since the year 2013. In a site visit report published by Vindhya Bachao in September, 2013 it was claimed that the project proponent concealed the information on the presence of forests and several Schedule I species under [[Wildlife Protection Act, 1972]] in the [[Environmental impact assessment|EIA]] Report it submitted to the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)]]. In 2013 it was reported by [[Down to Earth (magazine)|Down to Earth]] that the plan was "mired in controversy following allegations that the company concealed information about the presence of forestland and endangered wildlife at the project site. The farmers in the region have also been protesting against the project, alleging the company bought land for the project by cheating them." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/did-welspun-fudge-facts-for-its-coalfired-power-plant-in-mirzapur--42768 |title= Did Welspun fudge facts for its coal-fired power plant in Mirzapur?| publisher= Down to Earth, 20 November 2013  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debadityo Sinha, founder of VENHF in his articles claimed that the project will be a threat to river Ganga and the upper Khajuri Reservoir for drinking and irrigation. It was apprehended that the project if comes into existence will also threat a historic waterfall of Mirzapur known as Wyndham Fall and will also jeopardise the drinking water supply of the newly established [[Rajiv Gandhi South campus]] of [[Banaras Hindu University]]. He also made an allegation that the Public Hearing process for the project was greatly compromised and local people were prohibited from entering the public hearing premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sandrp.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/water-for-power-irrigation-dam-to-be-used-for-thermal-power-drinking-water-supply-of-bhu-agriculture-and-existence-of-waterfalls-at-risk/ |title= Water for Power: Irrigation Dam to be Used for Thermal Power- Drinking Water Supply of BHU, Agriculture, and Existence of Waterfalls at Risk| publisher= South Asia Network on Dams Rivers and People, 20 March 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejolt.org/2014/08/power-play-at-a-thermal-power-plant-in-mirzapur/ |title= Power play at a Thermal Power Plant in Mirzapur| publisher= EJOLT, 21 August 2014  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a research paper published by VENHF in an international open source scientific journal ''Present Environment and Sustainable Development'' of [[Walter de Gruyter]] in its October, 2015 edition, the land use land cover map of the project site submitted by the company is contradicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/pesd.2015.9.issue-2/pesd-2015-0031/pesd-2015-0031.xml?format=INT|title= Geospatial Technology In Environmental Impact Assessments – Retrospective| publisher= Present Environment and Sustainable Development-Walter de Gruyter 18 October 2015  |date= |accessdate=2015-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4192">'''Willi Apel''' (October 10, 1893 &amp;ndash; March 14, 1988) was a [[German-American]] [[musicologist]] and noted author of a number of books devoted to [[music]].

Apel was born in [[Chojnice|Konitz]], [[West Prussia]], now Chojnice in [[Poland]]. He studied mathematics from 1912 to 1914, and then again after [[World War I]] from 1918 to 1922, in various universities in [[Weimar Republic|Weimar Germany]]. Throughout his studies, he had an interest in music and taught piano lessons. He then turned to music full-time, and essentially taught himself about musicology. He received his Ph.D. in 1936 in [[Berlin]] (with a dissertation on 15th and 16th century tonality) and immigrated to the USA the same year. He taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] from 1938 to 1942, but moved on to spend twenty years at [[Indiana University]] beginning in 1950. In 1972 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the university.

Apel's work of the 1940s included books of broad scope, such as the [[Harvard Dictionary of Music]] (1944), which he edited, and [[Historical Anthology of Music]] (1949, co-authored with [[Archibald Thompson Davison]]). His approach was to give as much attention to Medieval, Renaissance and world music as was given to familiar subjects such as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]; this influenced the higher music education in the USA. His book on the [[Musical notation|notation]] of early polyphonic music was also written in the 1940s, and still serves as one of the essential works on the subject.

In 1950 Apel's interest in early polyphonic notation resulted in an important edition, ''French Secular Music of the Late Fourteenth Century''. In 1958 he published a large work on [[plainchant]], which provided a comprehensive guide of the repertoire and its sources. In early 1960s he founded the Corpus of Early Keyboard Music (CEKM), a series of editions devoted to early keyboard music. Over the years, CEKM presented the music of less known composers such as [[Johann Ulrich Steigleder]], [[Bernardo Storace]], [[Peeter Cornet]], and others, and also included modern editions of various important manuscripts such as the 16th century [[Jan z Lublina]] [[tablature]]. Apel was the general editor for CEKM and edited a total of ten volumes; his pupils provided dozens more.

1967 saw the publication of ''Geschichte der Orgel- und Klaviermusik'', a large work on the history of keyboard music. An English translation (by Hans Tischler) appeared in 1972. Apel's last book was a collection of essays from 1973&amp;ndash;81, all dedicated to Italian violin music of the 17th century.

Willi Apel died at age 94 in [[Bloomington, Indiana]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3431">The '''Zutistes''' or the '''Circle of Poets Zutiques''' was an informal group of French poets, painters and musicians who met at the Hôtel des Étrangers, at the corner of rue Racine and rue de l'École-de -Medicine, in Paris from September to October 1871.

==Background==

The Zutistes were a fringe spin-off from a splinter group of [[Parnassianism|Parnassians]], known as the "Nasty Fellows" or "Villains Bonshommes",&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; who formed a Parisian dining club at the close of the 1860s. Without having a formal manifesto, and taking their name from the French exclamation of baffled exasperation, ''Zut'',&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129n&lt;/ref&gt; this informal gathering of artists known as the Zutistes gathered around the figure of the pianist [[Ernest Cabaner]], who worked as a bartender/piano player at the hotel.  Anarchic in spirit, they looked back regretfully to the atmosphere of the recently overthrown [[Paris Commune]].&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant figure in the circle was [[Charles Cros]], while other members were later better known, like [[Verlaine]] and [[Rimbaud]].

The most significant trace of the movement came with the re-discovery in the Thirties of the Zutique Album, with some 101 literary entries accompanied by (sometimes pornographic) drawings.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Album==

Shot through with black humour, and riddled with parody and pastiche of contemporary styles and attitudes,&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the album is the best guide to the Circle's membership of some fourteen names.

A central target of the Album's mockery was the recently successful Parnassian [[Francois Coppee]], while other more established figures like [[José-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leconte de Lisle]] were also in the line of fire.&lt;ref&gt;J Austin, ''Proust, Pastiche and the Postmodern'' (2013) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

This album is in the form of an in-quarto Italian, black hardback cover, about thirty sheets handwritten, the other pages remained blank.

==Aftermath==
Nostalgia for the circle persisted among its members long after its break-up, perhaps as early as the winter of 1871–1872: thus for example the young Zutiste [[Raoul Ponchon]] was one of only seven recipients of Rimbaud's ''[[A Season in Hell]]'';&lt;ref&gt;G Robb, ''Rimbaud'' (London 2001) p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Cros in 1883 used "zutique" to name  a new poetry circle; while (perhaps coincidentally) as late as in 1897 the claim would be made that "man is by nature essentially 'zutique'".&lt;ref&gt;Anon, quoted in S Whidden, ''Authority in Crisis in French Literature'' (2016) p 64&lt;/ref&gt;
