[[File:Akademie der künste berlin.JPG|thumb|320px|Academy of Arts, [[Pariser Platz]] 4 in [[Berlin]], opened 2005, architect [[Günter Behnisch]]]]
The '''Academy of Arts''' ({{lang-de|Akademie der Künste}}) is a state arts institution in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The task of the Academy is to promote art, as well as to advise and support the [[states of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Akademie der Künste: About |publisher=ARTINFO |year=2008 |url=http://www.artinfo.com/galleryguide/13365/1879/about/akademie-der-knste-berlin/ |accessdate=2008-07-24 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy's predecessor organization was founded in 1696 by Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III of Brandenburg]] as the [[Prussian Academy of Arts|Brandenburg Academy of Arts]], an [[learned society|academic institution]] in which members could meet and discuss and share ideas. The current Academy was founded on 1 October 1993 as the re-unification of formerly separate [[East Berlin|East]] and [[West Berlin]] academies.

==Membership==
The Academy is an incorporated body of the public right under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.  New members are nominated by secret ballot of the general assembly, and appointed by the president with membership never to exceed 500.

The academy‘s recent presidents include:
* [[Adolf Muschg]] – (2003–2006)
* [[Klaus Staeck]] – (2006–2015)
* [[Jeanine Meerapfel]] – (2015– )&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeanine Meerapfel elected new president of Berlin Academy of the Arts|url=http://www.epa.eu/arts-culture-and-entertainment-photos/culture-general-arts-general-photos/jeanine-meerapfel-elected-new-president-of-berlin-academy-of-the-arts-photos-51967165|website=european pressphoto agency|accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
* Representation of Germany in the fields of arts and culture
* Promotion of arts
* To advocate arts within the society
* To advance national cultural developments
* Preservation of the national cultural heritage
* Advice to the Federal Republic of Germany in terms of arts and culture

==History==
{{Main|Prussian Academy of Arts}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P049294, Berlin, Akademie der Künste.jpg|thumb|Palais Armin, seat of the Academy of Arts 1907–1938]]
Beginning in the 1690s, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] Academy of Arts, under various names, served as an [[arts council]] and [[learned society]] for the Prussian government. Founded by the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] elector Frederick III ([[King in Prussia]] from 1701), it was the third-oldest such academy in Europe. The institution was housed on No. 8 [[Unter den Linden]], until from 1902 the site was cleared and rebuilt as seat of the [[Berlin State Library]]. The Academy then moved to [[Pariser Platz]] next to [[Hotel Adlon]], where the Palais Arnim, former residence of Prime Minister [[Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg]], was refurbished according to plans designed by [[Ernst von Ihne]].

The Academy also served as a training school since its founding, and created a number of affiliated schools.  The first was the [[Bauakademie]] for architectural training, founded in 1799. The academic arm was fully separated in 1931 and developed into the present-day [[Berlin University of the Arts]] (''Universität der Künste Berlin''). In 1938 the academy building was seized by Hitler's chief architect [[Albert Speer]] to evolve his ''[[Welthauptstadt Germania]]'' plans; temporarily relocated to the [[Kronprinzenpalais]], the Prussian Academy ultimately ceased operations in 1945. 
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-34196-0001, Berlin, Akademie der Künste.jpg|thumb|Akademie der Künste (East), circa 1955, in the ''Kaiserin-Friedrich-Haus'', Robert-Koch-Platz]]
In [[History of Germany (1945–90)|postwar divided Germany]], two parallel organizations took its place. The western successor organization was called the ''Akademie der Künste'', founded in 1954 under President [[Hans Scharoun]], which resided in the rebuilt [[Hansaviertel]] quarter of [[West Berlin]]. The eastern successor organization was founded on March 24, 1950 as the ''Deutsche Akademie der Künste'' in [[East Berlin]] which became the ''Akademie der Künste der DDR'' in 1972, then the ''Akademie der Künste zu Berlin'' in 1990. Its presidents included [[Arnold Zweig]], [[Ludwig Renn]], [[Johannes R. Becher]], [[Otto Nagel]], [[Willi Bredel]], [[Konrad Wolf]], [[Manfred Wekwerth]] and [[Heiner Müller]].

These two were merged on 1 October 1993 into the present-day academy, which took its seat in a new building at the former location on Pariser Platz.

[[File:Portraits of the three engravers of Fuchs' 'De Historia...' Wellcome L0035316.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Heinrich Füllmauer, Albrecht Meyer, and Veit Rudolf Speckle]]
'''Albrecht Meyer''' also known as '''Albertus Meyer''' in Latinised form, was a botanical illustrator noted for his more than 500 plant images in [[Leonhart Fuchs]]'s epic pre-Linnean publication of 1542, ''[[De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes]]'', published in Latin and Greek, and almost immediately translated into German. At the time it was regarded as one of the most beautifully illustrated books on plants and a jewel in the crown of [[German Renaissance]].

==Collaborations==
Meyer collaborated with the painter Heinricus Füllmaurer and the engraver Veit Rudolph Speckle (d.12 December 1550 Straßburg) in producing the woodcuts for the book, which, unusually for its time, named the contributing artists and included their portraits. Fuchs, whose herbal had been inspired by [[Brunfels]]'s work "''Herbarum vivae imagines''" which had appeared twelve years earlier, praised the illustrations as having been carried out with 'great diligence and artifice', and went on to state that 'shading and other less crucial things with which painters sometimes strive for artistic glory' had been shunned in order to make the images truer to nature. The book appeared in both coloured and uncoloured versions. Fuchs planned for the illustrations to be coloured and did not want their appearance disfigured by excessive shading. Although some copies of the work were issued as coloured, many were worked on after publication. The text, like that of Brunfels', was taken from ancient authors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/earlynaturalists00mialuoft "Early Naturalists" (1912) - Louis Compton Miall]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Cambridge History of Science" vol3 - Katharine Park, Lorraine Daston&lt;/ref&gt; "De Historia" continued a long tradition of herbals - books describing the medicinal uses of plants - but broke with tradition by using lifelike illustrations rather than the schematic and often fanciful representations.

The remarkably detailed woodcuts include the first published images of over 100 new plants from the Americas, such as pumpkin, marigold, maize, squash, chili peppers and tobacco – native to [[Mexico]] and brought to Europe from the [[New World]]. Leonhart Fuchs was a child prodigy, matriculating from [[Erfurt University]] by the age of twelve, and then obtaining a degree in medicine at [[Ingolstadt]]. He rendered outstanding medical service during the 1529 [[Sweating sickness#1528|Sweating Sickness plague]]. The illustrations were drawn from nature by Albert Meyer, using mature plants which Fuchs often provided from his garden in [[Tübingen]]. The accuracy of the plates which show the flowers, roots and the plant habit, led to its being used as a reference work by European physicians and many famous herbaria of the sixteenth century, notably that of [[Dodoens]]. [[William Morris]], the English artist and designer, possessed a copy of the book and some of his designs drew inspiration from the plates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Voyages/all-items.htm Smithsonian Institution Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Historia" was published in a German language folio edition a year after the original. The folio editions were bulky and difficult to use, and smaller, pocket editions soon appeared. During Fuchs' lifetime the book went through thirty-nine imprints in Latin, German, French, Spanish and Dutch. The woodblocks were used and copied for a further three hundred years. Fuchs laboured on a greatly expanded version of the work for the final twenty-four years of his life. The manuscript of this work, which was never published, is preserved in the [[Austrian National Library]] and is dubbed the 'Vienna Codex'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/oct2002.html Glasgow University Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425163720/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/oct2002.html |date=2013-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Commons category|Albrecht Meyer}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3936">The '''Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S.''' is a German foundation established in 1931 by the [[Hamburg]] merchant [[Alfred Toepfer]].  The foundation is committed to promoting [[European integration|European unification]] and ensuring cultural diversity and understanding between the countries of [[Europe]].

== History ==

The rich industrialist Alfred Toepfer is considered, by the contemporary historiographic criticism, a controversial figure; philanthropist and lover of the arts, he had a significant role in the culture, politics and economic environment of [[Nazi Germany]] from the 30s until the end of the [[Second World War]]. The activity of Toepfer in between the two World Wars, is well documented by a massive cultural promotion of the ideas of ''common ethics and identity'', obviously symbiotic with [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]]. Toepfer however, after the war, denied any kind of Nazi involvement completely and categorically.&lt;ref&gt;* ''Alfred Toepfer. Stifter und Kaufmann. Bausteine einer Biographie – Kritische Bestandsaufnahme [Alfred Toepfer, Sponsor and Businessman, the Foundations of a Biography – a Critical Appraisal]'', ed. Georg Kreis, Gerd Krumeich, Henri Menudier, Hans Mommsen, Arnold Sywottek, Hamburg 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* ''Alfred Toepfer'' by Jan Zimmermann, published by the ZEIT-Stiftung [ZEIT Foundation] in the series Hamburger Köpfe [Hamburg Heads], Ellert &amp; Richter Verlag [Ellert &amp; Richter Publishers], Hamburg 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The substantial abdication of his politic and ideologic past, is recognised by critics nowadays  in the important range of prizes instituted by the {{Ref_label|A|a|none}} foundation,&lt;ref&gt;* ''Die Kulturpreise der Stiftung F.V.S. 1935-1945 [The Cultural Prizes of the F.V.S.

* The [[Herder Prize]], established in 1963 and named for [[Johann Gottfried von Herder]], is a prestigious international prize, dedicated to the promotion of scientific, art and literature relations, and presented to scholars and artists from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] whose life and work have improved the cultural understanding of European countries and their peaceful interrelations.
* The [[Shakespeare Prize]] was an annual prize for writing or performance awarded to a British citizen.
* The [[Robert Schuman Prize|Robert Schuman Prize for European unity]] was a prize awarded annually in memory of former French Prime Minister, [[Robert Schuman]].{{Ref_label|B|b|none}}

The foundation cooperates also with the most important German universities and renowned cultural associations. The [[Heinrich Tessenow Medal]] is a prestigious architecture prize, created by the Alfred Toepfer Stiftung F.V.S. in 1963 in memoriam of [[Rostock]] architect [[Heinrich Tessenow]]. The prize is annually assigned by the [[Heinrich-Tessenow-Gesellschaft e.V.]] and among the rewardeds are [[Giorgio Grassi]] (1992), [[Juan Navarro Baldeweg]] (1998), [[David Chipperfield]] (1999), [[Eduardo Souto de Moura]] (2001) besides the [[Pritzker Prize]] winners [[Sverre Fehn]] (1997) and [[Peter Zumthor]] (1989).

'''American Poetry Center''' was founded in 1983 to bring the [[Spoken Word]] to a wide range of audiences. All programs were created, developed and implemented by [[Margaret Chew Barringer]], under the auspices of the [[Pennsylvania Council on the Arts]]. For its first decade, [[Jerome J. Shestack|Jerome J. Shestack, Esq.]] chaired the non-profit organization. In 2005, the organization legally changed its name to [[American INSIGHT]] as it prepared to reach new audiences through the latest advances  in all-digital historic archival research, video production techniques, and Internet-based delivery systems.

== Poetry Month ==
American Poetry Center (APC) developed, coordinated and promoted a month-long statewide annual celebration of the Literary Arts across Pennsylvania for over a decade. The festival featured over 1,500 poets and writers at over 900 events in more than 100 cities across the state. Poetry Month has now become [[National Poetry Month]] coordinated by the [[Academy of American Poets]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainlinetoday.com/Main-Line-Today/July-2008/FRONTLINE-Profile|title=History Lesson|work=mainlinetoday.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symposia ==
American Poetry Center produced annual symposia in Philadelphia that attracted national and international media attention, including substantial coverage in all regional newspapers, [[The New York Times]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]. Participating writers included [[E.L. Doctorow]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Susan Sontag]], [[Galway Kinnell]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Grace Paley]], [[Etheridge Knight]], [[Gerald Stern]], [[Czeslaw Milosz]], [[R.D. Laing]], [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Robert Bly]], [[Dennis Brutus]], [[John Ciardi]], [[Marge Piercy]], [[Amy Clampitt]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Robert Hass]], [[Stanley Kunitz]], [[Cynthia Ozick]], [[Donald Hall]] and [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]].

== Soviet Writers Union Exchange ==
APC initiated a six-year cultural exchange program through a Reciprocal Exchange Agreement with the [[USSR Union of Writers]]. Over 100 poets, editors, scholars, and students from Russia and the United States participated in this first-ever exchange, including poets [[Richard Wilbur]], [[John Ashbery]], [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]] and [[Andrei Voznesensky]]. Special receptions and readings were regularly held at the United States Embassies in [[Moscow]] and St. Petersburg, the Governor's Mansion in Harrisburg and the [[National Press Club (United States)|National Press Club]] in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/21/arts/soviet-poets-are-heard-in-philadelphia.html|title=Soviet Poets Are Heard in Philadelphia|date=21 March 1989|work=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Spoken Word ==
APC sponsored dozens of poetry readings in Philadelphia featuring personal appearances by such notable figures as Russia's [[Andrei Voznesensky]], Noble Laureates [[Czeslaw Milosz]] and [[Derek Walcott]] and Canada’s [[Gaston Miron]].

'''Anak Tomb No. 3''' is a [[chamber tomb]] of [[Goguryeo]] located in [[Anak (North Korea)|Anak]], [[South Hwanghae]], [[North Korea]]. It is known for mural paintings and an epitaph. It is part of the [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs]].

It was discovered in 1949 with valuable treasures having been stolen, but murals were kept in good condition.

== Epitaph and its interpretation ==

The Anak Tomb No.3 is one of few Goguryeo tombs that have epitaphs so that their dates can be determined. Its seven-lined epitaph contains the date 357, the personal name Dong Shou (冬壽), his title, his birthplace and his age at death.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[http://www.kaogu.cn/uploads/soft/2014/20140723wangfeifengdongshoumu1.pdf "冬壽墓蓮花紋研究"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113101228/http://www.kaogu.cn/uploads/soft/2014/20140723wangfeifengdongshoumu1.pdf |date=January 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, some scholars generally regard this site as the tomb of Dong Shou.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt; The inscription of Dong Shou relates that he was a general from the Xianbei state of [[Former Yan]] in Liaodong (modern [[Liaoning]], China), who fled to Goguryeo in 336 and was given a position in the former territory of the [[Lelang commandery]].&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK%3D0000594065%26danrak_no%3D%26clss_cd%3D%26top_menu_cd%3D0000000808 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081913/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?PK=0000594065&amp;danrak_no=&amp;clss_cd=&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000808 |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While K. H. J. Gardiner and Wonyong Kim believe this to be a Chinese tomb of excellent quality, North and other South Korean scholars believe that Dong Shou was an emigre official. Moreover, the quality of these paintings and the size of the tomb indicate that it is a royal tomb of Koguryo—a theory advocated recently by Hwi-joon Ahn and Youngsook Pak.&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; North Korean scholars claim that it is the mausoleum of [[King Micheon of Goguryeo|King Micheon]] or [[King Gogugwon of Goguryeo|King Gogugwon]].

The epitaph reflects a complex situation in which Tong Shou, and Goguryeo, were put. He claimed various titles including "Minister of [[Lelang Commandery|Lelang]]" and "Governor of [[Changli Commandery|Changli]], [[Xuantu Commandery|Xuantu]] and [[Daifang Commandery|Daifang]]." It is not clear whether these titles were given by the Eastern Jin or just self-designation. Scholars associate one of his title "Minister of Lelang" with the title "Duke of Lelang", which was bestowed on King Gogugwon by [[Murong Jun]] of the Former Yan in 354.

The murals found in Anak Tomb No. 3 are nearly identical with those in the [[Yuantaizi Tomb]] found in [[Liaoning]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hudong.com/wiki/%E8%A2%81%E5%8F%B0%E5%AD%90%E5%A2%93&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;The Anak Tomb No. 3 is the host to multiple famous mural paintings, each giving a greater insight to the life and hierarchy of the Goguryeo people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://contents.nahf.or.kr/goguryeo/anak3/an_html_en/int1.html|title=contents.nahf.or.kr/goguryeo/anak3/an_html_en/int1.html|website=contents.nahf.or.kr|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains two portraits, one on the front wall of the west side chamber and one on the southern wall, portraying a man and a woman, respectively.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Scholars have disputed the owner of this tomb and thus the identity of people portrayed in these murals; because of the epitaph, many believe that the images depict Dong Shou, a refugee from [[Former Yan]], and his wife, while others believe that the person depicted was the Goguryeo king, [[Gogugwon of Goguryeo|King Gogukwon]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artistic Creation, Borrowing, Adaptation, and Assimilation in Koguryǒ Tomb Murals of the Fourth to Seventh Century|last=Jeon|first=Ho-Tae|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man in the mural is shown to be sitting upright and is flanked by other men who are smaller than him. He is dressed in red silk clothes with a white [http://worldhat.net/en/exhibition/kwan Kwan] over a black inner Kwan &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is staring straight out with an impersonal expression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The painting of the woman resides on the southern wall of the tomb, next to that of the man, and her sitting position is slightly turned in to face the him.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The woman also wears an impersonal expression, but with a notable face shape; her face, as well as the faces as the women who flank her, is round and full, different from the typical facial structure of the Goguryeo people, who had long and oval faces.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The next mural in this tomb is a [[procession]] scene and resides in the corridor. It contains 250 people, including the owner of the tomb who is sitting in a cow-pulled wagon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other Goguryeo people displayed in this mural include members of a marching band, flag bearers, maids and civil officials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The large amount of people suggests the high social status of the owner.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also important to note the seemingly identical, impersonal facial structure of the people included in this scene. This can be attributed to the fact that at the time when this mural was developed, the expression of individuality was not yet a developed technique in Goguryeo paintings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The inside of the eastern chamber contains a colorful mural illustrating the typical life of the Goguryeo people. The scene includes a kitchen, a meat storage room, a barn, a carriage shed, and household staff, along with other commonplace features.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This mural allows scholars to analyze the daily rituals of the Goguryeo culture, and gain insight on what the house of the tomb's owner may have looked like.

[[Image:AutographBook 2pages.png|thumb|right|250px|1888 autograph book]]
An '''autograph book''' is a [[book]] for collecting the [[autograph]]s of others.  Traditionally they were exchanged among friends, colleagues, and classmates to fill with [[poem]]s, drawings, personal messages, small pieces of verse, and other [[souvenir|mementos]].  Their modern derivations include [[yearbook]]s, [[friendship book]]s, and [[guest book]]s.  They were popular among [[university]] students from the 15th century until the mid-19th century, after which their popularity began to wane as they were gradually replaced by yearbooks.  

==History==

===Origin===
[[Image:Stammbuch1.jpg|thumb|This page from the autograph book of Simon Haendel (compiled in the 1590s) features a personal greeting, written in Latin adde]]

By the beginning of the [[early modern period]], there was a trend among graduating university students of central Europe to have their personal bibles signed by classmates and instructors.  Gradually these expanded from mere signatures to include poetry and sketches, and publication companies responded to this trend by appending blank pages to bibles.  Eventually they began offering small, decorated books with only blank pages.&lt;ref name="mki"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://mki.wisc.edu/virtualex/Stammbuecher/Stammbuecher.htm| title= Dies schrieb Dir zur Erinnerung...: From Album Amicorum to Autograph Book| accessdate= 9 February 2009| last= Petty| first= Antje| publisher= Max Kade Institute for German-American Studies| location= Madison, Wisconsin, United States| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090207045136/http://mki.wisc.edu/virtualex/Stammbuecher/Stammbuecher.htm| archivedate= 7 February 2009| deadurl= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other traditions dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] played into the development of the autograph book.&lt;ref name="artdir"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[genealogy|Genealogical]] tables and guides circulated within aristocratic families, with each person adding his or her own information.  Similarly, tournament participators would record their names, [[coat of arms|coats-of-arms]], and possibly [[motto]]es into tournament books.&lt;ref name="ket"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first true autograph books appeared in German and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] linguistic regions (possibly originating in [[Wittenberg]]) by the mid-16th century.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mun"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Known as an ''album amicorum'' ("book of friends") or ''stammbuch'' ("friendship book"), the oldest on record is that of Claude de Senarclens, an associate of [[John Calvin]], and dates back to 1545.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;  By the end of the century, they were common throughout Germany among students and scholars.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;  Academics tended to retain their autograph books for many years and gather the correspondence of fellow intellectuals with whom they associated; therefore the books began to function not only as sentimental artifacts but also as a crude form of scholarly credentials, a precursor to the modern "list of references".&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

===Evolution===
The popularity of autograph books was generally confined to [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] cultures, and they appeared only sporadically in other countries.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  They began to fall out of favor in the academic community by the late 17th century, but rebounded a century later as they came into use among [[fraternity|fraternity students]] and members of the burgeoning [[middle class]].  This new wave of autograph curators included women as well as men.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

German immigrants transported the tradition to American culture in the late 18th century, where their popularity peaked around the time of the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]].  Thereafter the use of autograph books declined sharply in both cultures as they were replaced by school yearbooks,&lt;ref name="princeton"&gt;{{cite web
| url         = http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=AC040&amp;kw=

| publisher=[[Princeton University Library]]
| location    = Princeton, New Jersey, United States
}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they remained a lingering fad among young women for some time.

Autograph books in their classic form eventually disappeared from the landscape of American culture, but their usage endures among German schoolgirls, who know them as ''poesiealben''.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

==Function==
[[File:Album russia.jpg|thumb|Small album, Russia, 1820-30s. [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
When they first emerged in the 1500s, autograph books were used for collecting signatures at graduation and kept as a sentimental memento of college life. Eventually it became popular to use them well after graduation, and scholars would carry the books on their travels (particularly between various universities) to record the well-wishes of colleagues and noteworthy acquaintances.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  The books therefore conveyed a form of academic credentials, dependent upon who had signed them and what had been written.&lt;ref name="mki"/&gt;

Additionally, an autograph book may have been used as a crude [[address book]] to maintain correspondence to past and distant friends.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;

Recently, researchers have come to see the historical value of these books in assessing the biographical data of those who composed them and the cultural backdrop in which they wrote. The autograph books of Ludwig van Beethoven and Babette Koch are among the most famous.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;

==Design and format==

===Books===
Until the late 18th century, German autograph albums generally consisted of loose sheets of paper or sometimes [[vellum]] bound in an elongated [[octavo]] format; later, they became available in the horizontal format.  The binding material varied dramatically, from cardboard to gold-tooled leather.&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;

A different type of album contained unbound pages in cassettes or folders, which could be passed out and collected individually and later arranged in any order.&lt;ref name="artdir"/&gt;

===Autographs===
A typical page contained a set of verses in Latin, Greek, or Hebrew at the top, and a formal greeting to the album's owner below, sometimes including a heraldic shield or emblematic picture of the signator.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;  More artistic autographers sketched full-page drawings, and less conventional entries included [[engraving]]s, [[embroidery]], paper silhouettes, [[lock of hair|locks of hair]], or [[pressed flower craft|pressed flowers]].&lt;ref name="ket"/&gt;  The high quality of some illustrations suggests that the books must have been kept by the autographer for some length of time to work on the composition.&lt;ref name="mun"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5944">{{See also|Neo-Aristotelianism (rhetorical criticism)}}
The '''Chicago School''' of [[literary criticism]] was a form of criticism of English literature begun at the [[University of Chicago]] in the 1930s, which lasted until the 1950s. It was also called [[Neo-Aristotelianism]], due to its strong emphasis on [[Aristotle]]’s concepts of plot, character and genre. It was partly a reaction to [[New Criticism]], a then highly popular form of literary criticism, which the Chicago critics accused of being too subjective and placing too much importance on irony and figurative language. They aimed instead for total objectivity and a strong classical basis of evidence for criticism. The New Critics regarded the language and poetic diction as most important, but the Chicago School considered such things merely the building material of poetry.  Like [[Aristotle]], they valued the structure or form of a literary work as a whole, rather than the complexities of the language. Despite this, the Chicago School is considered by some to be a part of the New Criticism movement.

==Beginnings==

[[Ronald Salmon Crane]] (1886–1967) is considered the founder of the Chicago Aristotelians. He began teaching at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1924, was made a professor in 1925, and chaired the English department there from 1935–1947. In 1935, he wrote “History versus Criticism in the Study of Literature” (published in ''English Journal'' 24 [1935]:645-67), in which he defined literary criticism as “simply the disciplined consideration, at once analytical and evaluative, of literary works as works of art.” Crane was greatly influenced by [[Richard McKeon]], a professor of philosophy at the University, who stressed [[Aristotle]]’s idea of "pluralism," which says that many systems of criticism are necessary to completely understand literature, specifically poetry, or in the case of philosophy, the world. Crane said that “the only rational ground for adhering to one [form of criticism] rather than to any of the others is its superior capacity to give us the special kind of understanding and evaluation of literature we want to get, at least for the time being.”

==Theory==

The question for the Chicago School (as it was for Aristotle) was always what the purpose of the theory of criticism was, what hypotheses were brought to bear by the theory about the nature of literature (for instance, whether it consisted of the words alone, or whether it was to be thought of as part of a larger context such as an era or an artist's life), and the definitions of words (such as the definition of tragedy or comedy).

The Chicago School claimed not to preclude other theories of criticism. It did, however, criticize those who were not clear or consistent about the initial hypotheses and definitions behind their theories. It thus appeared to many of the proponents of those theories that the Chicago School was claiming that theirs was the only good and effective approach to literature. For this reason, they were considered by some critics (including W.K. Wimsatt, whose essay "The Chicago Critics" is a critical assessment of their work) to be hypocritical, although they would vehemently deny this.

==Purpose==

Many of the ideas of the Chicago School are thought to have come out of the reorganization of undergraduate education at the [[University of Chicago]] by [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]], then President there. He placed great importance on primary sources and interdisciplinary studies for all students. Crane and his colleagues were forced to defend English as a valid topic of study, and the Chicago School might have developed partly from this pressure to put the study of English on a sound classical basis.

Other key figures in the Chicago School were W.R. Keast, [[Norman Maclean]], [[Elder Olson]], and Bernard Weinberg.  After this first generation, the most important critics to carry on the theory were [[Wayne C. Booth]] (who taught at the University of Chicago from 1947-1950 and again from 1962 until his death in 2005) and his contemporaries, Richard L. Levin, Sheldon Sacks, Robert Marsh, Arthur Heiserman, and Ralph W. Rader. Booth loosened the rigid categories of genre originally set forth by the Chicago School, and moved the concentration away from poetry towards rhetoric. The Chicago School has demonstrated continuing importance, and continuing flexibility, in the work of the third-generation Chicago critics, including Michael Boardman, Barbara Foley, [[Walter A. Davis]], Dorothy Hale, Elizabeth Langland, [[James Phelan (literary scholar)|James Phelan]], [[Peter J. Rabinowitz]], David H. Richter, and Harry Shaw, among others.

==Works==

Great works in the Chicago School include ''Critics and Criticism'' (Crane, ed. Chicago, 1952), ''The Languages of Criticism and the Structure of Poetry'' (Crane, Toronto, 1953), and ''The Rhetoric of Fiction'' (Booth. Chicago, 1983).&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43444">[[File:Subgenius-JHVH-1-by-St-Ken.jpg|thumb|[[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], the primary deity of the Church of the SubGenius.]]
The '''Church of the SubGenius''' is a [[parody religion]] that satirizes better-known belief systems. It teaches a complex philosophy that focuses on [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]], purportedly a salesman from the 1950s, who is revered as a prophet by the Church. SubGenius leaders have developed detailed narratives about Dobbs and his relationship to various gods and conspiracies. Their central deity, [[Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1]], is accompanied by other gods drawn from ancient myth and popular fiction. SubGenius literature describes a grand conspiracy that seeks to brainwash the world and oppress Dobbs' followers. In its narratives, the Church presents a blend of cultural references in an elaborate remix of the sources.

[[Ivan Stang]], who co-founded the Church of the SubGenius in the 1970s, serves as its leader and publicist. He has imitated actions of other religious leaders, using the tactic of [[culture jamming]] in an attempt to undermine better-known faiths. Church leaders instruct their followers to avoid mainstream commercialism and the belief in [[absolute truth]]s. The group holds that the quality of "Slack" is of utmost importance—it is never clearly defined. The number of followers is unknown, although the Church's message has been welcomed by college students and artists in the United States. The group is often compared to [[Discordianism]]. Journalists often consider the Church to be an elaborate joke, but a few academics have defended it as an honest system of deeply held beliefs.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

==Origins==
The Church of the SubGenius was founded by [[Ivan Stang]] (born Douglas St Clair Smith) and Philo Drummond (born Steve Wilcox){{sfn|Chryssides|2012|p=95}} as the SubGenius Foundation.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Dr. X (born Monte Dhooge) was also present at the group's inception.{{sfn|Shea|2006}} The organization's first recorded activity was the publication of a photocopied document, known as the ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'', disseminated in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] in 1979. The document announced the impending end of the world and the possible deaths of its readers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} It criticized Christian conceptions of God and [[New Age]] perceptions of spirituality.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}}

Church leaders maintain that a man named [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs]] founded the group in 1953.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} SubGenius members constructed an elaborate account of the life of Dobbs, which is described by commentators as fictional.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=67}} They assert that he telepathically contacted Drummond in 1972, before meeting him in person the next year, and that Drummond persuaded Ivan Stang to join shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} Stang describes himself as the "sacred scribe" of Dobbs and a "professional maven of weirdness".{{sfn|Batz|1995}}{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

==Beliefs==

===Deities===
The Church of the SubGenius's ostensible beliefs defy categorization or a simple narrative, often striking outside observers as bizarre and convoluted.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The group has developed an intricate mythology involving gods, aliens, and mutants, which is usually considered by observers to satirize other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Their primary deity, generally known as Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} is cast as an extraterrestrial, who contacted Dobbs in the 1950s. Various accounts state that the encounter occurred while Dobbs was building a television or watching late-night television.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 gave him supernatural knowledge of the past and future, in addition to incredible power.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Dobbs then posed deep questions to the alien, receiving mysterious answers.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} Some of their discussion centered on a powerful conspiracy, to which the Church attributes command of the world.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}

Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 and his spouse [[Eris (mythology)|Eris]], regarded by the Church as "relatively evil", are classified as "rebel gods".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=86 &amp; 101}} SubGenius leaders note that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is wrathful, a quality expressed by his "stark fist of removal".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church teaches that they are part of the Elder Gods, who are committed to human pain, but that Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 is "relatively good" in comparison. [[Yog-Sothoth]], a character from [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]], is the leader of the Elder Gods. In her 2010 study of the Church of the SubGenius, religious scholar Carole Cusack of the [[University of Sydney]] states that Lovecraft's work is a "model for the Church of the SubGenius' approach to scripture", in that aspects of his fiction were treated as real by some within paganism, just as the Church appropriates aspects of popular culture in its spirituality.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=101}}

===J. R. "Bob" Dobbs===
{{Main article|J. R. "Bob" Dobbs}}
[[File:June and Ward Cleaver Leave it to Beaver 1958.JPG|thumb|[[Ward Cleaver]] (right), to whom Dobbs' appearance is often compared.]]

SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs' nature is ineffable and consequently stylize his name with quotation marks.{{sfn|Hart|1992}}{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} They cast him as a "World Avatar"{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and hold that he has died and been reborn many times.{{sfn|Batz|1995}} The Church's primary symbol is an icon of his face in which he smokes a pipe.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Stang states that the image was taken from [[Yellow Pages]] clip art,{{sfn|Hart|1992}} and it has been likened to [[Ward Cleaver]],{{sfn|Batz|1995}} [[Mark Trail]],{{sfn|Rea|1985}} or a 1950s-era salesman.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} The Church's canon contains references to aspects of the culture of the United States in that decade;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} religious scholar Danielle Kirby of [[RMIT University]] argues that this type of reference "simultaneously critiques and subverts" the concept of the [[American dream]].{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

In the Church's mythology, Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 had intended for Dobbs to lead a powerful conspiracy and brainwash individuals to make them work for a living. Dobbs refused to support the group; instead, he infiltrated it and organized a counter-movement. Church leaders teach that he was a very intelligent child and, as he grew older, studied several religious traditions, including [[Sufism]], [[Rosicrucianism]], and the [[Fourth Way]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Another key event in his life occurred when he traveled to [[Tibet]]; there he learned vital truths about topics including [[Yeti]]s. The Church teaches that Yetis exist, and that SubGenius members have descended from them. The only relative of Dobbs that the Church identifies is his mother, Jane McBride Dobbs—Church leaders cite his lack of resemblance to his mother's husband as the reason for not revealing his father.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=84–6}} Dobbs is married to a woman named [[J. R. "Bob" Dobbs#Connie Dobbs|Connie]]; SubGenius leaders identify the couple as archetypes of the genders in a belief that resembles Hindu doctrines about [[Shiva]] and [[Parvati]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}} Church literature has variously described Dobbs' occupation as "drilling equipment" or [[fluoride]] sales,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}}{{sfn|Rea|1985}} and accounts of his life generally emphasize his good fortune rather than intelligence.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} SubGenius leaders believe that he is capable of time travel, and that this ability results in occasional changes to doctrine, deemed the "Sacred Doctrine of Erasability" by the Church. Consequently, members attempt to follow Dobbs by eschewing unchangeable plans.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}

==={{anchor|slack}}Conspiracy and "Slack"===
The Church of the SubGenius's literature incorporates many aspects of conspiracy theories,{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} teaching that there is a grand conspiracy at the root of all lesser ones.{{sfn|Hart|1992}} It records that there are many UFOs, most of which are used by the conspiracy leaders to monitor humans, although a few contain extraterrestrials. In the Church's view, this conspiracy uses a façade of empowering messages but manipulates people so that they become indoctrinated into its service.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} The Church refers to these individuals as "pinks" and states that they are blissfully unaware of the organization's power and control.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} SubGenius leaders teach that most cultural and religious mores are the conspiracy's propaganda.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} They maintain that their followers, but not the pinks, are capable of developing an imagination; the Church teaches that Dobbs has empowered its members to see through these illusions. Owing to their descent from Yetis, the Church's followers have a capacity for deep understanding that the pinks lack.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} [[Cultural studies]] scholar Solomon Davidoff states that the Church develops a "satiric commentary" on religion, morality, and conspiracies.{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}}

SubGenius members believe that those in the service of the conspiracy seek to bar them from "Slack",{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} a quality promoted by the Church. Its teachings center on "Slack"{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} (always capitalized),{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} which is never concisely defined, except in the claim that Dobbs embodies the quality.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=222}} Church members seek to acquire "Slack" and believe that it will allow them the free, comfortable life (without hard work or responsibility) which they claim as an entitlement.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=85}}{{sfn|Duncombe|2005|p=226}} Sex and the avoidance of work are taught as two key ways to gain "Slack".{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Davidoff believes that "Slack" is "the ability to effortlessly achieve your goals".{{sfn|Davidoff|2003|p=170}} Cusack states that the Church's description of "Slack" as ineffable recalls the way that [[Tao]] is described,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=86}} and Kirby casts "Slack" as a "unique magical system".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}  The [[Slackware]] Linux distribution is so named after the tenet of Slack.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

==Members==
[[File:Robert Crumb 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Crumb|R. Crumb]], a cartoonist who helped publicize the Church.]]
The Church of the SubGenius's founders were based in Dallas when they distributed their first document. The SubGenius Foundation moved to [[Cleveland]], Ohio, in 1999.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} In 2009, Stang claimed that the Church had 40,000&amp;nbsp;members, but the actual number may have been much lower.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} As of 2012, becoming a minister in the Church consists of paying a $35&amp;nbsp;fee;{{sfn|SubGenius.com Sales}} Stang has estimated that there are 10,000&amp;nbsp;ministers{{sfn|Rea|1985}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and that the Church's annual income has reached $100,000.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} In October 2017, The Church moved to [[Glen Rose, Texas|Glen Rose]], Texas.

Most SubGenius members are male,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=102}} and, according to Stang, many of them are social outcasts.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} He maintains that those who do not fit into society will ultimately triumph over those who do.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} The Church has experienced success "converting" college students,{{sfn|Batz|1995}} particularly at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} It has also gained popularity in several American cities, including [[San Francisco]], [[Little Rock]], and Cleveland.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}} A few Church members have voiced concerns and/or amusement about new members who took the Church too seriously, fearing that they acted like serious cult-followers, the very concept that the SubGenius parodies.{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Stang has expressed concern that the Church's doctrines could exacerbate pre-existing [[psychosis|psychoses]] of mentally ill devotees, although he believes that the Church genuinely helps many adherents.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}}

Notable associates of the Church include [[Mark Mothersbaugh]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Mojo Nixon]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[Paul Mavrides]],{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} [[Paul Reubens]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=94}} members of [[Negativland]],{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} [[David Byrne]], and [[Robert Crumb|R.&amp;nbsp;Crumb]].{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Crumb, a cartoonist, provided early publicity for the church by reprinting ''Sub Genius Pamphlet #1'' in his comics anthology ''[[Weirdo (magazine)|Weirdo]]''.{{sfn|Niesel|2000}} References to the Church are present in several works of art,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} including the Internet-based [[collaborative fiction]] ''[[Ong's Hat]]'', the comic book ''[[The Middleman]]'', the band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]]'s album ''[[40oz. to Freedom]]'', and the television program ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]''.{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64–7}}{{sfn|Lloyd|2008}}{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Instructions===
Church leaders have issued specific instructions to their followers;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} Robert Latham of the [[University of California, Riverside]], casts their ideology as "anarcholibertarian".{{sfn|Latham|2002|p=94}} Five specific commands particularly embody the group's values.

*The first command is to shun regular employment and stop working. This encapsulates the Church's view that to repent is to "SLACK OFF" (''[[sic]]''),{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} in opposition to the idea of working for a living.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} SubGenius leaders state that it is permissible for members to collect public assistance in lieu of maintaining employment.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}
*The second command is to purchase products that are sold by the Church, which its leaders teach was founded by Dobbs to gain wealth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} Unlike most religious groups, the Church proudly admits it is for-profit (presumably mocking some religious groups that seem to have ulterior financial motives).{{sfn|Leiby|1994}} Cusack sees the instruction to buy as an ironic parody of the "[[Wall Street (1987 film)|greed is good]]" mentality of the 1980s,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} and Kirby notes that although the group emphasizes "the consumption of popular cultural artefacts", this consumption is "simultaneously de-emphasized by the processes of remix".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=52}}
*The third command is to rebel against "law and order": specifically, the Church condemns security cameras and encourages computer hacking. Cusack notes that this instruction recalls [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s critique of law and order.
*The fourth command is to rid the world of everyone who did not descend from [[Yeti]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} SubGenius leaders teach that Dobbs hopes to rid the Earth of 90&amp;nbsp;percent of humanity, making the Earth "clear".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The group praises drug abuse and abortion as effective methods of culling unneeded individuals.
*The fifth command is to exploit fear, specifically that of individuals who are part of the conspiracy. Church leaders teach that members of the conspiracy fear SubGenius devotees.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}}

Local groups of members of the Church of the SubGenius are known as "clenches". They host periodic events known as "devivals", which include sermons, music, and other art forms.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Devival is a term used by both the [[Church of the Subgenius]] and later [[Discordianism]]{{cn|date=June 2018}} for a gathering or festival of followers. The name is a pun on [[Christian]] [[Revival meeting|revivals]].&lt;ref name=Cusack&gt;{{citation

At devivals, leaders take comical names and give angry rants,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} and many devivals occur in bars or similar venues.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Cusack compares the style of the services to [[Pentecostal]] [[revivalism]];{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=93}} David Giffels of the ''[[Akron Beacon Journal]]'' casts them as "campy preaching sessions".{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} Cusack posits that these events are examples of [[Peter Lamborn Wilson]]'s concept of [[Temporary Autonomous Zone]]s, spaces in which the ordinary constraints of social control are suspended.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=97}} On one occasion, the presence of the wife of a Church leader at a SubGenius meeting that included public nudity and a goat costume contributed to her losing custody of her children in a court case. However, the publicity surrounding the event was ultimately a boon to the Church's recruitment efforts.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

The Church also celebrates several holidays in honor of characters drawn from fiction and popular culture, such as [[Monty Python]], [[Dracula]], and [[Klaatu (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Klaatu]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} The [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]] and pagan groups have occasionally assisted the Church in its events.{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=106}} Some SubGenius members put little emphasis on meetings, citing the Church's focus on individualism, although the ''Book of the SubGenius'' discusses community.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=98–9}}

SubGenius devivals are not regularly scheduled, but are recorded on the SubGenius website.&lt;ref name=DevivalHistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|title=Reports on Great Devivals of yore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devivals have been held in multiple states within the continental United States, as well as different countries, including China, the Netherlands, and Germany. The Church has also held Devivals at non-SubGenius events, such as [[Burning Man]] and the [[Starwood Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Past Events|url = http://www.subgenius.com/bigfist/fun/devivals/devivals.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivanstang.jpg|right|thumb|Rev. [[Ivan Stang]] of the Church of the SubGenius at ''The Cyclone of Slack'']]
''The Cyclone of Slack''&lt;ref name=PDXPoster&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/36254855@N00/4036592396/|title=Salvation - $10|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PDXDevival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdxdevival.com/|title=Cyclone of Slack|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Devival in Portland, Oregon, in October 2009 put on by the joint efforts of the [[Church of the Subgenius]]&lt;ref name=HourOfSlack1232&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos_logs/Hour_of_Slack_1232.html|title=Hour of Slack #1232 - Portland Cyclone of Slack Devival 1 - 59:08|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organizers of Esozone.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

One of the more bizarre moments of the evening was when suddenly, in 2s and 3s, the alcohol and [[fire-and-brimstone]] sermon fueled crowd in front of the stage began to sit down and Slack when the Duke of Uke began to play his [[ukulele]].&lt;ref name=DukeofUke&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPYhpNMM16I|title=Duke of Uke calms the Devival with the healing power of the ukulele|accessdate=2010-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Go Fuck Yourself" devival was held in [[Astoria, New York]], in October 2010 put on by the Church of the Subgenius at the Wonderland Collective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/subgenius-devival-/E0-001-034012941-7|title=SUBGENIUS DEVIVAL IN ASTORIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-Day===
In early SubGenius literature, July 5, 1998, was introduced as a significant date, later becoming known as "[[X-Day (Church of the SubGenius)|X-Day]]".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=89}} The Church held that Dobbs identified the date's significance in the 1950s,{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} claiming that the world was to experience a massive change on that date when Xists, beings from Planet&amp;nbsp;X, would arrive on Earth.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} SubGenius leaders declared that their paying members were to be transported onto spaceships for union with goddesses as the world was destroyed,{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} although a few posited that they would be sent to a joyful hell.{{sfn|Giffels|1995}} In anticipation of the event, X-Day "drills" were held in 1996 and 1997.{{sfn|SubGenius.com Devivals}}

In July 1998, the Church held a large devival at a "clothing-optional" campground in [[Sherman, New York]],{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} attended by about 400&amp;nbsp;members.{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} The event was ostensibly intended to celebrate the coming of aliens. When their appearance was not detected using the technology available at that time, Stang speculated that they might arrive in 8661, an inversion of 1998;{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} this has been interpreted as a satire of the way that religious groups have revised prophecies after their failures.{{sfn|Gunn|Beard|2000|p=269}} Some critics have dismissed the event as a prank or form of "performance art".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}} Steve Bevilacqua, the Church's business manager, admitted that his group made strange predictions about aliens, but contended that their statements were as believable as the account of [[Jesus' walk on water]].{{sfn|Yuen|1998}} Another theory is that The Conspiracy has lied about what year the present year actually is (just as they have lied about everything else), so that the liberation date would seem to pass without fulfillment and cause followers to lose faith. As a precaution, SubGenius members continue to gather for X-Day every July 5 after 1998. At these events, the non-appearance of the aliens is celebrated.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Cusack casts the productions as [[carnivalesque]]{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} or an echo of ancient Greek [[satyr play]]s.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=90}}

==Publishing==

=== Online ===
The Church of the SubGenius established a website in May 1993,{{sfn|Ciolek|2003|p=800}} and its members were very active on [[Usenet]] in the 1990s.{{sfn|Batz|1995}}

=== Print ===
Although it has gained a significant online presence, it was successful before the advent of Internet communities.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} The Church was a pioneer in the religious use of [[zine]]s;{{sfn|Kinsella|2011|p=64}} Cusack notes that its use of the medium can be seen as a rejection of the alienation of labor practices.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}}

The SubGenius Foundation has published several official teachings, as well as non-doctrinal works by Stang.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} The ''Book of the SubGenius'', which discusses "Slack" at length, was published by [[Simon&amp;nbsp;&amp; Schuster]] and sold 30,000&amp;nbsp;copies in its first five years in print.{{sfn|Ashbrook|1988}}{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} Kirby casts the book as a "call to arms for the forces of absurdity".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} The juxtaposition, visual style, and content of the book mirror the group as a whole.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} It draws themes from fiction, as well as established and new religions, parodying a number of topics, including the Church of the SubGenius itself.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

A number of SubGenius writers have authored stories to build their mythology, which have been compiled and published.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=100}} Their core texts are disordered, presented in the style of a collage.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Kirby notes that the group's texts are a [[bricolage]] of cultural artifacts, which is then remixed into a new creation.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=51}} In this process, Kirby argues, they interweave and juxtapose a variety of concepts, which she describes as a "web of references".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

=== Video ===
The group has also been promoted by a video Stang produced in 1992.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}}{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

=== Radio ===
The Church of the SubGenius hosts several radio shows throughout the world, including broadcasters in Atlanta, Ohio, Maryland, and California. ''[[Hour of Slack|The Hour of Slack]]'', the Church’s most popular audio production, is broadcast by several radio stations in the United States and two in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Radio|url = http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2015-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hour of Slack|The Hour of Slack]]'' can also be heard in podcast form.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SubSite - Radio|url = http://www.subgenius.com/ts/hos.html|website = www.subgenius.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = hourofslack.libsyn.com|url = http://hourofslack.libsyn.com|accessdate = 2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and commentary==

===Comparative religion===
The Church's teachings are often perceived as satirizing Christianity and Scientology,{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} earning them a reputation as a [[parody religion]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=83}} Church leaders have stated that Dobbs met [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]], and SubGenius narratives echo [[Space opera in Scientology|extraterrestrial themes found in Scientology]].{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=105}} Cusack notes that descriptions of Jehovah 1 bear noticeable similarities to [[Xenu]], a powerful alien found in some Scientologist writings.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=87}} The Church's rhetoric has also been seen as a satirical imitation of the [[televangelism]] of the 1980s.{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} Cusack sees the Church's faux commercialism as [[culture jamming]] targeting [[prosperity theology]];{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=104}} she describes this as "a strikingly original innovation in contemporary religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=111}} Religious scholar Thomas Alberts of the [[University of London]] views the Church as attempting to "subvert the idea of authenticity in religion" by mirroring other religions to create both a sense of similarity and [[alterity]].{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=127}}

Cusack compares the Church of the SubGenius to the [[Ranter]]s, a radical 17th-century pantheist movement in England. She notes that they made statements that shocked many hearers, attacking traditional notions of religious orthodoxy and political authority. In her view, this demonstrates that the Church of the SubGenius has "legitimate pedigree in the history of Western religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|pp=106–7}} The American journalist [[Michael Muhammad Knight]] likens the Church to the [[Moorish Orthodox Church of America]], a 20th-century American [[syncretism|syncretic]] religious movement, citing their shared emphasis on freedom.{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

There are a number of similarities between the Church of the SubGenius and [[Discordianism]]. Eris, the goddess of chaos who is worshiped by adherents of the latter, is believed by members of the Church of the SubGenius to be the wife of Jehovah&amp;nbsp;1 and an ally to humans. Like Discordianism, the Church of the SubGenius rejects absolute truth and embraces contradictions and paradoxes.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}} Religious scholar David Chidester of the [[University of Cape Town]] views the Church as a "Discordian offshoot",{{sfn|Chidester|2005|p=198}} and Kirby sees them as "a child of the Discordians".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=48}} Both groups were heavily influenced by the writings of [[Robert Anton Wilson]], who is referred to by SubGenius members as "Pope Bob".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=88}}{{sfn|''The Daily Telegraph'', "Robert Anton Wilson"}} Kirby states that the two groups have elements of bricolage and absurdity in common, but the Church of the SubGenius more explicitly remixes pop culture.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}}

===Categorization===
Scholars often have difficulty defining the Church.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} Most commentators have placed the Church in the category of "joke religions", which is usually seen as a pejorative description. Kirby sees this categorization as partially accurate because irony is an essential aspect of their faith.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Other terms used to describe the Church include "faux cult",{{sfn|Callahan|1996}} "[post-modern] cult",{{sfn|Batz|1995}} "satirical pseudoreligion",{{sfn|Stein|1993|p=179}} "sophisticated joke religion",{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=109}} "anti-religion religion",{{sfn|Scoblionkov|1998}} and "high parody of cultdom".{{sfn|Rea|1985}} Members of the Church, however, have consistently maintained that they practice a religion.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=98}} Stang has described the group as both "satire and a real stupid religion", and he contends that it is more honest about its nature than are other religions.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=107}}

Cusack states that the Church "must be accorded the status of a functional equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion".{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} She sees it as "arguably a legitimate path to liberation", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism.{{sfn|Cusack|2010|p=84}} Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}} Alberts believes that there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term "fake religion" to describe the group. He sees it, along with Discordianism, as part of a group of "popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion".{{sfn|Alberts|2008|p=126}} Knight characterizes the Church as "at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right".{{sfn|Knight|2012|p=96}}

===Appraisal===
Kirby argues that the Church forms a counterpart to [[Jean Baudrillard]]'s concept of [[hyperreality]], arguing "they create, rather than consume, popular culture in the practice of their spirituality".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|pp=42–3}} She describes their remixing of popular culture sources as an "explicitly creative process",{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} maintaining that it prompts the reader to adopt some of the group's views by forcing "the individual to reconsider normative methods of approaching the content".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}} She states that the group attempts to "strip references of their original meaning without necessarily losing their status as icons".{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=50}}

In addition, Kirby sees the Church's goal as deconstructing "normative modes of thought and behavior" in American culture;{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=44}} she believes that it attempts to fight culturally ingrained thought patterns by shocking people.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=49}} She argues that traditional approaches to religion cast seriousness as a measure of devotion, an approach which she believes has failed in contemporary society. She feels that irony is a common value that has been ignored by most religions. By embracing the quality, she maintains, the Church of the SubGenius offers a more accessible worldview than many groups.{{sfn|Kirby|2012|p=43}}

Literature scholar Paul Mann of [[Pomona College]] is critical of the Church of the SubGenius. He notes that the Church purports to present the truth through absurdity and faults it for insufficiently examining the concept of truth itself.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=156}} In addition, he believes that the group undermines its attempts to take a radical perspective by their "hysterical, literal, fantastic embrace" of criticism.{{sfn|Mann|1999|p=158}}

Anarchist writer [[Bob Black]], a former member, has criticized the Church, alleging that the group has come to be characterized by conformism and submission to authority. He believes that although it initially served to satirize cults, it later took on some of their aspects. In 1992, allegations of cult-like behavior also appeared in the newspaper ''[[Bedfordshire on Sunday]]'' after a spate of SubGenius-themed vandalism struck the English town of [[Bedford]].{{sfn|Leiby|1994}}

The '''Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar''' or '''Cincinnati Music Center half dollar''' is [[Early United States commemorative coins|a commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|50-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1936. Produced with the stated purpose of commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] as a center of music, it was conceived by [[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin enthusiast who controlled the group which was allowed to buy the entire issue from the government, and who resold the pieces at high prices.

[[74th United States Congress|Congress]] approved legislation for the coin on March 31, 1936, authorizing 15,000 pieces to be struck at the three mints then in operation. Melish had hired sculptor [[Constance Ortmayer]] to design the coin, but the [[Commission of Fine Arts]] refused to recommend the designs. Members objected to the depiction of [[Stephen Foster]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], finding no connection between Foster, who died in 1864, and the supposed anniversary. Nevertheless, the designs were approved by the Bureau of the Mint, and 5,000 sets from the three mints were issued and sold to Melish's group, the only authorized purchaser.

Melish likely held back much of the issue for later resale, and with few pieces available, prices for the set spiked, rising to over five times the issue price. The value dropped somewhat when the boom in commemorative coins burst in late 1936, but quickly recovered and the coins are valuable today. Melish has been assailed by [[numismatics|numismatic]] writers for greed.

== Inception ==
Sparked by low-mintage issues which appreciated in value, the market for [[United States commemorative coin]]s spiked in 1936. Until 1954, the entire mintage of such issues was sold by the government at face value to a group authorized by Congress, who then tried to sell the coins at a profit to the public. The new pieces then came on to the secondary market, and in early 1936 all earlier commemoratives sold at a premium to their issue prices. The apparent easy profits to be made by purchasing and holding commemoratives attracted many to the [[coin collecting]] hobby, where they sought to purchase the new issues. Among the pieces which had recently been struck and had appreciated in value was the 1935 [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]]. This piece had been issued at the behest of L. W. Hoffecker, a Texas entrepreneur and coin dealer, who put aside a fifth of the 10,000 mintage for himself and sold them well into the 1940s, by which time he had served as president of the [[American Numismatic Association]] (ANA).{{sfn|Bowers|pp=12–13}} Congress authorized an explosion of commemorative coins in 1936; no fewer than fifteen were issued for the first time. At the request of the groups authorized to purchase them, several coins minted in prior years were produced again, dated 1936, senior among them the [[Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar]], first struck in 1926.{{sfn|Yeoman|pp=1136–1145}}

[[File:Melish picture.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Thomas G. Melish]]
[[Thomas G. Melish]], a coin collector and entrepreneur from Cincinnati, came up with an idea for a commemorative coin that he would control and from which he could profit.{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} Melish was a prominent businessman who had inherited the Bromwell Wire Company.{{sfn|Horning|p=30}} He formed the Cincinnati Musical Center Commemorative Coin Association, and secured the introduction of H.R. 10264 on January 31, 1936. This bill would have provided for 10,000 coins from the [[Philadelphia Mint]], 2,000 coins from [[Denver Mint|Denver]], and 3,000 from the [[San Francisco Mint]]. Such a low mintage would have made the Denver coin a significant rarity, increasing Melish's profit. On February 17, the [[United States House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures|House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures]] recommended that it be amended to provide for a total of 15,000 coins without dictating at what mint or mints they should be struck. That committee, in its report accompanying the bill, noted that the piece was "in commemoration of the fiftieth (golden) anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution of the annual{{efn|Biennial for much of its history}} [[Cincinnati May Festival|May festival]] to the art of music for the past 50 years."{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}}{{sfn|House Committee|p=1}} Melish, through political influence, was able to retain the provision that they should be struck "at the mints", allowing coinage at all three mints. This marked the last time that a coinage bill would pass Congress in the 1930s with that phrasing—later issues were limited to a single mint.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=307}}

The bill passed Congress, and was signed by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] on March 31, 1936.{{sfn|Flynn|p=353}} The pieces were to honor "the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati, Ohio, as a center of music, and its contribution to the art of music for the past 50 years".{{sfn|Bowers|p=329}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their volume on commemorative coins, concluded that "pressure from the above-named Association on Congress induced passage of the Act".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=42}}

== Preparation and controversy ==
Melish engaged [[Constance Ortmayer]] to design the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} Ortmayer later remembered, "I was recommended by them, someone came through Cincinnati&amp;nbsp;... they were just looking for somebody so they recommended me".{{sfn|Starck|p=56}} Ortmayer apparently prepared a design before the bill passed Congress, for Melish wrote to Assistant [[Director of the United States Mint|Director of the Mint]] [[Mary Margaret O'Reilly]] on April 4, 1936, that the original "lacked distinction and artistic merit" and that Ortmayer would redesign the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} He wrote again on May 7, asking if Ortmayer's new design was satisfactory.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}} The models were submitted to the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], charged since 1921 with advising on coin design, though the government was not bound to follow its recommendations. On May 13, the chairman, Charles Moore, wrote to Mint Director [[Nellie Tayloe Ross]], withholding approval.{{sfn|Flynn|p=266}}{{sfn|Taxay|p=182}}

[[File:Theodore thomas.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]]]]
Moore recited the stated purpose of the coin, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Cincinnati as a center of music, then noted that the obverse depicted [[Stephen Foster]], the composer and songwriter—who died in 1864, whereas Cincinnati was not notable as a center of music until at least 1873. "The Commission is at a loss to connect a fiftieth anniversary in 1936 with a movement that began in 1873."{{sfn|Flynn|pp=266–267}} Foster did live in Cincinnati, Moore admitted, but only for a brief period while working as a bookkeeper, and his main contributions to American music came later, when he lived in Pittsburgh and in New York City. Further, the coin was to commemorate Cincinnati's contributions to the art of music, and Foster "was an American [[troubadour]], but to music as an art he made no contribution".{{sfn|Taxay|p=183}} Moore felt that if anyone should be depicted, it should be [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]], who conducted the [[Cincinnati May Festival]] from its beginning in 1873 and in 1878 became director of the Cincinnati College of Music. He stated that "Theodore Thomas was, artistically, the founder of Cincinnati as a musical center. His portrait should appear on any coin commemorative of Cincinnati 'as a center of music'".{{sfn|Flynn|p=267}}

On May 16, ''[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]'' reported that Thomas would appear on the coin, not Foster. The paper also reported the controversy before the Commission of Fine Arts, that Melish had travelled to Washington the previous day, and had announced he had no objection to the change.&lt;ref name="enq"&gt;{{cite news|title=Theodore Thomas's Likeness To Appear On Cincinnati Coins; Collectors Foiled|newspaper=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|date=May 16, 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on May 16, Melish telephoned [[Lee Lawrie]], sculptor member of the Commission. Melish's notes indicate that Moore's objection was on behalf of [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth]] and the Longworth family, who had employed Thomas to lead the May Festival, and who wanted Thomas on the coin, although, as (per Melish) Lawrie put it, "Thomas looks like a walrus and would be a very hard head to make". Melish was defiant, stating that he also knew Alice Longworth well, and Foster remained on the coin.{{sfn|Flynn|p=267}} Ortmayer remembered that the "boss" of the Bureau of the Mint (presumably Ross) objected to the reverse design, not liking the position of the goddess' legs.{{sfn|Starck|p=56}} Swiatek, in his later volume, averred that Melish's association put pressure on the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] to approve Ortmayer's design.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=305}}

The Philadelphia Mint received the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], stating that the sculptor's models were in too high [[relief (art)|relief]], and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high relief that the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece were expected to be tested by coining trial strikes in early July.{{sfn|Flynn|p=268}}

== Design ==
[[File:1926 50C Sesquicentennial (obv).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cornelius Vermeule]] compared the Cincinnati coin with the [[United States Sesquicentennial coinage|Sesquicentennial half dollar]].]]
The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the Cincinnati Musical Center half dollar displays a bust of Stephen Foster, facing to the viewer's right, and below it, the words "&lt;small&gt;STEPHEN FOSTER AMERICA'S TROUBADOUR&lt;/small&gt;".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} This phrase was taken from a biography of Foster published earlier in the 1930s.{{sfn|Bowers|p=330}} The artist's initials, "CO", are to the left of Foster. The name of the country, and the denomination, appear near the rim. The reverse shows a kneeling figure, intended to be the goddess of music. In the upper left portion of the field, or background, is the date 1886, in the lower right 1936, and beneath the latter the [[mint mark]] (unless struck at Philadelphia, which did not then use one). The goddess kneels on the mottos required by law to appear, and near the edge is "&lt;small&gt;CINCINNATI A MUSIC CENTER OF AMERICA&lt;/small&gt;".{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}}

The design attracted comments from those interested in coins. Frank Duffield, editor of the ANA's journal ''[[The Numismatist]]'', noted in the October 1936 issue that the coin had been awaited with anticipation by hobbyists because of an announcement that it would bear the likeness of Foster, but "when it finally appeared many expressions of approval of the designs were heard and a few criticisms&amp;nbsp;... Foster deserved a better bust than the one the artist has given us&amp;nbsp;...the toy four-string lyre [the goddess] holds in her hand is not in keeping with the times or the occasion&amp;nbsp;... After all these years, Music deserved something better."{{sfn|Bowers|pp=330–331}} Coin dealer B. Max Mehl, in his monograph on commemorative coins published in 1937, agreed with the criticism of the reverse, "apparently this lyre must have been bought at a 5¢ and 10¢ store as it seems to be only a toy".{{sfn|Mehl|p=44}}

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his 1971 volume on American coins and medals, ''Numismatic Art in America'', criticized Ortmayer's design:

{{quote|
The details and style of this coin perpetuate the slender lettering and weak surfaces of the John Sinnock school, as exemplified in the [[United States Sesquicentennial coinage|Philadelphia Sesquicentennial half dollar]] of 1926. Surfaces are glazed or rubbed over, and the coin has a worn look&amp;nbsp;... Stephen Foster's bust on the obverse is a distorted or compressed lump, and the "goddess of music" has much the same appeal of a dancer with cramps.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=195}}
}}

== Release, distribution, and collecting ==
The mintage of 15,000 was struck in July 1936. At the Philadelphia and Denver mints, 5,005 pieces were produced, and 5,006 at San Francisco, with the excess from the even thousands held for inspection and testing at the 1937 meeting of the [[United States Assay Commission]]. The first 200 pieces from each mint were collected in sets of three, with a notarized letter from Melish testifying to what number coins they were. Several of these special sets were sent by Melish to government officials.{{sfn|Bowers|p=331}}

[[File:Melish OTMA letter.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Letter from Melish to a would-be purchaser of the half dollar]]
Melish had been fielding inquiries from collectors since Roosevelt signed the legislation, but from mid-May, those who wrote received only postcards stating the new issue was oversubscribed. The summer of 1936 was the peak of the commemorative coin boom, and Melish announced the new pieces would be sold in sets of three by mint mark for $7.75 (a high price at that time). Order blanks were sent to those who had written early, and soon these blanks were selling for $10. Yet few collectors were successful in having their orders filled, with most having their payment returned as the coins had supposedly sold out. The sets quickly jumped in price to $40. At this high level, many coins proved available. Numismatist [[Q. David Bowers]] stated that these were most likely surreptitiously sold by Melish and other insiders. Melish also allowed the issuers of the [[York County, Maine Tercentenary half dollar]] to purchase, at the original issue price, several sets—members of the public could order at most one set at that price. In return, he sought to purchase that and other commemorative coins in quantities beyond the usual order limit.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=26, 332–333}} Nevertheless, when the [[Oregon Trail Memorial Association]], issuer of the long-lived half dollar honoring the trail, tried to purchase a set, Melish replied that they were sold out.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Thomas G. Melish to the Oregon Trail Memorial Association, September 8, 1936. Howard G. Driggs Papers, Southern Utah University, folder "Coins".&lt;/ref&gt;

By December, the bottom had dropped out of the commemorative coin market, and dealers who had purchased quantities found themselves unable to dispose of them at a profit. By 1940 the coin sets were selling for $15 per set. They thereafter recovered, and by the early 1960s had reached $100 a set,{{sfn|Bowers|pp=333, 336}} and by 1975 $550 per set of three.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, they sold for $2,250 a set.{{sfn|Bowers|p=336}} [[R.S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'', published in 2015, lists the sets at between $875 and $2,700 depending on condition. Individual coins are cataloged at about a third of the set prices.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=1152}}

[[File:1936 Cincinnati PDS (SET).jpg|thumb|right|The Cincinnati set in holder of issue]]
The circumstances of the issuance were not clear at first: Mehl wrote that the coin was to honor the 50th anniversary of the "Cincinnati Musical Center" which was "founded in 1886" and that "either through good distribution or a great demand, the sets did not go around to all those who wanted them".{{sfn|Mehl|p=44}} Later numismatic writers have been harsh to Melish; Swiatek deemed the coin issued because of "false claims" on its behalf.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=304}} Kevin Flynn, in his volume on commemoratives, stated that the Cincinnati piece "was made for pure profit and greed".{{sfn|Flynn|p=71}} Swiatek and Breen, in their 1988 book, suggest that Melish's group "had only one idea in mind: enriching themselves by publicizing and distributing a limited issue which could be priced into orbit by speculators".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=42}}

With the success of the issue, Melish tried to get Congress to authorize 1937-dated pieces; he was not successful.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=115}} He had managed to get Congress to allow another commemorative under his control, the 1936 [[Cleveland Centennial half dollar]]. In 1942, when the ANA held its annual convention in Cincinnati, Melish hosted a hospitality suite. Dubbed the "Pirate's Den", it featured paintings he had commissioned, depicting coin dealers and other numismatic personalities in [[Pirates in popular culture|piratical]] clothes. According to Bowers, "Overlooked was the fact that the greatest pirate of all was surely Melish himself, who undoubtedly treated many of his guests with money taken from them a few years earlier in the sale of Cincinnati sets!"{{sfn|Bowers|pp=334–335}}

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired! Lab] at Duke University&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dukewired.org/projects/dictionary-art-historians/|title=Dictionary of Art Historians {{!}} Wired!

Starting as a database of art historians mentioned in major art historiographies, the site has grown through the comments and contributions of various authors specializing in national fields of art history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about/explanation-en Explanation on website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edith Gertrude Clements''' (1874–1971), also known as '''Edith S. Clements''' and '''Edith Schwartz Clements''', was an American botanist and pioneer of botanical ecology who was the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Nebraska.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt; She was married to botanist [[Frederic Clements]], with whom she collaborated throughout her professional life. Together they founded the Alpine Laboratory, a research station at Pikes Peak, Colorado. Clements was also a botanical artist who illustrated her own books as well as joint publications with Frederic.

Both Clementses were involved with the study of [[phytogeography]], especially those factors determining the ecology of vegetation in particular regions, and they would be praised as "the most illustrious husband-wife team since the Curies."&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=ganong/&gt; It is impossible to entirely disentangle Clements's work from that of her more famous husband.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Edith Gertrude Schwartz was born in 1874 in Albany, New York, to George and Emma (Young) Schwartz.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; Her father was a pork packer from Omaha, Nebraska.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt; She was educated at  the University of Nebraska (UNL), being elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and gaining her A.B. in German in 1898.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt; She was also a member of [[Kappa Alpha Theta]].&lt;ref&gt;''Kappa Alpha Theta,'' Vol. 22(2), January 1909, p. 164, Report of the Minneapolis, MN Alumnae Association: "It was our privilege in October to give a tea at the home of Mrs Birch in welcome to Edith Schwartz Clements of Rho chapter (University of Nebraska) whose brilliant husband has come to head the department of botany at the university. The guests included the wives of members of the faculty and also representatives from the alumnae chapters of the other women's fraternities."&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote her dissertation on "The Relation of Leaf Structure to Physical Factors" in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/dissertations/AAIDP14173/|title=Digital Commons @ University of Nebraska-Lincoln|website=University of Nebraska-Lincoln|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schwartz began her career as a teaching fellow in German at UNL (1898–1900). During this period, she met her future husband, Frederic Clements, a UNL botany professor who influenced the direction of her graduate studies. At the time, the Universities of Nebraska and Minnesota (where she would later teach) were centers for the study of phytogeography—the geographic distribution of plant species—and she chose to make this her area of specialization.&lt;ref name=ganong/&gt; She earned her doctoral degree in botany in 1904 (with a minor in Germanic philology and geology), becoming the first woman to be awarded a Ph.D. by UNL.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt;&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt;

Edith and Frederic married in 1899.&lt;ref name=esc/&gt;&lt;ref name=fec/&gt;

==Career==

[[File:Rocky mountain flowers (Plate 28) (6280208636).jpg|thumb|A Clements illustration for her book ''Rocky Mountain Flowers'' (Plate 28).]]
After gaining her Ph.D., Clements got a job as an assistant in botany at the University of Nevada (1904–07), where Frederic was teaching.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; To raise money, they spent several summers collecting plant specimens and assembled the ''Herbaria Formationum Coloradensium'', a valuable collection of some 530 specimens of Colorado mountain plants carefully annotated and supplemented by 100 photographs.&lt;ref name=ganong/&gt; It was issued in 1903 in 24 sets that were sold to scientific institutions. A few years later, they assembled another collection featuring some 615 specimens of [[cryptogams]]; this set was later (1972) issued in print form by the New York Botanical Garden.&lt;ref name=nybg/&gt;

In 1909, Clements was hired as an instructor in botany by the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, where Frederic had been hired two years before to head up the botany department.&lt;ref name=whoswho/&gt; In 1917, Frederic gave up teaching and began doing research funded by the [[Carnegie Institution]] of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=iath/&gt; For many years thereafter, Carnegie Institution funding supported their joint research endeavors, and Clements was named a field assistant by the Carnegie Institution.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt;&lt;ref name=iath/&gt;

Beginning in 1917, the Clementses spent the winters doing research at two Carnegie-funded research institutions: first at the Tucson Institute in Arizona, and then (starting in 1925) at the Coastal Laboratory in Santa Barbara, California.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt;&lt;ref name=iath/&gt; Throughout this period, their summers were spent at a botanical station they developed as a test site for plant acclimatization, Alpine Laboratory at Pikes Peak, Colorado.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt; Clements served as instructor in botany for the Alpine Laboratory, and Frederic as director.&lt;ref name=iath/&gt; They trained many botanists and ecologists at this lab during its four decades of activity, before it closed in 1940.&lt;ref name=oberg/&gt; They published jointly and individually, and Clements used her language skills to translate some of their books and articles into foreign languages.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt;

During the Dust Bowl years, Clements and Frederic drove around the Great Plains and Southwest, helping to encourage conservation measures to counter the destructive loss of farm and range land.&lt;ref name=oberg/&gt;

Clements was a botanical artist and illustrated a number of their joint publications, such as ''Rocky Mountain Flowers'' (1914) and ''Flowers of Coast and Sierra'' (1928), as well as solo publications by Frederic, including ''Plant Succession'' (1916, which she also helped to compile),&lt;ref name=oberg/&gt; ''Adaptation and Origin in the Plant World: The Role of Environment in Evolution'' (1939), and ''Dynamics of Vegetation'' (1949). In 1916, the color plates from ''Rocky Mountain Flowers'' were issued as a stand-alone guidebook to 175 of the most striking flowers of the area under the title ''Flowers of Mountain and Plain''. The novelist [[Willa Cather]], an acute oberver of nature and a friend of the Clementses, was a great admirer of their work.&lt;ref name=oberg/&gt; In a 1921 interview, Cather observed: "There is one book that I would rather have produced than all my novels. That is the Clements botany dealing with the wildflowers of the west" (by which she probably means ''Rocky Mountain Flowers'').&lt;ref name=ansari/&gt;

In 1960, at the age of eighty-six, Clements published a lively memoir, ''Adventures in Ecology: Half a Million Miles: From Mud to Macadam'', in which she told the story of "two plant ecologists who lived and worked together."&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt; It is extremely revealing in showing how many jobs Clements undertook in support of the couple's joint expeditions, ranging from chauffeur, mechanic, cook, and stenographer to photographer, artist, and botanist.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt; Indeed, Frederic himself was of the opinion that Clements would have been ranked among the world's top ecologists had she spent less time assisting his career.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;

Clements's wry style is evident in this account of the departure of one expedition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Friendly neighbors stood around, offering advice, warnings and gloomy prophecies as well as bets on the impossibility of finding space in one car for the appalling number of things that seemed to be absolutely indispensable for the venture. I won the bets for I had a diagram that showed a 'place for everything' and finally I had 'everything in its place.' That is, everything except a pile of sugared and buttered pancakes, left from breakfast. Ginger had planned to have them for lunch, but there was absolutely not a vacant spot for them, and when he wasn't looking I put them on a shelf in the garage.&lt;ref name=bonta/&gt;&lt;ref name=esc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Frederic retired in 1941 and died in 1945.&lt;ref name=iath/&gt; Edith continued to work on their joint manuscripts and write articles until her death in La Jolla in 1971.&lt;ref name=iath/&gt;

==Legacy and honors==
Clements was nominated for the Nebraska Hall of Fame in 2012.&lt;ref name=nhf/&gt;&lt;ref name=oberg/&gt;

An archive at the University of Wyoming, the Edith S. and Frederic E. Clements Papers, comprises photographs from the period 1893–1944, field notes, scientific correspondence, manuscripts and scientific papers, and Edith's diaries for the period 1907–1966.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt; In addition, the University of Nebraska has digitized a small collection of letters written by Clements to her family about a 1911 trip she and Frederic took to Europe to participate in an international meeting of botanists and ecologists.&lt;ref name=letters/&gt; Now available online, they are written with Clements's signature eye for vivid detail and knack for storytelling.

'''Ellen "Nelly" Thayer Fisher''' (April 16, 1847 – October 15, 1911) was an American [[botanical illustrator]].  Fisher exhibited her paintings at the [[National Academy of Design]]&lt;ref name="Bland"/&gt; and other exhibitions.

The '''Friends of the Uffizi Gallery''' was established in 2006 in [[Palm Beach, Florida]] as the United States "sister" organization to the Amici degli Uffizi in [[Florence, Italy]], which was founded by a group of concerned citizens in response to the terrorist bombing of the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in May 1993 that damaged several artworks and portions of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cowell|first=Alan|title=Bomb Outside Uffizi in Florence Kills 6 and Damages Many Works|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/05/28/world/bomb-outside-uffizi-in-florence-kills-6-and-damages-many-works.html|accessdate=21 April 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi directly support the Uffizi Gallery by helping build awareness of the museum and its [[cultural heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Cultural Heritage|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/illicit-trafficking-of-cultural-property/unesco-database-of-national-cultural-heritage-laws/frequently-asked-questions/definition-of-the-cultural-heritage/|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by raising funds for acquisitions, preservation, restorations, temporary exhibitions, and educational programming.

== History ==
[[File:Uffizi Gallery from south 2013 February.jpg|thumb|250px|Uffizi Gallery viewed from the south]]

In 1993 a terrorist bomb severely damaged the [[Uffizi Gallery]] and some of the artworks.&lt;ref name=Olive&gt;{{cite news|last=Pirro|first=Deirdre|title=The Olive Tree of Peace: The massacre in via dei Georgofili|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=7762|accessdate=25 April 2014|newspaper=The Florentine|date=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this attack, a group of concerned citizens founded the Amici degli Uffizi in Florence to help restore and preserve the artistic heritage of the museum. Since the bombing, the Amici degli Uffizi has supported the Uffizi Gallery by facilitating acquisitions, supporting restorations, and organizing special temporary exhibitions.

In 2006, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery, Inc. was established in Palm Beach, Florida as the United States “sister” organization to the Amici degli Uffizi. Granted 501(c)(3) Tax Exempt Status, its sole purpose is to support the activities of the Amici by helping to fund ongoing restoration projects and to bring these projects to fruition.

Led by Executive Board President Contessa Maria Vittoria Colonna Rimbotti, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery in conjunction with the Amici degli Uffizi raises funds to support all of these activities through an international group of members and patrons. More than 30 restoration projects designated as priorities by the museum have been completed over the last several years and include renowned paintings, altarpieces, sculptures and tapestries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completed Restoration Projects|url=http://www.friendsoftheuffizigallery.org/completed-restoration-projects/|publisher=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery|accessdate=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The mission of both organizations is to support the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy, by raising awareness of the museum and its collections and by providing resources for acquisition, preservation, restoration and education.
 
The mission of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery is to support the Amici degli Uffizi in raising funds and resources for the acquisition, restoration, preservation and maintenance of the Uffizi Gallery's cultural heritage as prioritized by its Director, Antonio Natali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Mission|url=http://www.friendsoftheuffizigallery.org/mission/|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol ===
Created by Sergio Bianco, the symbol represents the view of the Uffizi from the Arno arcade. The sky seen under the archway forms the shape of a horse head in the typical posture of the knight chess piece. Representing loyalty and the right cause, the horse symbolizes the commitment of the Associations Amici degli Uffizi and Friends of the Uffizi Gallery to the benefit of the Uffizi Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery Symbol|url=http://www.sergiobianco.it/basement.asp?sn=&amp;sez=1&amp;sez1=1&amp;area=&amp;lang=en&amp;nome=&amp;lay=articolo&amp;pag=69|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities and special events ==

===Florentine weekend, Florence Italy===
Every two years, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery organize the Florentine Weekend, which includes art-focused activities at the Uffizi Gallery and in nearby locations throughout the City of Florence that relate to both Renaissance art and Italian culture. It is a members-only event open to Friends of the Uffizi Gallery members at the Botticelli, Michelangelo and Leonardo membership levels.

== Completed restoration projects ==
[[File:Michelangelo- Tondo Doni - tone corrected.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo's ''Tondo Doni'' is the centerpiece of the new room reconstructed through funds from the Friends of Uffizi Gallery]]
More than thirty restorations designated as a priority by the Uffizi Gallery have been completed with funds raised by both Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and Amici degli Uffizi.

The '''Michelangelo Room''', which opened to the public on January 29, 2013, is an example of a completed project by this organization.  The Friends of the Uffizi Gallery and the Amici degli Uffizi funded the re-construction of this room on the second floor and the re-installation of the paintings. The re-construction involved restoring the original marble floor and re-plastering the walls and painting them red. 
The re-installation included Michelangelo’s ''[[Doni Tondo|Tondo Doni]]'' (ca. 1507 oil and tempera on panel) which is the only confirmed panel painting existing today in its original frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends of the Uffizi Gallery fund new Michelangelo Room on second floor of gallery in Italy|url=http://artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=60758#.U15_RF7Zdg0|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Art Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Other early sixteenth-century Florentine painters represented in the room include [[Francesco Granacci]], [[Fra Bartolomeo]] (Paolo di Jacopo del Fattorino detto Baccio della Porta), [[Andrea del Sarto]], [[Franciabigio]], [[Giuliano Bugiardini]],  and [[Alonso Berruguete]].

'''''[[Laocoön]]''''' by [[Baccio Bandinelli]] (Firenze 1493-1560), depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his two sons ensnared in the toils of the sea serpents sent by [[Poseidon]]. A previous restoration was done when the sculpture was broken into more than 40 pieces by a fire that caused a partial roof collapse at the Uffizi on August 12, 1762. The new restoration improved on the previous one plus removed layers of dust and wax that had built up over the decades and caused the sculpture’s surface to become dull and darkened. This restoration will protect the beauty and condition of this sculpture for many generations.

== Individual restoration projects ==
These two projects are examples of restorations funded by a single Leonardo-level member of the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery.

The restoration of this late 2nd Century A.D. replica of a 5th Century B.C. Greek sculpture of '''''[[Asclepius]]''''', the god of medicine, made it possible to confirm the pertinence of the head to the body. In addition to strengthening the sculpture by replacing old putty, recent cleaning of the surface revealed details from an early 12th Century restoration such as the figure’s left hand holding a medicinal plant well known since the Middle Ages. This restoration was funded by the Lisa Marie Conte Browne Family.

This mid-2nd Century A.D. statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]] &amp; [[Eros]]''''' is a replica of the original Capitoline Venus, apart from the addition of the small funerary Eros. The sculpture’s head, arms and right leg were integrated in 1584. The sculpture is likely to have never been restored since then and the recent restoration included removing the dirt deposits and addressing the ancient integrations and fractures repairs. This restoration was funded by Thomas J. and Judith A. Embrescia.

== Community restoration projects ==
With this type of project, the Friends of the Uffizi Gallery accepts donations from all sources (including non-members) interested in conserving a selected work of art.

The 2014 project is a statue of '''''[[Aphrodite]]''''' (2nd Century AD). She is the Greek goddess of love, known as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] to the Romans. This sculpture is a standing semi-nude female figure created using the ancient Roman fragments of the torso and head. The arms aned richly-draped lower part were added by [[Alessandro Algardi]], an artist hired by the Medici in the 17th Century to integrate the fragments into a single sculpture. This restoration project involved removing thick layers of accumulated dust and greatly increased documentary information.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3781">'''Geomontography''' was a printing method, that consisted in the combination of [[Paper embossing|embossing]] and of multiple color printing, and that was used primarily for the production of maps.&lt;ref name="Daumas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Daumas |first1=Maurice |date= |year=1970 |title=A History of Technology &amp; Invention: The expansion of mechanization, 1725-1860 |url= |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=English |location= |publisher=Crown Publishers |pages=701–702 |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The color layers were applied using [[lithography|lithographic techniques]], and then the embossing was used to give relief to buildings, walls, mountains and other architectural and geographic features. Sometimes, the raised elements of the map were left unprinted, such as in Bauerkeller's 1846 map of Paris, while the rest of the picture was printed with vivid colors. The same method was sometimes used for the production of relief prints of buildings, plants, sculptures, landscape views or other graphic motives. Several of these maps were exposed at the Industrial World Fair of Paris in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hebenstreit |first1=Wilhelm |date= |year= |title=Wissenschaftlich-literarische Encyclopädie der Ästhetik |trans-title=Scientific-literary encyclopedia of aesthetics |url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=03GppzIhgg4C |access-date=|dead-url= |format= |language=German |location= |publisher=Georg Olms Verlag |page=297 |pages= |isbn= |archive-url= |archive-date= |via= |subscription= |quote= |trans-quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique was developed by the German printer [[Georg Michael Bauerkeller]] (1805 - 1886) and his half-brother Georg Leonhart Bauerkeller, who worked in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and in [[Karlsruhe]] before opening a printing and embossing office in Paris in the late 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darmstadt-stadtlexikon.de/b/bauerkeller-praegeanstalt.html |title=Bauerkeller, Prägeanstalt |author= |date= |website=Stadtlexicon Darmstadt |publisher=Historischer Verein für Hessen e.V. |access-date= |language=german}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Michael Bauerkeller deposited a patent application for his invention in France, in January the 18th, 1839. However, even if the manufacturing process was patented, the term ''geomontographie'' (''geomontography'') was not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dörflinger |first=Johannes| date=1981 |title=Dauer und Kosten des Karten-Kupferstichs — dargestellt an Hand von Karten des Wiener Verlags Artaria &amp; Co. aus der 1.

Jahrhunderts. |trans-title= |url= |language=German |journal=International Yearbook of Cartography |volume=21 |issue= |pages=85 |doi= |access-date= |publisher=Universitätsverlag Ulm GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process was adopted for the teaching of the blind, and maps embossed in that manner where employed at Paris' [[Institut National des Jeunes Aveugles|Institut des Jeunes Aveugles]] (Institute for the Blind Youth), that were offered to the children for them to finger-read.&lt;ref name="Daumas"/&gt; Laas d'Aguen, a supervisor of the institute, reinforced the printed maps by embossing additional layers of blank paper using the same [[platen]], so the paper sheets would stick together creating a rigid cardboard material. This was done so to avoid deforming and damaging the paper under the blind readers finger's pressure.

'''Sir George Pirie''' [[Royal Scottish Academy|PRSA]] (1863–1946) was a Scottish artist who was associated with the [[Glasgow Boys]] in the 1880s, though he was not in much sympathy with the theories of these artists.&lt;ref&gt;Biography in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40594?docPos=2&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was born in [[Campbeltown]], [[Argyllshire]], on 5 December 1863. His father was John Pirie, a physician and surgeon, and his mother was Jane Harvey.&lt;ref&gt;Births, marriages and deaths information: http://scotlandspeople.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;  As a child the family moved to Glasgow, where his father was a popular and well-known physician. He educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and graduated M.A. at [[Glasgow University]] in 1882.  He studied at [[Glasgow School of Art]], the [[Slade School]], and the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris under [[Gustave Boulanger]], [[Jules Lefebvre]], and [[Emmanuel Frémiet]] the sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;Biography in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&lt;/ref&gt; 

He painted animals and birds, as well as some landscapes. In the early 1890s he was in Texas for a period, drawing horses and ranching scenes. He exhibited widely, including at the Royal Academy as well as in Scotland and the provinces. 

He served as President of the [[Royal Scottish Academy]] from 1933 to 1944 and was knighted in 1937. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite book|title= Scotland, CEMA and the Arts Council, 1919-1967|first = Euan|last=McArthur}} &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 he had married Jean Wingate in Glasgow with whom had two sons and a daughter. The family lived in a large isolated house in [[Torrance, East Dunbartonshire|Torrance]] with enough space for all of them to pursue their own interests. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|author=W. S. Pierpoint|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-norman-pirie-1268626.html |title=Obituary: Norman Pirie - People - News|publisher=The Independent |date=1997-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The younger son was the biochemist [[Norman Wingate Pirie]]. He was knighted in 1937, and died in Torrance on 17 February 1946, aged 82.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9380">The '''ISO 22715 standard''' provides guidelines for manufacturers in the best practices for [[cosmetic packaging|cosmetic packaging and labelling]] of all [[cosmetics|cosmetic products]]. This standard applies to products that fall under the category of cosmetics that are sold or given away as free [[Product sample|samples]]. ISO 22715 was initially published in April 2006.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosper|first1=Alex|title=Cosmetic packaging compliant to ISO 22715|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/cosmetic-packaging-compliant-to-iso-22715|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics -- Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The intent of Standard ISO 22715 is to specify how cosmetic products should be packaged and labeled to maintain a certain level of standards within the [[cosmetic industry]]. This standard applies to cosmetic products whether the product is sold or given away. It is one of 26 published standards that are devoted to the cosmetic industry sector.&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;

ISO 22715 does not regulate what products are to be considered cosmetic. This determination is left to the national [[Regulation (European Union)|regulations]] of those countries that follow the ISO 22715 and use it as a guide to best practices for packaging and labeling cosmetic products. Often, these national regulations are stricter than those provided in the standard are.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the Standard ISO 22715 on Cosmetic Packaging legally binding?|url=http://www.desjardin.fr/blog/is-the-standard-iso-22715-on-cosmetic-packaging-legally-binding|publisher=Desjardin|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labeling specifications==

ISO 22715 supports the need for consumers to know what is in the cosmetic products they purchase, how those products should be used and who has manufactured the products. To accomplish this, 22715 specifies that a product’s packaging should show certain information such as the [[ingredient]]s used in the product listed in descending order according to the percentage of each ingredient in the product. A list of coloring agents used in the product then follows the list of ingredients.

For safety purposes, ISO recommends including an explanation of what the product function is on the package, along with instructions for its use. Any precautionary or warning statements should also be printed on the package to caution consumers in the use of said product. Additional information that should appear on the packaging of cosmetic products includes:

* Manufacturer’s name and address
* Date of manufacture or batch number that can be used to identify the product
* Product’s weight or volume at the time it was packaged
* Recommendations for storage of the product
* ISO 22715 provides guidelines to be followed in how that information should appear on the packaging. If applicable, requirements are provided for primary and secondary packaging.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO22715:2006" /&gt;

==Relevance of ISO standards==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) was formed in 1947. It is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that is based in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The ISO has 162 members and the organization represents the interest of international standards of 196 countries. This represents almost 97 percent of the world’s population.

The ISO’s purpose is to create standards that are used to help form public policies and business objectives that benefit people throughout the world. Since May 2016, there has been over 21,500 ISO standards published. The ISO develops new standards when industry sectors and their stakeholders determine that a need exists. The standards are developed under the oversight of the ISO through cooperative efforts between other NGOs, consumer organizations, representatives from [[government agencies]], academics and testing laboratories.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-ISO22715" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

==Legal relevance of ISO 22715==

ISO 22715 is not legally binding, but it is the common denominator used for developing national regulations that address the labeling and packaging of cosmetic products. Regulators in individual countries often look to ISO standards as the benchmark for best practices for the different industry sectors in which they apply. Many regulators require businesses and manufacturers to comply with applicable ISO standards, in addition to local regulations.&lt;ref name="Turner-legally binding" /&gt;

Currently, there are 26 published ISO standards devoted to the cosmetic sector, including ISO 22715. These standards are overseen by the ISO’s cosmetic product technical committee that was established in 1998.&lt;ref name="ISO-Office-and-Number"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 Cosmetics|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_technical_committee%3Fcommid%3D54974|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This committee is composed of standardization bodies from major markets, such as leading ASEAN countries, most European counties and the United States via ANSI. Thirty-nine countries participate in the creation of standards for cosmetic products, with 27 observing countries within the committee.&lt;ref name="ISO-Countries"&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO/TC 217 - Cosmetics_ Participating and Observing Countries|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee_participation.htm?commid=54974|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To better distribute and update standards as needed, the ISO maintains the copyright on its standards. Most standards are reviewed and updated every five to seven years to remain relevant to the latest technologies within [[industry sector]]s.&lt;ref name="IP-watch-on-ISO"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saez|first1=Catherine|title=International Standards Key To Helping The World With Many Issues, ISO Says|url=http://www.ip-watch.org/2012/05/18/international-standards-key-to-helping-the-world-with-many-issues-iso-says/|publisher=Intellectual Property Watch|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO 22715 and local regulations==

Often, local regulations may exceed the requirements specified in ISO 22715. In the [[United States]], the Food &amp; Drug Administration ([[FDA]]) regulates the cosmetic industry&lt;ref name="FDA-Cosmetics&amp;US-Law"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosmetics &amp; U.S. Law |url=http://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/GuidanceRegulation/LawsRegulations/ucm2005209.htm|publisher=U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA)|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with standards that are provided by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), in which the FDA is member.&lt;ref name="StandardsConformityBook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=National Research Council (U.S.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13582">[[File:Jean-Pierre Ponnelle Strasbourg 1980.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]]
'''Jean-Pierre Ponnelle''' (19 February 1932 – 11 August 1988) was a French opera [[Theatre director|director]], [[scenographer]] and [[costume designer]].

==Biography==
Ponnelle was born in Paris. He studied philosophy, art, and history there and, in 1952, began his career in Germany as a theatre designer for [[Hans Werner Henze]]'s opera ''[[Boulevard Solitude]]''. He was greatly influenced by the work of art director [[Georges Wakhévitch]] who also designed sets and costumes for the theatre, the ballet, and the opera.

In 1962, Ponnelle directed his first production of [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' in [[Düsseldorf]]. His production of that opera at the [[Bayreuth Festival]] in 1981 was widely praised as one of the most aesthetically beautiful in its history.

His work throughout the world included stage productions at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] and the [[San Francisco Opera]]; productions for television (a ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' in 1974 notable for performances by [[Mirella Freni]] and the young [[Plácido Domingo]]); and filmed versions of operas such as the well-known [[Karl Böhm]]-conducted ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]''. His 1969 production of [[Mozart]]'s then neglected ''[[La Clemenza di Tito]]'' for [[Cologne]] helped re-establish this work in the repertory. Ponnelle also was a frequent guest at the [[Salzburg Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salzburgerfestspiele.at/dieinstitution/geschichte/  Salzbug Festival website (in English)] Retrieved 3 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, his productions were controversial. His 1986 ''[[Aida]]'' at [[Covent Garden]], in which he replaced the usual ballet dancers with young boys, was soundly booed and never revived, though his earlier ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' at the same theatre had been a triumph,&lt;ref&gt;Pfaff, ''San Francisco Chronicle'': "Welcome as it may be to find Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's infamous 1975 Eurotrash production of the work, presented as "The Steersman's Dream", (which held the War Memorial stage for three of the company's five presentations of the piece) banished, presumably forever, it can still be a strain to discern ''Dutchman''.&lt;/ref&gt; as were his interpretations of well-known works.
&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Andrew, ''The Times'': "Only in recent years have directors taken it upon themselves to rewrite Wagner's stage actions, to intervene, to move from simplification to new invention. Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's idea at Bayreuth, in 1981, was that Isolde should not appear in Act Three but be an off-stage voice sounding in Tristan's mind"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chatfield-Taylor, p. 63: "Some critics felt that there was...perversity in Ponnelle's conception of ''(Rigoletto)'' as a flashback that begins with Gilda already dead, lying on the floor during the Prelude".&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Munich]], Germany in 1988 of a [[pulmonary embolism]] following a tragic fall into the orchestra pit during rehearsals for a production of ''Carmen'' with the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]] under [[Zubin Mehta]]. His son is the orchestra conductor [[Pierre-Dominique Ponnelle]] and his nephew is [[Jean Pierre Danel]].

'''John Ryan''' (1925–1992) was an Irish artist, broadcaster, publisher, critic, editor, and [[Public house|publican]].

Ryan was a well-known man of letters, artist and a key figure in bohemian Dublin of the 1940s and 1950s. Founded [[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]], in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions. Friend and intimate (and sometime benefactor) to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war era, such as [[Patrick Kavanagh]] and [[Brendan Behan]]; Ryan's memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', evoke literary Dublin of the period 1945-55. Involved in numerous literary events and happenings and, with [[Brian O'Nolan]], organised the first [[Bloomsday]].

==Biography==
John Ryan attended [[Clongowes Wood College]] and the [[National College of Art and Design]] (NCAD), Dublin. One of the eight children of [[Séamus Ryan]],&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; a member of [[Seanad Éireann]], and his wife Agnes Ryan née Harding who came from Kilfeacle and Solohead respectively in [[County Tipperary]] and who were [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] activists during the [[Irish War of Independence]]. His mother was a patron of the painter [[Jack Yeats]], amongst others. His sister was the actress [[Kathleen Ryan]]. Several of Ryan's children followed him into the arts: son and namesake [[John Ryan (publisher)|John Ryan]] (journalist, publisher and actor); [[Seamus Ryan (photographer)|Seamus Ryan]]  (photographer); Anna Livia Ryan (actress).&lt;ref name=ria-dict1&gt;{{cite book| last = McGuire| first = James| last2 = Quinn | first2 = James |year=2009|title=Dictionary of Irish Biography|volume= Volume V|location=Dublin|publisher= Royal Irish Academy-Cambridge University Press|ISBN = 978-0-521-63331-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ryan studied at the [[National College of Art and Design|NCAD]], but was largely a self-taught painter through a practice of 'careful intelligent observation' combined with 'a genuine and humorous love of land, sea and human tradition' (Hilary Pyle, 'John Ryan exhibition in Cork', [[The Irish Times]], 23 October 1981). He was a regular exhibitor at the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA) from 1946 onwards, and also showed at the annual Oireachtas and the Irish Exhibition of Living Art (IELA). Designed theatre sets for the [[Abbey Theatre|Abbey]], [[Gate Theatre|Gate]], [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia]] and [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatres]] as well as for the stage in London. He also acted in and produced several plays.

In response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions founded ''[[Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art]]'' (1949–1951), and was editor of ''[[The Dublin Magazine]]'' from 1970–75. As a writer and critic he contributed to literary magazines and newspapers. Publishing two memoirs, ''Remembering How We Stood'', a memoir of post-war literary Dublin, and ''A Wave of the Sea'' (Ward River, 1981), a marine memoir. A broadcaster from the early 1950s he became a long-time contributor to Sunday Miscellany on [[Radio Éireann]] (RTÉ Radio). Purchased The Bailey pub in 1957 which became a famous literary venue frequented by characters such as Kavanagh, O'Nolan, et al. A friend and intimate to a number of struggling artists and writers in the post-war period, such as [[Brendan Behan|Behan]], [[Anthony Cronin]], [[Patrick Swift]], [[Seán O'Sullivan (painter)|Seán O'Sullivan]], [[Pearse Hutchinson]], [[J. P. Donleavy]] and [[Brian O'Nolan]], et al., he was also a benefactor to some of these artists, particularly Patrick Kavanagh. During the war years he very cheaply rented a space above the family's Monument Creameries store (now a Burger King) on Grafton Street to sculptor [[Desmond MacNamara]], and which became the site for a famous bohemian salon attended by all of the foregoing names and many more.

Ryan was an important early champion of James Joyce's work in Ireland at a time when Joyce was largely ignored in his homeland: with Brian O'Nolan he organised the first [[Bloomsday]] celebration; in 1951 to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce he published a special number  of ''Envoy'' dedicated to Joyce "which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countryman towards their illustrious compatriot"&lt;ref&gt;John Ryan, introduction to ''A Bash In The Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish (Brighton: Clifton Books, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  (Envoy, Vol. 5, No. 17, April 1951), inviting Brian O'Nolan to be guest editor; edited ''A Bash in the Tunnel'': James Joyce by the Irish, [[Patrick Kavanagh]], [[Brian O'Nolan]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Ulick O'Connor]], [[Edna O'Brien]] (Brighton: Clifton Books 1970); saved [[Leopold Bloom]]'s front door to 7 Eccles Street from demolition and used it in The Bailey pub in St. Anne Street, Dublin, from whence it was removed and transported to the Joyce Museum on N. Gt. George's St., Oct. 1995; arranged that the [[James Joyce Tower and Museum|James Joyce Tower]] become a museum; Secretary of the James Joyce Society of Ireland 1970–74.

==Envoy==
December 1949– July 1951. Founded and edited by Ryan.
Envoy was inaugurated in response to Irish trade and censorship restrictions which had forced many writers to seek publication outside their homeland.
During its brief existence, ''Envoy, A Review of Literature and Art'', published the work of a broad range of writers, Irish and others. The first to publish [[J. P. Donleavy]], [[Brendan Behan]]'s first short stories and his first poem, and an extract from [[Samuel Beckett]]'s Watt. Envoy included [[Patrick Kavanagh]]'s infamous monthly "Diary". [[Brian O'Nolan]] was another substantial contributor and was "honorary editor"&lt;ref&gt;'In 1951, whilst I was editor of the Irish literary periodical Envoy, I decided that it would be a fitting thing to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of James Joyce by bringing out a special number dedicated to him which would reflect the attitudes and opinions of his fellow countrymen towards their illustrious compatriot. To this end I began by inviting Brian Nolan to act as honorary editor for this particular issue. His own genius closely matched, without in anyway resembling or attempting to counterfeit, Joyce's. But if the mantle of Joyce (or should we say the waistcoat?) were ever to be passed on, nobody would be half so deserving of it as the man whom under his other guises as Flann O'Brien and Myles Na gCopaleen, proved himself incontestably to be the most creative writer and mordant wit that Ireland had given us since Shem the Penman himself.' – John Ryan, Introduction to ''A Bash in the Tunnel'' (1970) [http://www.ricorso.net/rx/az-data/authors/r/Ryan_J2/life.htm John Ryan (1925–92) Ricorso.net]&lt;/ref&gt; for the special number commemorating James Joyce.

==Remembering How We Stood==
An affectionate account of Bohemian Dublin in the 1950s with Behan, Kavanagh, J. P. Donleavy (q.v.), Anthony Cronin and other Dublin characters. Ryan:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Dublin was a town of ‘characters’ then as now, and I suppose will ever be. A man I knew was taking a stroll down Grafton Street one day when he happened to overhear part of a discussion which three citizens were having outside Mitchell’s café. The gist of their dialogue was that they were deploring the absence from the Dublin scene of any real ‘characters’. They appeared to be genuinely aggrieved. They were, in fact, Myles na gCopaleen, Sean O’Sullivan and Brendan Behan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the foreword by [[J. P. Donleavy]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As one reads his words, dressed in their wonderful finery of irony, the world he speaks of reblossoms to be back again awhile. To see, feel and smell the Dublin of that day... a masterpiece of reminiscence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==First Bloomsday Celebration==

BLOOMSDAY (a term Joyce himself did not employ) was invented in 1954, the 50th anniversary, when John Ryan and the novelist [[Flann O'Brien]] organised what was to be a daylong pilgrimage along the Ulysses route. They were joined by Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Tom Joyce (a dentist who, as Joyce's cousin, represented the family interest) and AJ Leventhal (Registrar of Trinity College). Ryan had engaged two horse drawn cabs, of the old-fashioned kind, which in Ulysses Mr. Bloom and his friends drive to poor Paddy Dignam's funeral. The party were assigned roles from the novel. They planned to travel round the city through the day, visiting in turn the scenes of the novel, ending at night in what had once been the brothel quarter of the city, the area which Joyce had called Nighttown. The pilgrimage was abandoned halfway through, when the weary pilgrims succumbed to inebriation and rancour at the Bailey pub in the city centre, which Ryan then owned, and at which, in 1967, he installed the door to No. 7 Eccles Street (Leopold Bloom's front door) having rescued it from demolition . A Bloomsday record of 1954, informally filmed by John Ryan, follows this pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~maelduin/firstbloom.html An account of the first Bloomsday]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patrick Kavanagh: 'O commemorate me where there is water'==
Whenever you mention Patrick Kavanagh’s seat on the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand Canal Dublin]], most people will immediately think of the more famous park bench with the statue of Paddy himself sitting to one side of the seat almost beckoning for someone to sit down beside him. This bench is situated on the north bank of the Grand Canal between [[Baggot Street]] Bridge and the upstream Eustace Bridge. John Coll produced the sculpture and the seat was unveiled by President [[Mary Robinson]] on 11 June 1991, however this is not the original seat.
Only a relatively few people will be aware of the lesser known original Kavanagh seat situated on the South Bank at the Lock Gates close to Baggot Street Bridge. As is well known from his poem and heavy hints to his friends, he wished to be commemorated with a simple canal side seat near the lock gates of Baggot Street Bridge. To this effect shortly after his death in 1967, a committee was formed by the late John Ryan and Denis Dwyer to collect a sum of money to purchase the materials and labour for the seat. The seat was erected in the poet's memory by his friends in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Liam Brady. His father and namesake was one of the original committee members, with John Ryan, of the Grand Canal South Bank Seat [http://kavanaghseat.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moellman had been a member of [[New York City]]'s Kit Kat Club, which served as inspiration for Kokoon. From 1913 to 1946 Kokoon's annual Bal-Masque balls scandalized Cleveland with risqué activities, provocative art, and nudity, and was sometimes wagishly referred to as the "Cocaine Club". A fierce rivalry stood between Kokoon and the more conservative [[Cleveland Society of Artists]].

'''''La Revue blanche''''' was a French art and [[literary magazine]] run between 1889 and 1903. Some of the greatest writers and artists of the time were its collaborators.

==History==
The ''Revue blanche'' was founded in [[Liège]] in 1889 and run by the Natanson brothers (Alexander, Thaddeus and Louis-Alfred, aka "Alfred Athis"). In 1891, the magazine moved to [[Paris]] where it rivaled the ''[[Mercure de France]]'', hence its name, which served mark the difference with the ''Mercure'''s  purple cover. During the early years the magazine was associated with [[Marcel Proust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ellison|title=A Reader's Guide to Proust's 'In Search of Lost Time'|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBv3wE6l-RYC&amp;pg=PA12|accessdate=21 November 2014|date=18 February 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-78909-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thaddeus's wife, Misia, participated in the launch of the magazine and served as a model for some covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toulouse-Lautrec, Henri de|url=http://www.masterworksfineart.com/inventory/4707|publisher=Masterworks Fine Art|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics [[Lucien Muhlfeld]] and [[Félix Fénéon]] from 1896 to 1903 served as secretaries, as well as [[Léon Blum]] himself.

The journal served as a representative for the cultural and artistic intelligentsia of the time. Starting from 1898, at the instigation of [[Lucien Herr]], it contributed to the [[Dreyfus affair]],&lt;ref name=ven&gt;{{cite book|author=Venita Datta|title=Birth of a National Icon: The Literary Avant-Garde and the Origins of the Intellectual in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AdSfgOC9n8AC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=21 November 2014|year=1999|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-4207-4|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; siding with the captain accused of treason. During this period the magazine developed close relations with [[Emile Durkheim]].&lt;ref name=ven/&gt;

[[Octave Mirbeau]] published his ''[[The Diary of a Chambermaid (novel)|Diary of a Chambermaid]]'' in serial form in the ''Revue blanche'' in 1900.

The ''Revue blanche'' disappeared in 1903 after 237 issues.&lt;ref name=rut&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the European Nineteenth-Century Rare Journals at the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University|url=http://www.zimmerlimuseum.rutgers.edu/finding-aid-nineteenth-c-journals|work=Rutgers University|accessdate=31 May 2015|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Leningrad Codex''' (Latin: ''Codex Leningradensis'', the "[[codex]] of [[Leningrad]]") is the oldest ''complete'' manuscript of the [[Hebrew Bible]] in Hebrew, using the [[Masoretic Text]] and [[Tiberian vocalization]].&lt;ref&gt;There are older manuscripts of translations into other languages, such as the [[Codex Amiatinus]] in Latin.&lt;/ref&gt; It is dated 1008 CE (or possibly 1009) according to its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]].&lt;ref&gt;Foreword by Gérard E. Weil to ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Aleppo Codex]], against which the Leningrad Codex was corrected, is several decades older, but parts of it have been missing since 1947, making the Leningrad Codex the oldest complete codex of the Tiberian mesorah that has survived intact to this day.

In modern times, the Leningrad Codex is significant as the Hebrew text reproduced in ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (1937) and ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (1977). It also serves as a primary source for the recovery of details in the missing parts of the Aleppo Codex.

==Name==
The Leningrad Codex (a codex is a handwritten book as opposed to a [[scroll]]) is so named because it has been housed at the [[National Library of Russia]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] since 1863. In 1924, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], Petrograd (formerly Saint Petersburg) was renamed Leningrad, and, because the codex was used as the basic text for the Biblia Hebraica since 1937, it became internationally known as the "Leningrad Codex". Although in 1991, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city's original name was restored to St Petersburg, the National Library of Russia requested that "Leningrad" be retained in the name of the codex. Nonetheless, the Codex is occasionally referred to as the Codex Petersburgensis or Petropolitanus, or the St. Petersburg Codex. This is ambiguous as, since 1876, these appellations refer to a different biblical codex (MS. Heb B 3) which is even older (916 CE), but contains only the later Prophets.

==Contents==
The biblical text as found in the codex contains the Hebrew letter-text along with Tiberian [[niqqud|vowels]] and [[cantillation]] signs. In addition, there are [[masoretic notes]] in the margins. There are also various technical supplements dealing with textual and linguistic details, many of which are painted in geometrical forms. The codex is written on parchment and bound in leather.

The Leningrad Codex, in extraordinarily pristine condition after a millennium, also provides an example of medieval Jewish art. Sixteen of the pages contain decorative geometric patterns that illuminate passages from the text. The [[carpet page]] shows a star with the names of the scribes on the edges and a blessing written in the middle.

The order of the books in the Leningrad Codex follows the Tiberian textual tradition, which is also that of the later tradition of [[Sephardic]] biblical manuscripts. This order for the books differs markedly from that of most printed Hebrew bibles for the books of the [[Ketuvim]]. In the Leningrad Codex, the order of the Ketuvim is: Chronicles, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ruth, Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Esther, Daniel, Ezra-Nehemiah. The full order of the books is given below.

==History==
[[File:LeningradCodex text.jpg|thumb|Leningrad Codex text sample, portions of Exodus 15:21-16:3]]

According to its [[colophon (publishing)|colophon]], the [[codex]] was copied in [[Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stuhlman|first1=Daniel D.|title=The Leningrad Codex|url=http://home.earthlink.net/~ddstuhlman/crc10.htm|publisher=Librarian's Lobby|accessdate=13 October 2014|date=1 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; from manuscripts written by [[Aaron ben Moses ben Asher]]. It has been claimed to be a product of the Asher scriptorium itself; however, there is no evidence that Asher ever saw it. Unusual for a masoretic codex, the same man (Samuel ben Jacob) wrote the consonants, the vowels and the Masoretic notes. In its vocalization system (vowel points and [[cantillation]]) it is considered by scholars to be the most faithful representative of ben Asher's tradition apart from the Aleppo Codex (edited by ben Asher himself). Its letter-text is not superb, however, and contradicts its own masoretic apparatus in many hundreds of places.&lt;ref&gt;On the vocalization and letter-text of the Leningrad Codex see Israel Yeivin, ''The Aleppo Codex of the Bible: A Study of its Vocalization and Accentuation (Jerusalem: Magnes, 1968) pp. 357-359 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; There are numerous alterations and erasures, and it was suggested by [[Moshe Goshen-Gottstein]] that an existing text not following Asher's rules was heavily amended so as to make it conform to these rules.

The codex is now preserved in the [[National Library of Russia]], accessioned as "Firkovich B 19 A". Its former owner, the [[Crimean Karaite]] collector [[Abraham Firkovich]], left no indication in his writings where he had acquired the codex, which was taken to Odessa in 1838 and later transferred to the Imperial Library in St Petersburg.

==Modern editions==
===Biblia Hebraica===
In 1935, the Leningrad Codex was lent to the Old Testament Seminar of the University of Leipzig for two years while [[Paul E. Kahle]] supervised its transcription for the Hebrew text of the third edition of ''[[Biblia Hebraica (Kittel)|Biblia Hebraica]]'' (BHK), published in Stuttgart, 1937. The codex was also used for ''[[Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia]]'' (BHS) in 1977, and is being used for [[Biblia Hebraica Quinta]] (BHQ).

As an original work by Tiberian masoretes, the Leningrad Codex was older by several centuries than the other Hebrew manuscripts which had been used for all previous editions of printed Hebrew bibles until [[Biblia Hebraica (disambiguation)|Biblia Hebraica]].

The Westminster Leningrad Codex is an online digital version of the Leningrad Codex maintained by the J. Alan Groves Center for Advanced Biblical Research at the [[Westminster Theological Seminary]]. This is a verified version of the Michigan-Claremont text, transcribed from BHS at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1981-1982 under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (of the University of Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (of the Institute for Antiquity and Christianity, Claremont Graduate University) with funding from the Packard Foundation and the University of Michigan,&lt;ref&gt;Introductory notes to the Bibleworks WTT text, www.bibleworks.com&lt;/ref&gt; with further proofreading and corrections. The online version includes transcription notes and tools for analyzing syntax.

===Jewish editions===
The Leningrad Codex also served as the basis for two important modern Jewish editions of the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]):
*The [[Aron Dotan|Dotan]] edition, which was distributed to soldiers in mass quantities as the official [[Tanakh]] of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] throughout the 1990s.
*The [[New Jewish Publication Society of America Version|''JPS Hebrew-English Tanakh'']] (Philadelphia, 1999) and the various volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary and JPS Bible Commentary.

For minute masoretic details, however, Israeli and Jewish scholars have shown a marked preference for modern Hebrew editions based upon the Aleppo Codex. These editions use the Leningrad Codex as the most important source (but not the only one) for the reconstruction of parts of the Aleppo Codex that have been missing since 1947.

==Models==
There are five major models, that sub-divide into others, which are: CIE, RGB, YUV, HSL/HSV, and CMYK.
[[Image:AdditiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Additive color mixing]]
[[Image:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumbnail|200px|Subtractive color mixing]]

==CIE==
===CIE 1931 XYZ===
{{main|CIE 1931 color space}}
(aka "CIE 1931")
The first attempt to produce a color space based on measurements of human color perception and the basis for almost all other color spaces.

===CIELUV===
{{main|CIELUV}}
A modification of "CIE 1931 XYZ" to display color differences more conveniently. The CIELUV space is especially useful for additive mixtures of lights, due to its linear addition properties.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Keith McLaren; "Dyes, General Survey" in: ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry''; Wiley-VCH; 15 June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CIELAB===
{{main|Lab color space}}
The intention of CIELAB (or L*a*b* or Lab) is to produce a color space that is more perceptually linear than other color spaces. Perceptually linear means that a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of about the same visual importance. CIELAB has almost entirely replaced an alternative related Lab color space "Hunter Lab". This space is commonly used for surface colors, but not for mixtures of (transmitted) light.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"/&gt;

===CIEUVW===
{{main|CIE 1964 color space}}
Measurements over a larger field of view than the "CIE 1931 XYZ" color space which produces slightly different results.

==RGB==
===RGB===
{{main|RGB color model|RGB color spaces}}
RGB (Red, Green, Blue) describes what kind of ''light'' needs to be ''emitted'' to produce a given color. Light is added together to create form from darkness. RGB stores individual values for red, green and blue. RGB is not a color space, it is a color model. There are many different RGB color spaces derived from this color model, some of which appear below.

[[RGBA color space|RGBA]] is RGB with an additional channel, alpha, to indicate transparency.

===sRGB===
{{main|sRGB color space}}
The '''sRGB color space''', or '''standard RGB''' (Red Green Blue), is an [[RGB color space]] created cooperatively by [[Hewlett-Packard]] and [[Microsoft Corporation]] for use on the [[Internet]]. It has been endorsed by the [[W3C]], [[Exif]], [[Intel]], [[Pantone]], [[Corel]], and many other industry players. It is also well accepted by [[open-source software]] such as the [[GIMP]], and is used in proprietary and open [[graphics file format]]s such as [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]].

sRGB is intended as a common color space for the creation of images for viewing on the [[Internet]] and [[World Wide Web]] (WWW), the resultant color space chosen using a [[Gamma correction|gamma]] of '''2.2''', the average response to linear voltage levels of CRT displays at that time.

===Adobe RGB===
{{main|Adobe RGB color space}}
The '''Adobe RGB color space''' is an [[RGB color space]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] in 1998. It was designed to encompass most of the colors achievable on [[CMYK]] color [[printing|printers]], but by using [[RGB color model|RGB]] primary colors on a device such as the [[computer display]]. The Adobe RGB [[color space]] encompasses roughly 50% of the visible colors specified by the [[Lab color space]], improving upon the [[gamut]] of the [[sRGB color space]] primarily in cyan-greens.

===Adobe Wide Gamut RGB===
{{main|Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space}}
The '''Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space''' is an [[RGB color space]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] as an alternative to the standard [[sRGB color space]]. It is able to store a wider range of color values than sRGB. The Wide Gamut color space is an expanded version of the [[Adobe RGB color space]], developed in 1998. As a comparison, the Adobe Wide Gamut RGB color space encompasses 77.6% of the visible colors specified by the [[Lab color space]], whilst the standard Adobe RGB color space covers just 50.6%.

One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 8% of the colors representable are [[imaginary colors]] that do not exist and are not representable in any medium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brucelindbloom.com/index.html?WorkingSpaceInfo.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that potential color accuracy is wasted by reserving these unnecessary colors.

===Other RGB spaces===
There is an open ended set of RGB spaces; by picking new red, green, blue primaries and a gamma value, anyone can invent one. The following have articles:
*[[ProPhoto RGB color space]]
*[[scRGB]]
*[[DCI-P3]], used primarily for digital movie projection
*[[Rec. 709]]
*[[Rec. 2020]]
*[[Academy Color Encoding System]] (ACES)

==Luma plus chroma/chrominance==
===YIQ, YUV, YDbDr ===
{{main|YIQ|YUV|YDbDr}}
YIQ was formerly used in [[NTSC]] (North America, Japan and others) television broadcasts for historical reasons. This system stores a [[Luma (video)|luma]] value with two [[Chroma (video)|chroma or chrominance]] values, corresponding approximately to the amounts of blue and red in the color. It corresponds closely to the [[YUV]] scheme used in [[PAL]] (Australia, Europe, except France, which uses [[SECAM]]) television except that the YIQ color space is rotated 33° with respect to the YUV color space. The [[YDbDr]] scheme used by [[SECAM]] television is rotated in another way. (''work needed'')

===YPbPr, YCbCr, ICtCp ===
{{main|YPbPr|YCbCr|ICtCp}}
YPbPr is a scaled version of YUV. It is most commonly seen in its digital form, [[YCbCr]], used widely in [[Video compression|video]] and [[Image compression|image]] compression schemes such as [[MPEG]] and [[JPEG]]. [[ICtCp]] is the optimized high dynamic range version of YCbCr.

===xvYCC===
{{main|xvYCC}}
xvYCC is an extension of YCbCr that extends the color gamut beyond the R/G/B primaries specified by [[Rec. 709|BT.709]].

==Cylindrical transformations==
===HSV and HSL===
{{main|HSL and HSV}}
HSV and HSL are transformations of a Cartesian RGB colorspace (usually [[sRGB]]), and their components and colorimetry are relative to the RGB colorspace from which they are derived. HSV ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''v'''alue), also known as HSB (hue, saturation, '''b'''rightness), is often used by artists because it is often more natural to think about a color in terms of hue and saturation than in terms of additive or subtractive color components. HSL ('''h'''ue, '''s'''aturation, '''l'''ightness/'''l'''uminance), also known as HSI (hue, saturation, '''i'''ntensity) or HSD (hue, saturation, '''d'''arkness), is quite similar to HSV, with "lightness" replacing "brightness". The difference is that a perfectly ''light'' color in HSL is pure white; but a perfectly ''bright'' color in HSV is analogous to shining a white light on a colored object. I.e. shining a bright white light on a red object causes the object to still appear red, just brighter and more intense. Shining a dim light on a red object causes the object to appear dark and less bright.

===CIELCh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; and CIELCh&lt;sub&gt;uv&lt;/sub&gt;===
CIELCh&lt;sub&gt;ab&lt;/sub&gt; and CIELCh&lt;sub&gt;uv&lt;/sub&gt; are cylindrical transformations of the [[CIELAB]] and [[CIELUV]] color spaces, respectively. The cylindrical coordinates C* (chroma, relative saturation) and h° (hue angle, angle of the hue in the color wheel) are specified. The CIELAB and CIELUV coordinate L* (lightness) remains unchanged.

==CMYK==
===CMYK===
{{main|CMYK color space}}
CMYK is used in the printing process, because it describes what kind of [[inks]] need to be applied so the light reflected from the substrate and through the inks produces a given color. One starts with a white substrate (canvas, page, etc.), and uses ink to subtract color from white to create an image. [[CMYK]] stores ink values for cyan, magenta, yellow and black. There are many CMYK colorspaces for different sets of inks, substrates, and press characteristics (which change the dot gain or transfer function for each ink and thus change the appearance).

== Special-purpose color spaces ==

* The [[rg chromaticity]] space is used in [[computer vision]] applications, and shows the color of light (red, yellow, green, etc.), but not its intensity (dark, bright).
* [[LMS color space]] (long, medium, short), a perceptual color space based on the response functions of the cones in the retina of the eye. It is mostly used in psychophysical research.

== Obsolete color spaces ==

Early color spaces had two components. They largely ignored blue light because the added complexity of a three-component process provided only a marginal increase in fidelity when compared to the jump from monochrome to two-component color.

* [[RG color space|RG]] for early [[Technicolor]] film
* [[RGK color space|RGK]] for early color printing

This page is a '''list of cities and venues that have hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]''', one or more times. Future venues are shown in ''italics''. Since [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958|1958]], the host city has customarily been in the winner country of the previous year. [[Eurovision Song Contest#Host country|There have been exceptions]], however, when certain issues have prevented the winner from hosting the following year's contest. Hosting then passed to the country that had come second, or to another country that agreed to host. Such events occurred in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1960|1960]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963|1963]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history#By_year The history of the Eurovision Song Contest - By year] Official Eurovision Website History. Accessed May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

With 6 contests, [[Dublin]] is the city that has hosted the most frequently. It is followed by [[London]] and [[Luxembourg_(city)|Luxembourg]] (4 contests each), and [[Copenhagen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dr.dk/event/melodigrandprix/koebenhavn-bliver-vaert-internationalt-melodi-grand-prix|title=København bliver vært for internationalt Melodi Grand Prix|work=DR|access-date=2017-05-08|language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stockholm]] (3 contests each).

[[Croatia]] is the only country to have hosted the contest, without winning directly.

==Host City Insignia==
[[File:ESC Host City Insignia.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The Host City Insignia on display inside the [[Rathaus,_Vienna|Rathaus]] in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], in May 2015. ]]
'''Host City Insignia''' is a rotating trophy awarded to cities hosting the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The symbol is a large key ring to which the Eurovision Song Contest Host Cities can attach their city key or other symbol representing the city. Additionally, there is a fob with a picture of the Helsinki Senate Square attached to the key ring. The idea of the rotating trophy was proposed jointly by the City of [[Helsinki]], the Finnish Broadcasting Company [[YLE]] and [[EBU]] in connection with the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest. Hand-engraved on the ring are the following texts: "Eurovision Song Contest Host City", all Host Cities up until the year 2006 and a stamp: Helsinki 2007 with the initials of the prize designers. The concept and fob were designed by the ANTEEKSI Team and the ring by jewellery designer Taru Tonder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Badzic|first1=Milenko|title=Host City Insignia Exchange &amp; Semi-Final Allocation Draw|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&amp;type=Press|website=eurovision.tv|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=26 March 2017|date=26 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327081350/http://www.eurovision.tv/page/press/photo-downloads?gal=123813&amp;type=Press|archivedate=27 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liverpool Academy of Arts'''  was founded in [[Liverpool]] in April 1810 as a regional equivalent of the [[Royal Academy]], London. It followed the Liverpool Society of Artists, first founded in 1769, which had a fitful existence until 1794.&lt;ref&gt;James Stonehouse, Handbook for the Stranger in Liverpool,Liverpool, 2nd. ed., 174-6&lt;/ref&gt; Two local art collectors, [[Henry Blundell (art collector)|Henry Blundell]] and [[William Roscoe]] were its first Patron and Secretary, the [[Prince Regent]]  [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George]] gave his patronage for the next three years, and it was actively promoted by presidents of the Royal Academy.

Its membership included local artists such as the landscapists [[John Rathbone (artist)|John Rathbone]], [[Richard Ansdell]], [[Thomas Chubbard]], [[Alfred William Hunt]] and [[Charles Barber (artist)|Charles Barber]], and the sculptor [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]].

Leading artists of the day competed for its prize of £50 for non-local contributors to its annual exhibition, including [[J. M. W. Turner]], [[Henry Fuseli]], [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and [[Joseph Wright of Derby]].

In the late 1850s, however, it split due to major disagreements following annual prizes being awarded to the then controversial [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood|Pre-Raphaelite]] painters, particularly to [[William Holman Hunt]] in 1852 for ''Valentine Rescuing Sylvia from Proteus'' and to [[John Everett Millais|Millais]] in 1857 for ''The Blind Girl''.

The Academy remained nominally in existence, continuing to hold annual exhibitions, but never regaining its national importance.

'''''Mortal Kombat: Live Tour''''' was a [[martial art]] [[theatre|theatrical]] stage show featuring ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' characters, sound, and [[Laser lighting display|laser light effects]] on stage. The plot was based on three fighters rescuing their friends and retrieving a magic [[amulet]] from the evil master of Outworld, [[Shao Kahn]], in order to save the Earth.

The show debuted at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]] on September 14, 1995, followed by a 200 city road trip into 1996. It replicated ''Mortal Kombat'' [[martial arts]] and [[video game]] moves on stage mixed with dancing and music. [[Lip synching]] were pre-recorded and used to demonstrate the official ''MK'' [[sound effects]], though there was no graphic violence or [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatalities]] visible in the show. The audience participated by yelling "Run!" or "Kick him!" as part of the live action.

In a 1992 poll for the British film magazine [[Sight &amp; Sound]], Brakhage picked Solomon's ''Remains to Be Seen'' as one of the ten greatest films of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/the7thart/directorlist.html&amp;date=October 25, 2009+22:49:13 Directors' Top Ten]. Webcitation.org. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The film had previously been selected as one of the top ten films of 1989 by the ''[[Village Voice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canyoncinema.com/S/Solomon.html Canyon Cinema: The Films of Phil Solomon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907121547/http://www.canyoncinema.com/S/Solomon.html |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel.creative-capital.org/grantee_182.html Creative Capital: Philip S. Solomon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808053141/http://channel.creative-capital.org/grantee_182.html |date=August 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was the recipient of the Thatcher Hoffman Smith Award from the University of Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cim.ou.edu/About.htm The Thatcher Hoffman Smith Award]. Cim.ou.edu. Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Solomon received the Knight Fellowship of the USA ([[United States Artists]]) Fellows program, alongside such luminaries as novelist Annie Proulx, sculptor Alison Saar, jazz musician Jack DeJohnette, dancer and choreographer Trisha Brown, and artist Theaster Gates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usafellows.org/fellow/phil_solomon&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2010, Solomon's ''American Falls'' opened at the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. The six-projection video/sound installation received great acclaim before closing in July 2010.  In conjunction with the Corcoran exhibition, Solomon's career as a filmmaker was explored in "Rhapsodies in Silver,"  a three-program survey at Washington's [[National Gallery of Art]].

A re-edited, feature-length, single-projection version of ''American Falls'' was featured at the New York Film Festival's "Views from the Avant Garde" on October 1, 2010. The single projection version of the film condenses the original multi-projector format into a triptych, placing three independent (yet associative) images next to one another. In Fall 2012, Solomon screened a three-channel version of ''American Falls'' at the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Astoria, New York, as part of the exhibition "Film After Film."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.movingimage.us/exhibitions/2012/09/15/detail/phil-solomon-american-falls-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the May/June 2010  [[Film Comment]] poll, The Top 50 Avant-Garde Filmmakers of the Decade, Phil Solomon placed at number 5, tied with his late colleague, Stan Brakhage.&lt;ref&gt;.http://www.filmlinc.com/film-comment/article/best-of-the-decade-avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Originally from New York City, Solomon attended [[Binghamton University]]&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006"&gt;[http://www.cinemad.iblamesociety.com/2006/12/phil-solomon.html Cinemad: Interview with Phil Solomon]. Cinemad.iblamesociety.com (November 18, 2005). Retrieved on January 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and received an MFA from the [[Massachusetts College of Art]]. One of Solomon's instructors was the experimental filmmaker [[Ken Jacobs]], who started his first class with a screening of [[Tony Conrad]]'s film ''[[The Flicker]]''. Solomon initially disliked the film, but the experience, followed by a screening of his future collaborator [[Stan Brakhage]]'s ''[[Blue Moses (film)|Blue Moses]]'', had a profound impact on his development as a filmmaker.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; Another formative experience came in the form of a lecture by critic [[Fred Camper]] on Brakhage's ''[[Anticipation of the Night]]''.&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt;

Solomon began making films in 1975. Solomon has since destroyed some of his early works,&lt;ref name="iblamesociety2006" /&gt; many of which were made in imitation of Brakhage.

Solomon has been teaching at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] since 1991.

'''Pillow Pets''' are a brand of [[stuffed toy]]s with [[Velcro]] straps that allow them to be changed from a decorated pillow into a stuffed animal. The toys are made from [[chenille fabric|chenille]]. Invented by Jennifer Telfer in 2003, Pillow Pets first gained success when Telfer personally sold the toys near the Christmas season of that year. They would later become more successful through [[television advertisement|television advertising]], where the company's famous slogan, "It's a pillow, it's a pet, it's a Pillow Pet!" was in every ad. Pillow Pets have been used for charitable fund raising.

==History==
In 2003, Jennifer Telfer was living in San Diego&lt;ref name="inventor"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/about/message-from-the-founder/ | title=Pillow Pets Inventor | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with her husband, Clint, and two sons. In an interview with CNBC, Telfer states that she came up with the idea of functional stuffed toys when her oldest son, then seven, flattened out one of his stuffed animals from sleeping with it often.&lt;ref name="CNBC"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Pillow Pets / Tate's Cookies / Tom's of Maine|series=How I Made My Millions | url=https://www.cnbc.com/video/2011/03/07/how-i-made-my-millions-episode-5.html | accessdate=January 26, 2018 | network=CNBC | airdate=March 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She decided on a combination of a pillow and a stuffed animal as the concept for Pillow Pets. Telfer and her husband proposed a meeting with a plush manufacturer at a [[trade fair|tradeshow]] in Las Vegas,&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; and decided to wholesale the toys themselves through their company, CJ Products (CJ is a combination of their first initials).&lt;ref name="inventor2"/&gt; Following the meeting, the Telfers were prepared to sell the first toys.&lt;ref name="adage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://adage.com/article/print-edition/pillow-pets-america-s-hottest-brands-2010/147053/ |title= My Pillow Pets |author= Rooney, Jennifer |date= November 15, 2010 |work= Advertising Age |accessdate= March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Pillow Pet was "Snuggly Puppy".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; In the Christmas season, Jennifer Telfer first sold Pillow Pets at mall kiosks, but failed to sell them all: "Every single parent would walk up, and their kids would love them. [The parents would] say, 'No, it's just another stuffed animal.' Because they didn't know that it opened up to a pillow."&lt;ref name="CNBC" /&gt; A few weeks later, Telfer discovered that the Pillow Pets were most profitable during the period after Christmas when they were almost sold out at home shows. She later ordered a container of 7,000 Pillow Pets, now in six different animal varieties, and sold all of them in three months.&lt;ref name="inventor2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/PillowPetsCEOBioFinal2.pdf | title=Jennifer Telfer Biography | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=April 26, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110408192147/http://mypillowpets.com/PillowPetsCEOBioFinal2.pdf | archivedate=April 8, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2010, CJ Products earned $300,000 in [[gross (economics)|gross]] sales.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;

In 2009, CJ Products started using [[television advertisement|television advertising]] to promote the Pillow Pets. Commercials aired on children's cable channels such as Nickelodeon, and family-oriented networks such as Travel Channel.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; Partly because of the ads, gross sales of $7,000,000 were recorded at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt; Telfer recalled: "I didn't realize that we were gonna be at this level, or people would love my idea as much as I loved it."&lt;ref name="CNBC" /&gt;

In 2012, Dream Lite Pillow Pets were introduced, along with Glow Pets in 2013.

Given that it starts in pillow position, its strap fastens to the other side in order to transform it into a stuffed toy. If the strap is unfastened again, the Pillow Pet can again be used as a pillow.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;
The original release of Pillow Pets included merely six varieties.&lt;ref&gt;mypillowpetsreview.blogspot.com/2010/09/history-of-my-pillow-pets.html&lt;/ref&gt; Now, more than one hundred varieties of Pillow Pets have been sold by CJ Products. Current varieties range from scented to body pillow pets, they even have a North Dakota State University pillow pet available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;https://mypillowpets.com/shop/accessories/&lt;/ref&gt;  Available as one of the licensed Pillow Pets that exist for [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[National Football League|NFL]], [[National Hockey League|NHL]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] sports teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/sports/ | title=Shop – Sports Teams | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=June 21, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110516105451/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/sports/ | archivedate=May 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also themed Pillow Pets based on [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/disney/ | title=Shop – Disney | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=October 24, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111018112113/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/disney/ | archivedate=October 18, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuffed toys based on [[Thomas the Tank Engine]], [[Scooby-Doo]], [[Dora the Explorer]], and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] are being produced as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/specialty | title=Shop – Specialty | publisher=My Pillow Pets | accessdate=June 21, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20111022184444/http://mypillowpets.com/shop/category/specialty | archivedate=October 22, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CJ Products has also licensed Pillow Pets for three [[Premier League|English Premier League]] football clubs for release in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toynews-online.biz/news/36861/Arsenal-Chelsea-and-Spurs-Pillow-Pets-unveiled |title=Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs Pillow Pets unveiled |publisher=Intent Media |work=ToyNews |date=August 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 16, 2012 |author=Sacco, Dominic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides stuffed animals, other products bear the Pillow Pets name, such as blankets, slippers, hats, and print pajamas. Three Pillow Pets books and two board games are also available. In late October 2011, a Pillow Pets video game was released for [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wegotthiscovered.com/news/pillow-pets-nintendo-ds/ | title=Pillow Pets Is Now Available For Nintendo DS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Pillow Pets World online  has been created, featuring interactive, Pillow Pet related games for children to play for free online.

==Charity work==
CJ Products are known for their charity work, as they have donated Pillow Pets to many causes. In addition to CJ Products, the public have also donated Pillow Pets to help others.

===Indirect===
In December 2010, Michele McFarland, a human resources worker for the Baltimore County Department of Social Services, and her family, all from Catonsville, Maryland, started a Pillow Pet drive to help children at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Their initial goal was to donate 200 toys, but they actually donated 250 Pillow Pets to the hospital in time for Christmas Eve. According to McFarland, residents of New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Georgia helped contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.marylandfamilymagazine.com/2010/12/24/catonsville-family-leads-drive-to-donate-pillow-pets-to-childrens-center/ | title=Catonsville family leads drive to donate Pillow Pets to children’s center | work=Maryland Family Magazine | date=December 24, 2010 | accessdate=March 6, 2011 | author=Conlin, Brian | location=Catonsville, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, it was announced that McFarland aimed to donate even more Pillow Pets to five hospitals, including Johns Hopkins, by Christmas. She became affiliated with the Casey Cares Foundation and ordered 1,400 Pillow Pets to help the hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/explore/baltimorecounty/news/community/ph-ca-pillow-pets-1123-20111121,0,2872787.story | title=Catonsville woman aims to comfort children not just during holidays | publisher=Tribune Company | work=Baltimore Sun | date=November 21, 2011 | accessdate=November 22, 2011 | author=Conlin, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob McConahay (then seven) and his family accepted donations of Pillow Pets in the [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children|Riley Hospital for Children]], in [[Indianapolis]], where Jacob was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer. An early childhood volunteer mentioned that Jacob's goal was 1,000 Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfromyou.indystar.com/posts/cancer-doesn-t-hold-jake-back-from-collecting-pillow-pets | title=Cancer doesn't hold Jake back from collecting Pillow Pets | work=The Indianopolis Star | date=February 7, 2011 | accessdate=March 5, 2011 | author=Welty, Lauren | location=Indianopolis, Indiana | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120711192602/http://newsfromyou.indystar.com/posts/cancer-doesn-t-hold-jake-back-from-collecting-pillow-pets | archivedate=July 11, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; CJ Products had heard about Jacob's goal, and they committed to matching the number of Pillow Pets that he collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpetsblog.com/help-support-pillow-pets%e2%84%a2-for-jacob/ | title=Help Support Pillow Pets for Jacob | publisher=My Pillow Pets Blog | date=March 9, 2011 | accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConahay's wish to help children in the Riley Hospital inspired students at China Grove Middle School in North Carolina to donate Pillow Pets to patients at the Jeff Gordon Children's Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salisburypost.com/News/041411-edu-MUST-China-Grove-pillow-pets-PIC-qcd | title=School collects Pillow Pets for Jeff Gordon’s Children’s Hospital | publisher=Post Publishing Company | work=The Salisbury Post | date=April 14, 2011 | accessdate=November 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob died on August 31, 2011. {{as of|November 2011}} his family has collected over 140,000 Pillow Pets in his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dunedin.patch.com/articles/pillow-pets-to-honor-young-cancer-victim | title=Pillow Pets, Vigil to Honor Late 7-Year-Old | publisher=DunedinPatch | date=November 17, 2011 | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Dolac, Katie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in Japan, CJ Products, [[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]], and the [[American Red Cross]], collaborated to support relief efforts. Pillow Pets announced that they would donate one dollar of every purchase of a Pillow Pet on their website, on March 17 and 18, 2011, to the American Red Cross. They also auctioned five Pillow Pets on the same days, and the money also went to the American Red Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mypillowpetsblog.com/support-relief-efforts-in-japan-with-pillow-pets-plush-animals-the-today-show-the-american-red-cross/ | title=Support Relief Efforts in Japan with Pillow Pets plush animals, The Today Show &amp; the American Red Cross | publisher=My Pillow Pets Blog | date=March 17, 2011 | accessdate=March 18, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714001541/http://mypillowpetsblog.com/support-relief-efforts-in-japan-with-pillow-pets-plush-animals-the-today-show-the-american-red-cross/ | archivedate=July 14, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, Pillow Pets has collaborated with the Family Reach Foundation to help families of children to fight cancer. In September 2011, the foundation received a donation of 6,200 Pillow Pets and was able to generate thousands of dollars in funds. Carla Tardif, the Foundations' director of development and special programs, stated a consideration of initiatives to create more promotion of Family Reach's cause and raise charitable funds for families worldwide. "We applaud the tremendous amount of work being done by the Family Reach Foundation on behalf of [the] families," Jennifer Telfer said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.familyreach.org/news/family-reach-receives-major-donation-of-pillow-pets%E2%84%A2/ | title=Family Reach Receives Major Donation of Pillow Pets to Support its Mission | publisher=Family Reach Foundation | date=September 28, 2011 | accessdate=November 20, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085418/http://www.familyreach.org/news/family-reach-receives-major-donation-of-pillow-pets%E2%84%A2/ | archivedate=April 26, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counterfeits==
Some toy companies have taken advantage of Pillow Pets' popularity by manufacturing and selling counterfeits. CJ Products have been notified many times of impostor Pillow Pets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press_release | url=http://mypillowpets.com/HOLIDAYSHOPPERS-BEWAREOFPILLOWPETS%20IMPOSTORS12-21-10.pdf | title=Holiday Shoppers: Beware of Pillow Pets Impostors | date=December 21, 2009 | accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telfer said: "It is priority one for us to protect our brand and deliver the high quality people have come to expect when they see the My Pillow Pets plush folding stuffed animals authentic tag."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.pets4home.net/consumers-help-combat-my-pillow-pets-plush-folding-stuffed-animal-fraud/ | title=Consumers Help Combat My Pillow Pets Plush Folding Stuffed Animal Fraud | publisher=Pets 4 Home | date=September 7, 2010 | accessdate=November 19, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224152/http://www.pets4home.net/consumers-help-combat-my-pillow-pets-plush-folding-stuffed-animal-fraud/ | archivedate=March 3, 2016 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one case, in January 2011, Concord Toys International were accused of selling fake Pillow Pets. Their products were being sold in a warehouse in Queens, New York City and bore the label "[[Made in China]]." Private detectives hired by CJ Products tracked the toys to the warehouse, where U.S. marshals seized 17,000 counterfeits. An injunction was signed preventing Concord from manufacturing any forgeries, and CJ Products are seeking punitive damages against the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-01-25/news/27096545_1_pillow-pets-federal-court-lawyers | title=Fake Thumpy, Squeaky in custody as lawyers for Pillow Pets seek damages for counterfeit items | work=New York Daily News | date=January 25, 2011 | accessdate=March 5, 2011 | author=Marzulli, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sinfonía india''''' is [[Carlos Chávez]]'s Symphony No. 2, composed in 1935–36. In a single movement, its sections nevertheless follow the traditional pattern for a three-movement symphony. The title signifies the fact that the thematic material consists of three melodies originating from native-American tribes of [[northern Mexico]]. The symphony is Chávez's most popular composition.

==History==
The ''Sinfonía india'' was begun in December 1935, during the composer's first tour of the United States as a conductor, and finished early in the following year. It was premiered under Chávez's direction in a radio performance by the [[CBS#Radio years|Columbia Broadcasting]] Orchestra on 23 January 1936, and given its first concert performance by the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by the composer on 10 April 1936. The Mexican premiere took place in the capital on 31 July 1936 {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=234}}.

This symphony has become immensely popular, and so the primary source of the composer's identity with the public, comparable in this respect with [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]] and [[Maurice Ravel|Ravel's]] ''[[Bolero (Ravel)|Bolero]]'' {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=70}}.

In 1971 G. Schirmer, the publisher of the work, issued an arrangement for [[Concert band|wind band]] by [[Frank William Erickson|Frank Erickson]]. Although Chávez had not authorised this version, he did conduct it himself in performances, though with some revisions of his own {{harv|Parker|1983|loc=72}}.

==Instrumentation==
[[File:Aztec drums, Florentine Codex..jpg|thumb|left|Aztec musicians playing ''teponaztli'' (foreground) and ''huéhuetl'', both called for in the ''Sinfonía india'']]
The symphony is scored for two piccolos (the second interchangeable with third flute), two flutes, three oboes, E{{Music|flat}} clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, three bassoons, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, timpani, percussion (four players), harp, and strings.

The percussion section originally included a large number of indigenous Mexican instruments, for example the ''jicara de agua'' (half of a gourd inverted and partly submerged in a basin of water, struck with sticks), ''[[güiro]]'', ''cascabeles'' (a pellet rattle), ''tenabari'' (a string of butterfly cocoons), a pair of ''[[teponaztli|teponaxtles]]'', ''[[Huehuetl|tlapanhuéhuetl]]'', and ''grijutian'' (string of deer hooves). When the score was published, the composer substituted their nearest equivalents in commonly used orchestral percussion, but requested that the originals be used wherever possible ({{harvnb|Chávez|1950}}; {{harvnb|García Morillo|1960|loc=91}}; {{harvnb|Slonimsky|1945|loc=44, 216, 234}}).

==Analysis==
The symphony is based on three [[Indigenous peoples of Mexico|Indian]] melodies (hence the title), which supply the ideas for what are in effect three movements, though they are played without a break {{harv|Slonimsky|1945|loc=234}}. The composer regarded this as a condensation of the traditional three-movement variety of the symphony, in which a third theme takes on the function of a slow movement {{harv|Orbón|1987b|loc=84}}. This slow, third theme (starting at rehearsal-number 43 in the score) is supported by an austere succession of [[Quartal and quintal harmony|chords built from fourths]] {{harv|Orbón|1987b|loc=86}}. The three main themes are melodies from the [[Huichol people|Huicholes]] (or [[Cora people|Cora]]) of [[Nayarit]] (the principal theme, beginning at rehearsal number 9), the [[Yaqui people|Yaquis]] of [[Sonora]] (the second and third themes, beginning at rehearsal-numbers 27 and 43, respectively), and the [[Seri people|Seris]] of [[Tiburón Island]] in [[Baja California]] (theme of the finale, beginning at rehearsal-number 88), supplemented by secondary themes, some of which are also quoted from folklore {{harv|García Morillo|1960|loc=92–93}}.

The '''Sydney Opera House''' is a multi-venue [[Performing arts center|performing arts centre]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], Australia. It is one of the 20th century's most famous and distinctive buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/sydney-opera-house/values|title=World Heritage Places – The Sydney Opera House – World Heritage values|last=Environment|first=Department of the|date=23 April 2008|website=www.environment.gov.au|language=en|access-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510212625/http://www.environment.gov.au/heritage/places/world/sydney-opera-house/values|archive-date=10 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by Danish architect [[Jørn Utzon]], the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973&lt;ref name="opened"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sydney Opera House history |publisher=Sydney Opera House Official Site |url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/house_history/1973_1981.aspx |access-date=17 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020095748/http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/house_history/1973_1981.aspx |archive-date=20 October 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; after a gestation beginning with Utzon's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition. The [[Government of New South Wales]], led by the [[Premier of New South Wales|premier]], [[Joseph Cahill]], authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction. The government's decision to build Utzon's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed, including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect's ultimate resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2003 Laureate|url=http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2003/bio|website=The Pritzker Architecture Prize|publisher=The Hyatt Foundation|accessdate=19 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222104832/http://www.pritzkerprize.com/2003/bio|archive-date=22 December 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building and its [[wikt:surrounds|surrounds]]&lt;!-- Please do not change this word without first discussing it on the article's talk page. --&gt; occupy the whole of [[Bennelong Point]] on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]], between [[Sydney Cove]] and [[Farm Cove, New South Wales|Farm Cove]], adjacent to the [[Sydney central business district]] and the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]], and close by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]].

==Description==
The facility features a modern [[expressionist architecture|expressionist design]], with a series of large precast concrete "shells",&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis.html Shells of the Sydney Opera House], The Royal Society of New South Wales {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927211933/http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each composed of sections of a [[sphere]]  of {{convert|75.2|m|ftin|1}} radius,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis_2.html "Roof Cladding of the Sydney Opera House", Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales, Volume 106 Parts 1 and 2, pp. 18–32, issued 21 November 1973 (Note: The paper is contradictory, giving both radius and diameter as over 246 ft. It is unlikely to be the diameter as the building's height of 213 ft makes that illogical.)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927212007/http://nsw.royalsoc.org.au/journal_archive/106_12_lewis_2.html |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; forming the roofs of the structure, set on a monumental podium. The building covers {{convert|1.8|ha|acre|1}} of land and is {{convert|183|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|120|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide at its widest point. It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as {{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} below sea level.

Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as "shells" (as in this article), they are [[precast concrete]] panels supported by precast concrete ribs, not shells in a strictly structural sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces, the building's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at [[Tarana, New South Wales|Tarana]]. Significant interior surface treatments also include off-form concrete, [[Schizomeria ovata|Australian white birch]] [[plywood]] supplied from [[Wauchope, New South Wales|Wauchope]] in northern New South Wales, and [[brush box]] [[glulam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Of the two larger spaces, the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells, the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group. The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements, with low entrance spaces, rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers. The smaller venues (the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio) are within the podium, beneath the Concert Hall. A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant. The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces, and the large stone-paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space.

===Performance venues and facilities===
The Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/About/Venues.aspx|title=Sydney Opera House venues|work=sydneyoperahouse.com|accessdate=13 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416175901/http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/About/Venues.aspx|archive-date=16 April 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction history==

===Origins===
[[File:Aerial view of Sydney Harbour - the bridge is under construction.jpg|thumbnail|Bennelong Point with tram depot in the 1920s (top left-hand side of photograph)]]
[[File:Sydney Opera House - construction - phase 2 1966.jpg|thumb|right|Construction progress in 1966]]
Planning began in the late 1940s, when [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]], the Director of the [[Sydney Conservatorium of Music|NSW State Conservatorium of Music]], lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions. The normal venue for such productions, the [[Sydney Town Hall]], was not considered large enough. By 1954, Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] [[Joseph Cahill]], who called for designs for a dedicated opera house. It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site: Cahill had wanted it to be on or near [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard Railway Station]] in the northwest of the [[Sydney central business district|CBD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |title=Sydney Architecture Images- Sydney Opera House |publisher=Sydneyarchitecture.com |accessdate=9 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224195120/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |archive-date=24 December 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international [[Architectural design competition|design competition]] was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries, representing architects from 32 countries. The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people, each to be designed for different uses, including full-scale operas, orchestral and choral concerts, mass meetings, lectures, ballet performances, and other presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The winner, announced in 1957, was [[Jørn Utzon]], a Danish architect. According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish-American architect [[Eero Saarinen]] from a final cut of 30 "rejects". The runner-up was an entry by firm [[GBQC]] of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. The grand prize was 5,000 [[Australian pound]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericellis.com/utzon.htm|title=Eric Ellis interview with Utzon in the ''Sydney Morning Herald Good Weekend''|work=Ericellis.com|date=31 October 1992|accessdate=2 December 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020726154645/http://www.ericellis.com/utzon.htm|archivedate=26 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{quote|There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece. It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century, an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world – a symbol for not only a city, but a whole country and continent.}}

===Design and construction===
The [[Fort Macquarie Tram Depot]], occupying the site at the time of these plans, was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959. It was built in three stages: stage I (1959–1963) consisted of building the upper podium; stage II (1963–1967) the construction of the outer shells; stage III (1967–1973) interior design and construction.

====Stage I: Podium====
Stage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm [[Civil &amp; Civic]], monitored by the engineers [[Arup Group Limited|Ove Arup and Partners]].&lt;ref name=sa&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm Sydney Architecture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010222/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 1 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The government had pushed for work to begin early, fearing that funding, or public opinion, might turn against them. However, Utzon had still not completed the final designs. Major structural issues still remained unresolved. By 23 January 1961, work was running 47 weeks behind,&lt;ref name=sa/&gt; mainly because of unexpected difficulties (inclement weather, unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater, construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared, changes of original contract documents). Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963. The forced early start led to significant later problems, not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure, and had to be re-built.&lt;ref name="PMurray"&gt;{{cite book

====Stage II: Roof====
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
[[File:Sydney Opera House construction 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Construction progress in 1968]]
The [[Thin-shell structure|shells]] of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Arup, Ove and Zunz, G.J.: Article in ''Structural Engineer'' Volume 47, March 1969&lt;/ref&gt; but, early in the design process, the "shells" were perceived as a series of [[parabola]]s supported by [[precast concrete]] ribs. However, engineers [[Arup Group|Ove Arup and Partners]] were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them. The [[formwork]] for using ''[[in-situ]]'' concrete would have been prohibitively expensive, and, because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms, the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive.

[[File:AUS NSW Opera House DSC05118.jpg|thumb|right|Sydney Opera House shell ribs]]
[[File:Sydney Opera House Ceramic Tile Pattern.jpg|thumb|right|The glazed ceramic tiles of the Sydney Opera House]]
From 1957 to 1963, the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form (including schemes with parabolas, circular ribs and [[ellipsoids]]) before a workable solution was completed. The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in [[structural analysis]], to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected.&lt;ref name="PJones"&gt;Jones, Peter: ''Ove Arup: Masterbuilder of the Twentieth Century''. Yale University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches. The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day, and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day. In mid-1961, the design team found a solution to the problem: the shells all being created as sections from a sphere. This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould, and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another, to form a spherical section. With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy. It was originally credited to Utzon. Ove Arup's letter to Ashworth, a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee, states: "Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;page 199&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Jones, the author of Ove Arup's biography, states that "the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise [[Eureka effect|''eureka'' moment]] ... ; the engineers and some of their associates, with equal conviction, recall discussion in both central London and at Ove's house."

He goes on to claim that "the existing evidence shows that Arup's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells, from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres."&lt;ref name="PJones" /&gt; Yuzo Mikami, a member of the design team, presents an opposite view in his book on the project, ''Utzon's Sphere''.&lt;ref name="sphere"&gt;{{cite web| author=Bentley, Paul| date=September 2001| title=A Matter of Integrity – A Review of Yuzo Mikami's ''Utzon's Sphere''| publisher=The Wolanski Foundation| url=http://www.twf.org.au/research/mikami.html| accessdate=30 January 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102161608/http://www.twf.org.au/research/mikami.html| archive-date=2 January 2007| dead-url=no| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikami, Yuzo: ''Utzon's Sphere'', Tokyo: Shoku Kusha. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known, but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon, Arup, and Ronald Jenkins (partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project) all played a very significant part in the design development.&lt;ref name="findarticles"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hunt, Tony |date=October 2001 |title=Utzon's Sphere: Sydney Opera House—How It Was Designed and Built—Review |publisher=EMAP Architecture, Gale Group |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1256_210/ai_79759827 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061219120138/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3575/is_1256_210/ai_79759827 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=30 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Peter Murray (architectural writer)|Peter Murray]] states in ''The Saga of the Sydney Opera House'':&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt;

{{quote|... the two men—and their teams—enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and, despite many traumas, was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect/engineer collaboration.}}

The design of the roof was tested on scale models in [[wind tunnel]]s at [[University of Southampton]] and later [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] in order to establish the wind-pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds, which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/mob/collection/database/?irn=12041&amp;img=7593 |title=Model of Sydney Opera House, 1960 |work=Powerhouse Museum – Collection Database |year=2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506212436/http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/mob/collection/database/?irn=12041&amp;img=7593 |archive-date=6 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npl.co.uk/content/conWebDoc/8580 |title=Building the Sydney Opera House |work=npl.co.uk |year=2014 |accessdate=6 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506200203/http://www.npl.co.uk/content/conWebDoc/8580 |archive-date=6 May 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shells were constructed by [[Bilfinger Berger|Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/$FILE/bb_historie_en.html |title=Bilfinger Berger corporate history |publisher=Bilfingerberger.com |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324054618/http://www.bilfingerberger.com/C1257130005050D5/vwContentByKey/W26U3AX8814LUNADE/%24FILE/bb_historie_en.html |archivedate=24 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were also responsible for construction in Stage III. Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on-site factory and also developed the construction processes.&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt; The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units (it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground, instead of being stuck on individually at height). Ove Arup and Partners' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells, which used an innovative adjustable steel-trussed "erection arch" to support the different roofs before completion. On 6 April 1962, it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965.

Stage III, the interiors, started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963. However, there was a change of government in 1965, and the new [[Robert Askin]] government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works. Due to the Ministry's criticism of the project's costs and time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/About/The_Architect.aspx|title=Sydney Opera House – the Architect – Sydney Opera House|website=www.sydneyoperahouse.com|access-date=10 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513175048/http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/about/the_architect.aspx|archive-date=13 May 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with their impression of Utzon's designs being impractical, this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 (see below).

The cost of the project so far, even in October 1966, was still only $22.9&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm Sydney Architecture] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010222/http://sydneyarchitecture.com/ROC/QUA01.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 1 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; less than a quarter of the final $102&amp;nbsp;million cost. However, the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant.

The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned. His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall, who became largely responsible for the interior design. Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E. H. Farmer as government architect, D. S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd.

Following Utzon's resignation, the acoustic advisor, Lothar Cremer, confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC) that Utzon's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the [[brief (architecture)|brief]] would be disastrous for the acoustics. According to Peter Jones, the stage designer, Martin Carr, criticised the "shape, height and width of the stage, the physical facilities for artists, the location of the dressing rooms, the widths of doors and lifts, and the location of lighting switchboards."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;page203&lt;/ref&gt;

===Significant changes to Utzon's design===

* The major hall, which was originally to be a multipurpose opera/concert hall, became solely a concert hall, called the Concert Hall. The minor hall, originally for stage productions only, incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre, later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre. As a result, the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large-scale opera and ballet. A theatre, a cinema and a library were also added. These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre "in the round". These now comprise the Drama Theatre, the Playhouse and the Studio respectively. These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief, which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used. The layout of the interiors was changed, and the stage machinery, already designed and fitted inside the major hall, was pulled out and largely thrown away, as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary ''Autopsy on a Dream'', which "chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Doug: [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/21/autopsy-on-a-dream-unflattering-national-psyche Review of rediscovered Sydney Opera House film ''Autopsy on a Dream''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305064511/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/oct/21/autopsy-on-a-dream-unflattering-national-psyche |date=5 March 2016 }} at ''[[The Guardian]]'', 21 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* Externally, the cladding to the podium and the paving (the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water, but to be left open).
* The construction of the glass walls (Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood [[mullion]]s, but a different system was designed to deal with the glass).
* Utzon's plywood corridor designs, and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls, were scrapped completely. His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000, which was considered insufficient.&lt;ref name="PJones"/&gt; Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer, and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good. The subsequent Todd, Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics, particularly for the performing musicians. The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians' hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Morgan, Joyce |date=November 2006 |title=The phantoms that threaten the Opera House |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-phantoms-that-threaten-the-opera-house/2006/11/10/1162661901377.html |accessdate=13 March 2007 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016055723/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/the-phantoms-that-threaten-the-opera-house/2006/11/10/1162661901377.html |archive-date=16 October 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Concert Hall has a very high roof, leading to a lack of early reflections onstage—[[perspex]] rings (the "acoustic clouds") hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an (unsuccessful) attempt to address this problem.

===Completion and cost===
The Opera House was formally completed in 1973, having cost [[Australian dollar|$]]102&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Government, Department of Commerce, [http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/guides-and-finding-aids/archives-in-brief/archives-in-brief-30] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126044007/http://www.records.nsw.gov.au/state-archives/guides-and-finding-aids/archives-in-brief/archives-in-brief-30 |date=26 November 2014 }} Accessed 3 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; H.R. "Sam" Hoare, the Hornibrook director in charge of the project, provided the following approximations in 1973:
Stage I: podium Civil &amp; Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5m.
Stage II: roof shells M.R. Hornibrook (NSW) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5m.
Stage III: completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5m.
Separate contracts: stage equipment, stage lighting and organ $9.0m.
Fees and other costs: $16.5m.

The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of [[Australian pound|£]]3,500,000 ($7&amp;nbsp;million) and completion date of 26 January 1963 ([[Australia Day]]).&lt;ref name="PJones"/&gt; In reality, the project was completed ten years late and 1,357% [[over budget]] in real terms.

==Utzon and his resignation==
[[File:Sydney Opera House - Dec 2008.jpg|thumb|right|The building illuminated at night]]
Before the Sydney Opera House competition, Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;page174&lt;/ref&gt; Utzon's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking. The Assessors Report of January 1957, stated:

{{quote|The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic. Nevertheless, as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings, we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world.}}

For the first stage, Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client, but, as the project progressed, the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions. They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction. Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design. This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined. The building was unique, and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans.

After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party, with [[Robert Askin]] becoming [[Premier of New South Wales]], the relationship of client, architect, engineers and contractors became increasingly tense. Askin had been a "vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office."&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |author=Farrelly, Elizabeth |author-link=Elizabeth Farrelly |title=High noon at Bennelong Point |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |access-date=3 December 2014 |date=30 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807212144/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |archive-date=7 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His new Minister for Public Works, [[Davis Hughes]], was even less sympathetic. [[Elizabeth Farrelly]], an Australian architecture critic, wrote that:
{{quote|at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon. Hughes had no interest in art, architecture or aesthetics. A fraud, as well as a philistine, he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree. The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance. For him, as for Utzon, it was all about control; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt;}}
[[File:1 The Opera House in Sydney.jpg|thumb|left|The Opera House seen from the north]]
Differences ensued. One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice, while the clients wanted a system (notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes) where architect, contractors, and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately. This had great implications for [[procurement]] methods and cost control, with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers (such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be [[Call for bids|put out to tender]].&lt;ref name="PMurray" /&gt;

Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee (SOHEC).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;page 191&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges, [[Harry Ingham Ashworth]]. Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change.

Utzon's ability was never in doubt, despite questions raised by Davis Hughes, who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer. Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was "probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects"&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;page 209&lt;/ref&gt; and: "The Opera House could become the world's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head."
[[File:Sydney Opera House, botanic gardens 1.jpg|thumb|left|The Opera House, backed by the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], from the eastern [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Botanic Gardens]]]]

In October 1965, Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Utzon was at this time working closely with [[Ralph Symonds]], a manufacturer of [[plywood]] based in Sydney and highly regarded by many, despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds's "knowledge of the design stresses of plywood, was extremely sketchy" and that the technical advice was "elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes." Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup's project engineer Michael Lewis as having "other agendas".&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt; In any case, Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered. By February 1966, Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |title=High noon at Bennelong Point |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=1 December 2008 |accessdate=3 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807212144/http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/high-noon-at-bennelong-point/2008/11/30/1227979845045.html?page=fullpage |archive-date=7 August 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff. The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation, Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes: "If you don't do it, I resign." Hughes replied: "I accept your resignation. Thank you very much. Goodbye."&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;page224&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sydney Opera House (Vivid Sydney 2012).jpg|thumb|right|The Opera House seen from [[The Rocks, Sydney|The Rocks]]]]
[[File:Sydney Opera House, vivid Sydey.JPG|thumb|right|The Sydney Opera House during [[Vivid Sydney]] (2013).]]
Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966. He said that Hughes's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as "Malice in Blunderland". In March 1966, Hughes offered him a subordinate role as "design architect" under a panel of executive architects, without any supervisory powers over the House's construction, but Utzon rejected this. Utzon left the country never to return.

Following the resignation, there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' initially opined: "No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon. Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW. One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other." On 17 March 1966, the ''Herald'' offered the view that:&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;page 228&lt;/ref&gt; "It was not his [Utzon's] fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project .... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step .... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along."

The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture. The design was one of the first examples of the use of [[computer-aided design]] to design complex shapes. The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture, such as works of [[Gehry]] and [[blobitecture]], as well as most reinforced concrete structures. The design is also one of the first in the world to use [[araldite]] to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use.

It was also a first in mechanical engineering. Another Danish firm, [[Steensen Varming]], was responsible for designing the new air-conditioning plant, the largest in Australia at the time, supplying over {{convert|600000|cuft|m3}} of air per minute,&lt;ref&gt;Sunday Mail, 9 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt; using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water-cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today.&lt;ref&gt;A. Building a masterpiece 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural design role of Peter Hall==
After the resignation of Utzon, the Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, and the Government Architect, Ted Farmer, organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion. The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall, Todd, Littlemore partnership. David Littlemore would manage construction supervision, Lionel Todd contract documentation, while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{RP|45}}

Peter Hall (1931–1995) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University. Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in [[Hellebæk]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ABC, The Opera House Project, online&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Sydney, Hall worked for the Government Architect, a branch of the NSW Public Works Department. While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings, including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales, which won the [[Sir John Sulman Medal]] in 1964.

Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice. When approached to take on the design role, (after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined), Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position. Utzon reportedly told Hall: he (Hall) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back.&lt;ref name="webber"&gt;{{cite book |author=Webber, Peter |title=Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House |publisher=The Watermark Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-949284-95-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=46}} Hall also sought the advice of others, including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would "never be his own".&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning. Even so, his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon Utzon's dismissal, a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point. A petition was also circulated, including in the Government Architects office. Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon's reinstatement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966, he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced. What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity, acoustics and structure.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|42}} In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief. To bring himself up to speed, Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan, while establishing his team. In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967. The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|53}} Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls, their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|49}} With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants, Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973.

A former Government Architect, Peter Webber, in his book ''Peter Hall: the Phantom of the Opera House'', concludes: when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified (than Hall) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House.&lt;ref name="webber"/&gt;{{rp|126}}

==Opening==
[[File:Tourists and Sydney Opera Hosue.jpg|thumb|right|Tourists observing the Opera House.]]
The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II, [[Monarchy of Australia|Queen of Australia]], on 20 October 1973. A large crowd attended. Utzon was not invited to the ceremony, nor was his name mentioned. The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author1=Lewis, Wendy |author-link1=Wendy Lewis |author2=Balderstone, Simon |author3=Bowan, John |title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=239–243 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance firsts==
During the construction phase, lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers, with American vocalist [[Paul Robeson]] the first artist to perform, in 1960.

Various performances were presented prior to the official opening:
* The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973, played by [[Romola Costantino]] to an invited audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bentley, Paul |url=http://www.twf.org.au/search/sohstory3.html |title=The Wolanski Foundation |publisher=Twf.org.au |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127144413/http://twf.org.au/search/sohstory3.html |archive-date=27 January 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first opera performed was [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s ''[[War and Peace (opera)|War and Peace]]'', in what was then known as the Opera Theatre on 28 September 1973, conducted by the [[Opera Australia|Australian Opera]]'s Music Director, [[Edward Downes]]. (It had been intended that [[Peter Sculthorpe]]'s work ''[[Rites of Passage (Sculthorpe)|Rites of Passage]]'' would have this honour, but it was not ready on time. ''Rites of Passage'' was premiered almost exactly a year later, on 27 September 1974.)
* The first evening performance of an opera was [[Larry Sitsky]]'s ''The Fall of the House of Usher'', conducted by [[Rex Hobcroft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suzukimusicwa.com.au/rexhobcroft.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121230222722/http://www.suzukimusicwa.com.au/rexhobcroft.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 December 2012 |title=Suzuki Talent Education Association of Australia (WA) Inc |publisher=Suzukimusicwa.com.au |date= |accessdate=23 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and paired with ''Dalgerie'' by [[James Penberthy]], to a libretto by [[Mary Durack]]; it took place on 25 July 1973.&lt;ref name="GriffelBlock1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Margaret Ross Griffel]]|author2=Adrienne Fried Block|title=Operas in English: A Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WxIKAQAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-25310-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973. It was an all-[[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] orchestral concert performed by the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], conducted by [[Charles Mackerras]] and with [[Birgit Nilsson]] as the soprano soloist. The first music played was the Prelude to ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]''. The concert closed with the Immolation Scene from ''[[Götterdämmerung]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

After the opening:
* The first violin and piano recital was given by [[Wanda Wiłkomirska]], with pianist [[Geoffrey Parsons (pianist)|Geoffrey Parsons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sigridharris.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/interview-with-a-famous-violinist-wanda-wilkomirska/ |title=Interview with Wanda Wilkomirska |publisher=Sigridharris.wordpress.com |date=25 November 2007 |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108092908/http://sigridharris.wordpress.com/2007/11/25/interview-with-a-famous-violinist-wanda-wilkomirska/ |archive-date=8 November 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation with Utzon; building refurbishment==
In the late 1990s, the [[Sydney Opera House Trust]] resumed communication with Utzon in an attempt to effect a reconciliation and to secure his involvement in future changes to the building. In 1999, he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Sydney Opera House Media Release | date=August 1999 | title=Utzon Appointment: 'Reunites The Man and his Masterpiece' | url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/sections/media_room/media_releases/press_release.asp?idPressRelease=15&amp;sm=5&amp;ss=19 | accessdate=13 March 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118233459/https://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/sections/media_room/media_releases/press_release.asp?idPressRelease=15&amp;sm=5&amp;ss=19 | archive-date=18 November 2006 | dead-url=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A state memorial service, attended by Utzon's son Jan and daughter Lin, celebrating his creative genius, was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances, readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene.

Refurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009, the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999. Designed by Utzon and his son [[Jan Utzon|Jan]], the project provided improved ticketing, toilet and cloaking facilities. New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with [[Baby transport|prams]]. The prominent [[Paralympic Games|paralympian]] athlete [[Louise Sauvage]] was announced as the building's "accessibility ambassador" to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/uploadedFiles/accessplan.pdf Sydney Opera House: Access Strategic Plan, 2013–2015]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on official website&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 2016, an original 1959 [[tapestry]] by [[Le Corbusier]] (2.18 x 3.55 metres), commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called ''Les Dés Sont Jetés'' (The Dice Are Cast), was finally unveiled ''in situ'' after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years. The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015. It now hangs in the building's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public.

In the second half of 2017, the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works. The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020-2021.

==Public and commemorative events==
In 1993, [[Constantine Koukias]] was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose ''Icon'', a large-scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AusStage|url=http://www.ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/18737|website=www.ausstage.edu.au|access-date=29 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805013606/http://ausstage.edu.au/pages/event/18737|archive-date=5 August 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], the venue served as the focal point for the [[Triathlon at the 2000 Summer Olympics|triathlon]] events. The event had a {{Convert|1.5|km|mi|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} swimming loop at Farm Cove, along with competitions in the neighbouring [[Royal Botanical Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanical Gardens]] for the cycling and running portions of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 Summer Olympics official report.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109071400/http://www.olympics.com/eng/ |date=9 November 2000 }} Volume 1. pp. 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2013, a group of residents from the nearby [[Bennelong Apartments]] (better known as 'The [[Bennelong Apartments|Toaster]]'), calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group, have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval (DA). In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015. However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels. The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/music/noise-fine-toaster-folks-first-win-over-opera-house-concerts/news-story/91362db275f0485a9ba4475525099de8|title=Noise fine: Toaster folks’ first win over Opera House concerts|first=Michaela|last=Boland|publisher=[[The Australian]]|date=22 February 2017|accessdate=10 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4625239.htm|title=Sydney Opera House fined $15,000 following 'Toaster' noise complaints|first=Al|last=Newstead|publisher=[[TripleJ]]|date=23 February 2017|accessdate=10 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170617234407/http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4625239.htm|archive-date=17 June 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising controversy ==
On 5 October 2018 the Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] who called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise [[The Everest]] horse race.  Within hours, NSW Premier [[Gladys Berejiklian]] overruled Herron.  Two days later, Prime Minister [[Scott Morrison]] supported the decision, calling the Opera House "the biggest billboard Sydney has".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-07/pm-says-sydney-opera-house-biggest-billboard-sydney-has/10348398|title=PM Scott Morrison says Opera House is 'the biggest billboard Sydney has'|date=2018-10-07|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-AU|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181007092051/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-10-07/pm-says-sydney-opera-house-biggest-billboard-sydney-has/10348398|archive-date=7 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NSW Labor party leader, Luke Foley, and senior federal Labor frontbencher [[Anthony Albanese]] have supported the proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/06/its-not-a-billboard-anger-at-use-of-sydney-opera-house-for-horse-racing-ads |title='It's not a billboard': anger at use of Sydney Opera House for horse racing ads |date=6 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |access-date=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181008174901/https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/06/its-not-a-billboard-anger-at-use-of-sydney-opera-house-for-horse-racing-ads |archive-date=8 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The political view is not supported by significant public opinion, with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tendaily.com.au/news/australia/a181009xdz/thousands-attend-sydney-opera-house-protest-shine-lights-onto-sails-20181009|title=Protesters Shine Lights Onto Opera House - ten daily|website=tendaily.com.au|accessdate=9 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009154704/https://tendaily.com.au/news/australia/a181009xdz/thousands-attend-sydney-opera-house-protest-shine-lights-onto-sails-20181009|archive-date=9 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW parliament in the morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.themandarin.com.au/99692-petition-supporting-opera-house-boss-surges-past-265000-signatures/ |work=The Mandarin |title=Petition supporting Opera House boss surges past 265,000 signatures |date=9 October 2018 |access-date=9 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009132200/https://www.themandarin.com.au/99692-petition-supporting-opera-house-boss-surges-past-265000-signatures/ |archive-date=9 October 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81% of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier's direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/eight-out-of-10-in-nsw-opposed-to-berejiklian-s-opera-house-sails-deal-survey-20181009-p508oc.html|title=Eight out of 10 in NSW opposed to Berejiklian's Opera House sails deal: survey|first=Jacob Saulwick, Jenny Noyes, Deborah|last=Snow|date=9 October 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=9 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009211232/https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/eight-out-of-10-in-nsw-opposed-to-berejiklian-s-opera-house-sails-deal-survey-20181009-p508oc.html|archive-date=9 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an affectionate spoof of [[role-playing game]]s, and often shown at [[gaming convention]]s. A sequel entitled ''[[The Gamers: Dorkness Rising]]'' was set to be released in 2006, but was delayed due to problems finding a distributor; it was eventually released on [[DVD]] in August 2008 at conventions and online.

A second sequel ''[[The Gamers: Hands of Fate]]'' was funded via [[Kickstarter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Plot==
The movie flips between following a group of [[gamer]]s in a dorm immersed in a role-playing game, and their characters (played by the same actors) as they journey through a world of fantasy and wonder to defeat a being known as "The Shadow" and rescue a princess. The latter is theoretically a heroic quest, but while the game master attempts to foster in a narrative, the players tend to be more interested in their characters' tolerance for ale, trying to apply the sneak attack damage multiplier to [[Ballista|siege weaponry]], et cetera.

The movie both makes fun of gamer stereotypes and plays the discrepancy between an optimal RPG plot and the events of an actual RPG session for maximum absurdity. Characters attempting something dangerous freeze as dice clatter in the distance. The party thief [[Pickpocketing|picks the pocket]] of a bystander, then steals that bystander's [[trousers|pants]]—not because he wants the pants in any way, but solely to see if his skill statistics allow it.  When an unlucky dice roll causes the death of one character, the other players' characters mourn him for a moment, and then immediately start squabbling over the items he was carrying.  Characters spring to action, then keel over as their players forget and are reminded that the characters are asleep, players argue and make snack runs, and their game is frequently interrupted by a girl from the same dorm who demands they keep quiet so that she can study.

The Shadow is eventually defeated, after a long quest, and the characters find themselves in a strange tunnel.  On the other side of the door, they hear voices—the voices of their players, who are narrating the action in the hallway outside.  Bursting into the room (as dictated by the players), the characters slaughter the gamers, then begin picking over the room for treasure.  Discovering that their entire adventure has been documented by the 'strange sorcerers' they've just slain, they discover their character sheets (which inadvertently insults the group's warrior, because his Intelligence statistic is only 4).  In the midst of these revelations, the 'Princess' (the girl who needs to study and is constantly interrupted by the gamers' noise) bursts in and reads them the riot act, thinking their outfits to be mere costumes; after she leaves, the adventurers seem quite stunned that their beloved Princess has such a foul mouth and temper.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
In 2013 [[Zombie Orpheus Entertainment]] in cooperation with [[Dead Gentlemen Productions]] and [[Lynnvander Inc]] produced two mini miniseries, "Natural One" and "Humans &amp; Households", set in the Gamers universe. Both series mirror the structure of "The Gamers" by showing both players of a roleplaying game and the fictitious characters they are playing.

"Natural One"  features the characters Leo and Gary (both are main characters in "Dorkness Rising" and "Hands of Fate"). The plot revolves around Monica, Gary's sister, who wants to marry her fiancé, Ryan. However, since Ryan is not a geek and an old agreement between Gary and Monica states that both of them may only marry geeks, Ryan has to prove his geekiness by beating a roleplaying game scenario before Gary gives his blessing to the wedding. The fictitious roleplaying game featured in the film is an homage to the popular [[cyberpunk]] roleplaying game [[Shadowrun]].

"Humans &amp; Households" (the title is a reference to [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]) turns the concept of "The Gamers" on its head: Characters in the fantasy world of "The Gamers" play a roleplaying game set in our world.

In April 2015, a web series continuation of the plot of The Gamers was announced. It will lead directly into the events of the next movie in the series and will chronicle exploits of the protagonists' characters who are now lost in the modern world. The project will be funded via Kickstarter, much like The Gamers: Hands of Fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''''The Great God Pan''''' is an outdoor [[bronze sculpture]] of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] by American artist [[George Grey Barnard]] currently installed on the grounds of [[Columbia University]]. 

The work was originally commissioned by one of Barnard's most important patrons, [[Alfred Corning Clark]], for the interior courtyard of [[The Dakota]], an apartment building on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper West Side]]. However, it was never installed there. Upon completion, [[Alfred Corning Clark]] donated the sculpture instead to [[Central Park]]. After [[Alfred Corning Clark]]'s death, a permanent site for the sculpture could not be determined with [[Central Park]]. It was included in several exhibitions, including the [[Paris Exposition of 1900]], [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] and the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYhMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA485&amp;lpg=PA485&amp;dq=pan+columbia+university+barnard+george+grey&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=I-SWGC_49v&amp;sig=oyINFEXhK4YlBY6r-99whD5Z1cI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimzJC0g_fSAhUPySYKHd-EBm44ChDoAQgeMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=pan%20columbia%20university%20barnard%20george%20grey&amp;f=false|title="The Great God Pan"|last=Carpenter|first=William H.|date=September 1908|work=Columbia University Quarterly|publisher=|year=|isbn=|volume=10|location=|pages=485-88|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His son, [[Edward Severin Clark]], acting on behalf of his estate, ultimately donated the work to [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Charles Follen McKim]] installed the sculpture as a functional fountain in the northeast corner of the campus in 1907.

'''"The Professor of Practical Jokes"''' is a literary fairy tale published in 1898 by British [[suffragist]] and author [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] (1829–1955). The story tells of a good yet boring king who is tricked into marrying one of his courtiers daughters, who brings excitement into his dull kingdom. The story is one of many published in Sharp's collection, [[All the Way to Fairyland|All The Way To Fairyland: Fairy Stories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm#chap06 |title=The Project Gutenberg E-text of All the Way to Fairyland, by Evelyn Sharp |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story begins by introducing a King named Grumbelo. His kingdom is well governed and he is well loved, but his people find him dull and are quite bored. One day some of his [[courtiers]], one of whom is the Professor of Practical Jokes, approach him and suggest he find himself a wife in order to bring excitement to the kingdom. Grumbelo reluctantly agrees and sets his criteria: his wife must be the most beautiful, the most silent, and the most foolish princess in the world. With these specifications in mind, the king's courtiers begin gathering as many beautiful princesses as possible and present them to Grumbelo, who rejects each and every one of them because they aren't silent enough. After their failure, the courtiers once again approach Grumbelo and inform him of a princess who meets all of his criteria; however, she does not desire to marry ''him'' and has fled the kingdom. Intrigued by the notion that someone would not want to marry him, he decides to set out and find her. After extensive searching, the king comes upon a little house in the forest, guarded by a dragon. By conversing with the dragon he discovers that Lady Whimsical lives in the house. She shows no romantic interest in the king, but agrees to let him visit her for a period of time each day. The king is persistent in seeing her daily, but eventually grows tired of her silence, causing him to lose patience and run away . He realizes that he would like a wife who speaks, and guided by the Wise Woman of the Wood, he decides to return and admit his foolishness to Lady Whimsical. She happily welcomes him and admits a secret of her own: she hid herself on purpose because she heard he was looking for a princess and she wanted him to find her! There was never a princess for him to find, only her: the daughter of the Professor of Practical Jokes. Grumbelo and Lady Whimsical then return to the kingdom and marry, and the kingdom is happy as can be.

== About the Author ==
Primarily a journalist, Evelyn Sharp also wrote fantasy, novels, an account of dance, studies of children, a biography, an autobiography and a comic libretto.  In the composition of her literature for children, Sharp "followed her own advice, which is mentioned in ''The Books Children Like'' (1922), that writing should make children “feel on a level with the author”'.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Beverly Lyon. "Sharp, Evelyn." The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature. : Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference. 2006. Date Accessed 10 Feb. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195146561.001.0001/acref-9780195146561-e-2948&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature "Evelyn Sharp's collections ''[[Wymps and Other Fairy Tales]]'' (1897) and ''[[All the Way to Fairyland]]'' (1897), are contrasting works that take pleasure in turning things upside-down. Sharp enjoyed writing "anti-fairies", whom she called 'wymps', which emphasized common themes of people playing practical jokes and causing chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Manlove, C. N., and Inc ebrary. From Alice to Harry Potter: Children's Fantasy in England. Christchurch, N.Z: Cybereditions, 2003.Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">'''Unrealised Projects''' is an artist run web-based project established in London by [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]] in 2003. Unrealised Projects investigates the potential of unrecognised, unfinished or unfulfilled ideas. The project is ongoing.

[[Lisa Le Feuvre]] writing on Art Failure states:

:“Other, more recent, catalogues of unrealised projects are [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]]’s Unbuilt Roads or the online archive Unrealised Projects devised by artist [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]. These collections show proposals that have been deemed failures before they have been realised, yet nonetheless they are released into the space of critical engagement.” &lt;ref&gt;Le Feuvre, Lisa, February 2008, [[Art Monthly]] 313, ‘Art Failure’, {{ISSN|0142-6702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Ely and Lynn Harris are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as [[Per Hüttner]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], [[Apolonija Šušteršič]], Simon Morris, [[Dallas Seitz]] and [[Denise Hawyrsio]]. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonskiene, Lolita, October 2008, Printed Project, Issue 10, 'The Art of Living with Strangers', p132, ISSN 1649-4075.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrealised Projects have participated in [[Publish And Be Damned]], an annual independent publishing fair in both 2009 and 2006, in June 2009 Volume 4 publication (a partial introduction to a process in progress) was launched at the [[Liverpool Artists Book Fair]] at [[A Foundation]].

The '''Vorstengraf''' (''[[Grave (burial)|grave]] of the king'') in [[Oss]] is one of the largest [[burial mounds]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The hill was 3 metres high and had a diameter of 54 metres.  

==First, second and third Vorstengraf==
In 1933, the so-called Vorstengraf was uncovered during the construction of a trailer park on the [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]. It contained a bronze bucket containing a curved iron sword from 700 BC. The find was transferred to the [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]] in [[Leiden]]. The site of the hill was later a junkyard. The mound is now partly restored, a portion of the circumference of the hill is marked with poles. 

In 2009, a second Vorstengraf was discovered a few hundred metres from the first Vorstengraf. The finds from this tomb are displayed in the Jan Cunen Museum in Oss. In 2011, it was announced that a third ''Vorstengraf'' was discovered in [[Uden]].

==Pile graves==

[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|250px|The original curved iron sword, [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]]]]
[[File:Oss vorstengraf.jpg|thumb|250px|The Vorstengraf from above]]
The Vorstengraf is located at the [[Interchange (road)|interchange]] ''Paalgraven''. This node is named after the pile graves that have been found in the immediate vicinity. These tombs were built in the period of the Early [[Bronze Age]] to the Early [[Iron Age]], between 2000 BC to 700 BC. 

To the east of Oss a new highway was built to connect the A50 and A59 from [[Emmeloord]] to [['s-Hertogenbosch]] (formerly the junction with the N265 [[Eindhoven]]-Oss). 

In the vicinity of the tomb two Forest Hills Tree Wreaths were excavated. According to archaeologists the poles probably had a [[ritual]] function. One of the hills is surrounded by a ditch. 

To the east and south of the Vorstengraf an urnfield was found dating back to the Late Bronze Age and Early Iron Age. Cremated remains are interred in an urn or cloth. Soon after the establishment of the Vorstengraf the burial ground was closed.

==Seven Mounds==
The area ''De Zevenbergen'' - ''Seven Mounds'' - was examined in 1964 and 1965 and seven burial mounds were found. When the junction was later modified the area had another investigation. Trial slots revealed that there had been a line of poles over a length of at least 100 meter in the area. In 2004 began the actual excavation of the multiple burial hills. 

In the 13th century a gallows was built on one of these hills. This was at a crossroads of continuous ruts on the heath and the remains of two victims were found nearby.

==Myths==
There are folk tales associated with the mound, local historian Jan Cunen (1884-1940) once recorded that a prince must have been buried in the heath.

The hill is also called Hansjoppenmountain. There are several stories about the [[Gnome]] Hans Joppen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2508">[[File:Federal Court Canada.jpg|thumb|Winged sea caribou is used in the Coat of Arms of the Federal Court]]
The '''Winged Sea Caribou''' is a [[mythical creature]] featured on the heraldic coat of arms of the [[Federal Court of Canada]] (FCC).

==History==
In 2003, the Federal Court of Canada was recreated and separated from Federal Court of Appeal. This required the creation of a new coat of arms.&lt;ref name = "lawyer weekly"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Schmitz |first=Cristin |url=http://www.lawyersweekly.ca/index.php?section=article&amp;articleid=896 |title=Federal Court chooses mythical creature for coat of arms |date=2009-04-10 |work=Lawyer's Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept for the coat of arms was proposed by [[Robert Watt|Robert D. Watt]] and [[Claire Boudreau]] of the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].&lt;ref name = "court" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://cas-ncr-nter03.cas-satj.gc.ca/portal/page/portal/fc_cf_en/CoatofArms |title=The Federal Court's Coat of Arms |date=2013-01-04 |publisher=Federal Court}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was painted by Eva Pilar-Cass and calligraphed by Doris Wionzek at a cost of $4,500.&lt;ref name = "lawyer weekly" /&gt; The coat of arms entered Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada on December 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=1203 |title=Register of Arms, Flags and Badges |publisher=The Governor General of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was granted by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] in October 2008.

==Motto==
The motto “Droit, Equity, Admiralty” means "law, equity and admiralty”.&lt;ref name = "court" /&gt; 

== Morphology ==
This fantastic Canadian beast has the head of a [[caribou]], the wings and claws of a [[raven]], and the posterior of a [[salmon]].  This unique morphology reflects the FCC's jurisdiction over federal land matters, aeronautics, and law of the oceans.  The Federal Court of Canada website explains: "The winged sea caribou is a mythic creature representing the Court’s involvement with issues on the land, in the sea and other waters, and in the air. The three constituent creatures, the caribou, the raven and the salmon are found in many parts of Canada. The male and female supporters represent the equality of the sexes, as well as the fact that the Federal Court is {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} both male and female judicial officers."&lt;ref name = "court" /&gt;

'''Yael Bartana''' ({{lang-he|יעל ברתנא}}; born 1970, [[Kfar Yehezkel]], [[Israel]]) is an Israeli artist working in film, installation and  photography. Her work investigates "the imagery of identity and the politics of memory."{{cn|date=June 2018}} She is perhaps best known for the film trilogy ''And Europe Will Be Stunned'', which premiered at the [[Venice Biennale#Poland|Polish pavilion]] of the 2011 [[Venice Biennale]] and explores notions of identity and nationalism inherent to the right of return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yael Bartana|journal=Modern Painters|date=2014|volume=26|issue=3|pages=27–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is based in [[Amsterdam]], [[Berlin]], and [[Tel Aviv]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ago.net/meet-the-artist-yael-bartana|title=Meet The Artist, Yael Bartana|website=Ago|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Bartana received a BFA in photography from the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]] Academy, [[Jerusalem]], a MFA in 1999 from the [[School of Visual Arts]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and was an artist in residence at the [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van Beelden de Kunsten]] in Amsterdam for two years, ending in 2001.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Career ==
[[File:AND EUROPE WILL BE STUNNED.jpg|thumb|"...and Europe will be stunned", 2012 on the outside wall of Helena Rubinstein Pavilion for Contemporary Art]]Yael Bartana’s films, film installations and photographs challenge the national consciousness that is propagated by her native country of Israel. Bartana focuses her work on the implied meanings of terms related to "homeland", "return", and "belonging".{{cn|date=June 2018}} Her photography, film, and sound works investigate questions surrounding society, spirituality, and politics.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Bartana's platform for investigation includes ceremonies, public rituals and social diversions that are intended to reaffirm the collective identity of countries. Working outside the country, she observes it from a critical distance. Her early films were primarily registrations in which aesthetic interventions, including soundtracks, slowing the image and specific camera perspectives, played a role. 

Between 2006 and 2011, she was working in Poland, creating the trilogy ''And Europe Will Be Stunned'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMG-Vk39m8M|title=Yael Bartana ...and Europe will be Stunned}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMG-Vk39m8M|title=Yael Bartana ...and Europe will be Stunned|first=|last=SEA Foundation Tilburg|date=27 March 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; which examines 19th- and 20th-century [[Europe]] as a historic homeland for [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. This is a project on the history of Polish-Jewish relations and its influence on the contemporary Polish identity. The trilogy represented Poland in the 54th International Art Exhibition in Venice (the [[Venice Biennale]], 2011). In recent years, she has increasingly staged her films, and proposed utopic narratives for new chapters of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/19/arts/design/yael-bartana-and-europe-will-be-stunned.html|title=Yael Bartana: And Europe Will Be Stunned|last=Smith|first=Roberta|date=18 April 2013|work=The New York Times|access-date=13 March 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first non-Polish citizen to represent Poland.

As a solo exhibition, her video trilogy has been on display at museums around the world.{{cn|date=June 2018}} In 2013 her film ''And Europe Will Be Stunned'' was acquired in the permanent collection by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]] and the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.guggenheim.org/press-release/bartanaacquisition|title=Guggenheim and Tel Aviv Museum of Art Announce Acquisition of Yael Bartana Video|date=5 March 2013|work=Guggenheim|access-date=10 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yael Bartana has had several solo exhibitions held at various venues including: the [[Museum of Modern Art, Warsaw|Museum of Modern Art]] in [[Warsaw]], [[Van Abbemuseum]] in [[Eindhoven]], [[MoMA PS1]] in [[New York City]], and [[Moderna Museet]] [[Malmö]]. She participated in [[Documenta]] 12 in [[Kassel]] in 2007, in the [[São Paulo Art Biennial]] 2010 and won the Artes Mundi Prize in 2010.&lt;ref name="BBCNews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8692717.stm |title=Israeli Yael Bartana is Artes Mundi 4 winner  |publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=19 May 2010 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
