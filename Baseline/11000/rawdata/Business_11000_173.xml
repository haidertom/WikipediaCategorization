      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">In [[economics]], '''average fixed cost''' ('''AFC''') is the [[fixed cost]]s of production (FC) divided by the quantity (Q) of output produced. Fixed costs are those costs that must be incurred in fixed quantity regardless of the level of output produced.

:&lt;math&gt;AFC=\frac{FC}{Q}.&lt;/math&gt;

Average fixed cost is a per-unit-of-output  of fixed costs.  As the total number of units of the good produced increases, the average fixed cost decreases because the same amount of fixed costs is being spread over a larger number of units of output.

[[Average variable cost]] plus average fixed cost equals [[average cost|average total cost]]:

:&lt;math&gt;ATC=AVC+AFC&lt;/math&gt;

== Explanation ==

=== Example 1 ===
Assume a firm produces clothing. When the quantity of the output varies from 5 shirts to 10 shirts, fixed cost would be 30 dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12|title=Microeconomics|last=Dorman|first=Peter|date=2014|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=9783642374333|series=Springer Texts in Business and Economics|pages=249–274|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-37434-0_12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, average fixed cost of producing 5 shirts would be 30 dollars divided by 5 shirts, which is 6 dollars.  In other words, when 5 shirts are produced, 30 dollars of fixed cost would spread and result in 6 dollars per shirt. Similarly, average fixed cost of producing 10 shirts would be 3 dollars derived from 30 dollars divided by 10 shirts.
[[File:Average_fixed_cost.png|thumb|A table and graph of average fixed cost]]

=== Example 2 ===
In Example1, there was no information about average total cost and average variable cost. If the firm knows average total cost and average variable cost, it is possible to find the same result as Example 1. Because average total cost is average variable cost plus average fixed cost, average fixed cost is average total cost minus average variable cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amosweb.com/cgi-bin/awb_nav.pl?s=wpd&amp;c=dsp&amp;k=average+fixed+cost|title=AmosWEB is Economics: Encyclonomic WEB*pedia|website=www.amosweb.com|access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If producing 5 shirts generates average total cost of 11 dollars and average variable cost of 5 dollars, fixed cost would be 6 dollars. Similarly, the firm produces 10 shirts and average total cost and average variable cost is 10 dollars and 7 dollars respectively. In this case, average fixed cost would be 3 dollars.

{{Portal|Gemology and Jewelry}}

==History==
[[Image:Frédéric Boucheron00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Frédéric Boucheron&lt;/center&gt;]]

===At the origins===
The House of Boucheron is a French family dynasty founded by Frederic Boucheron in 1858, with the opening of his first store in the Galerie de Valois, at [[Palais-Royal]], during the heyday of the [[Second French Empire]]. He created his atelier in 1866 and a year later won the Gold Medal during the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]].

In 1893, Frédéric Boucheron became the first [[jeweller]] to move to [[Place Vendôme]]. Legend has it that he chose 26 [[Place Vendôme]], where Boucheron remains to this day, because it was the sunniest corner of the square.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He believed that the [[diamonds]] in the windows would sparkle all the more brilliantly.

In 1893, Boucheron opened a store in Moscow, later transferred to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1911. In 1903 a store in London and an office in New York. More store openings followed in [[Japan]] in 1973, [[Shanghai]], [[Dubai]] in 2005, and finally [[Hong Kong]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in 2006.

Boucheron was a family business; after the death of its founder Frédéric Boucheron in 1902, his descendants took over the business.
In 1994, the family business shifted to a more global approach with its selling out to Schweizerhall.

The House of Boucheron was then acquired by former [[Gucci]] Group in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.professionaljeweler.com/archives/news/2000/052400story.html |title=Gucci Buys Boucheron |publisher=Professionaljeweler.com |date=2000-05-24 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was bought by [[PPR (company)|PPR]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Finance |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2881950/Confident-Gucci-holds-attraction-for-PPR.html |title=Confident Gucci holds attraction for PPR |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Bouissou was appointed CEO in April 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bishop |first=Kathryn |url=http://www.professionaljeweller.com/article-9456-new-president-and-ceo-appointed-at-boucheron/ |title=New president and CEO appointed at Boucheron |publisher=ProfessionalJeweller.com |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822220103/http://www.professionaljeweller.com/article-9456-new-president-and-ceo-appointed-at-boucheron/ |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Helene Poulit-Duquesne in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2015/07/09/cartier-executive-named-ceo-of-boucheron/ |title=Cartier Executive Named CEO Of Boucheron |publisher=forbes.com |date=2015-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The royal years===
In 1878, the Russian Prince Felix Youssoupoff purchased a corsage decorated with 6 detachable diamond bows during one of his visits to [[Paris]].

In 1921, Boucheron was commissioned to make a tiara for Lady Greville which was later given to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orderofsplendor.blogspot.com/2011/09/tiara-thursday-boucheron-honeycomb.html |title=The Royal Order of Sartorial Splendor: Tiara Thursday: The Boucheron Honeycomb Tiara |publisher=Orderofsplendor.blogspot.com |date=2011-09-08 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her grandson [[Prince Charles]] passed the tiara on to his wife [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madhattery.royalroundup.com/2009/10/state-banquet-hrh-the-duchess-of-cornwall/ |title=Mad Hattery! » Blog Archive » State Banquet: HRH The Duchess of Cornwall |publisher=Madhattery.royalroundup.com |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Elizabeth II]] also has a collection of Boucheron jewels.

In 1928, the [[Maharaja of Patiala]] asked Boucheron to set the stones of his treasure, which were brought to the [[Place Vendôme]] boutique by the prince.

In addition to [[Czar Alexander III]], royal patrons of Boucheron have included [[Bhupinder Singh of Patiala|Maharajah Sir Bhupinder Singh of Patiala]], [[Riza Shah Pahlevi]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida of Egypt]] and [[Queen Rania of Jordan]].

===Collections===
One of the first lines created was the symbolic snake line in the 1970s.

[[Solange Azagury-Partridge]] was appointed Creative Director in 2001, she held the position for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Harriet|title=Queen of the stone age: Solange Azagury-Partridge has never been too precious to go her own way|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/queen-of-the-stone-age-solange-azagurypartridge-has-never-been-too-precious-to-go-her-own-way-7678854.html?origin=internalSearch|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Independent, The|date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2002 saw the launch of the "Beauté Dangereuse" and "Cinna Pampilles" collections, "Not Bourgeois" launched the following year.

In 2004, the "Jaipur" High Jewellery line and the "Déchaînée" collection are launched.

2005 is a very creative year for the House of Boucheron : the "Trouble", "Quatre", "Diablotine", "Vingt-Six" and "Trouble Désir" jewellery lines are launched.

In 2006 "Exquises Confidences" is launched, and a year later "Fleurs Fatales" high jewellery collection makes its debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris-joaillerie.com/paris-joaillerie/collection/un-florilege-de-sortileges-selon-boucheron.html |title=Collections - Un florilège de sortilèges selon Boucheron |publisher=Paris-joaillerie.com |date=2007-12-02 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Boucheron unveiled a colorful jewellery range to enhance its "Cinna Pampilles" collection.

In 2011, the "Cabinet of Curiosities" line was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lucire.com/2011/0207fe0.shtml |title=Lucire Fashion: A cabinet of curiosities – The global fashion magazine |publisher=Lucire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collaborations===
In 1996 Boucheron collaborated with Waterman Paris to produce the limited edition, ''Edson signe Boucheron''. The nib was made of 18K solid gold with the body of the pen being of a blue translucent Resin. The retail price was €2000 / $2700 / £1700 and limited to only 3471 pieces (this number is the sum of the years of foundation of Waterman, 1883, and Boucheron, 1858). The pen remains one of the most sought after pieces within the fine writing category.

In 2006, Boucheron and [[Alexander McQueen]] collaborated to create a limited-edition Novak bag that incorporates the snake motif of Boucheron's Trouble line.

The beginning of a collaboration between Boucheron and Swiss watchmaker [[Girard-Perregaux]] started a year later in 2007, amongst which feature the LadyHawk Tourbillon and the limited Boucheron tribute watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luxury-insider.com/luxury-news/2010/10/girard-perregaux-limited-edition-boucheron-tribute |title=Girard-Perregaux Limited Edition Boucheron Tribute - Luxury News from |publisher=Luxury Insider |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Boucheron and [[MB&amp;F]] launched the HM3 JwlryMachine timepiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Adams |first=Ariel |url=http://www.luxist.com/2010/10/05/mbandf-and-boucheron-team-up-for-the-jwlrymachine-watch/ |title=MB&amp;F &amp; Boucheron Team Up For The JwlryMachine Watch |publisher=Luxist.com |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2012-08-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228160803/http://www.luxist.com/2010/10/05/mbandf-and-boucheron-team-up-for-the-jwlrymachine-watch# |archive-date=2010-12-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boucheron today===
It has 34 boutiques worldwide and an online e-commerce website launched in 2007. Claire Choisne was appointed Creative Director in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brunel|first=Charlotte|title=Claire Choisne réenchante Boucheron|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/styles/createurs/claire-choisne-reenchante-boucheron_1154439.html|publisher=www.lexpress.fr|accessdate=3 October 2012|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's estimated sales (in 2010/2011) were €50 million in total sales and €5 million in watches.&lt;ref name="Luxury"&gt;{{cite book | title=Luxury Brand Management | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | author=Chevalier, Michel | year=2012 | location=Singapore | isbn=978-1-118-17176-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

Boucheron makes watches, and jewellery, and licenses its marque for perfumes. The watch and jewelry making segments have existed for over 150 years. The first fragrance, "Boucheron," was launched in 1988. Over 22 men's and women's fragrances have been released. Since 2011 Boucheron fragrances have been created, produced and distributed under license by [[:fr:Interparfums|Interparfums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boucheron and Interparfums sign 15-year exclusive license agreement for fragrances|url=http://uk.fashionmag.com/news/Boucheron-and-Inter-Parfums-sign-15-year-exclusive-license-agreement-for-fragrances,141780.html|publisher=FashionMag.com|accessdate=23 September 2012|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boucheron International Rating of Diamonds==
Boucheron has compiled a classification system by which to determine the value of a diamond, developed on the basis of the diamond's international currency. The Boucheron method of appreciation has been registered under the name B.I.R.D. (Boucheron International Rating of [[Diamonds]]). This original classification system is based on an evaluation of diamond quality and relies on a combined analysis of two criteria: first, the degree of clarity and second, the colour of the stone. The point at which these two variables, "clarity" and "colour" intersect gives rise to a mark of appreciation of between 90/100 and 99/100 for the quality of the diamond. A mark of 100/100 would indicate that a stone possesses the ultimate degree of perfection, according to Boucheron's criteria.

==Vertu mobile phone==
In a joint venture with the mobile phone brand Vertu, Boucheron created the world's first High Jewellery limited edition cell phones out of gold and precious stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woollard |first=Deidre |url=http://www.luxist.com/2006/10/07/boucheron-for-vertu-phones/ |title=Boucheron for Vertu Phones |publisher=Luxist.com |date=2006-10-07 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collaboration continued with the 150th anniversary celebration with a new line of 7 Vertu mobile phones inspired by Boucheron's High Jewellery "Enchanting Boucheron" anniversary collection. There are only eight pieces of the Cobra model in rose gold set all round with rubies and a pear-cut diamond and emerald eyes.

'''Campagnolo''' is an Italian manufacturer of [[bicycle]] components with headquarters in [[Vicenza]], Italy. The components are organised as [[groupset]]s (gruppi), and are a near-complete collection of a bicycle's mechanical parts. Campagnolo's flagship components are the Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets that represent their recent shift to 11-speed drivetrains.  Record and Super Record are the top groupsets, followed by Chorus, Potenza, Centaur and Veloce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campyonly.com/history.html |title=History!! |publisher=Campyonly.com |date=1927-11-11 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campagnolo also produces aluminum and carbon wheels, as well as other components (like carbon fiber seat posts, and bottle-cages).

==History==

Founded by [[Tullio Campagnolo]], the company began in 1933 in a Vicenza workshop.  The founder was a racing cyclist in Italy in the 1920s who conceived several ideas while racing, such as the [[quick release]] mechanism for bicycle wheels, [[derailleur]]s, and the rod gear for gear changing.  Campagnolo has been awarded more than 135 patents for innovations in cycling technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://campyonly.com/history/campy_timeline.html|title=Campy Timeline|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamborghini Espada wheels.jpg|thumb|Magnesium wheel of [[Lamborghini Espada]] made by Campagnolo.]]
At the end of the 1950s, Campagnolo started to manufacture magnesium parts such as wheels for sports cars like [[Alfa Romeo]], [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]], and [[Maserati]], and built chassis for [[NASA]] satellites in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/milestones/index.jsp|title=Official Website Campagnolo - Bike Wheels and Groupsets|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531062837/http://www.campagnolo.com/jsp/en/milestones/index.jsp|archivedate=31 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Campagnolo produced a [[disc brake]] for the [[Innocenti]] [[Lambretta]] TV motorscooter - the first two-wheel production vehicle with such a brake. In the 1970s they also supplied wheels for Ferrari's [[Formula One]] cars.&lt;ref name="campyonly.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.campyonly.com/history/campy_timeline.html|title=Campy timeline|accessdate=2009-12-14|work=campyonly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campagnolo worked with the manufacturer [[Colnago]] and racer [[Eddy Merckx]] and produced lightweight parts for the bike he used to beat the world [[hour record]] in 1972.

Following Campagnolo's success during the 1970s and '80s, innovation lagged as rival [[Shimano]] developed indexed shifting and combined shifter/brake levers ([[Shimano Total Integration]]).  An unsuccessful foray into [[mountain biking]], the overbuilt and heavy Euclid, Centaur and Olympus groupsets contributed to the company's decline during those years.  By the time the expensive Record O.R. (off-road) and Icarus MTB groupsets made it to the market, Campagnolo's reputation was firmly cemented as a road bike brand.  As a result, Campagnolo pulled out of the Mountain Bike market in 1994.  Despite its struggles, Campagnolo introduced its [[Campagnolo ErgoPower|ErgoPower]] combined shifter/brake levers and renewed its focus on high-end road cycling components.

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Campagnolo's increased use of [[Carbon fiber reinforced plastic|carbon fibre]] and [[titanium]] parts in groupsets and the development of wheelsets.  In 2004, Campagnolo introduced a complete [[Compact drivetrain]] with smaller chainrings, to give lower gears than traditional drivetrains.  Other innovations included a Hirth-joint engineered Ultra-Torque external-bearing crankset and G3 spoke lacing for racing wheels.  In 2008, Campagnolo introduced 11-speed drivetrains with Super Record, Record, and Chorus groupsets.&lt;!-- blanked out the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campagnolo.com|title=Official Website Campagnolo - Bike Wheels and Groupsets|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reference, its the company/original source &amp; noted elsewhere, including campyonly.com --&gt;  Campagnolo has released an electronic version of its drivetrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pezcyclingnews.com/?pg=fullstory&amp;id=4772 |title=What's Cool In Pro Cycling |publisher=PezCycling News |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018 the company launched 12-speed Record and Super Record groupsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bikeradar.com/au/road/news/article/campagnolo-12-speed-record-and-super-record-groups-complete-information-prices-weights-and-availability-52062/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Campagnolo has focused on [[Road bicycle racing|road cycling]] and [[track cycling]].  It has sponsored teams in the [[UCI ProTour]] such as [[Astana Pro Team|Astana]], [[Movistar Team (men's team)|Movistar]], [[Lotto-Soudal]], [[Cofidis (cycling team)|Cofidis]], [[Quick Step-Innergetic]] (Tom Boonen, Paolo Bettini), and [[Lampre (UCI ProTour)|Lampre]].  Campagnolo is associated with the victories of [[Eddy Merckx]], who used Campagnolo exclusively and was a friend of Tullio Campagnolo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2548">A '''certificate of public convenience and necessity''' or '''certificate of public convenience''' is a type of [[regulatory compliance]] certification for [[public service]] industries. [[Private companies]] wishing to provide essential public services in certain countries must be granted a CPCN before constructing facilities and offering services.

==Philippines==
In the Philippines, a certificate of public convenience (CPC) is required for private provision of public services for which no franchise, either municipal or legislative, is required by law, such as a [[common carrier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batasnatin.com/law-library/mercantile-law/transportation-laws/2218-certificate-of-public-convenience-cpc.html|title=What is a Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC)?|work= Philippine Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
The first [[U.S. state]] statutes for certificate of public convenience (CPCN) were issued in 1870, and the [[U.S. Congress]] included a certification provision in [[U.S. federal law]] in the [[Transportation Act of 1920]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/1121802?sid=21105515254613&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4|title=Origins of the Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity: Developments in the States, 1870 - 1920|last=Jones|first=William K.|journal=[[Columbia Law Review]]|volume=79|number=3|pages=426–516|doi=10.2307/1121802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of industries requiring a CPCN from a U.S. state include the provision of [[telecommunications]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/All/C78F4BE884AA2FA885257687006F3964?OpenDocument|title=CPCN: Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity|publisher=[[New York State Public Service Commission]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation of [[natural gas]] in [[Alaska]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/720a|title=15 U.S. Code § 720a - Issuance of certificate of public convenience and necessity|work=[[Legal Information Institute]]|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a range of public services in [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/ilcs/fulltext.asp?DocName=022000050K8-406|title= Illinois Compiled Statutes: Sec. 8-406.

'''Cheah Tek Soon''' ({{zh|c=謝德順|p=Xiè Déshùn}})&lt;ref&gt;Also Cheah Teck Soon and Cheah Teik Soon.&lt;/ref&gt; was a 19th-century Penang businessman, and headman of the Hokkien in [[Penang]],&lt;ref name="RevFarm1"&gt;"The Excise Farms." The Straits Times 3 August 1900: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; after whom Tek Soon Street was named. The tycoon was an active member of the Penang community and the bandstand that was erected near the Town Hall before the Japanese Occupation, was his gift to the city.&lt;ref name="Bandstand1"&gt;"Chinese Gifts To Penang." The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942) 28 April 1930: 5. Print: Citing the Pinang Gazette &amp; Straits Chronicle, the Singapore Free Press (1930), noting the generosity of the Chinese of Penang, listed out some of the gifts to the island's community from its ethnic Chinese inhabitants: a clock tower from Cheah Chen Eok in 1897, a fountain from Koh Seang Tat (J.P.) in 1883 and the bandstand near the Town Hall from Cheah Tek Soon in 1884.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with Ng Pak Soon, also a member of the Penang Chinese Advisory Board, his higher $126,700 bid for the Penang Farms in 1900 lost out to incumbent Lim Kek Chuan &amp; Co.'s $125,000.&lt;ref name="RevFarm1"/&gt; He was also a Singapore Opium Farm holder.&lt;ref&gt;Sadka, Emily.

==Weld Quay (Penang)==
He was a part of a large deputation that met with Governor Sir [[Frederick Weld]] on the question of building a quay at the back of Beach Street (Penang) on 27 August 1881. Together with him were the Honourable Captain [[Henry McCallum|McCallum]] (Royal Engineers), and Messrs. James Gibson ( partner at Sandilands, Buttery &amp; Co.), the Hon. Daniel Logan (the Penang Chamber of Commerce's representative on the Straits Settlements Legislative Council), Karl,&lt;ref&gt;probably, Ernest Karl, Asst. Protector of Chinese in Penang, appearing as E. Karl in the Straits Settlements civil service list. His real identity was revealed only in the 1980 as being Charles Ernest Tardy a Frenchman.&lt;/ref&gt; Gan Kim Swee, Khaw Boo Aun, [[Khoo Thean Teik]], Khoo Kay Chan, Oh Yean Heng, Lim Leng Cheak, Tan Sim Ho, Beng Tek, Khoo Cheat, Eng Beng Seah, among others. Governor Weld said that the Government was, then, finally in a position to meet their wishes with the greatest liberality in undertaking this scheme that had been talked about for many years, but for one reason or another, nothing had resulted from it. The work, which finally began with land reclamation in 1883, resulted in the completion of Weld Quay in 1889, at a cost of $526,107.&lt;ref&gt;"H.E. The Governor at Penang.

== [[Kong Hock Keong Temple]] ==

Along with Foo Tye Sin, Khaw Boo Aun, Khoo Thean Teik, and Khaw Sim Bee, he was among the twenty leading citizens of Penang, appointed by the Straits Settlements Government to be trustees of the Kong Hock Keong Temple in Pitt Street for 1887, vested with the powers to appoint, or dismiss, priests. This came following complaints lodged with Government over the manner in which priests there conducted temple affairs. The new trustees appointed Beow Lean, of the Yung Chuan Monastery of Ku Shan, the drum mountain in Fuzhou, Fujian, China. Their confidence was justified. Beow Lean soon brought in a new body of priests, and later went on to found the [[Kek Lok Si]] temple at Ayer Itam (Penang).&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Choon-san. Kek Lok Si = Temple of Paradise.

== Cheah Eu Ghee (谢有义) ==

His business partner was Cheah Eu Ghee, and together, in 1893, they were commissioned by Government, following a vote of $5,000 sanctioned by the Finance Committee of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council, to metal the road from Tanjong Tokong, all the way upwards to Tanjong Batu in Penang North, as part of the Government's move to improve the road there.&lt;ref name="Road"&gt;"Penang News." The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942) 5 May 1893: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Cheah Eu Ghee, whose business interests included shipping, he had access to the influential members of the Penang Chinese Advisory Board, like George Cecil Wray (President of the Penang Chinese Advisory Board and Assistant Protector of the Chinese in Penang), Chew Sin Yong, Lim Hua Chiam, Tan Kim Keng, Tan Sim Ho, Yeoh Chean Liew, Khaw Boo Aun and Kee Lai Huat.&lt;ref name="CAB"&gt;"Penang Chinese Advisory Board." Straits Times Weekly Issue 6 August 1890: 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gift of a band stand ==
In 1884, Cheah Tek Soon made a gift to the municipality of a band stand,&lt;ref name="Bandstand1"/&gt; which soon, and thereafter until it was destroyed during the Japanese occupation, drew attention to itself, allowing some to fan the fires of that long competition between the older northern and younger southern settlements.

In May 1884, quoting their Penang correspondent, the Straits Times of Singapore published, "We are certainly ahead of you here in one little matter. We have a neat and convenient Band Stand on the Esplanade in front of the Town Hall, where the Police Band plays once or twice a week, and where such Bands as belong to vessels-of-war passing through may now find suitable accommodation for the afternoon (better still, moonlight!) performances, which they invariably give when here, greatly to the enlivenment of our somewhat humdrum life." The entry, which goes on at length, notes, "The cost of the whole affair was defrayed by a wealthy Chinese gentleman, and amounted, I am informed, to close on some £300—say $1,500."&lt;ref name="Bandstand2"&gt;"Penang." Straits Times Weekly Issue 21 May 1884: 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Cheah Tek Soon commissioned the Glasgow-based Macfarlane and Co. to create the iron bandstand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Parliamentary Papers, Volume 52|last=UK Parliament|first=|publisher=Eyre and Spottiswoode|year=1885|isbn=|location=London|pages=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December's Free Press we read, "How wonderfully Penang has advanced in a few years. In my time, a quarter of a century ago, it was visited by the mail steamer once a fortnight, and only a few small sailing-vessels frequented the port. Now, I count seven large steamers, ten smaller ones, sailing vessels of all sizes, and innumerable native prahus lying around us. Instead of the few old-fashioned bungalows that lined the high street leading into the country, we have a handsome Town Hall; the Grand Hotel, built on the most fashionable lines, exceeding in beauty anything you have in Singapore ... The road-side trees, that used to be mere shrubs in my time, are great sturdy sons of the forest, affording ample share to the wayside traveller: they seemed to me chiefly Angsanas (I hope I have spelt the word rightly). In my time a ricketty old narrow pier sufficed It used to be called "Scandal Point," where the lads and lasses used to meet of an afternoon and retail to each other all the gup they had picked up during the day. I dare say the handsome Band-stand on the Esplanade answers the samepurpose in this year of grace. Here the Penang Band performs once a week. Why should not Singapore have a Town Band? You see you are far behind old Penang."&lt;ref name="Bandstand3"&gt;"Penang, 1stDecember 1884." The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884–1942) 13 December 1884: 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with other structures like the Penang Sports Club (Cricket Section), the Penang Recreation Club (for Europeans), ornate benches and lamp posts, and the other Victorian cast-iron pavilion, the James Montague Bent Vermont's memorial, Cheah Tek Soon's Bandstand was destroyed by bombs during the Second World War.&lt;ref name="Bandstand4"&gt;Khoo, Salma Nasution. Streets of George Town, Penang. Penang, Malaysia: Areca, 2007: 84. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cheah Tek Soon 5 Storey Mansion ==
Originally built in the 1880s by Cheah Tek Soon, this was the first five-story residence in Penang. It was said to be inspired by Raffles in Singapore and by 1910s, it was being referred to as Raffles-By-The-Sea.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Streets of George Town, Penang|last=Khoo|first=Su Nin|publisher=Areca Books|year=2007|isbn=9839886002|location=Penang|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pagoda-shaped structure featured a unique layered style&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Penang 500 Early Postcards|last=Cheah|first=Jin Seng|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2012|isbn=9789671061718|location=Singapore|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; that combined British and Chinese architectural elements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The  building passed on to his daughter Cheah Liew Bee, who married Goh Say Eng, a supporter of Dr. [[Sun Yat Sen]]. Goh, who was selling his properties one by one to support Dr. Sun's revolutionary movement, sold this property too. Merchant [[Tye Kee Yoon]] bought it and turned it into a hotel. It has been known as the Bellevue Hotel. It was leased to the Government in the 1920s to be used as an English school, and became the Shih Chung branch school after the war. In 1993 it was acquired from the Tye trustees by the Malaysia Vegetable Oil Refinery Sdn Bhd, one of the major shareholders of Raffles-By-The-Sea Sdn. Bhd, for nine and a half million Malaysian Ringgit. With the purchase, the building which has through the years been reduced to three storeys, is to be restored and will surrounded by a three-block columbarium to be built by developers Raffles-By-The-Sea Sdn. Bhd.&lt;ref&gt;*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030901050435/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2003%2F6%2F26%2Ffeatures%2Fkkheritage&amp;sec=features Row over the dead By CHOONG KWEE KIM, The Star Thursday, 26 June 2003: A columbarium project smack in the middle of the Millionaire’s Row in Penang has drawn enough flak to make the dead turn in their graves, reports CHOONG KWEE KIM.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodist Girls' School ==
The gem that would become the Methodist Girls' School, Penang, began in the home of Cheah Tek Soon. Reverend Daniel D. Moore expanded the Methodist Mission to Penang when he went over there, from Singapore, in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Lau, Earnest. From Mission to Church: The Evolution of the Methodist Church in Singapore Singapore: Genesis Books. 2008: 18. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Without wasting time, Moore set out to visit wealthy Chinese homes in order to become acquainted with prominent Chinese citizens. One of these was the home of Cheah Tek Soon, who wished for his two little nieces to receive an education. Cheah Tek Soon's sister was persuaded to allow her daughters to be taught and a girls' school was started at the missionary residence, No. 1, Penang Road, in October 1891.&lt;ref name="MGS"&gt;Means, Nathalie. Malaysia Mosaic; a Story of Fifty Years of Methodism. Singapore: Methodist Book Room, 1935: 60. Print.; Barclay, Wade Crawford, and J. Tremayne Copplestone. History of Methodist Missions. Vol. 2.

The Malaysia Message, an English-language Methodist magazine, noted, "In a Penang newspaper there is an advertisement of a girls' school which has lately been started in the Settlement by the Rev. S.S. Moore. It is called the 'Young Ladies' Anglo-Chinese and Indian School,' and is modelled after the young ladies' schools in England and the pupils are taught by competent lady teachers."&lt;ref name="MGS"/&gt; That school would eventually grow to become the Methodist Girls' School.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, Seng-Ong.

== The case of Gan Kim Swee and Inspector C. C. Newland ==
When Inspector C. C. Newland, without provocation,  assaulted Gan Kim Swee, a leading member of the Penang community, Cheah Tek Soon was among the leaders of the Chinese, Mahomedan and Hindu sections of the community who convened a public meeting, presided over by Captain Bowers, on 21 September 1878 at the office of Messrs. Bun Chin Hong. After it was determined to petition the Governor in complaint of the Inspector's assault of Gan Kim Swee, Cheah Tek Soon seconded the proposal by Verapa Chetty that a committee, made up of Cheah Eu Ghee, Golam Mydin, Verapa Chetty, Khoo Thean Teik, Choo Cheng Whey, Tan Yeow Chew, Ong Seon Tek, Oh Yean Heng, L. Seow Huck, Y. Hup Keat, Caderasah Merican and Lim Quan Cheang (Secretary), be appointed to develop and bring that petition to the Governor.&lt;ref&gt;"Topics of the Day. From the Daily Times, 30th September. The Penang Police." Straits Times Overland Journal 5 October 1878: 2. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governor, upon receipt of this, ordered an official inquiry. Major Dunlop forwarded copies of the Straits Times containing the report of the public meeting at Penang to the Superintendent of Police, asking for an official explanation from him on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;The Straits Times 5 October 1878: 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspector C. C. Newland was eventually tried before the Police Court on Monday 7 October 1878 before Mr. Gottlieb and was found guilty. And while he may have suffered a fine, as he did in an earlier prosecution brought against involving one Abdool Gunny, Gan Kim Swee, through his Solicitor, Mr. Ross, said he would  accept an apology instead. Newland read out the apology in court.&lt;ref&gt;"Penang. From the Daily Times, 17th October. Penang, 14th October, 1878." Straits Times Overland Journal 24 October 1878: 6. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases''' is a workers compensation scheme administered by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|UK government]]. It was established in November 1982 by [[British Nuclear Fuels Ltd|British Nuclear Fuels Limited]] and its [[Trade union|trade unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=shCh5KzE7xEC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ay7uRDDnnA&amp;sig=bHI_Fkk4rUc8nrJO_z454mgC10E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=The Redfern Inquiry into human tissue analysis in UK nuclear facilities|last=|first=|date=2010-11-16|publisher=The Stationery Office|year=|isbn=9780102966183|location=|pages=|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; following legal actions brought against the company by nuclear industry workers in the late 1970s. At the time of its establishment, BNFL and its trade unions agreed that the causation of cancer by radiation was sufficiently well understood that "it should be possible to construct a scheme which would evaluate the probability that a diagnosed cancer may have been caused by radiation exposure at work." Initially the scheme only accepted claims in which a worker had died from a radiation-linked disease. In 1987 this was expanded to allow [[Disease|morbidity]] claims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_history.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme history|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of participating member employers and trade unions has grown through the 1990s and 2000s. As of December 2015, 1525 claims have been made out of which 156 have been successful.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/annual_statement.php|title=CSRLD: 2015 Compensation Scheme Annual Statement|last=|first=|date=2015-12-01|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Eligibility ==
In order to be eligible for compensation, a worker must have been employed by a listed company, and have received an occupational radiation dose. Then the claimant must have developed [[cancer]] of the [[Bladder cancer|bladder]], [[Bone Cancer|bone]], [[Brain cancer|brain]] and central nervous system, [[Breast cancer|breast]] or [[Uterine cancer|uterus]] (for female workers), [[Colorectal cancer|colon]], [[Liver cancer|liver]], [[Esophageal cancer|oesophagus]], respiratory or [[Lung cancer|lung]], prostate, [[Ovarian cancer|ovary]], skin (non-Melanoma), [[Thyroid cancer|thyroid]] or other tissues. Other compensable diseases include [[Cataract|cataracts]] and [[Leukemia|leukaemias]] (with two exceptions). Some diseases are excluded on the basis that there is no convincing epidemiological evidence to link them with ionising radiation exposure. Excluded diseases include: [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin’s disease]], [[Hairy cell leukemia|hairy cell leukaemia]], [[Chronic lymphatic leukemia|chronic lymphatic leukaemia]] (CLL), [[Melanoma|malignant melanoma]] and [[mesothelioma]].

=== Member Trade Unions ===
In 1982, trade union members of the scheme included [[Transport and General Workers' Union|Transport and General Workers Union]], [[Institution of Professional Civil Servants]], [[Amalgamated Engineering Union]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and PCS. Other trades unions joined as the scheme expanded. Later members include the [[Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union|EETPU]] and [[Manufacturing Science Finance|MSF]], [[Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians|UCATT]], [[Engineers and Managers Association]], [[UNISON|Unison]], the [[First Division Association]] of Civil Servants, the AEA Constabulary Federation (now the Civil Nuclear Police Federation) and the [[Defence Police Federation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/scheme_employers.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Scheme employers|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claiming compensation ==
Claims may be lodged by the worker, his or her wife, husband or partner (including same sex), the worker's "first line children" (those born to or legally adopted by the claimant). Once diagnosed with or deceased from an eligible disease, the worker or surviving family members have 30 years in which to make a claim. Claims can be made online, by post, by phone or through the worker's trade union. Once made, claims are assessed on consideration of medical, employment and dosimetry histories and data. These are used to calculate the probability that the cancer could have been caused by occupational exposure to radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/qa.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Q &amp; A|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Payments ==
The payment received following a successful claim varies depending on the actual loss (in earnings and pension) suffered by the claimant and sums for pain and suffering, loss of amenity and number of dependents. The level of payment awarded to a claimant (or estate if deceased) is determined by the "causation probability". The greater the causation probability, the greater the payment. Top tier payments are awarded if the causation probability is 50% or more. The Scheme publishes an Annual statement which is approved by the Scheme Council. The report includes a paragraph updating the number of claims and payments awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrld.org.uk/html/case_processing.php|title=CSRLD: The Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases - Case Processing|last=|first=|date=|website=www.csrld.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 22 February 2005, 1000 claims had been made, of which 97 had been awarded to varying degrees along a sliding scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=oxqdAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT152&amp;lpg=PT152&amp;dq=%22compensation+scheme+for+radiation+linked+diseases%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sCtN2E6adQ&amp;sig=0MUeAJ5xKrJx-EFVDn_13BMYhEI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj6uWFjcPRAhUBTJQKHeIbBFkQ6AEIRzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22compensation%20scheme%20for%20radiation%20linked%20diseases%22&amp;f=false|title=Assessment of the Scientific Information for the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=|date=2005-10-01|publisher=National Academies Press|year=|isbn=9780309096102|location=|pages=137|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015, 1525 cases had been considered since the compensation scheme for radiation-linked diseases was established. 156 of these claims were successful, and payments totaling £8.24 million had been dispatched.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5021">'''Construction partnering''' is a type of [[business partnering]] used in the [[architecture]], [[engineering]] and [[construction]] industry.  Partnering is intended to assist project teams with setting goals, resolving disputes and improving project outcomes.  The construction partnering team is made up of the project’s owner (client), the consulting engineers and/or architects, the contractor(s) and other key project stakeholders. Construction partnering has been used both in the [[United States]] and elsewhere since the early 1980s as a methodology to reduce litigation and improve productivity.

==Objective==
The objective of construction partnering is to reduce project costs and schedules, eliminate change orders and claims, and improve communication by developing mutually agreed upon project and partnership success goals and by monitoring the achievement of these goals for the duration of the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://partneringinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/IPI-101.pdf Partnering Institute - Partnering 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The construction partnering team will also develop an agreed upon process for resolving disputes should they arise, called a dispute resolution ladder.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer S, Partner Your Project, Pendulum Publishing, Livermore, CA 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Litigation in the construction industry exploded in the 1980s.  Settling disputes in court added time, cost and energy to projects.  Partnering was developed as a response to this problem.

In 1987, the [[Construction Industry Institute]] (CII) at [[The University of Texas at Austin]] formed a task force to explore a process to address the issues that brought the people involved in construction projects to litigation.  The task force’s objectives were to examine the risks and benefits of partnering, to provide guidelines on the process and to define the relationship between partnering and the construction contract.  Their results were published in January 1991 entitled, “In Search of Partnering Excellence.”&lt;ref&gt;Construction Industry Institute, “In Search of Partnering Excellence,” Austin, TX: Report of the Partnering Task Force, Special Publication 17-1, July 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (Corps) was part of the CII task force.  In the late 1980s the Corps used the partnering process on two of their construction projects with great success.  As a result, the Corps established a partnering program in 1991.  They developed a pamphlet which described the partnering process, the reasons for using it, and the potential benefits of partnering the Corps had experienced in using the process.&lt;ref&gt;Edelman L Carr F, and Lancaster C., “Partnering,” Washington DC, US Army Corps of Engineers Publication, IWR Pamphlet 91-ADR-P, December 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Associated General Contractors of America]] (AGC) endorsed partnering in January 1991. AGC’s president announced that one of AGC’s objectives for the year was building construction quality through partnering.&lt;ref&gt;Associated General Contractors of America, “Partnering: Changing Attitudes in Construction,” Washington DC, AGC Publication #1225, October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  They later developed an annual award, the Marvin M. Black Award, to honor the AGC contractor(s) involved in the year’s most collaborative project.

In the past 30 years, partnering has grown.  Twenty-four of the 50 state transportation programs have adopted Partnering as an important process to improve outcomes.  Several state transportation departments (including [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]], [[Maryland State Highway Administration|Maryland SHA]], ODOT, [[Arizona Department of Transportation|ADOT]] and others) now require a partnering process by specification. 

==Awards==
Construction partnering has been embraced by the construction industry to such an extent that organizations have started offering awards to the top partnered projects.  The current awards available are:

*AGC’s Marvin M. Black Partnering Competition  (http://www.agc.org/cs/about_agc/recognition_programs/marvin_m_black_partnering_awards)

'''''Culpa in contrahendo''''' is a [[Latin]] expression meaning "fault in conclusion of a contract". It is an important concept in [[contract law]] for many civil law countries, which recognize a clear duty to negotiate with care, and not to lead a negotiating partner to act to his detriment before a firm contract is concluded. In [[German contract law]], §311 [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|BGB]] lists a number of steps by which an obligation to pay damages may be created.

By contrast, in [[English contract law]], and many other common law jurisdictions, there has been stulted judicial acceptance of this concept. The doctrine of [[estoppel]] has been mooted by academics as a good model, but judges have refused to let it be a sidestep of the doctrine of [[consideration]], saying estoppel must be a shield not a sword, and calling instead for Parliamentary intervention.&lt;ref&gt;The English and Scottish Law Commissions invited [[Harvey McGregor]] to draw up a "Contract Code" (being a codification and fusion of English and Scots contract law), but neither country has adopted his 1993 recommendations.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in the case of land, [[proprietary estoppel]] effectively created obligations regardless of any pre-existing contract. In the [[United States]], however, courts have allowed [[promissory estoppel]] to function as a substitute for the consideration doctrine. This movement was stimulated by the acceptance of the concept in section 90 of the first ''[[Restatement of Contracts]]''.

==''Culpa in contrahendo'' under German law==
Rudolf von Jhering is credited with developing the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine. Originally, according to the prevailing interpretation of the German Civil Code, there was no such legal doctrine. The courts saw a gap in the law and used the ''culpa in contrahendo'' doctrine to fill it.

Since the 2001 reform of the law of obligations, ''culpa in contrahendo'' is provided for by statute. (§311(2) in connection with §§280(1) and 241(2) of the German Civil Code).

Jhering argued that the "reliance measure" ought to be the proper one in "not quite" contracts, e.g. where there is a misunderstanding as to the terms of the contract.

'''David Kraiselburd''' (1912–1974) was an Argentine journalist, newspaper publisher, and lawyer, best known for his commitment and actions against military regimes and political violence of both right- and left-wing extraction. He was assassinated shortly after the beginning of the Dirty War—in mid-1974—and shortly before the military coup.

==Life and times==
David Kraiselburd was born into a working-class [[Ukrainian Jews|Ukrainian Jewish]] family in [[Berisso]], an industrial city north of [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]], in 1912. In his teens, a high-school writing contest earned him an internship in La Plata's main daily, ''[[El Día (La Plata)|El Día]]'', after the end of which he was hired by the paper as a sports commentator. He enrolled in the prestigious [[University of La Plata]], and, at the paper, he was promoted to university affairs correspondent. He was also involved in university politics—he had anarchist sympathies, and had protested [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]'s execution a few years earlier. After earning the equivalent of a JD degree from Law School, he became a representative of the alumni association (''Graduados''). To broaden his background, he re-enrolled in the university and earned another degree in History. Also in those early years, the paper sent him to Spain to cover the Spanish Civil War.

Gradually, he rose up in the journalistic ranks and became a prominent figure within and outside the paper. ''El Día'''s financial straits eventually led the heirs of its founding partners to sell part of their stake in the daily, and, in September 1961, Kraiselburd purchased a share of ''El Día''. The main owners of the daily became, thus, the Fascetto family (heirs of one of the founding partners) and Kraiselburd, although none had a controlling share (this partnership ended in 2010, with an agreement that gave the Fascetto family full control of ''[[Diario Popular]]'', founded by Kraiselburd in 1974, while control of ''El Día'' was given fully to the Kraiselburd family, especially his eldest son, Raul, who took up his father's post after his murder).

==Kraiselburd and ''El Día'' in the face of the 1960s military coups and the political turmoil of the early 1970s==

Putting his legal background in action as director and editor-in-chief, Kraiselburd was among the few Argentine publishers to openly oppose the 1966 coup d'état against the moderate, democratically elected President [[Arturo Illia]]. Kraiselburd denounced the imminent coup, and then refused to publish dictator [[Juan Carlos Onganía]]'s inaugural address. Onganía's La Plata officials retaliated by confiscating that day's circulation and harassing the paper.

''El Día'''s challenges were not mitigated by the March 1973 return to democracy in 1973. A decree signed by interim President [[Raúl Lastiri]] sought to prohibit Argentine periodicals' access to international [[news agencies]] wires, in an attempt to limit them to wires published by [[Telam]], the state news agency founded by Lastiri's benefactor, populist former President [[Juan Perón]]. This measure amounted to a monopoly of news wires by the state agency, controlled by the government. Kraiselburd moved quickly, however, and, on his initiative, ''El Día'' and numerous other Argentine dailies established a national news agency, ''Noticias Argentinas''. He was named president of the agency while remaining at the helm of ''El Día''.&lt;ref name="Cuenta Regresiva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz|first=César L.|title=La cuenta regresiva. la construcción periodística del Golpe de Estado de 1976|year=2002|publisher=Editorial La Crujía Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kraiselburd's murder during the 1974 "unofficial" beginning of the Dirty War==

Staunchly centrist, ''El Día'' marshaled its "Page 4" editorial section, which had openly opposed the Ongania coup in the 60s, and that by early 1974 denounced the Argentine Anti-Communist Alliance (AAA), a right-wing paramilitary organization that was given free rein (and was supported by) the Ministry of Welfare in chasing down left-wing organizations. Naturally, the stronger left-wing organizations (i.e., the left-Peronist Montoneros) retaliated. Yet, by the same token, "El Dia" warned against the escalation of violence that was ensuing, as well as against the increasingly violent "politics" of both Left and Right. "Violence was the main medium of politics first, and {{em|became}} politics later," as researcher [[Pilar Calveiro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calveiro|first=Pilar|author-link=Pilar Calveiro|title=Poder y desaparicion|year=2001|publisher=Colihue|location=Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; succinctly said in regard to the process underwent by the left-wing Montoneros. Threatened by both the AAA and Montoneros, and although he was a more "fitting" target for the former, it was the latter organization the one which took action against the paper and its editor. Kraiselburd was kidnapped on June 25, 1974 by a Montoneros cell while the editor was walking toward the newspaper building.

In a spree against dissenters, and prefiguring Kraiselburd's fate, on July 15 a Montoneros unit burst into a small-town restaurant and machine-gunned a frequent ''El Dia'' contributor, former Interior (law enforcement) Minister [[Arturo Mor Roig]], who, under the military regime of Gen. Lanusse, had been instrumental in the transition toward democracy that led to two 1973 elections, which Peron's stand-in (Hector Campora) first, and Peron later, won by a landslide. Mor Roig was a well-known moderate democrat. He had knowingly sacrificed his political career when he accepted the position offered to him by Gen. Lanusse years earlier, for the sake of speeding up the transition toward democracy. Montoneros, however, emphasized that during Mor Roig's tenure, prominent political prisoners had been massacred in the course of (and even ''after'') a partially successful escape attempt in a Patagonian prison. The massacre had been brutal, but it was known that Mor Roig had had no involvement whatsoever. Yet, on Montoneros' view, his past association with a military government, in addition to his 1974 ''El Dia'' critical articles, made him a suitable target.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Cecil|title=Guerrillas and Generals: Argentina's Dirty War|year=2002|publisher=Kraeger|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As many Montoneros acknowledged—most remarkably, intelligence officer, journalist, and outstanding writer [[Rodolfo_Walsh#cite_note-montondoc-2|Rodolfo Walsh]]—these "acts of individual terror," as Walsh called them, would not only backfire, but make popular support dwindle.&lt;ref name=Baschetti&gt;{{cite book|last=Walsh|first=Rodolfo|title=Los papeles de Walsh|year=1996|publisher=In Baschetti, R., Rodolfo Walsh, vivo.|location=Buenos Aires. Edic. de la Flor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraiselburd would soon follow Mor Roig's fate. He was being held captive in a house in [[Manuel B. Gonnet|Gonnet]], located between La Plata and Buenos Aires. Twenty odd days after the kidnapping, a neighbor called the police after noticing "suspicious activity" in the house next door. On July 17, 1974, a police unit was sent to investigate, and a shooting between the Montoneros cell and the police ensued. Outnumbered, the Montoneros shot Kraiselburd to death and fled the scene.

In September 1975, Kraiselburd was posthumously awarded the prestigious [[Maria Moors Cabot prize]] by Columbia University's School of Journalism, for his defense of democratic values in the face of forms of authoritarianism of both right-wing and left-wing leanings.

==Kraiselburd's imprint after 1974. Kraiselburd, Jr. and ''El Dia'' during the 1976-1983 dictatorship==

After Kraiselburd's murder, his eldest son, Raul, took up his post. Under his direction, and following the lead of his father, ''El Dia'' continued its explicit plea for the adherence to consensus-building, democratic practices, and its equally explicit rejection of lawless, criminal murders and disappearances, increasingly effected with the support of the State apparatus (1975) and, after the coup (1976) with the ''full'' disposal of the State resources at the tip of the Armed Forces. Threats from right-wing paramilitary groups, bombs in the printing press, random machine-gun attacks on buildings and houses, and other intimidatory tactics were overshadowed by the kidnapping and murder of Raul's two-year-old son, named David, after his grandfather. Chalked up to the action of "run-of-the-mill" kidnappers in search for a ransom, the case of David Kraiselburd's homonymous grandson was never fully explained—nor was the baby's body ever found.

Despite sporadic anti-Semitic aspersions claiming the contrary, ''El Día'' was, as media researcher Cesar Diaz put it in a book-length critical analysis of the printed media under the 1976-83 dictatorship, one of the few "non-partner" (no socios) newspapers, along with the better-known case of ''The Buenos Aires Herald''and a few others; that is, newspapers that didn't partake in the "gentleman's agreement" that the military regime had imposed. The "non-partners," therefore, reported on disappearances and related crimes perpetrated by the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Díaz|first=Cesar L.|title=Nos/otros y la violencia política 1974-1982. El Herald, La Prensa, y El Día. La Plata:|year=2009|publisher=Al Margen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, both Robert Cox, from the ''Herald'', and Raul Kraiselburd, from ''El Dia'', were also awarded Columbia University's Moors Cabot Prize. Diaz's analysis of the media under the military regime, unusually virtuous in escaping the widespread polarization of accounts of the 1970s (and therefore advancing a critical stance, rather than an unqualified paean), hints that the example of the late David Kraiselburd strengthened the commitment of the journalists who risked their lives every day at the newsroom during the dark years of the juntas.

'''Downtown Columbus''' is the [[Central Business District]] of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]]. The area centers on the intersection of Broad and High streets, with the northeast corners being known simple as Broad &amp; High by the surrounding businesses and media. Downtown as a whole encompasses all the area inside the inner belt and is home to most of the [[List of skyscrapers in Columbus, Ohio|largest buildings in Columbus]]. 
The [[Ohio State Capitol|State Capitol]] is located on the southeast corner of Broad &amp; High, in Capitol Square. Downtown is also home to [[Columbus State Community College]], [[Franklin University]], [[Columbus College of Art and Design]], [[Grant Medical Center]], [[Capital University Law School]], as well as the main branch of the [[Columbus Metropolitan Library]], the [[Main Street Bridge (Columbus, Ohio)|Main Street Bridge]] and many parks. 

Downtown has many neighborhoods or "districts", but it can easily be separated into three main areas; the [[Discovery District (Columbus, Ohio)|Discovery District]], [[High Five (Columbus)|High Street Corridor]], and the [[Riverfront]]. [[The Short North]], [[Italian Village, Columbus, Ohio|Italian Village]], and [[Victorian Village]] are directly north of Downtown. [[Olde Towne East]], and the historic [[King-Lincoln Bronzeville|King-Lincoln District]] are directly east, while the [[Brewery District]] and [[German Village]] are directly south of Downtown. [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] is to the west of Downtown. In the northwest area is the [[Arena District]], a [[mixed-use development]] centered on [[Nationwide Arena]], the home of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]]. The Arena District also includes the baseball stadium [[Huntington Park (Columbus, Ohio)|Huntington Park]] and the [[Lifestyle Communities Pavilion]].

Over 87,000 people are employed Downtown, and more than 25,000 students attend school at one of the many institutions of higher education located there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2013/12/who-brings-the-most-people-into.html|title=Who brings the most people into downtown Columbus?|last=Newpoff|first=Laura|date=December 16, 2013|work=Columbus Business First|accessdate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown is currently home to over 8,600 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dispatch.com/news/20180419/toronto-planner-columbus-needs-more-people-downtown-to-grow-transit-system|title=Toronto planner: Columbus needs more people Downtown to grow transit system|last=Ferenchik|first=Mark|work=The Columbus Dispatch|access-date=2018-05-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The city of Columbus began development in 1812&lt;ref&gt;Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan, Downtown Columbus, Inc., p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of being the state's new capital. Originally laid out by Lucas Sullivant as the town of Franklinton, the original settlement lay west of the Scioto River. However, Sullivant laid out plans to expand east of the river for what we now know as downtown Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touring-ohio.com/central/columbus/columbus-history.html History of Columbus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150511183752/http://www.touring-ohio.com/central/columbus/columbus-history.html |date=May 11, 2015 }}. ''Touring Ohio''. Retrieved  May 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Development began quickly and by 1814 significant buildings included a penitentiary, the first school, the statehouse, the first newspaper, and the first church. By 1816, Columbus was incorporated as an official town, and in 1824 Columbus became the official seat of the county and elected its first mayor, [[John Brooks (mayor)|John Brooks]], in 1834 after being elevated to "city" status.&lt;ref name=central&gt;[http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Columbus,_Ohio?rec=689 Columbus, Ohio].

Another pivotal element of downtown Columbus is the Scioto River, which snakes directly through downtown. The downtown of Columbus has changed roles since its founding, going from a government center, to an industrial and commercial center, to what it currently is as the major commercial hub of central Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Downtown Columbus Strategic Plan, Downtown Columbus, Inc., p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  The first skyscraper to adorn downtown Columbus' skyline is the [[LeVeque Tower]], built in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carrie Ghose|date=July 7, 2008|title=Will Columbus ever get another skyscraper?|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/stories/2008/07/07/focus1.html?page=all|work=Columbus Business First|accessdate= May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many other high rises and skyscrapers have been added since the LeVeque Tower, fitting a variety of uses from commercial to residential.

=== Urban renewal ===
In the early 1950s, major cities began revitalization projects of [[Slum|slums and blighted areas]] in their communities. Assisted by federal and state funding, these were intended to clear major slums in an effort to revitalize that area for the overall welfare of the city. In January 1952, the Department of Development for the city of Columbus began commissioning task forces in an effort for urban renewal in the blighted areas. The efforts of these task forces are evident in numerous older communities and districts, including Market Mohawk and [[German Village]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Colwell|first1=W.

After revitalization efforts were made, the annual tax return was greater than $514,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Status of Urban Renewal|date=1965|publisher=Citizen Research Inc.|location=Columbus, Ohio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
Columbus' location was chosen based on its central location within the state of Ohio along with the confluence of the [[Scioto River]] and Olentangy River being right next to it. Originally, the area that is now Columbus was to be allotted to those displaced from [[Nova Scotia]] during the American Revolution, and the original settlement lay about a mile west of the Scioto River and the current downtown area. The center of downtown Columbus is focused on the intersection of Broad Street and High Street. The City of Columbus includes an area of around 225 square miles, but downtown is generally referred to as the area within the Scioto River, [[Interstate 70]], [[Interstate 71]], and [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]].&lt;ref&gt;"Columbus: Geography and Climate".

=== Park Street District (North Market Historic District) ===
[[File:North market christmas.jpg|thumb|North Market]]
Park Street District, also known as the North Market Historic Area, sits in the northernmost part of downtown Columbus. Sitting just north of the Arena District, it is bounded by Goodale Avenue to the north, Vine Street to the south, high street to the west, and Neil Avenue to the west. The area retains numerous physical characteristics from the early twentieth century when it served as a wholesale and manufacturing focal point just north of the [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Columbus Union Station]]. In 1980, revitalization focused on becoming an exciting area, restaurant, and entertainment center. It features the [[North Market]], the only continued market of the four originals in Columbus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arena District, A Neighborhood 170 Years in the Making|date=2006|publisher=Nationwide Realty Investors|location=Columbus, Ohio|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous restaurants and bars extend off of Park Street, as well as offices and retail options in the area.

=== Fort Hayes ===
[[File:Fort Hayes parade grounds in the snow.jpg|thumb|left|Fort Hayes parade grounds and Shot Tower]]
The Fort Hayes area is primarily located within the boundaries of the I-670 loop northeast of downtown, primarily along Cleveland Avenue. It was sold by Robert A. Neil and his brother William to the state in order to build a United States [[barracks]] in the then northeastern part of the city. The facility was built, and by 1875 was re-purposed to be primarily a recruiting intake and training facility. It was originally called the Columbus Barracks until 1922, when it then became Fort Hayes, named after Governor and President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].&lt;ref name="Forgotten Columbus"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Henderson|first1=Andrew|title=Forgotten Columbus|date=2002|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Chicago|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1976, the military had largely abandoned the Fort Hayes facility. The [[Columbus Public Schools]] district purchased an area of {{convert|50|acres|ha sqkm|abbr=on}} for $1 [[United States dollar|USD]] and established what is now known as the [[Fort Hayes Metropolitan Education Center]]. During the 1988–89 school year, the Fort Hayes Arts and Academic High School was created, and joined the Columbus Public Schools' excellently-rated programs.&lt;ref&gt;Fort Hayes History. (n.d.).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3053">The term [[farm assurance]] was first used in [[Scotland]] in the late 1980s to describe new [[Product certification|certification]] schemes established by farmers, meat processors, consumers and supporting agencies, in response to emerging consumer concerns about food production. Organisations involved included the [[National Farmers Union of Scotland]], [[Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers]], the [[Scottish Consumer Council]], [[Scottish Enterprise]], [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise|Highlands and Islands Development Board]], the [[Meat and Livestock Commission]] and the [[Scottish Agricultural College]]. These schemes introduced independent, on-farm auditing of [[animal welfare]], environmental care and staff competence.  

The first farm assurance scheme was the Scottish Pig Industry Initiative, established in 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfqc.co.uk/farm_schemes/quality_meat_scotland_qms_assurance_schemes_-_pigs |title= Quality Meat Scotland Assurance Scheme – Pigs |publisher=Scottish Food Quality Certification |accessdate=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Farm Assured Scotch Lamb and Scottish Quality Cereals.  Food produced through these schemes carry Scotch and Scottish branding (e.g. Scotch Beef).  Other farming sectors in Scotland quickly followed. Scottish [[farmed salmon]] producers established similar assurance schemes (Scottish Quality Salmon and Shetland Quality Salmon) during the same period, followed by farmed trout (Scottish Quality Trout).  Farmers in England established their own (and sometimes UK-wide) farm assurance schemes in the second half of the 1990s, these eventually being encompassed within [[Assured Food Standards]] which operates the "Red Tractor" mark.   The rest of Europe took up farm assurance in the late 1990s (e.g. EurepGap) with many other parts of the world adopting farm assurance in the early 2000s (e.g. GlobalGap).   

The individuals who established farm assurance in Scotland included Maitland Mackie (SPII Chair), Jim Royan (FASL Chair), John Ross (NFUS President), John MacNaughton (SQBLA Chair), Alistair Donaldson (MLC Scotland Director), Brian Simpson (SQBLA Chief Executive), Ian Duncan Miller (livestock farmer), Alan Stevenson (SAMW), David Jack (cereal farmer), David Taylor (Scottish Enterprise), George Russell (Scottish Enterprise) and Peter Brown (HIDB then SPII &amp; FASL Chief Executive).

== Scottish Food Quality Certification ==
Scottish Food Quality Certification is an independent company which monitors Scottish farm produce.  Founded in 1995 it was the world's first farm and food certification business accredited to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] Guide 65. By the late 1990s SFQC certified approximately 15,000 farms (circa 90% of Scottish farm output).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="787">The '''French Intellectual Property Code''' ('''IPC'''; [[French language|French]]: ''Code de la propriété intellectuelle''), is a corpus of law relating to intellectual and industrial property. It was formalised by Law No 92-597 of 1 July 1992, replacing earlier laws relating to [[industrial property]] and [[literary property|artistic and literary property]].

The code is frequently modified: two major modifications are known as the [[DADVSI law]] and the [[HADOPI law]].

{{Nihongo|'''Haruji Matsue'''|松江春次|Matsue Haruji|extra=January 15, 1878 to November 29, 1954}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[entrepreneur]] and the first person to manufacture the [[Sugar|sugar cube]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;City of Aizu (no date): Commemorative plaque at Aizu Kōgyo　kōkō, [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Aizuwakamatsu]], [[Fukushima Prefecture]], Japan. Viewed on 2008-07-29&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, Major General [[Toyohisa Matsue]] was commandant of the [[Bandō prisoner-of-war camp]] in [[World War I]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Matsue was born in [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima]] as the second son of a former samurai of [[Aizu Domain]]. In 1899, he graduated from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology|Tokyo Technical School]] and found employment with Dai-Nippon Sugar Company.  However, in 1903 he passed an acceptance examination held by the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce]] and received a scholarship to study overseas. He was sent to the [[Louisiana State University]], well-known at the time for its work in sugar cultivation, and graduated with a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Peattie | first =Mark R. | title = Nan'yō: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885-1945 | publisher =University of Hawaii Press | year =1988 | location = | pages =124 | isbn =0-8248-1480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Japan in 1907 and was appointed plant manager at Dai-Nippon Sugar’s Osaka factory. However, Matsu left the company in 1908 after it became the center of a public scandal involving the bribery of several noted members of the [[Diet of Japan]] and moved to [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]]. He worked for two sugar companies in Taiwan, but left due to disagreements with their senior management and after realizing that both companied were in precarious financial situations. Visiting [[Saipan]] and [[Tinian]] in the [[Mariana Islands]], he realized their potential for development for [[sugar cane]] cultivation, and returned to Japan seeking investors.

=== Nan’yō Kōhatsu Kabushiki Kaisha===
Meanwhile, the first governor of [[South Pacific Mandate]], [[Toshiro Tezuka]], was turning to the [[Oriental Development Company]] for assistance in reviving the economy of Saipan and rescue the former employees of two failed companies, ''Nishimura Takushoku'' and ''Nan'yō Shokusan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Peattie | first =Mark R. | title = Nan'yō: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885-1945 | publisher =University of Hawaii Press | year =1988 | location = | pages =126 | isbn =0-8248-1480-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the capital from these companies and government approval, Matsue acquired the assets of Nan'yō Shokusan. In 1921 he founded [[Nan’yō Kōhatsu]] (South Seas Development Company). He trained Japanese laborers living on Saipan and others brought over from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and the [[Tōhoku region]] to clear the land, cultivate and harvest sugar cane, and build his refineries.

By 1925 Matsue had built an alcohol factory and ice plant on Saipan, planted over 3000 hectares of sugar, and extended his operations to Saipan's neighboring islands. By the end of the decade, he had brought more than 5,000 workers to the Marianas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lal| first = Brij V. |author2=Kate Fortune| title = The Pacific Islands: an encyclopedia| publisher =University of Hawaii Press | year = 2000| location = | pages = 214| isbn =0-8248-2265-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company quickly grew to become the largest private company in the Japanese Mandate, and at its height employed over 40,000 people. Matsue also built numerous recreational facilities for his workers on Saipan and other islands.

A fervent supporter of the ''[[Nanshin-ron]]'' doctrine, which advocated Japanese territorial expansion and colonization of the islands of Oceania and eventually the European-held territories of the [[Indonesian archipelago]], Matsue led the company in developing a wide range of activities in [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[Australia]]n territories in southeast Asia, especially in [[Sulawesi]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and in [[New Guinea]]. The company bought out local Japanese [[copra]] plantations and [[fish processing]] plants, and established a shipping company. He also cultivated close relations with the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. 
Matsue resigned as president of Nan’yō Kōhatsu in 1940 and withdrew completely from the company in 1943. He donated money from his successful business to his home town of [[Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima|Aizuwakamatsu]]. A technical high school, ''Aizu Kōgyon kōkō'' (会津工業高校), was constructed using these funds. He died in November 1954 of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

The '''High Pay Centre''' is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[think tank]] carrying out [[research]] and analysis on issues relating to top [[income]]s, [[corporate governance]], and [[business performance management|business performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/about|title=About - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre is generally critical of existing top pay practices, and advocates policies designed to reduce [[economic inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/pubs/reform-agenda-how-to-make-top-pay-fairer|title=Reform Agenda: How to make top pay fairer - Publications - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; HPC research and commentary on high pay and [[pay inequities|inequality]] are regularly cited in the [[UK media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highpaycentre.org/press|title=Press - High Pay Centre|website=Highpaycentre.org|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the Centre has promoted 'fatcat day', usually occurring in the first week of January, marking the date on which the earnings for the average FTSE 100 Chief Executive surpasses the amount that the average UK worker can expect to earn all year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/04/fat-cat-thursday-top-bosses-earn-workers-annual-salary-by-lunchtime&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre was established by [[Compass (think tank)|Compass]] in 2009 as the High Pay Commission, and changed its name to the High Pay Centre following publication of the final report of the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.compassonline.org.uk/action/campaigns/high-pay-commission-for-a-just-and-sustainable-economy/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay involves fixing up properties in order to create a profit. Tasks that can be performed include painting, laying down tile, cleaning, installations, and demolition.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Reception ==
''House Flipper'' received "mixed or average reviews" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House Flipper for PC Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/house-flipper |website=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with multiple reviewers commenting that fixing up the homes is satisfying while questioning its long-term playability. [[Kotaku]] reviewed the game, stating that they found it satisfying to fix up homes that are "often extremely gross or ugly" and that "Manifesting your vision of a decent, sellable house onto these garbage heaps feels amazing—especially because it happens on such a granular scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/steam-top-seller-house-flipper-makes-it-fun-to-watch-pa-1826205207|title=Steam Top Seller House Flipper Makes It Fun To Watch Paint Dry|last=D'Anastasio|first=Cecilia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game Informer was more mixed, writing that "Flipping your first few houses is fun, but the game doesn’t have the scope or flexibility to stay interesting for long".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/house-flipper/a-definite-fixer-upper|title=House Flipper Review – A Definite Fixer-Upper|work=Game Informer|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC Gamer was critical, stating that "There's a definite satisfaction in taking a gross room and making it look nice, and it's pretty cool that you can knock down (and rebuild) walls, but I just don't find the act of slowly and mechanically painting and cleaning much fun, especially with the knowledge that my actual house could do with a bit of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/house-flipper-is-like-viscera-cleanup-detail-only-for-super-gross-houses/|title=House Flipper is like Viscera Cleanup Detail only for super gross houses|last=|first=|date=|work=PC Gamer|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ILA Berlin Air Show''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Internationale Luft- und Raumfahrtausstellung''' ('''ILA''')) combines a major trade exhibition for the [[Aerospace industry|aerospace]] and [[defence industry|defence]] industries with a public [[airshow]].
It is held every even year at the new [[Berlin ExpoCenter Airport]] near [[Schönefeld]], [[Brandenburg]] 18&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The [http://www.ila-berlin.com most recent ILA Berlin Air Show] was held in April 2018.

Established in 1909, it claims to be world's oldest [[air show]], and it is among the largest and most important [[aerospace]] trade fairs today. According to the organisers Messe Berlin GmbH, in 2012 the Berlin Air Show attracted 125,000 professional visitors and 105,000 members of the general public, with 3,600 journalists from 65 countries also attending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2012/aussteller/fakten_e.cfm |title=ILA statistics at a glance |accessdate=20 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317173031/http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2012/aussteller/fakten_e.cfm |archivedate=17 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format is similar to the [[Paris Air Show]] in France and the [[Farnborough Airshow|Farnborough International Airshow]] in Britain, the other major events in the European air show calendar. The Berlin event starts with three professional days closed to the general public, and then on Friday, Saturday and Sunday the public are allowed in.

The main display sections planned for 2014 include commercial air transport, space, military aviation, helicopters and both civil and military unmanned aircraft systems, also known as [[UAVs]].

==History==
It was first held in [[Frankfurt am Main]] in 1909, and as such can lay claim to being the oldest [[Airshow|aviation show]] in the world. After the first ILA, following the idea of the aircraft constructor [[August Euler]], numerous flying clubs combined to form the German Pilots' Association in April 1910. Shortly after, the Association of German Aircraft Makers was founded in Frankfurt/Main, establishing close ties between the ILA and the future Federal Association of the Aerospace Industry (BDLI), an organisation that exists today.

Before the [[First World War]], the ILA was held in [[Berlin]] (1912 and later on in 1928). When Germany regained air sovereignty after the [[Second World War]], the foundations were laid in 1955 for an "International Show for Travel by Air", which in 1957 took place at [[Langenhagen Airport]] as part of the [[Hanover Trade Fair]], the first in a run of ILA shows in [[Hanover]] that was to last over 30 years.

Known initially as the ''German Aviation Show'', the fair was increasingly attracting participants from abroad, and in 1978 the symbolic three letters ILA from 1909 were revived. In 1992, the far-reaching political and economic changes which had taken place in [[Europe]] since the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] opened the way for the ILA to return to its birthplace in Berlin. The ILA’s main display sections include commercial aviation, aerospace, military aviation and military technology, equipment and engines, and general aviation and helicopters.

The new multi-purpose exhibition area, called [[Berlin ExpoCenter Airport]] adjacent to the BER was finished in time for ILA 2012. The main section of the grounds cover approximately 250,000 square metres.

The site is situated {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} southeast of Germany's capital city [[Berlin]].

==ILA 2006==

All previous attendance records had been broken at ILA2006. More than 250,000 visitors (2004: 201,500, +25%) were recorded at the ILA2006 between 16 and 21 May, including 115,000 trade visitors (2004: 105,000). Events on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld airport were dominated by the signing of sales contracts and joint venture agreements worth billions, a display featuring some 340 aircraft, many of them making their first public appearance, and the largest number of delegations and conferences ever. 1,014 exhibitors from 42 countries (2004: 987 from 42 countries) presented products, systems and processes from every area of the aerospace industry. Several thousand experts from all over Europe and from overseas attended the more than 90 accompanying conferences in search of information. Some 4,100 media representatives from 70 countries provided comprehensive coverage of the main technical themes and the attractions for the public at the ILA2006.

ILA 2006 emphasised the importance of this sector for Germany in its role as a centre for the aerospace industry. Hans-Joachim Gante, Chief Executive of the BDLI, stated: "We have become one of the few sectors with sustainable growth in Germany, due above all to our innovative strengths." This was clearly demonstrated at the ILA2006, which is acquiring an increasingly international dimension, thereby strengthening its role as one of the world’s major meeting places for the industry. This was an ideal opportunity for the German aerospace industry to demonstrate that it is among the world leaders." Exhibitors expressed their satisfaction with the discussions and contacts and with the business deals that were finalised at this event. "In particular the decision to make Russia the partner country proved highly effective. Russia was very strongly represented and was able to establish numerous contacts and business links."

At the close of the event Stefan Grave, Project Director for Messe Berlin GmbH, summed up: "The ILA2006 underlined its major importance as a European marketing platform for this sector as well as again demonstrating its many attractions for the public. Trade visitors and the general public alike were fascinated by the high-tech products on display. Unprecedented numbers of people attended to see the [[Airbus A380]], an outstanding international flying display and the Space Hall.

Many high-ranking delegations attended, especially during the three Trade Visitors’ Days. In addition to the Federal Minister of Economics Michael Glos, the ILA 2006 also received visits from the Defence Minister Franz-Josef Jung, Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble, Transport Minister Wolfgang Tiefensee, the Minister at the Chancellor’s Office Dr. Thomas de Maizière and the heads of the regional governments in Brandenburg and Berlin, Matthias Platzeck and Klaus Wowereit. Germany’s armed forces, the Bundeswehr, were very strongly represented: the Chief of the Armed Forces Wolfgang Schneiderhan attended the ILA 2006, as did the Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force and Army, Klaus-Peter Stieglitz and Hans-Otto Budde. A number of ministers from other countries also visited this event, accompanied by high-ranking delegations, thereby underlining the international importance of the ILA 2006. Among them were, from the partner country Russia, the Minister of Disaster Relief Sergei Schoigu, the Minister of Defence of the Netherlands, Henk Kamp, the Greek Defence Minister Evangelos Meimarakis, the French Transport Minister Dominique Perben, the Slovenian Defence Minister Karl Erjavec, the Albanian Defence Minister Fatmir Mediu and the Ukrainian Industry Minister [[Volodymyr Shandra]]. In addition 70 parliamentarians from 17 European countries were welcomed at the ILA2006.

The ILA2006 was organised jointly by the association representing the German aerospace industry, Bundesverband der Deutschen Luft- und Raumfahrtindustrie (BDLI) e.V., Berlin, and by Messe Berlin GmbH.

==ILA 2008==

ILA 2008 was held between 27 May and 1 June 2008 on the southern section of Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, which has been designated as the future Berlin Brandenburg International Airport (BBI). [[Chancellor of Germany (1949–)|Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]] attended the opening ceremony and welcomed international guests, among which a special place was dedicated to Indian operators, as India was chosen as 2008 edition's partner country. Special events were planned as part of 60th Anniversary of the [[Berlin Blockade|Berlin Airlift]] celebration. UK and US veterans from the cold war age Berlin airlift were invited as ILA's special guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2008/presse/presse_volltext_e.cfm?id_nr=137 |title=ILA2008 Berlin Air Show Update |accessdate=13 June 2008 |publisher=ILA |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604013341/http://www.ila-berlin.com/ila2008/presse/presse_volltext_e.cfm?id_nr=137 |archivedate=June 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jani Hirvinen''' (born 1969 in [[Helsinki]], Finland) is one of the earlier Finnish IT-technology pioneers. He started his IT career on early 1980s by doing [[FIDONet]] and [[SiGNET]] BBS networks.

== Youth ==
Hirvinen was born to a family of aviation as his father was a long term aviator and also flight instructor in Finland. Throughout he has been keen on aviation and the technologies behind it. In his early age he was able to access on new technologies around the world due the connections of his parents. He was starting electronics at the age of 4 years and computers at age of 8 years.

=== 1980s ===
Hirvinen received his first Sinclair [[ZX80]] on 1980 just few weeks after it was released in the UK. The next year Hirvinen started to work with new released Sinclair [[ZX81]] and became a member of the international Sinclair Club.

After graduating from High School Hirvinen became one of the youngest and earliest persons in Finland to get in touch with SMD technologies and also a programmer for SMD Assembly machine. He started to work with Universal Omni-place 4621A machines at a company called Point Production Ltd in [[Hyvinkää]], Finland. One highlight of his early "SMD era" was to introduce SMD technologies and being responsible of creating first SMD assemblies for the [[Finnish Army]] at 1987.

== Later dates ==

=== 1990s ===
Hirvinen started his first ISP on 1994 called as SGIC Communications Oy in [[Tampere]], Finland. Two year later they acquired a majority from VIP Tietoverkot Oy and changed the corporation's name to VIP Networks Oy. During the early dates of the known internet age, he has one of the first ones to create [[web site]]s and web hosting systems in Finland.

=== Pioneering on Drones ===

'''Kraków University of Economics''' or '''Cracow University of Economics''' ('''KUE''' or '''CUE'''; Polish: ''Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie'') is one of the five [[Poland|Polish]] public [[economics]] [[university|universities]]. CUE came into existence in 1925. It is the biggest university of economic sciences in Poland. Krakow University of Economics is one of the three largest universities in Kraków, after [[Jagiellonian University]] and the [[AGH University of Science and Technology]]. The [[motto]] and mission of the university in Latin is "Rerum cognoscere causas et valorem" (in English "To learn the causes and values of things. To provide universal education. To bring together professional and general knowledge of methodological and theoretical character.") Its {{convert|17|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus is in the vicinity of historical medieval Old Town of Kraków and easily accessible both on foot or by public transportation. In addition to the main campus in [[Kraków]], the university has seven Remote Teaching Centers in the cities of the region.

==History==

The university opened its doors on October 1, 1925 as College of Commerce (''Wyższe Studium Handlowe'').

On 6 November 1939, as a part of  [[Sonderaktion Krakau]] operation, the Nazis arrested professors of Cracow universities who later were executed or sent to concentration camps. Among them were four professors of the academy: [[Arnold Bolland]], [[Zygmunt Sarna]], [[Walenty Winid]] and [[Albin Żabiński]], as well as many professors of other universities who were running some classes at the academy &lt;ref&gt;https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Uniwersytetu_Ekonomicznego_w_Krakowie#/media/File:Tablica_pamiatkowa_wywiezienia_profesorow_Akademii_Ekonomicznej_w_Krakowie.JPG&lt;/ref&gt;. Two buildings of the school were seized, and numerous library books and documents were lost. Classes continued surreptitiously throughout the war, until the school was able to reopen in 1945. The school was nationalized in 1950 and renamed as Higher School of Economics (''Wyższa Szkoła Ekonomiczna'').

In 1974 it was renamed again, as Krakow Academy of Economics (''Akademia Ekonomiczna w Krakowie''). In 2007 it received its current name: Krakow University of Economics (''Uniwersytet Ekonomiczny w Krakowie'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3509">{{For|the German anarchist|Max Baginski}}

'''Leo Maximilan Baginski''', known as '''Max Baginski''' (born June 7, 1891 in Kolmar (now [[Chodzież]]), [[Province of Posen]]; died March 19, 1964 in [[Locarno]], [[Switzerland]]) was a German [[entrepreneur]], [[inventor]] and [[marketing]] specialist. He invented the „Spalt“-tablet, an analgesic bearing a characteristic split-mark. He donated the funds for building the Catholic parish church of St. Katharina in [[Bad Soden am Taunus]], [[Germany]].
== Early life==
Max Baginski was born as one of seven children of a mason and contractor. After the death of his father in 1897, he lived with aunt and uncle. After school he went to [[Berlin]], where he completed a mercantile apprenticeship. He quit his first job after six months and started his own business marketing a first patented invention, an all-purpose bottle cap. In 1912 he acquired the pharmaceutical firm ''Dr. Ballowitz &amp; Co.'' in Berlin. While he served in the German armed forces during World War I, his companies were run by three of his sisters. In 1920 he married Katharina Stanke (1900–1982). The couple had three daughters and one son..
== Inventions ==

The big success of another invention, a massage device, enabled Baginski to expand his enterprise. In 1931 he teamed up with the prominent serologist  [[Hans Much]] (1880–1932) and founded another company named  „Prof. Dr. med. Much’sche Präparate m.b.H.“, where the „Spalt“-tablet was created in 1932. After World War II, however, most of his production plants ended up in the soviet zone. Baginski himself was accused of having had employed forced labourers, arrested and sent to the [[Buchenwald concentration camp]]. There he vowed to build a church, if he would survive. 

The Soviet authorities released Max Baginski in August 1948. From his enterprises only the ''Dr. Ballowitz &amp; Co.'' had escaped disappropriation, but fortunately, this was where all his trademarks had been registered. This enabled Baginski to go on producing his articles which he did in [[Bad Soden am Taunus]], a spa town some 15 Kilometers northwest of [[Frankfurt am Main]]. In 1953, a new factory of the ''Prof. Dr. med. Much AG'' started production and in 1955 Baginski fulfilled his vow by providing the funds for a new church for the town’s catholic parish, a new vicarage and a kindergarten that today bears Baginski’s name. 
== Death ==
Before his death in 1964, Max Baginski put his son Jürgen in control over the ''Prof. Dr. med Much AG''. Jürgen Baginski sold the company in 1972 to ''American Home Products Corp.''  This group, that changed its name to [[Wyeth]] in 2002, integrated the “Much AG” to its subsidiary ''Whitehall International''. The factory in Bad Soden was closed in 1993.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4359">'''Managerial Risk Accounting''' is concerned with the generation, dissemination and use of [[risk]] related [[accounting]] information to managers within organisations to enable them to judge and shape the risk situation of the organisation according to the objectives of the organisation.

== Subject ==

As a part of the [[management accounting]] system and function, managerial risk accounting has the following two main purposes:

* decision-facilitating or decisions-making
* decision-influencing or stewardship

These purposes are achieved by providing respectively relevant information to improve the ability and willingness of the employees to achieve the organisations’s goals and objectives. For the purpose of decision facilitation, decision makers should be provided with an accounting representation of the state-act-outcome set of the decision. Especially, it is necessary to provide statements concerning the likelihood or probability of states and outcomes. For the purpose of stewardship, it is necessary to provide information on the risks taken and their relation to the risk bearing capability of organisation as well as their relationship to the return generated.

== Accounting representation of risk ==

Existing accounting systems are primarily "monovalent". That is, a single accounting value is attributed to a specific object or purpose. In contrast, risk and uncertainty are formally characterised by a whole range of possible values connected to an object.

* [[Financial accounting]]: Risks are mainly represented by the recognition of [[Provision (accounting)]] or [[Contingent liability]]. [[Fair value]] measurement partially includes considerations of risk. [[Hedge accounting]] allows for limited aggregation of mutually offsetting risks.
* [[Cost accounting]]: Risks in the sense of unexpected resource consumption is accounted for by using normalised costs for those events (expected value).
* [[Capital budgeting]]: Risk representation ranges from flat adjustments to cash flows and duration via risk adjusted discount rates to decision tree analysis, stochastic simulation and real options.
* [[Performance measurement]]: Risk is usually represented in form of risk adjusted discount rates or hurdle rates.

Special risk accounting techniques do exist but are in practice mostly restricted to financial instruments as accounting objects and financial institutions as accounting subjects. They include:

* At-Risk-Measures such as [[Value at Risk]], Cash Flow at Risk or Earnings at Risk.
* Risk adjusted performance measures as [[RAROC]] and RARORAC.

In summary, it can be concluded that the representation of risk and uncertainty in accounting systems is limited in scope and technique as well as dispersed over different systems. As of now, no specialised comprehensive accounting system for the purpose of representing risk organisation wide in comparable terms has evolved. Such a system should allow for the representation of risk in accounting terms connected to the goals of the organisation such as liquidity and profitability on different organisational levels such as the organisation as a whole, business units and projects. Central to this is the configuration of adequate [[risk measure]]s to capture the risk situation and measures for the capability of the organisation to bear risks (e. g. risk capital). These measures should also take into account behavioural and cognitive aspects of [[judgement]] and [[decision making]] under risk and uncertainty.

==Kidnapping incident== 
Mirilashvili's elderly father was kidnapped on a highway in August 2000 while driving in his [[Lexus LS]], by a group pretending to be traffic police. The group was apparently unaware of who they had kidnapped and had not seen the logo of the family's casino company on the numberplate. A couple of days later, he was returned safely.  Two weeks later, the dead bodies of those responsible for the kidnapping, along with their girlfriends and driver, were found dead near Isaakievsky square.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kommersant]], № 17 (2147), 2/1/2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian authorities arrested Mikhael Mirilashvili (the son) and charged him with kidnapping in March, 2001.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaminskaya|first=Masha|title=Prosecutors Formally Charge Mirilashvili|url=http://sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=14216|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=February 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the case details, Mirilashvili ordered the security service to find mafia members who had abducted his family, and as a result mafia members were kidnapped to be delivered to the office of the company "Petromir", a company belonging to the family. There under torture they told the co-ordinates of kidnappers of Mirilashvili-senior, then after his release they too had been executed. The original kidnappers themselves were later found dead in [[Saint Isaac's Square]].(Source: Newspaper Kommersant № 185)

A group of well-known Russian figures including [[Andrei Petrov]], [[Oleg Basilashvili]], [[Mikhail Boyarsky]] and poet and singer [[Alexander Rosenbaum]] protested the City Prosecutor’s Office’s illegal methods of investigation applied in this case.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times" /&gt;  On August 1, 2003 The Leningrad District Military Court sentenced Mirilashvili to serve eight years in prison.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kovalev|first=Vladimir|title=Mirilashvili Handed 12-Year Jail Term|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=10629|accessdate=24 December 2013|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=August 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mirilashvili stated that the testimony of court expert Sergei Koval was an act of revenge and should be thrown out because of his personal interest in the case. Koval’s wife, Tatyana, was asked to resign at the Mirilashvili-owned Conti group as a result of not doing her job properly.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg" /&gt;  While in prison, Mirilashvili fought the sentencing at the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in Strasbourg, France. The court declared that the taking and examination of the evidence was done in an unfair manner and had not satisfied the requirements of a fair hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CASE OF MIRILASHVILI v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1357">'''Privatier''' ([{{IPA|pʀiˈvaˈtjeː}}], also spelled '''Privatus''', with the feminine forms '''Privata''' or '''Privatière''', meaning "private person") is a French word that was used from the 19th century in [[Germany]] and some other countries as a title by members of [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] families of substantial financial means in lieu of another professional title. Much like [[wikt:rentier|rentier]], it denoted someone who did not have to work to make a living, and who lived off their assets of some size, e.g. [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profits]] from [[investor|investments]], [[real estate]] and [[current asset]]s. Sometimes, the title was used by affluent businessmen after they had wholly or largely retired from their former activity. For example, in [[Thomas Mann]]'s novel ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', the character Alois Permaneder, a former merchant, uses this title after his marriage to Tony Buddenbrook, after receiving a substantial [[dowry]] from her wealthy family, at which point he retires from business.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Mann]]: ''[[Buddenbrooks]]'', part 6, chapter 8, Frankfurt 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4857">The '''''Repartimiento''''' ({{IPA-es|repaɾtiˈmjento}}) (Spanish, "distribution, partition, or division") was a colonial [[Unfree labour|forced labor]] system imposed upon the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous population of Spanish America]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]]. In concept it was similar to other [[tribute]]-labor systems, such as the ''[[mita (Inca)|mita]]'' of the [[Inca Empire]] or the [[corvée]] of [[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime France]]: the natives were forced to do low-paid or unpaid labor for a certain number of weeks or months each year on Spanish-owned farms, mines, workshops (''obrajes''), and public projects. With the [[New Laws]] of 1542, the ''repartimiento'' was instated to substitute the ''[[encomienda]]'' system that had come to be seen as abusive and promoting unethical behavior. The ''repartimiento'' was not [[slavery]], in that the worker is not owned outright—being free in various respects other than in the dispensation of his or her labor—and the work was intermittent. It however, created [[slavery]]-like conditions in certain areas, most notoriously in silver mines of 16th century [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Spodek |first=Howard |authorlink= Howard Spodek|coauthors= |title= The World's History, Third Edition: Combined Volume (pages 457-458)|date= February 2005|publisher= [[Prentice Hall]] |location= |isbn=978-0-13-177318-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first decades of the colonization of the Caribbean the word was used for the institution that became the ''[[encomienda]]'', which can cause confusion. It was a way for people to pay tribute by doing laborious jobs for the mother country. 

The ''repartimiento'', for the most part, replaced the ''encomienda''  throughout the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] by the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

In practice, a [[conquistador]], or later a Spanish settler or official, would be given and supervised a number of indigenous workers, who would labor in farms or mines, or in the case of the Philippines might also be assigned to the ship yards constructing the [[Manila galleon]]s. The one in charge of doing the ''reparto'' ("distribution") of workers was the ''[[Corregidor (position)|Alcalde Mayor]]'' (local magistrate) of the city. Native communities that were close to Spanish populations were required to provide a percentage of their people (2-4%) to work in agriculture, construction of houses, streets, etc.  The diminution of the number of natives in the Americas due to European diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]] and [[typhus]]) to which the native populations had no resistance, as well as to desertion from the work fields, led to the substitution of the ''encomienda'' system and the creation of privately owned farms and [[hacienda]]s. Many native people escaped the ''encomienda'' and ''repartimiento'' by leaving their communities. Some looked for [[Wage labour|wage labor]]; others signed contracts (''asientos'') for six months to a year, during which time the worker was required to be paid a salary (something the Spanish Crown did not enforce or support), and provided living quarters as well as religious services. There were many cases in which both wage and ''repartimiento'' laborers worked side-by-side on farms, mines, ''obrajes'' or haciendas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Organizational resilience is defined as "the ability of a system to withstand changes in its environment and still function".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=Ian P|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|last3=Johnson|first3=Michael|title=Adaptive organizational resilience: an evolutionary perspective|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=28|pages=33–40|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2017.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a capability that involves organizations either being able to endure the environmental changes without having to permanently adapt, or the organization is forced to adapt a new way of working that better suits the new environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In recent years, a new consensus of the concept of '''resilience''' emerged as a practical response to the decreasing lifespan of organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Upside-Turbulence-Seizing-Opportunity-Uncertain/dp/0061771155/|title=The Upside of Turbulence: Seizing Opportunity in an Uncertain World|first=Donald|last=Sull|date=15 October 2009|publisher=HarperBusiness|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and from the key stakeholders, including boards, governments, regulators, [[shareholder]]s, staff, suppliers and customers to effectively address the issues of security, [[preparedness]], risk, and survivability.

# Being resilient is a proactive and determined attitude to remain a thriving enterprise (country, region, organization or company) despite the anticipated and unanticipated challenges that will emerge; 
# Resilience moves beyond a defensive security and protection posture and applies the entity’s inherent strength to withstand crisis and deflect attacks of any nature; 
# Resilience is the empowerment of being aware of your situation, your risks, vulnerabilities and current capabilities to deal with them, and being able to make informed tactical and strategic decisions; and, 
# Resilience is an objectively measurable competitive differentiator (i.e., more secure, increased stakeholder and shareholder value).
An organization that realizes the benefits of the above definitions of resilience will have a high likelihood of maintaining a successful and thriving enterprise.

Previously, it was considered that 'organisational resilience' could only be generated from processes and functions such as [[Risk Management]], [[Business Continuity]], IT [[Disaster Recovery]], [[Crisis Management]], [[Information Security]], [[Operational continuity]], Physical Security and so on. These are recognised as key contributors to operational resilience, and “the positive ability of a system or company to adapt itself to the consequences of a catastrophic failure caused by power outage, a fire, a bomb or similar” event or as "the ability of a [system] to cope with change".&lt;ref&gt;Wieland, A. &amp; Wallenburg, C.M.

== Importance ==

Global turbulence is expected. Competition, instability and uncertainty are constants in a changing world. Organizations face an unprecedented and growing number of potential disruptions to the status quo and the best laid strategic plans. As history repeats itself, prominent organizations will fail unless modern risk management and governance models incorporate scalable resilience metrics.

To survive and prosper in this new environment of heightened uncertainty and change, organizations must move past traditional risk and governance models and focus instead on resilience. Resilience applies at all levels: national, regional, organizational and corporate. At the national level, major infrastructure concerns and societal institutions must be robust enough, and unencumbered by legal and regulatory constraints, to serve the national good in normal operations, in crisis, and in recovery. At the regional levels, specific infrastructure assets come together in highly interdependent ways to serve local constituents and be a part of a national infrastructure. At the organizational and corporate level (which owns or operates the vast majority of our critical infrastructure assets), individual companies and operating units must ensure their business operations and service delivery capacities remain able to perform their primary business functions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techzone360.com/topics/techzone/articles/2015/12/03/413946-saying-do-resilience-10-potential-barriers-business-bliss.htm Demrovsky, Chloe. Saying 'I Do' to Resilience: 10 Potential Barriers to Business Bliss. TechZone360. December 3, 2015.]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Business continuity and competitiveness ==

[[Yossi Sheffi]] extended the resilience concept to business continuity initiatives in his 2005 book ''The Resilient Enterprise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Yossi|last=Sheffi|url=http://resilient-enterprise.mit.edu/ |title=The Resilient Enterprise: Overcoming Vulnerability for Competitive Enterprise|publisher=MIT Press|date=October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheffi analyzed how disruptions can adversely affect the operations of corporations and how investments in resilience can give a business a competitive advantage over entities not prepared for various contingencies. Business organizations such as the [[Council on Competitiveness]] have embraced resilience and have tied economic competitiveness to security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compete.org/publications/detail/31/the-resilient-economy-integrating-competitiveness-and-security/ Transform. The Resilient Economy]. Integrating Competitiveness and Security. Council on Competitiveness.

Many experts and leaders see resilience as a vital component to a [[homeland security]] strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Katherine McIntire Peters.

== Growing support in Washington, D.C. ==

Prominent members in the United States Congress are embracing resilience. The Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, Bennie Thompson (D-MS) declared May 2008 “Resilience Month” as the committee and its subcommittees held a series of hearings to examine the issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hlswatch.com/2008/05/01/%e2%80%9cresilience%e2%80%9d-blooming-into-its-own/ 'Resilience' Blooming Into Its Own].

Homeland Security Advisory Council. September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; have also made resilience an integral component of homeland security policy.

The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, released by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] in February 2010, made resilience a prominent theme and one of the core missions of the U.S. homeland security enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/qhsr_report.pdf Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Report: A Strategic Framework for a Secure Homeland].

== Competitive advantage in business ==

Business and government enterprises that are able to quickly adapt to or seize [[competitive advantage]] from sudden and/or significant changes in their environments, with minimal interruption to their enterprise missions and manageable impact to their market value, as well as adapt to change in an apparently slower, more evolutionary manner - sometimes over many years or decades - can be described as being more resilient&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newsday.com/2.811/jamie-herzlich/small-business-a-good-plan-shields-from-storm-clouds-1.1322137?firstfree=yes&lt;/ref&gt;. Leading [[management consultancies]] and national governments including the Australia, [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[UK Cabinet Office]] believe that an organization’s resilience, properly understood, has critical implications for its competitive posture, profitability and shareholder value.

Over the past years, business, academic and government leaders have become aware that certain organizations respond better to disruptions than other, often similarly situated, organizations. For example, a September 2003 Harvard Business Review article&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Harvard Business Review|year=2003|title=The Quest for Resilience|author=Gary Hamel and Liisa Välikangis|url=http://www.hbr.org/2003/09/the-quest-for-resilience/ar/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that “momentum is not the force it once was” in ensuring an organization’s success. They noted the emergence of several disruptive trends — including technological discontinuities, regulatory upheavals, [[geopolitical]] shocks, industry [[deverticalization]] and [[disintermediation]], abrupt shifts in consumer tastes, and hordes of nontraditional competitors — that require companies to become resilient to remain successful. The authors concluded that “strategic resilience is not about responding to a one-time crisis.  It’s not about rebounding from a setback. It’s about continuously anticipating and adjusting to deep, secular trends that can permanently impair the earning power of a core business. It’s about having the capacity to change before the case for change becomes desperately obvious.”

Resilience also has important implications for governance processes and systems. In a 2004 white paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2004|title=Redefining the Corporate Governance Agenda |publisher=[[Booz Allen Hamilton]] and Weil, Gotschal and Manges LLP |url=http://www.boozallen.com/media/file/138022.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors wrote that “enterprise resilience marries risk assessment, information reporting, and governance processes with strategic and business planning to create an enterprise-wide early warning capability that is embedded in the business of the company.” They explained that “Enterprise Resilience is predicated on an expanded view of risk—one that focuses on value, and therefore encompasses not only traditional risks (e.g., financial, natural hazards, physical security, legal, compliance) but also risks relating to earnings drivers (e.g., innovation, channel relationships, intellectual property) and company culture.”

Over the past decade, governments worldwide have also become increasingly focused on protecting their facilities, technologies, networks, personnel and other mission-critical assets from attack or misappropriation. The risk of cyber-terrorism and other threats to critical infrastructure are of particular concern.  On March 31, 2011, the President issued Presidential Policy Directive Eight (PPD-8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PPD-8|url=https://www.dhs.gov/presidential-policy-directive-8-national-preparedness}}&lt;/ref&gt; that directed the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to develop a national preparedness system with the objective of strengthening the security and resilience of the United States through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk to the security of the Nation, including acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters. The directive defined resilience as “the ability to adapt to changing conditions and withstand and rapidly recover from disruption due to emergencies.”

[[Security]], whether applied to physical, financial, personnel, cyber information or any other asset, entails the measures to protect against danger or loss with emphasis on being protected from dangers that originate from outside. A significant [[security breach|breach in security]] could certainly impair an organizations ability to exist, and thus is a critical concept underlying the organization’s capacity to be resilient. Resilience is proactive in positioning the company to survive and thrive given known and unknown challenges. Security, as generally practiced, provides specific protection against identified or projected circumstances.

===Protection===
Protection is often associated with the set of actions to harden assets to withstand identified contingencies, mitigate the damage, or make them an unattractive target. The focus is to maintain the assets’ core function and ward off harm. Typically, protection performance objectives are stated as an absolute capability against varying levels of threat (category II or greater hurricane, defined types of breaches, specific acts). Organizations plan for protection against specific threats or categories of threats. Resilience approaches the issue from a standpoint of taking reasonable protective actions, but having alternative capabilities as needed or the ability to withstand the disruption.

===Crisis management===
[[Crisis management]] generally refers to the set of actions and capabilities in place to effectively respond to and contain a situation. The situation can vary from natural, man-made, or environmental challenges, whether internally or externally generated. Most consider crisis management to largely consist of actions that go into play when the crisis occurs and subside after it is considered “over”. There are plans and preparations, but the actions are not often dealt with as part of normal operations. Resilience depends on effective crisis management, but would encourage more prominent treatment of crisis management capabilities throughout the company’s operation than is often the case.

===Preparedness===
[[Preparedness]] consists of the plans of actions for when the disaster or crisis strikes.  Preparedness efforts are very specific sets of tactical actions (evacuation plans, sheltering plans, rehearsals, stockpiles, etc.) that the company and individuals will take to mitigate the effects of predicted disasters/crises. Resilience requires prudent and serious attention to preparations for known likely disasters, particularly those that are highly likely (e.g., hurricanes in Florida). Resiliency would address preparedness as a specific emergency management business function; but more importantly, as being impacted by numerous functions across the organization. These may include human resources, strategic planning, financial management, information technology, and risk management.

===Risk management===
[[Risk management]] consists of formal processes to identify threats and vulnerabilities to the company, and the mitigation approaches it will employ. Risk management is highly sophisticated and the results have application in managing the business, insurance coverage, and in attracting investors. The risk management profession is moving toward a more proactive and return on investment focus, but the traditional focus has been defensive in nature. Identifying and managing risks, particularly operational risks, is arguably the most important factor in achieving resilience; however, it is one of many factors. Resiliency has a healthy consideration of posturing for future opportunities. That is not a traditional consideration in risk management.

== Making resilience reality ==

Some scholars have identified the four facets of resilience as preparedness, protection, response and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.policyarchive.org/bitstream/handle/10207/9662/Building_Resilience_OCT6.pdf?sequence=1 Building A Resilient Nation: Enhancing Security, Ensuring a Strong Economy report]. Reform Institute. October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, are adopting the resilience concept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/resilientnation Resilient Nation]. Demos. April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcommission.vic.gov.au/getdoc/cd99d136-6195-4b70-b6f4-46202d717f1e/TEN.047.001.0001.pdf Improving Disaster Resilience]. Australian Government. May 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United Kingdom, resilience is implemented locally by the [[Local Resilience Forum]].

==Measuring resilience==
As part of the Canterbury University Resilient Organisations programme, ResOrgs have developed a tool for benchmarking the Resilience of Organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resorgs.org.nz/ Resilient Organisations]. March 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Resilience Diagnostic is an assessment made up of 11 categories, each evaluated by a set of 5 to 7 questions. These categories are defined as either asset or liability. A person’s resilience is determined by the sum of all asset scores divided by the sum of all liability scores, producing a Resilience Ratio. The Resilience Ratio can be reflected both on an organizational and individual level and the assessment provides self-coaching options for participants. Developed in 2011 by The Resilience Institute, the Resilience Diagnostic has been used by corporations worldwide, with key insights reflected in the Global Resilience Report 2016. &lt;ref&gt;[https://resiliencei.com/resilience-diagnostic/ Resilience Diagnostic]. November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resilience as an acquired skill==
In [[Organizational Studies]], resilience is often referred to as the maintenance of positive adjustment under challenging conditions. Here, resilience emerges as the response to specific interruptions of the normal. Sutcliffe and Vogus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.husdal.com/2010/10/14/organizing-resilience/ Organizing for Resilience] Sutcliffe, K. M., &amp; Vogus, T. J. (2003). In K. S. Cameron, J. E. Dutton &amp; R. E. Quinn (Eds.), Positive Organizational Scholarship: Foundations of a New Discipline (pp. 94-110). San Francisco: Berett-Koehler Publishers&lt;/ref&gt; argue that resilience should rather be viewed from a developmental perspective, as an ability that develops over time from continually handling risks. Resilience, then, is "the continuing ability to use internal and external resources successfully to resolve new issues". Thus, "resilience is the capacity to rebound from adversity strengthened and more resourceful".

==Organizational Resilience Management Standard==
[[ASIS International]] have developed and published the definitive Organizational Resilience Management Standard SPC.1-2009. Approved by ANSI and adopted by the Department of Homeland Security under the PS-Prep program, this American Standard provides a practical basis for implementation of preparedness objectives supported by ASIS ORMS (Organizational Resilience Management System) software.

'''Russian Accounting Standards''' ('''RAS'''; {{lang-ru|Российские стандарты бухгалтерского учёта, РСБУ}}), also called '''Russian Accounting Principles''' ('''RAP''') or '''Russian GAAP''', refer to the body of regulatory documents concerning financial accounting and reporting standards in the [[Russian Federation]].&lt;ref name="KPMG"&gt;{{cite press release | title=IFRS compared to Russian GAAP: An overview | publisher=[[KPMG International]] | date=October 2005 | page=7 | url=http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/IFRS-compared-to-Russian-GAAP-O-200510.pdf | accessdate=2011-12-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407070508/http://www.kpmg.com/CN/en/IssuesAndInsights/ArticlesPublications/Documents/IFRS-compared-to-Russian-GAAP-O-200510.pdf | archive-date=2012-04-07 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For historical reasons, the Russian Accounting Standards framework has been determined by the state, rather by professional bodies.&lt;ref name="iaspl"&gt;{{cite web |title=Financial Reporting Framework in Russia |url=https://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/europe/russia |website=iasplus.com |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161015194743/http://www.iasplus.com/en/jurisdictions/europe/russia |archive-date=2016-10-15 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary users of RAS are state and tax authorities, rather than management or third parties.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; RAS financial statements must include [[balance sheet]], [[income statement]], [[statement of changes in equity]], [[cash flow statement]] and explanatory notes.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; Under RAS, a specific layout is mandatory for the balance sheet and other statements.&lt;ref name="eycomp"/&gt;

The Russian government has been striving to harmonize Russian Accounting Standards with IFRS since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia to Fully Adopt International Accounting Rules by 2018 |url=https://sputniknews.com/business/20130223179634843-Russia-to-Fully-Adopt-International-Accounting-Rules-by-2018----/ |accessdate=28 October 2018 |work=sputniknews.com |date=23 February 2013 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010041732/https://sputniknews.com/business/20130223179634843-Russia-to-Fully-Adopt-International-Accounting-Rules-by-2018----/ |archive-date=2017-10-10 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Law No. 208-FZ introduced IFRS into Russian legislation in 2010.&lt;ref name="eycomp"&gt;{{cite web |title=IFRS, US GAAP and RAP: Comparison and basics |url=https://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng/$FILE/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng.pdf |website=EY |accessdate=28 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516144144/http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng/$FILE/EY-ifrs-usgaap-rap-2016-eng.pdf |archive-date=2017-05-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, [[IFRS]] have increasingly been adopted in Russia, and they are mandatory for [[consolidated financial statements]], while standalone financial statements must be prepared using RAS.&lt;ref name="iaspl"/&gt; IFRS statements are also required for domestic [[public companies]].&lt;ref name="ifrssite"&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia |url=https://www.ifrs.org/use-around-the-world/use-of-ifrs-standards-by-jurisdiction/russia/ |website=IFRS.org |accessdate=28 October 2018 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180216093055/http://www.ifrs.org/use-around-the-world/use-of-ifrs-standards-by-jurisdiction/russia/ |archive-date=2018-02-16 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; IFRS are generally deemed more relevant to the needs of investors.&lt;ref name="kim13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Oksana |title=Russian Accounting System: Value Relevance of Reported Information and the IFRS Adoption Perspective |journal=The International Journal of Accounting |date=December 2013 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=525–547 |doi=10.1016/j.intacc.2013.10.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to IFRS==
Major reasons for deviation between Russian GAAP and IFRS / US-GAAP (e.g. when the Russian affiliate of a larger group need to be consolidated to the mother company) are the following:

# Booking of payables in the [[general ledger]] according to national accounting standards can only be made upon receipt of the actual acceptance protocol (good's receipt). Indeed, in Russia, in contrast to IFRS and US-GAAP, the invoice (outgoing or incoming) is not an official tax or accounting document and does not trigger any booking. There is also no provision to book in the General Ledger any expense for goods and services that according to a contract are effectively received but for whom documents are still not exchanged.
# There is no possibility under Russian GAAP to recognise the good-will as an intangible asset in the balance sheet of a company. This has a major consequence when a company is sold. Indeed, if a company (or part of it) is sold at a higher value than its book value (i.e. to account for the good-will value), the selling party need to pay tax at the relevant profit tax rate (20% in 2013) on the difference in value between selling and accounting value and the buyer has no possibility to amortize the cost and deduct it from present and future revenues.
# There is no equivalent of [[IAS 37]] in the Russian GAAP. Loans and monetary securities are not discounted, so the present value of such financial assets is not discounted for the relevant interest rates at the different maturities of the loans.

{{Japanese name| Ōya }}
{{nihongo|'''Shinzō Ōya '''|大屋晋三| Ōya Shinzō |extra=5 July 1894 – 9 March 1980}} was an entrepreneur and politician, who served as [[Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Japan)|Minister of Commerce and Industry]] in post-war Japan.&lt;ref name=Kotobank&gt;{{cite web|title=Ōya Shinzō|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%A4%A7%E5%B1%8B%E6%99%8B%E4%B8%89|work=Nihon jinmei daijiten+Plus|publisher=Kōdansha|accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōya was born in what is now part of the town of [[Meiwa, Gunma |Meiwa]] in [[Gunma Prefecture]], where his father was a high school principal and his grandfather had been a [[samurai]] in the service of [[Kawagoe Domain]]. He graduated from what later became [[Hitotsubashi University]] in 1918. On graduation he joined the ''[[zaibatsu]]'' [[Suzuki Shoten]], and from 1925 went to work for [[Teijin]], eventually becoming its president in November 1945. 

In his early career, he was praised as a charismatic manager, who introduced new [[synthetic fiber]]s which made Teijin a market leader in the fabric industry. However, he later was criticized for over-diversification, and for his refusal to surrender authority over the company despite his obvious mental decline in old age, which led Teijin to the brink of bankruptcy.

In 1947, Ōya was elected to a seat in the [[Diet of Japan]] in [[Japanese House of Councillors election, 1947|1947 Upper House election]] from the Osaka electoral district, and was reelected for a second term, serving until June 1956 under [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party ]] (LDP) banner. From 19 October 1948 – 16 February 1949, he was Minister of Commerce and Industry under the 2nd [[Shigeru Yoshida]] administration, as well as interim [[Minister of Finance (Japan) |Minister of Finance]] from 14 December 1948 to 16 February 1949. During the 3rd Yoshida administration, Ōya served as [[Ministry of Transport (Japan)|Minister of Transport]] from 16 February 1949 to 28 June 1950.

Ōya was married to the singer and writer Ōya Masako.

'''Shut-off nozzles''' are used in the manufacturing process of [[plastic injection molding]]. Machine shut-off nozzles serve as the connection between the plasticizing barrel (with reciprocating screw) and the mold. They are mounted on the machineside of the plastic injection molding process, unlike [[hot runner]] nozzles which are mounted on the moldside of the process. Machine shut-off nozzles differ from open nozzles because of their closable melt channel.

== Reasons for using ==

Shut-off nozzles are used to avoid drooling of the melt and stringing, as well as to feed with a retracted nozzle.&lt;ref&gt;Johannaber, Friedrich (2008). ''Injection Molding Machines: A User's Guide.'' Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich. {{ISBN|978-3-446-22581-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Shut-off nozzles can be self-controlled or externally controlled.

=== Self-controlled ===
[[File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated info.jpg|Needle Shut-off Nozzle type A(S) - spring operated]]The needle keeps the nozzle [[wikt:orifice|orifice]] closed by spring pressure. When the injection pressure increases, the melt will push back on the needle head and try to open the nozzle. Once the melt inside the nozzle reaches a certain amount of [[pressure]], it will succeed in pushing the needle back against the spring. There must, therefore, be a minimum pressure for the opening process to overcome the [[force]] of the spring.&lt;ref&gt;Pötsch, Gerd. Michaeli, Walter (2008). '' Injection Molding: An Introduction.'' Carl Hanser Publishers, Munich. {{ISBN|978-3-446-40635-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the nozzle opens, the pressure will drop again and the spring-operated needle will close the nozzle tip orifice.

=== Externally actuated ===
The nozzle is opened by external force, independent of the melt-pressure. The shut-off nozzle’s actuation is [[hydraulically]] or [[pneumatically]] driven. Externally actuated shut-off nozzles can have different ways of closing the melt stream. Due to the fact that they operate independently of melt-pressure, they can be used for a range of applications such as melt pre-compression, physical and chemical [[foaming]] and high-speed injection molding.

==== Needle ====
[[File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation info.jpg|Needle Shut-off Nozzle type HP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation]]The melt flow is shut off via a melt channel-axis positioned needle moving back and forth according to actuation. This nozzle type shuts off the melt stream directly at the nozzle orifice-mold interface which prevents drooling.

==== Bolt ====
[[File:Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation info.jpg|Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type BHP - pneumatic or hydraulic actuation]]A shut-off bolt, positioned [[perpendicular]] to the melt channel moves up and down according to actuation, and thus shuts off/opens the melt flow. This nozzle type has a single melt channel. It therefore does not require rerouting of the melt around the shut-off mechanism. This makes it more suitable for processing of large volumes as well as shear sensitive materials.

==== Rotary ====
[[File:Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation.jpg|thumb|upright|link=File:Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation info.jpg|Rotary Bolt Shut-off Nozzle type DB - pneumatic actuation]]This nozzle type is fitted with a rotatable bolt assembly which has a cavity equal in size to the melt channel. In its open position, the bolt cavity is directly aligned with the melt stream. When the [[actuator]] rotates the bolt assembly, the cavity becomes misaligned and thus shuts of the melt flow.

==Mission==
'''Supply-Chain Management (SCM)''', techniques with the aim of coordinating all parts of SC from supplying raw materials to delivering and/or resumption of products, tries to minimize total costs with respect to existing conflicts among the chain partners. An example of these conflicts is the interrelation between the sale department desiring to have higher inventory levels to fulfill demands and the warehouse for which lower inventories are desired to reduce holding costs &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2016-08-01|title=Optimizing an inventory model with fuzzy demand, backordering, and discount using a hybrid imperialist competitive algorithm|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0307904X1630138X|journal=Applied Mathematical Modelling|language=en|volume=40|issue=15-16|pages=7318–7335|doi=10.1016/j.apm.2016.03.013|issn=0307-904X}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==Origin of the term and definitions==
In 1982, [[Keith Oliver]], a consultant at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]] introduced the term "supply chain management" to the public domain in an interview for the [[Financial Times]].&lt;ref name="handfield" /&gt;

In the mid-1990s, more than a decade later, the term "supply chain management" gained currency when a flurry of articles and books came out on the subject. Supply chains were originally defined as encompassing all activities associated with the flow and transformation of goods from raw materials through to the end user, as well as the associated information flows. Supply chain management was then further defined as the integration of supply chain activities through improved supply-chain relationships to achieve a competitive advantage.&lt;ref name="handfield"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.mypearsonstore.com/bookstore/introduction-to-supply-chain-management-9780136216162 |author1=Robert B. Handfield |author2=Ernest L. Nichols |title=Introduction to Supply Chain Management|date=1999|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=0-13-621616-1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s, "supply-chain management" (SCM) rose to prominence, and operations managers began to use it in their titles with increasing regularity.&lt;ref&gt;David Jacoby (2009), Guide to Supply Chain Management: How Getting it Right Boosts Corporate Performance (The Economist Books), Bloomberg Press; 1st edition, {{ISBN|978-1576603451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Feller, Dan Shunk, &amp; Tom Callarman (2006). BPTrends, March 2006 - Value Chains Vs. Supply Chains&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Blanchard (2010), Supply Chain Management Best Practices, 2nd. Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780470531884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commonly accepted definitions of supply-chain management include:
* The management of upstream and downstream value-added flows of materials, final goods, and related information among suppliers, company, [[reseller]]s, and final consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Nabil Abu el Ata, Rudolf Schmandt (2016), The Tyranny of Uncertainty, Springer, {{ISBN|978-3662491041}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The systematic, strategic coordination of traditional business functions and tactics across all business functions within a particular company and across businesses within the supply chain, for the purposes of improving the long-term performance of the individual companies and the supply chain as a whole&lt;ref name="Mentzer, J.T 2001 pp. 1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mentzer | first1 = J.T. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2001 | title = Defining Supply Chain Management | url = | journal = [[Journal of Business Logistics]] | volume = 22 | issue = 2| pages = 1–25 | doi=10.1002/j.2158-1592.2001.tb00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A customer-focused definition is given by Hines (2004:p76): "Supply chain strategies require a total systems view of the links in the chain that work together efficiently to create customer satisfaction at the end point of delivery to the consumer. As a consequence, costs must be lowered throughout the chain by driving out unnecessary expenses, movements, and handling. The main focus is turned to efficiency and added value, or the end user's perception of value. Efficiency must be increased, and bottlenecks removed. The measurement of performance focuses on total system efficiency and the equitable monetary reward distribution to those within the supply chain. The supply-chain system must be responsive to customer requirements."&lt;ref name="Hines, T 2004"&gt;Hines, T. 2004. Supply chain strategies: Customer driven and customer focused. Oxford: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The integration of key business processes across the supply chain for the purpose of creating value for customers and stakeholders (Lambert, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper et al., 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the [http://cscmp.org/ Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals] (CSCMP), supply chain management encompasses the planning and management of all activities involved in [[Strategic sourcing|sourcing]], [[procurement]], conversion, and [[logistics management]]. It also includes coordination and collaboration with [[channel partner]]s, which may be [[suppliers]], [[intermediaries]], third-party service providers, or [[customers]].&lt;ref name="Kozlenkova 586–609"/&gt; Supply chain management integrates [[supply and demand]] management within and across companies. More recently, the loosely coupled, self-organizing network of businesses that cooperate to provide product and service offerings has been called the ''[[Extended Enterprise]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

A supply chain, as opposed to supply-chain management, is a set of organizations directly linked by one or more upstream and downstream flows of products, services, finances, or information from a source to a customer. Supply chain management is the management of such a chain.&lt;ref name="Mentzer, J.T 2001 pp. 1"/&gt;

[[Supply chain management software]] includes tools or modules used to execute supply chain transactions, manage supplier relationships, and control associated business processes.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

Supply-chain event management (SCEM) considers all possible events and factors that can disrupt a supply chain. With SCEM, possible scenarios can be created and solutions devised.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In many cases, the supply chain includes the collection of goods after consumer use for recycling. Including third-party logistics or other gathering agencies as part of the RM re-patriation process is a way of illustrating the new endgame strategy.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Functions==
Supply-chain management is a cross-functional approach that includes managing the movement of raw materials into an organization, certain aspects of the internal processing of materials into finished goods, and the movement of finished goods out of the organization and toward the end consumer. As organizations strive to focus on core competencies and become more flexible, they reduce their ownership of raw materials sources and distribution channels. These functions are increasingly being outsourced to other firms that can perform the activities better or more cost effectively. The effect is to increase the number of organizations involved in satisfying customer demand, while reducing managerial control of daily logistics operations. Less control and more supply-chain partners lead to the creation of the concept of supply-chain management. The purpose of supply-chain management is to improve trust and collaboration among supply-chain partners thus improving inventory visibility and the velocity of inventory movement.

==Importance==
Organizations increasingly find that they must rely on effective supply chains, or networks, to compete in the global market and networked economy.&lt;ref&gt;Baziotopoulos, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In Peter Drucker's (1998) new management paradigms, this concept of business relationships extends beyond traditional enterprise boundaries and seeks to organize entire business processes throughout a value chain of multiple companies.

In recent decades, globalization, outsourcing, and [[information technology]] have enabled many organizations, such as [[Dell]] and [[Hewlett Packard]], to successfully operate collaborative supply networks in which each specialized business partner focuses on only a few key strategic activities (Scott, 1993). This inter-organisational supply network can be acknowledged as a new form of organisation. However, with the complicated interactions among the players, the network structure fits neither "market" nor "hierarchy" categories (Powell, 1990). It is not clear what kind of performance impacts different supply-network structures could have on firms, and little is known about the coordination conditions and trade-offs that may exist among the players. From a systems perspective, a complex network structure can be decomposed into individual component firms (Zhang and Dilts, 2004). Traditionally, companies in a supply network concentrate on the inputs and outputs of the processes, with little concern for the internal management working of other individual players. Therefore, the choice of an internal management control structure is known to impact local firm performance (Mintzberg, 1979).

In the 21st century, changes in the business environment have contributed to the development of supply-chain networks. First, as an outcome of globalization and the proliferation of multinational companies, joint ventures, strategic alliances, and business partnerships, significant success factors were identified, complementing the earlier "[[Just In Time (business)|just-in-time]]", [[lean manufacturing]], and [[agile manufacturing]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;MacDuffie and Helper, 1997; Monden, 1993; Womack and Jones, 1996; Gunasekaran, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Second, technological changes, particularly the dramatic fall in communication costs (a significant component of transaction costs), have led to changes in coordination among the members of the supply chain network (Coase, 1998).

Many researchers have recognized supply network structures as a new organisational form, using terms such as "[[Keiretsu]]", "Extended Enterprise", "Virtual Corporation", "[[Global Production Network]]", and "Next Generation Manufacturing System".&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, 1998; Tapscott, 1996; Dilts, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In general, such a structure can be defined as "a group of semi-independent organisations, each with their capabilities, which collaborate in ever-changing constellations to serve one or more markets in order to achieve some business goal specific to that collaboration" (Akkermans, 2001).

Supply-chain management is also important for organizational learning. Firms with geographically more extensive supply chains connecting diverse trading cliques tend to become more innovative and productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Todo |first1=Y. |last2=Matous |first2=P. |last3=Inoue |first3=H. |date=11 July 2016 |title=The strength of long ties and the weakness of strong ties: Knowledge diffusion through supply chain networks |journal=Research Policy |volume= 45|issue= 9|pages=1890–1906 |doi=10.1016/j.respol.2016.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The security-management system for supply chains is described in ISO/IEC 28000 and ISO/IEC 28001 and related standards published jointly by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]. Supply-Chain Management draws heavily from the areas of operations management, logistics, procurement, and information technology, and strives for an integrated approach.

==Historical developments==
Six major movements can be observed in the evolution of supply-chain management studies: creation, integration, and globalization (Movahedi et al., 2009), specialization phases one and two, and SCM 2.0.

===Creation era===
The term "supply chain management" was first coined by [[Keith Oliver]] in 1982. However, the concept of a supply chain in management was of great importance long before, in the early 20th century, especially with the creation of the [[assembly line]]. The characteristics of this era of supply chain management include the need for large-scale changes, re-engineering, downsizing driven by [[cost reduction]] programs, and widespread attention to Japanese management practices. However, the term became widely adopted after the publication of the seminal book ''Introduction to Supply Chain Management'' in 1999 by Robert B. Handfield and Ernest L. Nichols, Jr.,&lt;ref&gt;Prentice Hall, 1999, {{ISBN|9780136216162}}&lt;/ref&gt; which published over 25,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poole.ncsu.edu/index-exp.php/directory/dossier/robert-handfield/|title=People - Poole College of Management - NC State University|website=www.poole.ncsu.edu|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integration era===
This era of supply-chain-management studies was highlighted with the development of electronic data interchange (EDI) systems in the 1960s, and developed through the 1990s by the introduction of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. This era has continued to develop into the 21st century with the expansion of Internet-based collaborative systems. This era of supply-chain evolution is characterized by both increasing value added and cost reductions through integration.

A supply chain can be classified as a stage 1, 2 or 3 network. In a stage 1–type supply chain, systems such as production, storage, distribution, and material control are not linked and are independent of each other. In a stage 2 supply chain, these are integrated under one plan and enterprise resource planning (ERP) is enabled. A stage 3 supply chain is one that achieves [[vertical integration]] with upstream suppliers and downstream customers. An example of this kind of supply chain is Tesco.

===Globalization era===
It is the third movement of supply-chain-management development, the globalization era, can be characterized by the attention given to global systems of supplier relationships and the expansion of supply chains beyond national boundaries and into other continents. Although the use of global sources in organisations' supply chains can be traced back several decades (e.g., in the oil industry), it was not until the late 1980s that a considerable number of organizations started to integrate global sources into their core business. This era is characterized by the globalization of supply chain management in organizations with the goal of increasing their competitive advantage, adding value, and reducing costs through global sourcing.

===Specialization era (phase I): outsourced manufacturing and distribution===
In the 1990s, companies began to focus on "core competencies" and specialization. They abandoned vertical integration, sold off non-core operations, and outsourced those functions to other companies. This changed management requirements, by extending the supply chain beyond the company walls and distributing management across specialized supply-chain partnerships.

This transition also refocused the fundamental perspectives of each organization. [[Original equipment manufacturer|Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)]] became brand owners that required visibility deep into their supply base. They had to control the entire supply chain from above, instead of from within. Contract manufacturers had to manage bills of material with different part-numbering schemes from multiple OEMs and support customer requests for work-in-process visibility and vendor-managed inventory (VMI).

The specialization model creates manufacturing and distribution networks composed of several individual supply chains specific to producers, suppliers, and customers that work together to design, manufacture, distribute, market, sell, and service a product. This set of partners may change according to a given market, region, or channel, resulting in a proliferation of trading partner environments, each with its own unique characteristics and demands.

===Specialization era (phase II): supply-chain management as a service===
Specialization within the supply chain began in the 1980s with the inception of transportation brokerages, warehouse management (storage and inventory), and non-asset-based carriers, and has matured beyond transportation and logistics into aspects of supply planning, collaboration, execution, and performance management.

Market forces sometimes demand rapid changes from suppliers, logistics providers, locations, or customers in their role as components of supply-chain networks. This variability has significant effects on supply-chain infrastructure, from the foundation layers of establishing and managing electronic communication between trading partners, to more complex requirements such as the configuration of processes and work flows that are essential to the management of the network itself.

Supply-chain specialization enables companies to improve their overall competencies in the same way that outsourced manufacturing and distribution has done; it allows them to focus on their core competencies and assemble networks of specific, best-in-class partners to contribute to the overall value chain itself, thereby increasing overall performance and efficiency. The ability to quickly obtain and deploy this domain-specific supply-chain expertise without developing and maintaining an entirely unique and complex competency in house is a leading reason why supply-chain specialization is gaining popularity.

Outsourced technology hosting for supply-chain solutions debuted in the late 1990s and has taken root primarily in transportation and collaboration categories. This has progressed from the application service provider (ASP) model from roughly 1998 through 2003, to the on-demand model from approximately 2003 through 2006, to the software as a service (SaaS) model currently in focus today.

===Supply-chain management 2.0 (SCM 2.0)===
Building on [[globalization]] and specialization, the term "SCM 2.0" has been coined to describe both changes within supply chains themselves as well as the evolution of processes, methods, and tools to manage them in this new "era". The growing popularity of collaborative platforms is highlighted by the rise of [[TradeCard]]'s [[supply chain collaboration|supply-chain-collaboration]] platform, which connects multiple buyers and suppliers with financial institutions, enabling them to conduct automated supply-chain finance transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cgi.com/sites/cgi.com/files/GTR_AcceleratingSupplyChainFinance_Starace_Quote_e.pdf|title=Trade Services and the Supply Chain|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Web 2.0]] is a trend in the use of the World Wide Web that is meant to increase creativity, information sharing, and collaboration among users. At its core, the common attribute of Web 2.0 is to help navigate the vast information available on the Web in order to find what is being bought. It is the notion of a usable pathway. SCM 2.0 replicates this notion in supply chain operations. It is the pathway to SCM results, a combination of processes, methodologies, tools, and delivery options to guide companies to their results quickly as the complexity and speed of the supply-chain increase due to global competition; rapid price fluctuations; changing oil prices; short product life cycles; expanded specialization; near-, far-, and off-shoring; and talent scarcity.
{{buzzword|date=February 2018}}
SCM 2.0 leverages solutions designed to rapidly deliver results with the agility to quickly manage future change for continuous flexibility, value, and success. This is delivered through competency networks composed of best-of-breed supply-chain expertise to understand which elements, both operationally and organizationally, deliver results, as well as through intimate understanding of how to manage these elements to achieve the desired results. The solutions are delivered in a variety of options, such as no-touch via [[business process outsourcing]], mid-touch via managed services and [[software as a service|software as a service (SaaS)]], or high-touch in the traditional software deployment model.

==Business-process integration==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2013}}
Successful SCM requires a change from managing individual functions to integrating activities into key supply-chain processes. In an example scenario, a purchasing department places orders as its requirements become known. The marketing department, responding to customer demand, communicates with several distributors and retailers as it attempts to determine ways to satisfy this demand. Information shared between supply-chain partners can only be fully leveraged through [[process integration]].

Supply-chain business-process integration involves collaborative work between buyers and suppliers, joint product development, common systems, and shared information. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), operating an integrated supply chain requires a continuous information flow.
However, in many companies, management has concluded that optimizing product flows cannot be accomplished without implementing a process approach. The key supply-chain processes stated by Lambert (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, Douglas M.[http://www.scm-institute.org Supply Chain Management: Processes, Partnerships, Performance], 3rd edition, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* [[Customer-relationship management]]
* Customer-service management
* Demand-management style
* [[Order fulfillment]]
* Manufacturing-flow management
* Supplier-relationship management
* Product development and commercialization
* Returns management

Much has been written about [[demand management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scm.ncsu.edu/scm-articles/article/lessons-in-demand-management|title=Lessons in Demand Management {{!}} Supply Chain Resource Cooperative {{!}} NC State University|date=2002-09-24|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best-in-class companies have similar characteristics, which include the following:
* Internal and external collaboration
* Initiatives to reduce lead time
* Tighter feedback from customer and market demand
* Customer-level forecasting

One could suggest other critical supply business processes that combine these processes stated by Lambert, such as:

; Customer [[service management]] process
: Customer relationship management concerns the relationship between an organization and its customers. Customer service is the source of customer information. It also provides the customer with real-time information on scheduling and product availability through interfaces with the company's production and distribution operations. Successful organizations use the following steps to build customer relationships:
:* determine mutually satisfying goals for organization and customers
:* establish and maintain customer rapport
:* induce positive feelings in the organization and the customers

; [[Procurement]] process
: Strategic plans are drawn up with suppliers to support the manufacturing flow management process and the development of new products. In firms whose operations extend globally, sourcing may be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a relationship where both parties benefit and a reduction in the time required for the product's design and development. The purchasing function may also develop rapid communication systems, such as [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI) and Internet linkage, to convey possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers involve resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage, handling, and [[quality assurance]], many of which include the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers on matters of scheduling, supply continuity (inventory), hedging, and research into new sources or programs.  Procurement has recently been recognized as a core source of value, driven largely by the increasing trends to outsource products and services, and the changes in the global ecosystem requiring stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.&lt;ref&gt;Chick, Gerard, and Handfield, Robert.  The Procurement Value Proposition: The Rise of Supply Management.  London:  Kogan Page, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

; [[Product development]] and commercialization
: Here, customers and suppliers must be integrated into the product development process in order to reduce the time to market. As product life cycles shorten, the appropriate products must be developed and successfully launched with ever-shorter time schedules in order for firms to remain competitive. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), managers of the product development and commercialization process must:
:# coordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs;
:# select materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement; and
:# develop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the given combination of product and markets.

Integration of suppliers into the new product development process was shown to have a major impact on product target cost, quality, delivery, and market share.  Tapping into suppliers as a source of innovation requires an extensive process characterized by development of technology sharing, but also involves managing intellectual&lt;ref&gt;New Product Development:  Supplier Integration Strategies for Success.   R. Monczka, R. Handfield, D. Frayer, G. Ragatz, and T. Scannell,  Milwaukee, WI: ASQ Press, January, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; property issues.

; Manufacturing flow management process
: The manufacturing process produces and supplies products to the distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible in order to respond to market changes and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times, meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency in meeting customer demand. This process manages activities related to planning, scheduling, and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites, and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographical and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.

; Physical distribution
: This concerns the movement of a finished product or service to customers. In physical distribution, the customer is the final destination of a marketing channel, and the availability of the product or service is a vital part of each channel participant's marketing effort. It is also through the physical distribution process that the time and space of customer service become an integral part of marketing. Thus it links a marketing channel with its customers (i.e., it links manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers).

; [[Outsourcing]]/partnerships
: This includes not just the outsourcing of the procurement of materials and components, but also the outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain in which it has a distinctive advantage and outsource everything else. This movement has been particularly evident in [[logistics]], where the provision of transport, storage, and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, managing and controlling this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of central and local involvement: strategic decisions are taken centrally, while the monitoring and control of supplier performance and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners are best managed locally.

; [[Performance measurement]]
: Experts found a strong relationship from the largest arcs of supplier and customer integration to market share and profitability. Taking advantage of supplier capabilities and emphasizing a long-term supply-chain perspective in customer relationships can both be correlated with a firm's performance. As logistics competency becomes a critical factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, measuring logistics performance becomes increasingly important, because the difference between profitable and unprofitable operations becomes narrower. A.T. Kearney Consultants (1985) noted that firms engaging in comprehensive performance measurement realized improvements in overall productivity. According to experts{{According to whom|date=July 2015}}, internal measures are generally collected and analyzed by the firm, including cost, customer service, productivity, asset measurement, and quality. External performance is measured through customer perception measures and "[[best practice]]" benchmarking.

; [[Warehouse management system|Warehousing management]]
: To reduce a company's cost and expenses, warehousing management is concerned with storage, reducing manpower cost, dispatching authority with on time delivery, loading &amp; unloading facilities with proper area, inventory management system etc.

; [[Workflow management system|Workflow management]]
: Integrating suppliers and customers tightly into a [[workflow]] (or [[business process]]) and thereby achieving an efficient and effective supply chain is a key goal of workflow management.

==Theories==
There are gaps in the literature on supply chain management studies at present (2015){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}: there is no theoretical support for explaining the existence or the boundaries of supply chain management. A few authors, such as Halldorsson et al. (2003), Ketchen and Hult (2006), and Lavassani et al. (2009), have tried to provide theoretical foundations for different areas related to supply chain by employing organizational theories, which may include the following:
* [[Resource-based view]] (RBV)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kozlenkova|first=Irina V.|last2=Samaha|first2=Stephen A.|last3=Palmatier|first3=Robert W.|date=2014-01-01|title=Resource-based theory in marketing|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257730291_Resource-Based_Theory_in_Marketing|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|volume=42|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1007/s11747-013-0336-7|issn=0092-0703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[unit of analysis]] of most of these theories is not the supply chain but rather another system, such as the firm or the supplier-buyer relationship. Among the few exceptions is the [[relational view]], which outlines a theory for considering dyads and networks of firms as a key unit of analysis for explaining superior individual firm performance (Dyer and Singh, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/259056 | volume=23 | title=The Relational View: Cooperative Strategy and Sources of Interorganizational Competitive Advantage | journal=The Academy of Management Review | pages=660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supply chain ==
In the study of supply-chain management, the concept of centroids has become an important economic consideration. A centroid is a location that has a high proportion of a country's population and a high proportion of its manufacturing, generally within {{convert|500|mi|0|abbr=on}}. In the US, two major supply chain centroids have been defined, one near [[Dayton, Ohio]], and a second near [[Riverside, California]].

The centroid near Dayton is particularly important because it is closest to the population center of the US and Canada. Dayton is within 500&amp;nbsp;miles of 60% of the US population and manufacturing capacity, as well as 60% of Canada's population.&lt;ref name="daytondailynews.com"&gt;Doug Page,[http://www.daytondailynews.com/business/dayton-region-a-crucial-hub-for-supply-chain-managment-457836.html  "Dayton Region a Crucial Hub for Supply Chain Management"] [[Dayton Daily News]], 2009-12-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The region includes the interchange between I-70 and I-75, one of the busiest in the nation, with 154,000 vehicles passing through per day, 30–35% of which are trucks hauling goods. In addition, the I-75 corridor is home to the busiest north-south rail route east of the Mississippi River.&lt;ref name="daytondailynews.com"/&gt;

Wal-Mart strategic sourcing approaches
	Direct sourcing from suppliers-In 2010, Wal-Mart announced what would be a big change in its sourcing strategy. Initially, Wal-Mart relied on the intermediaries in the sourcing process. It bought only 20% of its stock directly but the rests were bought through the intermediaries (Cmuscm, 2014). Therefore, the company came to realize that the presence of many intermediaries in the product sourcing was actually increasing the costs in the supply chain. To cut these costs, Wall-Mart decided to do away with intermediaries in the supply chain and started direct sourcing of its goods from the suppliers. Eduardo Castro-Wright the then vice president of Wal-Mart set an ambitious goal of buying 80% of all Wal-Mart goods directly from the suppliers (Lu, 2014).  Walmart started purchasing fruits and vegetables on a global scale where it interacted directly with the suppliers of these goods. It later engaged the suppliers of other goods such as cloth and home electronics appliances directly and eliminated the importing agents.One advantage of this strategy of direct sourcing is that the supplier and the purchaser collaborate in finding goods of the highest quality that would appeal to the consumers. Moreover, the purchaser in this case Wal-Mart can easily direct the suppliers on how to manufacture certain products so that they can be acceptable to the consumers (Gilmorte, 2010). Thus, Wal-Mart through direct sourcing manages to get the exact product quality as it expects since it engages the suppliers in the producing of these products hence quality consistency (Lu, 2014). Using agents in the sourcing process in most cases lead to inconsistency in the quality of the products since the agent's source the products from different manufacturers which have varying qualities.
 Wal-Mart managed to source directly 80%v profit its stock and this has greatly eliminated the intermediaries and cut down the costs between 5-15% as markups that are introduced by these middlemen in the supply chain hence saving approximately $4–15 billion (Cmuscm, 2014). This strategy of direct sourcing not only helped WalMart in reducing the costs in the supply chain but also helped in the improvement of supply chain activities through boosting efficiency throughout the entire process. In other words, direct sourcing reduced the time that takes the company to source and stocks the products in its stock (Lu, 2014). The presence of the intermediaries elongated the time in the process of procurement which sometimes led to delays in the supply of the commodities in the stores thus, customers finding empty shelves.
Creation of procurement centers- WalMart adopted this strategy of sourcing through centralizing the entire process of procurement and sourcing by setting up four global merchandizing points for general goods and clothing. The company instructed all the suppliers to be bringing their products to these central points that are located in different markets (Gilmorte, 2010). The procurement team assesses the quality brought by the suppliers and buys the goods and distributes them to various regional markets. The procurement and sourcing at centralized places helped the company to consolidate the suppliers.
 The company has established four centralized points including an office in Mexico City and Canada. Just a mere piloting test on the combining the purchase of fresh apples across the United States, Mexico, and Canada led to the savings of about 10%. As a result, the company intended to increase centralization of its procurement in the North America for all its fresh fruits and vegetables (Cmuscm, 2014). Thus, centralization of the procurement process to various points where the suppliers would be meeting with the procurement team is the latest strategy which the company is implementing and signs show that this strategy is going to cut costs and also improve the efficiency of the procumbent process.
 Strategic vendor partnerships are another strategy the company is using in the sourcing process. WalMart realized that in order for it to ensure consistency in the quality of the products it offers to the consumers and also maintains a steady supply of goods in its stores at a lower cost, it had to create strategic vendor partnerships with the suppliers (Cmuscm, 2014). WalMart identified and selected the suppliers who met its demand and at the same time offered it the best prices for the goods. It then made a strategic relationship with these vendors by offering and assuring the long-term and high volume of purchases in exchange for the lowest possible prices (Lu, 2014). Thus, the company has managed to source its products from same suppliers as bulky but at lower prices. This enables the company to offer competitive prices of its products in its stores hence, maintaining a competitive advantage over its competitors whose goods are a little expensive compared to those of WalMart.
	Efficient communication relationship with the vendor networks to improve the material flow is another sourcing strategy Wal-Mart uses. The company has all the contacts with the suppliers whom they communicate regularly and make dates on when the goods would be needed so that the suppliers get ready to deliver the goods in time (Wisner, Leong, &amp; Tan, 2005).   The efficient communication between the company’s procurement team and the inventory management team enables the company source goods and fill its shelves on time without causing delays and empty shelves (Roberts, 2002).  In other words, the company realized that in ensuring a steady flow of the goods into the store, the suppliers have to be informed early enough so that they can act accordingly to avoid delays in the delivery of goods (Lu, 2014).  Thus, efficient communication is another tool which WalMart is using to make the supply chain to be more efficient and cutting the costs.
Cross-docking is another strategy that WalMart is using to cut costs in its supply chain. Cross-docking is the process of transferring goods directly from inbound trucks to outbound trucks (Cmuscm, 2014). When the trucks of from the suppliers arrive at the distribution centers, most of the trucks are not offloaded to keep the goods in the distribution centers or warehouses, but they are transferred directly to another truck designated to deliver goods to specific retail stores for sale.  Cross-docking helps in saving the storage costs (Gilmorte, 2010). Initially, the company was incurring considerable costs of storing the suppliers from the suppliers in its warehouses and the distributions centers to await the distribution trucks to the retail stores in various regions.

==Tax-efficient supply-chain management==
'''Tax-efficient supply-chain management''' is a business model that considers the effect of tax in the design and implementation of supply chain management. As the consequence of [[globalization]], cross-national businesses pay different tax rates in different countries. Due to these differences, they may legally optimize their supply chain and increase profits based on [[tax efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investorwords.com/4893/tax_efficient.html|title=What is Tax-efficient? definition and meaning|website=InvestorWords.com|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability and social responsibility in supply chains==
[[Supply-chain sustainability]] is a business issue affecting an organization's supply chain or logistics network, and is frequently quantified by comparison with SECH ratings, which uses a triple bottom line incorporating economic, social, and environmental aspects.&lt;ref&gt;Khairul Anuar Rusli, Azmawani Abd Rahman and Ho, J.A. Green Supply
Chain Management in Developing Countries: A Study of Factors and Practices
in Malaysia. Paper presented at the 11th International Annual Symposium on
Sustainability Science and Management (UMTAS) 2012, Kuala Terengganu,
9–11 July 2012. [http://fullpaperumtas2012.umt.edu.my/files/2012/07/BE03-ORAL-PP-278-285.pdf See publication here]&lt;/ref&gt; SECH ratings are defined as social, ethical, cultural, and health' footprints. Consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of their purchases and companies' SECH ratings and, along with [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), are setting the agenda for transitions to organically grown foods, [[anti-sweatshop]] labor codes, and locally produced goods that support independent and small businesses. Because supply chains may account for over 75% of a company's carbon footprint, many organizations are exploring ways to reduce this and thus improve their SECH rating.

For example, in July 2009, [[Wal-Mart]] announced its intentions to create a global [[sustainability]] index that would rate products according to the environmental and social impacts of their manufacturing and distribution. The index is intended to create environmental accountability in Wal-Mart's supply chain and to provide motivation and [[infrastructure]] for other retail companies to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retailindustry.about.com/b/2009/07/20/u-s-green-retailing-update-will-wal-mart-profit-from-high-supply-chain-standards-while-its-own-environmental-standards-are-low.htm|title=Fun Facts About the Supply Chain and Logistics That Put Cereal On Your Table|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been reported that companies are increasingly taking environmental performance into account when selecting suppliers.  A 2011 survey by the [[Carbon Trust]] found that 50% of multinationals expect to select their suppliers based upon carbon performance in the future and 29% of suppliers could lose their places on 'green supply chains' if they do not have adequate performance records on carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/news/2011/11/indirect-carbon-emissions-and-why-they-matter|title=Indirect carbon emissions and why they matter | publisher =Carbon Trust|date=7 Nov 2011|accessdate=28 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]], signed into law by President Obama in July 2010, contained a supply chain sustainability provision in the form of the Conflict Minerals law. This law requires SEC-regulated companies to conduct third party audits of their supply chains in order to determine whether any tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold (together referred to as ''[[conflict minerals]]'') is mined or sourced from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and create a report (available to the general public and SEC) detailing the due diligence efforts taken and the results of the audit. The chain of suppliers and vendors to these reporting companies will be expected to provide appropriate supporting information.

Incidents like the [[2013 Savar building collapse]] with more than 1,100 victims have led to widespread discussions about [[corporate social responsibility]] across global supply chains. Wieland and Handfield (2013) suggest that companies need to audit products and suppliers and that supplier auditing needs to go beyond direct relationships with first-tier suppliers. They also demonstrate that visibility needs to be improved if supply cannot be directly controlled and that smart and electronic technologies play a key role to improve visibility. Finally, they highlight that collaboration with local partners, across the industry and with universities is crucial to successfully managing social responsibility in supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Wieland and Robert B. Handfield (2013): The Socially Responsible Supply Chain: An Imperative for Global Corporations. Supply Chain Management Review, Vol. 17, No. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Circular supply-chain management ==
Circular Supply-Chain Management (CSCM) is  "the configuration and coordination of the organisational functions marketing, sales, R&amp;D, production, logistics, IT, finance, and customer service within and across business units and organizations to close, slow, intensify, narrow, and dematerialise material and energy loops to minimise resource input into and waste and emission leakage out of the system, improve its operative effectiveness and efficiency and generate competitive advantages". By reducing resource input and waste leakage along the supply chain and configure it to enable the recirculation of resources at different stages of the product or service lifecycle, potential economic and environmental benefits can be achieved. These comprise e.g. a decrease in material and waste management cost and reduced emissions and resource consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geissdoerfer|first=Martin|last2=Morioka|first2=Sandra Naomi|last3=de Carvalho|first3=Marly Monteiro|last4=Evans|first4=Steve|date=July 2018|title=Business models and supply chains for the circular economy|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|volume=190|pages=712–721|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.04.159|issn=0959-6526}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

===Management components===
SCM components are the third element of the four-square circulation framework. The level of integration and management of a business process link is a function of the number and level of components added to the link.&lt;ref&gt;(Ellram and Cooper, 1990; Houlihan, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, adding more management components or increasing the level of each component can increase the level of integration of the business process link.

Literature on business process re-engineering&lt;ref&gt;Macneil ,1975; Williamson, 1974; Hewitt, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; buyer-supplier relationships,&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, 1989; Ellram and Cooper, 1993; Ellram and Cooper, 1990; Houlihan, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and SCM&lt;ref&gt;Cooper ''et al.'', 1997; Lambert ''et al.'',1996; Turnbull, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; suggests various possible components that should receive managerial attention when managing supply relationships. Lambert and Cooper (2000) identified the following components:
* Planning and control
* Work structure
* Organization structure
* Product flow facility structure
* Information flow facility structure
* Management methods
* Power and leadership structure
* Risk and reward structure
* Culture and attitude

However, a more careful examination of the existing literature&lt;ref&gt;Zhang and Dilts, 2004 ;Vickery ''et al.'', 2003; Hemila, 2002; Christopher, 1998; Joyce ''et al.'', 1997; Bowersox and Closs, 1996; Williamson, 1991; Courtright ''et al.'', 1989; Hofstede, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; leads to a more comprehensive understanding of what should be the key critical supply chain components, or "branches" of the previously identified supply chain business processes—that is, what kind of relationship the components may have that are related to suppliers and customers. Bowersox and Closs (1996) state that the emphasis on cooperation represents the synergism leading to the highest level of joint achievement. A primary-level channel participant is a business that is willing to participate in responsibility for inventory ownership or assume other financial risks, thus including primary level components (Bowersox and Closs, 1996). A secondary-level participant (specialized) is a business that participates in channel relationships by performing essential services for primary participants, including secondary level components, which support primary participants. Third-level channel participants and components that support primary-level channel participants and are the fundamental branches of secondary-level components may also be included.

Consequently, Lambert and Cooper's framework of supply chain components does not lead to any conclusion about what are the primary- or secondary-level (specialized) supply chain components (see Bowersox and Closs, 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;93) —that is, which supply chain components should be viewed as primary or secondary, how these components should be structured in order to achieve a more comprehensive supply chain structure, and how to examine the supply chain as an integrative one (See above sections 2.1 and 3.1).

===Reverse supply chain===
[[Reverse logistics]] is the process of managing the return of goods. It is also referred to as "aftermarket customer services". Any time money is taken from a company's warranty reserve or service logistics budget, one can speak of a reverse logistics operation.
Reverse logistics is also the process of managing the return of goods from store, which the returned goods are sent back to warehouse and after that either warehouse scrap the goods or send them back to supplier for replacement depending on the warranty of the merchandise.

==Systems and value==
Supply chain systems configure value for those that organize the networks. Value is the additional revenue over and above the costs of building the network. Co-creating value and sharing the benefits appropriately to encourage effective participation is a key challenge for any supply system. Tony Hines defines value as follows: "Ultimately it is the customer who pays the price for service delivered that confirms value and not the producer who simply adds cost until that point".&lt;ref name="Hines, T 2004"/&gt;

==Global applications==
Global supply chains pose challenges regarding both quantity and value. Supply and value chain trends include:
* [[Globalization]]
* Increased cross-border sourcing
* Collaboration for parts of value chain with low-cost providers
* Shared service centers for logistical and administrative functions
* Increasingly global operations, which require increasingly global coordination and planning to achieve global optimums
* Complex problems involve also midsized companies to an increasing degree

These trends have many benefits for manufacturers because they make possible larger lot sizes, lower taxes, and better environments (e.g., culture, infrastructure, special tax zones, or sophisticated OEM) for their products. There are many additional challenges when the scope of supply chains is global. This is because with a supply chain of a larger scope, the lead time is much longer, and because there are more issues involved, such as multiple currencies, policies, and laws. The consequent problems include different currencies and valuations in different countries, different tax laws, different trading protocols, vulnerability to natural disasters and cyber threats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inboundlogistics.com/cms/article/5-steps-to-protect-your-supply-chain-from-cyber-threats/ Demrovsky, Chloe. ''5 Steps to Protect Your Supply Chain From Cyber Threats''. Inbound Logistics, May 4, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of transparency of cost and profit.

==Supply chain consulting==
'''Supply-chain consulting''' is the providing of expert knowledge in order to assess the productivity of a [[supply-chain]] and, ideally, to enhance the productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cscmp.org/|title=Home|first=Advanced Solutions International,|last=Inc.|website=cscmp.org|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supply chain Consulting is a service involved in transfer of knowledge on how to exploit existing assets through improved coordination and can hence be a source of competitive advantage; Hereby the role of the consultant is to help management by adding value to the whole process through the various sectors from the ordering of the raw materials to the final product.&lt;ref&gt;S. H. Ma, Y. Lin, Supply chain management, Beijing, China, Machinery Industry Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On this regard, firms either build internal teams of consultants to tackle the issue or use external ones, (companies choose between these two approaches taking into consideration various factors).&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Conley-Tyler, A fundamental choice: internal or external evaluation?, Evaluation Journal of Australasia, Vol. 4 (new series), Nos. 1 &amp; 2, March/April 2005, pp. 3–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of external consultants is a common practice among companies.&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, B &amp; Sifonis, JG 1994, Dynamic planning: the art of managing beyond tomorrow, Oxford University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;  The whole consulting process generally involves the analysis of the entire supply-chain process, including the countermeasures or correctives to take to achieve a better overall performance.&lt;ref&gt;Shuangqin Liu and Bo Wu, Study on the Supply Chain Management of Global Companies&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==

=== Skills and competencies ===
Supply chain professionals need to have knowledge of managing supply chain functions such as transportation, [[warehousing]], [[inventory management]], and [[production planning]]. In the past, supply chain professionals emphasized [[logistics]] skills, such as knowledge of [[shipping]] routes, familiarity with warehousing equipment and [[distribution center]] locations and footprints, and a solid grasp of [[freight rate]]s and fuel costs. More recently, supply chain management extends to logistical support across firms and management of global supply chains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmr.com/article/skills_and_competencies_that_supply_chain_professionals_will_need|title=Skills and Competencies That Supply Chain Professionals Will Need|website=www.scmr.com|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Supply chain professionals need to have an understanding of [[business continuity]] basics and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Betty A. Kildow (2011), Supply Chain Management Guide to Business Continuity, American Management Association, {{ISBN|9780814416457}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roles and responsibilities ===

Supply chain professionals play major roles in the design and management of supply chains. In the design of supply chains, they help determine whether a product or service is provided by the firm itself (insourcing) or by another firm elsewhere (outsourcing). In the management of supply chains, supply chain professionals coordinate production among multiple providers, ensuring that production and transport of goods happen with minimal quality control or inventory problems. One goal of a well-designed and maintained supply chain for a product is to successfully build the product at minimal cost. Such a supply chain could be considered a competitive advantage for a firm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Enver Yücesan, (2007) Competitive Supply Chains a Value-Based Management Perspective, PALGRAVE MACMILLAN, {{ISBN|9780230515673}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Blanchard (2007), Supply Chain Management Best Practices, Wiley, {{ISBN|9780471781417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond design and maintenance of a supply chain itself, supply chain professionals participate in aspects of business that have a bearing on supply chains, such as [[sales forecasting]], [[quality management]], strategy development, [[customer service]], and [[systems analysis]]. Production of a good may evolve over time, rendering an existing supply chain design obsolete. Supply chain professionals need to be aware of changes in production and business climate that affect supply chains and create alternative supply chains as the need arises.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Individuals working in supply chain management can attain a [[professional certification]] by passing an exam developed by a third party certification organizations. The purpose of certification is to guarantee a certain level of expertise in the field.

=== Education ===
The knowledge needed to pass a certification exam may be gained from several sources. Some knowledge may come from college courses, but most of it is acquired from a mix of on-the-job learning experiences, attending industry events, learning best practices with their peers, and reading books and articles in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Scott (2011), Guide to Supply Chain Management, Springer, {{ISBN|9783642176753}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certification organizations may provide certification workshops tailored to their exams.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Ptak &amp; Chad Smith (2011), Orlicky's 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill {{ISBN|978-0-07-175563-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also [http://scm.ncsu.edu free websites] that provide a significant amount of educational articles, as well as [http://scm.ncsu.edu/blog blogs] that are internationally recognized which provide good sources of news and updates.

=== Rankings ===
The following North American universities rank high in their master's education in the SCM World University 100 ranking, which was published in 2017 and which is based on the opinions of supply chain managers: [[Michigan State University]], [[Penn State University]], [[University of Tennessee]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Arizona State University]], [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Western Michigan University]]. In the same ranking, the following European universities rank high: [[Cranfield School of Management]], [[Vlerick Business School]], [[INSEAD]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], [[London Business School]] and [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmworld.com/top-100-universities|title=University 100 - SCM World|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 Eduniversal Best Masters Ranking Supply Chain and Logistics the following universities rank high: [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[KEDGE Business School]], [[Purdue University]], [[Rotterdam School of Management]], [[Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru]], [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]], [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]] and [[Copenhagen Business School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.best-masters.com/ranking-master-supply-chain-and-logistics.html|title=Master Supply Chain and Logistics Ranking master Supply Chain and Logistics|website=www.best-masters.com|accessdate=26 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizations ===

There are a number of organizations that provide certification exams, such as CSCMP (Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals), IIPMR (International Institute for Procurement and Market Research), APICS (the Association for Operations Management), ISCEA (The International Supply Chain Education Alliance) and IoSCM ([[Institute of Supply Chain Management]]). APICS' certification is called ''Certified Supply Chain Professional'', or CSCP, and ISCEA'S certification is called the ''Certified Supply Chain Manager'' (CSCM), CISCM (Chartered Institute of Supply Chain Management) awards certificate as ''Chartered Supply Chain Management Professional'' (CSCMP). Another, the Institute for Supply Management, is developing one called the ''Certified Professional in Supply Management'' (CPSM)&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;David Jacoby, 2009, Guide to Supply Chain Management: How Getting it Right Boosts Corporate Performance (The Economist Books), Bloomberg Press; 1st edition, {{ISBN|9781576603451}}. Chapter 10, Organising, training and developing staff&lt;/ref&gt; focused on the procurement and sourcing areas of supply chain management.  The Supply Chain Management Association (SCMA) is the main certifying body for Canada with the designations having global reciprocity. The designation Supply Chain Management Professional (SCMP) is the title of the supply chain leadership designation.

==Base of the pyramid and the William Davidson Institute==

London is vice president of the Scaling Impact Initiative and a senior research fellow at the [[William Davidson Institute]]. The Scaling Impact Initiative champions innovative ways of thinking about building better enterprises for BoP markets, with a particular focus on developing strategies and frameworks that enable enterprise leaders better navigate the journey to sustainability at scale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdi.umich.edu/people/ted-london/ William Davidson Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic experience and research==

London received his [[PhD]] in [[strategic management]] from the [[Kenan-Flagler Business School]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC). He was also an assistant professor of entrepreneurship, teaching strategic management, international business and poverty alleviation, and sustainable enterprise at UNC.

At UNC, London was the director of the BoP Learning Laboratory a consortium of companies, nonprofit organizations, multilateral institutions and academics that explores the opportunities and challenges associated with entering Base of the Pyramid markets.

London’s research interests center on business and development strategies in low income markets, assessment of poverty alleviation impacts, and capability development for cross-sector collaborations.   He has received awards and recognition for his research, teaching, and case writing, including winning the oikos Sustainability Case Writing Competition in 2005 and 2008, the Page Prize in 2011, the Samsung Best Paper Award in 2010, and the Doug Nigh Award in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oikos-international.org/publications/building-a-sustainable-venture-from-the-ground-up-the-mountains-institutes-earth-brick-machine/ Oikos Case Programme Site 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oikos-international.org/publications/scojo-foundation/ Oikos Case Programme Site 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://moore.sc.edu/about/sustainableenterprisedevelopment/pageprize/pageprize2011.aspx Page Prize Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://divtest.aom.org/im/recent-awards-winners/ Samsung Best Paper Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://divtest.aom.org/im/recent-awards-winners/ Doug Nigh Award]&lt;/ref&gt;

London’s work has been published in a number of academic and practitioner journals, and he has written several book chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ted-london University of Michigan: Ted London Biographical Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, the Harvard Business Review published London's paper entitled "Making Better Investments at the Base of the Pyramid". The article introduces London's Base of the Pyramid Impact Assessment Framework, a tool used to explore how ventures influence the well-being of local buyers, sellers, and communities. The Impact Assessment Framework guides managers through a detailed look at an organization's effects on those constituencies in three areas: economics, capabilities, and relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2009/05/making-better-investments-at-the-base-of-the-pyramid Harvard Business Review Article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, ''Next Generation Business Strategies for the Base of the Pyramid: New Approaches for Building Mutual Value'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;[https://nextgenerationbop.com/ Next Generation Business Strategies Book Site]&lt;/ref&gt;  Co-editors, London and [[Stuart L. Hart]], along with nine other leading BoP thought and practice leaders, focus on second-generation BoP innovations, techniques and business models that create value with the BoP. They identify ways to conceptualize opportunities, create sustainable business ecosystems, design new technologies with BoP in mind, and even transform entire sectors through collaborative entrepreneurship.

In 2012, WDI team members London and Ravi Anupindi published an article entitled "Using the base-of-the-pyramid perspective to catalyze interdependence-based collaborations." This article argues that in order for both donor- and enterprise-led value chain initiatives to be both scalable and sustainable, a BoP perspective must be taken so that development and business efforts are better integrated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/109/31/12338.full.pdf 2012 London and Anupindi Article]&lt;/ref&gt; The article’s research was funded by [[USAID]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].

In 2015, London wrote a book entitled  ''The Base of the Pyramid Promise'', which was published in early 2016.

London also has consulted for a variety of companies, non-profit organizations, and multilateral institutions in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, and the U.S.. This has involved exploring entry into base of the pyramid markets, examining cross-sector alliances between companies and non-profit organizations, and assessing poverty alleviation implications of BoP ventures.  He also serves on advisory boards for [[VisionSpring]] (formerly Scojo Foundation),  NextBillion, the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), and the Sasakawa Peace Foundation.

==Professional experience==
London was a [[design engineer]] for [[General Motors]] after graduating from [[Lehigh University]] in 1985 with a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in [[Mechanical Engineering]]. A few years later he received his MBA from the Peter Drucker Graduate Management Center at [[Claremont Graduate University]] and went to work for Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells as a senior consultant in [[business valuation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wdi.umich.edu/people/ted-london/ William Davidson Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 London joined the [[Peace Corps]] in Africa and co-managed a regional business development program in [[Malawi]].{{cn|date=July 2016}} Three years later, he was in Asia serving as general manager for an [[Indonesia]]n joint venture operated by McCormick Spices.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In 1993, London served as a director of a multi-country initiative in the Asia/Pacific Region that linked income generation and environmental protection for Conservation International.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Three years later, London became executive director of a non-profit providing business development services to companies in Northern Virginia before pursuing his [[PhD]] at [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://michiganross.umich.edu/faculty-research/faculty/ted-london See CV at University of Michigan Ross School of Business Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Internet Marketing}}

'''Web analytics''' is the measurement, [[data collection|collection]], analysis and reporting of web [[Data (computing)|data]] for purposes of understanding and optimizing [[web usage]].&lt;ref&gt;WAA Standards Committee. "Web analytics definitions." Washington DC: Web Analytics Association (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Web analytics is not just a process for measuring [[web traffic]] but can be used as a tool for business and [[market research]], and to assess and improve the effectiveness of a [[website]]. Web analytics applications can also help companies measure the results of traditional print or broadcast [[advertising campaign]]s. It helps one to estimate how traffic to a website changes after the launch of a new advertising campaign. Web analytics provides information about the number of visitors to a website and the number of page views. It helps gauge traffic and popularity trends which is useful for market research.

==Basic steps of the web analytics process==
[[File:Basic Steps of Web Analytics Process.png|thumb|Basic Steps of Web Analytics Process]]

Most web analytics processes come down to four essential stages or steps,&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, B. J. (2009). Understanding user-web interactions via web analytics. Synthesis Lectures on Information Concepts, Retrieval, and Services, 1(1), 1-102.&lt;/ref&gt; which are:
* Collection of data: This stage is the collection of the basic, elementary data. Usually, these data are counts of things. The objective of this stage is to gather the data.
* Processing of data into information: This stage usually take counts and make them ratios, although there still may be some counts. The objective of this stage is to take the data and conform it into information, specifically metrics.
* Developing KPI: This stage focuses on using the ratios (and counts) and infusing them with business strategies, referred to as [[key performance indicators]] (KPI). Many times, KPIs deal with conversion aspects, but not always. It depends on the organization.
* Formulating online strategy: This stage is concerned with the online goals, objectives, and standards for the organization or business. These strategies are usually related to making money, saving money, or increasing marketshare.

Another essential function developed by the analysts for the optimization of the websites are the experiments

* Experiments and testings: [[A/B testing]] is a controlled experiment with two variants, in online settings, such as web development. 
The goal of A/B testing is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize a statistically tested result of interest.

Each stage impacts or can impact (i.e., drives) the stage preceding or following it. So, sometimes the data that is available for collection impacts the online strategy. Other times, the online strategy affects the data collected.

===Web analytics technologies===
There are at least two categories of web analytics; ''off-site'' and ''on-site'' web analytics.
* Off-site web analytics refers to web measurement and analysis regardless of whether you own or maintain a website. It includes the measurement of a website's ''potential'' audience (opportunity), share of voice (visibility), and buzz (comments) that is happening on the Internet as a whole.
* On-site web analytics, the more common of the two, measure a visitor's behavior once ''on your website''. This includes its drivers and conversions; for example, the degree to which different [[landing page]]s are associated with online purchases. On-site web analytics measures the performance of your website in a commercial context. This data is typically compared against [[key performance indicators]] for performance, and used to improve a website or [[marketing campaign]]'s audience response. [[Google Analytics|Google&amp;nbsp;Analytics]]&amp;nbsp;and [[Adobe Analytics]]&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;most&amp;nbsp;widely used on-site web analytics service; although new tools are emerging that provide additional layers of information, including [[heat map]]s and [[session replay]].

Historically, web analytics has been used to refer to on-site visitor measurement. However, this meaning has become blurred, mainly because vendors are producing tools that span both categories. Many different vendors provide on-site [[List of web analytics software|web analytics software]] and [[List of web analytics software#Hosted .2F Software as a service|services]]. There are two main technical ways of collecting the data. The first and traditional method, ''server log file analysis'', reads the [[server log|logfiles]] in which the [[web server]] records file requests by browsers. The second method, ''[[Tag (metadata)|page tagging]]'', uses [[JavaScript]] embedded in the webpage to make image requests to a third-party analytics-dedicated server, whenever a webpage is rendered by a [[web browser]] or, if desired, when a mouse click occurs. Both collect data that can be processed to produce web traffic reports.

===Web analytics data sources===
The fundamental goal of web analytics is to collect and analyze data related to web traffic and usage patterns. The data mainly comes from four sources:&lt;ref&gt;Zheng, G. &amp; Peltsverger S. (2015) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272815693_Web_Analytics_Overview Web Analytics Overview], In book: Encyclopedia of Information Science and Technology, Third Edition, Publisher: IGI Global, Editors: Mehdi Khosrow-Pour&lt;/ref&gt;
# Direct HTTP request data: directly comes from HTTP request messages (HTTP request headers).
# Network level and server generated data associated with HTTP requests: not part of an HTTP request, but it is required for successful request transmissions. For example, IP address of a requester.
# Application level data sent with HTTP requests: generated and processed by application level programs (such as JavaScript, PHP, and ASP.Net), including session and referrals. These are usually captured by internal logs rather than public web analytics services.
# External data: can be combined with on-site data to help augment the website behavior data described above and interpret web usage. For example, IP addresses are usually associated with Geographic regions and internet service providers, e-mail open and click-through rates, direct mail campaign data, sales and lead history, or other data types as needed.

===Web server log file analysis===

Web servers record some of their transactions in a log file. It was soon realized that these log files could be read by a program to provide data on the popularity of the website. Thus arose [[web log analysis software]].
 
In the early 1990s, website statistics consisted primarily of counting the number of client requests (or ''hits'') made to the web server. This was a reasonable method initially, since each website often consisted of a single HTML file. However, with the introduction of images in HTML, and websites that spanned multiple HTML files, this count became less useful. The first true commercial Log Analyzer was released by IPRO in 1994.&lt;ref name="web-data-sources"&gt;[http://www.advanced-web-metrics.com/docs/web-data-sources.pdf Web Traffic Data Sources and Vendor Comparison] by Brian Clifton and Omega Digital Media Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Two units of measure were introduced in the mid-1990s to gauge more accurately the amount of human activity on web servers. These were ''page views'' and ''visits'' (or ''sessions''). A ''[[page view]]'' was defined as a request made to the web server for a page, as opposed to a graphic, while a ''visit'' was defined as a sequence of requests from a uniquely identified client that expired after a certain amount of inactivity, usually 30 minutes. The page views and visits are still commonly displayed metrics, but are now considered{{By whom||date=February 2013}} rather rudimentary.

The emergence of [[Web crawler|search engine spiders]] and robots in the late 1990s, along with [[Proxy server|web proxies]] and [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|dynamically assigned IP addresses]] for large companies and [[Internet service provider|ISPs]], made it more difficult to identify unique human visitors to a website. Log analyzers responded by tracking visits by [[HTTP cookie|cookies]], and by ignoring requests from known spiders.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The extensive use of [[web cache]]s also presented a problem for log file analysis. If a person revisits a page, the second request will often be retrieved from the browser's cache, and so no request will be received by the web server. This means that the person's path through the site is lost. Caching can be defeated by configuring the web server, but this can result in degraded performance for the visitor and bigger load on the servers.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Management: A Value-Creation Process (2nd Edition) by Alain Jolibert, Pierre-Louis Dubois, Hans Mühlbacher, Laurent Flores, Pierre-Louis Jolibert Dubois, 2012, p. 359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page tagging===

Concerns about the accuracy of log file analysis in the presence of caching, and the desire to be able to perform web analytics as an outsourced service, led to the second data collection method, page tagging or '[[Web beacon|Web bugs]]'. 
 
In the mid-1990s, [[Web counter]]s were commonly seen &amp;mdash; these were images included in a web page that showed the number of times the image had been requested, which was an estimate of the number of visits to that page. In the late 1990s this concept evolved to include a small invisible image instead of a visible one, and, by using JavaScript, to pass along with the image request certain information about the page and the visitor. This information can then be processed remotely by a web analytics company, and extensive statistics generated.

The web analytics service also manages the process of assigning a cookie to the user, which can uniquely identify them during their visit and in subsequent visits. Cookie acceptance rates vary significantly between websites and may affect the quality of data collected and reported.

Collecting website data using a third-party data collection server (or even an in-house data collection server) requires an additional [[Domain Name System|DNS]] look-up by the user's computer to determine the IP address of the collection server. On occasion, delays in completing a successful or failed DNS look-ups may result in data not being collected.

With the increasing popularity of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]]-based solutions, an alternative to the use of an invisible image is to implement a call back to the server from the rendered page. In this case, when the page is rendered on the web browser, a piece of Ajax code would call back to the server and pass information about the client that can then be aggregated by a web analytics company. This is in some ways flawed by browser restrictions on the servers which can be contacted with [[XmlHttpRequest]] objects. Also, this method can lead to slightly lower reported traffic levels, since the visitor may stop the page from loading in mid-response before the Ajax call is made.

===Logfile analysis vs page tagging===

Both logfile analysis programs and page tagging solutions are readily available to companies that wish to perform web analytics. In some cases, the same web analytics company will offer both approaches. The question then arises of which method a company should choose. There are advantages and disadvantages to each approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advanced-web-metrics.com/blog/2008/02/16/accuracy-whitepaper/ Increasing Accuracy for Online Business Growth] - a web analytics accuracy whitepaper&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advantages of logfile analysis====

The main advantages of log file analysis over page tagging are as follows:
* The web server normally already produces log files, so the raw data is already available. No changes to the website are required.
* The data is on the company's own servers, and is in a standard, rather than a proprietary, format. This makes it easy for a company to switch programs later, use several different programs, and analyze historical data with a new program.
* Logfiles contain information on visits from search engine spiders, which generally do not execute JavaScript on a page and are therefore not recorded by page tagging. Although these should not be reported as part of the human activity, it is useful information for [[search engine optimization]].
* Logfiles require no additional [[Domain Name System|DNS]] lookups or [[Slow-start|TCP slow starts]]. Thus there are no external server calls which can slow page load speeds, or result in uncounted page views.
* The web server reliably records every transaction it makes, e.g. serving PDF documents and content generated by scripts, and does not rely on the visitors' browsers cooperating.

====Advantages of page tagging====

The main advantages of page tagging over log file analysis are as follows:

* Counting is activated by opening the page (given that the web client runs the tag scripts), not requesting it from the server. If a page is cached, it will not be counted by server-based log analysis. Cached pages can account for up to one-third of all page views. Not counting cached pages seriously skews many site metrics. It is for this reason server-based log analysis is not considered suitable for analysis of human activity on websites.{{By whom||date=October 2016}}
* Data is gathered via a component ("tag") in the page, usually written in JavaScript, though Java can be used, and increasingly Flash is used. Ajax can also be used in conjunction with a server-side scripting language (such as [[PHP]]) to manipulate and (usually) store it in a database, basically enabling complete control over how the data is represented.{{dubious|date=June 2011|reason=Also log information can easily be transformed and stored in a database}}
* The script may have access to additional information on the web client or on the user, not sent in the query, such as visitors' screen sizes and the price of the goods they purchased.
* Page tagging can report on events which do not involve a request to the web server, such as interactions within [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] movies, partial form completion, mouse events such as onClick, onMouseOver, onFocus, onBlur etc.
* The page tagging service manages the process of assigning cookies to visitors; with log file analysis, the server has to be configured to do this.
* Page tagging is available to companies who do not have access to their own web servers.
* Lately page tagging has become a standard in web analytics.&lt;ref&gt;"Revisiting log file analysis versus page tagging": McGill University Web Analytics blog article (CMIS 530) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706165119/http://web.analyticsblog.ca/2010/02/revisiting-log-file-analysis-versus-page-tagging/ |date=July 6, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic factors====

Logfile analysis is almost always performed in-house. Page tagging can be performed in-house, but it is more often provided as a third-party service. The economic difference between these two models can also be a consideration for a company deciding which to purchase.

* Logfile analysis typically involves a one-off software purchase; however, some vendors are introducing maximum annual page views with additional costs to process additional information.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In addition to commercial offerings, several [[List of web analytics software#Free / Open source (FLOSS)|open-source logfile analysis tools]] are available free of charge.
* For Logfile analysis data must be stored and archived, which often grows large quickly. Although the cost of hardware to do this is minimal, the overhead for an IT department can be considerable.
* For Logfile analysis software need to be maintained, including updates and security patches.
* Complex page tagging vendors charge a monthly fee based on volume i.e. number of page views per month collected.

Which solution is cheaper to implement depends on the amount of technical expertise within the company, the vendor chosen, the amount of activity seen on the websites, the depth and type of information sought, and the number of distinct websites needing statistics.

Regardless of the vendor solution or data collection method employed, the cost of web visitor analysis and interpretation should also be included. That is, the cost of turning raw data into actionable information. This can be from the use of third party consultants, the hiring of an experienced web analyst, or the training of a suitable in-house person. A [[cost-benefit analysis]] can then be performed. For example, what revenue increase or cost savings can be gained by analyzing the web visitor data?

===Hybrid methods===

Some companies produce solutions that collect data through both log-files and page tagging and can analyze both kinds. By using a hybrid method, they aim to produce more accurate statistics than either method on its own. An early hybrid solution was produced in 1998 by Rufus Evison. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Geolocation of visitors===
With [[IP geolocation]], it is possible to track visitors location. Using IP geolocation database or API, visitors can be geolocated to city, region or country level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipinfodb.com/ip_database.php|publisher=IPInfoDB |author=IPInfoDB|title=IP geolocation database|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IP Intelligence, or Internet Protocol (IP) Intelligence, is a technology that maps the Internet and categorizes IP addresses by parameters such as geographic location (country, region, state, city and postcode), connection type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), proxy information, and more. The first generation of IP Intelligence was referred to as [[geotargeting]] or [[geolocation]] technology. This information is used by businesses for online audience segmentation in applications such [[online advertising]], [[behavioral targeting]], content localization (or [[website localization]]), [[digital rights management]], [[personalization]], online fraud detection, localized search, enhanced analytics, global traffic management, and content distribution.

===Click analytics===
[[File:Clickpath Analysis.png|300px|thumb|right|Clickpath Analysis with referring pages on the left and arrows and rectangles differing in thickness and expanse to symbolize movement quantity.]]
[[Click analytics]] is a special type of web analytics that gives special attention to [[point-and-click|clicks]].

Commonly, [[click analytics]] focuses on on-site analytics. An editor of a website uses click analytics to determine the performance of his or her particular site, with regards to where the users of the site are clicking.

Also, [[click analytics]] may happen real-time or "unreal"-time, depending on the type of information sought. Typically, front-page editors on high-traffic news media sites will want to monitor their pages in real-time, to optimize the content. Editors, designers or other types of stakeholders may analyze clicks on a wider time frame to help them assess performance of writers, design elements or advertisements etc.

Data about clicks may be gathered in at least two ways. Ideally, a click is "logged" when it occurs, and this method requires some functionality that picks up relevant information when the event occurs. Alternatively, one may institute the assumption that a page view is a result of a click, and therefore log a simulated click that led to that page view.

===Customer lifecycle analytics===
Customer lifecycle analytics is a visitor-centric approach to measuring that falls under the umbrella of lifecycle marketing.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Page views, clicks and other events (such as API calls, access to third-party services, etc.) are all tied to an individual visitor instead of being stored as separate data points. Customer lifecycle analytics attempts to connect all the data points into a [[purchase funnel|marketing funnel]] that can offer insights into visitor behavior and [[search engine optimization|website optimization]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Other methods===

Other methods of data collection are sometimes used. Packet sniffing collects data by [[Packet sniffer|sniffing]] the network traffic passing between the web server and the outside world. Packet sniffing involves no changes to the web pages or web servers. Integrating web analytics into the web server software itself is also possible.&lt;ref name="integrated-analytics"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/int.v19:7|title=A Data Warehouse/Online Analytic Processing Framework for Web Usage Mining and Business Intelligence Reporting|first1=Xiaohua|last1=Hu|first2=Nick|last2=Cercone|date=1 July 2004|publisher=|volume=19|issue=7|pages=585–606|via=ACM Digital Library|doi=10.1002/int.v19:7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these methods claim to provide better [[real-time business intelligence|real-time]] data than other methods.

==On-site web analytics - definitions==
{{expand section|date=September 2011}}

There are no globally agreed definitions within web analytics as the industry bodies have been trying to agree on definitions that are useful and definitive for some time. The main bodies who have had input in this area have been the IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau), JICWEBS (The Joint Industry Committee for Web Standards in the UK and Ireland), and The DAA (Digital Analytics Association), formally known as the WAA (Web Analytics Association, US). However, many terms are used in consistent ways from one major analytics tool to another, so the following list, based on those conventions, can be a useful starting point:

* {{anchor|Bounce rate}} '''[[Bounce Rate]]''' - The percentage of visits that are single page visits and without any other interactions (clicks) on that page.
* '''[[Click path]]''' - the chronological sequence of page views within a visit or session.
* '''[[Hit (internet)|Hit]]''' - A request for a file from the web server.  Available only in log analysis.  The number of hits received by a website is frequently cited to assert its popularity, but this number is extremely misleading and dramatically overestimates popularity.  A single web-page typically consists of multiple (often dozens) of discrete files, each of which is counted as a hit as the page is downloaded, so the number of hits is really an arbitrary number more reflective of the complexity of individual pages on the website than the website's actual popularity.  The total number of visits or page views provides a more realistic and accurate assessment of popularity.
* '''[[Page view]]''' - A request for a file, or sometimes an event such as a mouse click, that is defined as a page in the setup of the web analytics tool.  An occurrence of the script being run in page tagging.  In log analysis, a single page view may generate multiple hits as all the resources required to view the page (images, .js and .css files) are also requested from the web server.
* '''[[unique user|Visitor / Unique Visitor / Unique User]]''' - The uniquely identified client that is generating page views or hits within a defined time period (e.g. day, week or month).  A uniquely identified client is usually a combination of a machine (one's desktop computer at work for example) and a browser (Firefox on that machine).  The identification is usually via a persistent cookie that has been placed on the computer by the site page code.  An older method, used in log file analysis, is the unique combination of the computer's IP address and the User Agent (browser) information provided to the web server by the browser.  It is important to understand that the "Visitor" is not the same as the human being sitting at the computer at the time of the visit, since an individual human can use different computers or, on the same computer, can use different browsers, and will be seen as a different visitor in each circumstance. Increasingly, but still somewhat rarely, visitors are uniquely identified by Flash LSO's ([[Local Shared Object]]), which are less susceptible to privacy enforcement.
* '''[[Visit filter|Visit / Session]]''' - A visit or session is defined as a series of page requests or, in the case of tags, image requests from the same uniquely identified client. A unique client is commonly identified by an IP address or a unique ID that is placed in the browser cookie. A visit is considered ended when no requests have been recorded in some number of elapsed minutes.  A 30-minute limit ("time out") is used by many analytics tools but can, in some tools (such as Google Analytics), be changed to another number of minutes.  Analytics data collectors and analysis tools have no reliable way of knowing if a visitor has looked at other sites between page views; a visit is considered one visit as long as the events (page views, clicks, whatever is being recorded) are 30 minutes or less closer together.  Note that a visit can consist of one page view, or thousands. A unique visit's session can also be extended if the time between page loads indicates that a visitor has been viewing the pages continuously.
* '''Active Time / Engagement Time''' - Average amount of time that visitors spend actually interacting with content on a web page, based on mouse moves, clicks, hovers and scrolls.  Unlike Session Duration and Page View Duration / Time on Page, this metric '''can''' accurately measure the length of engagement in the final page view, but it is not available in many analytics tools or data collection methods.
* '''Average Page Depth / Page Views per Average Session''' - Page Depth is the approximate "size" of an average visit, calculated by dividing total number of page views by total number of visits.
* '''Average Page View Duration''' - Average amount of time that visitors spend on an average page of the site.
* '''Click''' - "refers to a single instance of a user following a hyperlink from one page in a site to another".
* '''Event''' - A discrete action or class of actions that occurs on a website. A page view is a type of event. Events also encapsulate clicks, form submissions, keypress events, and other client-side user actions.
* '''Exit Rate / % Exit''' - A statistic applied to an individual page, not a web site.  The percentage of visits seeing a page where that page is the final page viewed in the visit.
* '''First Visit / First Session''' - (also called 'Absolute Unique Visitor' in some tools) A visit from a uniquely identified client that has theoretically not made any previous visits.  Since the only way of knowing whether the uniquely identified client has been to the site before is the presence of a [[persistent cookie]] or via digital fingerprinting that had been received on a previous visit, the ''First Visit'' label is not reliable if the site's cookies have been deleted since their previous visit.
* '''Frequency / Session per Unique''' - Frequency measures how often visitors come to a website in a given time period.  It is calculated by dividing the total number of sessions (or visits) by the total number of unique visitors during a specified time period, such as a month or year.  Sometimes it is used interchangeable with the term "loyalty."
* '''Impression''' -  The most common definition of "Impression" is an instance of an advertisement appearing on a viewed page. Note that an advertisement can be displayed on a viewed page below the area actually displayed on the screen, so most measures of impressions do not necessarily mean an advertisement has been view-able.
* '''New Visitor''' - A visitor that has not made any previous visits. This definition creates a certain amount of confusion (see common confusions below), and is sometimes substituted with analysis of first visits.
* '''Page Time Viewed / Page Visibility Time / Page View Duration''' - The time a single page (or a blog, Ad Banner...) is on the screen, measured as the calculated difference between the time of the request for that page and the time of the next recorded request.  If there is no next recorded request, then the viewing time of that instance of that page is not included in reports.
* '''Repeat Visitor''' - A visitor that has made at least one previous visit. The period between the last and current visit is called visitor recency and is measured in days.
* '''Return Visitor''' - A Unique visitor with activity consisting of a visit to a site during a reporting period and where the Unique visitor visited the site prior to the reporting period. The individual is counted only once during the reporting period.
* '''Session Duration / Visit Duration''' - Average amount of time that visitors spend on the site each time they visit.It is calculated as the sum total of the duration of all the sessions divided by the total number of sessions. This metric can be complicated by the fact that analytics programs can not measure the length of the final page view.{{cn|date=October 2018}}
* '''Single Page Visit / Singleton''' - A visit in which only a single page is viewed (this is not a 'bounce').
*'''Site Overlay''' is a report technique in which statistics (clicks) or hot spots are superimposed, by physical location, on a visual snapshot of the web page.

==Off-site web analytics==

{{expand section|date=September 2014}}
Off-site web analytics is based on open data analysis, [[social media]] exploration, share of voice on web properties.
It is usually used to understand how to market a site by identifying the keywords tagged to this site, either from social media or from other websites.

By using [[HTTP referer|HTTP Referer]], webpage owners will be able to trace which are the referrer sites that helps bring in traffic to their own site.

==Common sources of confusion in web analytics==

===The hotel problem===

The hotel problem is generally the first problem encountered by a user of web analytics. The problem is that the unique visitors for each day in a month do not add up to the same total as the unique visitors for that month. This appears to an inexperienced user to be a problem in whatever analytics software they are using. In fact it is a simple property of the metric definitions.

The way to picture the situation is by imagining a hotel. The hotel has two rooms (Room A and Room B).
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! || Day 01 || Day 02 || Day 03 || Total
|-
! Room A
| John || John || Mark || 2 Unique Users
|-
! Room B
| Mark || Jane || Jane || 2 Unique Users
|-
! Total
| 2 || 2 || 2 ||  ?
|}

As the table shows, the hotel has two unique users each day over three days. The sum of the totals with respect to the days is therefore six.

During the period each room has had two unique users. The sum of the totals with respect to the rooms is therefore four.

Actually only three visitors have been in the hotel over this period. The problem is that a person who stays in a room for two nights will get counted twice if you count them once on each day, but is only counted once if you are looking at the total for the period. Any software for web analytics will sum these correctly for the chosen time period, thus leading to the problem when a user tries to compare the totals.

==Web analytics methods==

===Problems with cookies===
Historically, vendors of page-tagging analytics solutions have used [[third-party cookie]]s sent from the vendor's domain instead of the domain of the website being browsed. Third-party cookies can handle visitors who cross multiple unrelated domains within the company's site, since the cookie is always handled by the vendor's servers.

However, third-party cookies in principle allow tracking an individual user across the sites of different companies, allowing the analytics vendor to collate the user's activity on sites where he provided personal information with his activity on other sites where he thought he was anonymous. Although web analytics companies deny doing this, other companies such as companies supplying [[web banner|banner ads]] have done so. [[Third-party cookie|Privacy concerns about cookies]] have therefore led a noticeable minority of users to block or delete third-party cookies. In 2005, some reports showed that about 28% of Internet users blocked third-party cookies and 22% deleted them at least once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McGann|first=Rob|title=Study: Consumers Delete Cookies at Surprising Rate|url=http://www.clickz.com/clickz/news/1691871/study-consumers-delete-cookies-surprising-rate|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most vendors of page tagging solutions have now moved to provide at least the option of using [[first-party cookie]]s (cookies assigned from the client subdomain).

Another problem is cookie deletion.  When web analytics depend on cookies to identify unique visitors, the statistics are dependent on a persistent cookie to hold a unique visitor ID.  When users delete cookies, they usually delete both first- and third-party cookies.  If this is done between interactions with the site, the user will appear as a first-time visitor at their next interaction point.  Without a persistent and unique visitor id, conversions, click-stream analysis, and other metrics dependent on the activities of a unique visitor over time, cannot be accurate.

Cookies are used because IP addresses are not always unique to users and may be shared by large groups or proxies.  In some cases, the IP address is combined with the user agent in order to more accurately identify a visitor if cookies are not available.  However, this only partially solves the problem because often users behind a proxy server have the same [[user agent]].  Other methods of uniquely identifying a user are technically challenging and would limit the trackable audience or would be considered suspicious.  Cookies are the selected option{{Who|date=August 2009}} because they reach the lowest common denominator without using technologies regarded as [[spyware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Home News Access the Guide Tools Education Shopping Internet Cookies- Spyware or Neutral Technology?|url=http://news.cnet.com/Clueless-about-cookies-or-spyware/2100-1029_3-5561063.html|website=CNET|publisher=February 2, 2005|accessdate=24 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secure analytics (metering) methods==

It may be good to be aware that the third-party information gathering is subject to any network limitations and security applied. Countries, Service Providers and Private Networks can prevent site visit data from going to third parties.
All the methods described above (and some other methods not mentioned here, like sampling) have the central problem of being vulnerable to manipulation (both inflation and deflation). This means these methods are imprecise and insecure (in any reasonable model of security). This issue has been addressed in a number of papers,&lt;ref&gt;

'''Whitewash Resolution''' is a proposed resolution for the waiver of rights of independent [[shareholder]]s to receive a mandatory [[takeover]] from the [[investor]] and its concert parties for the [[voting share|ordinary share]]s of the [[company]] not already owned or controlled by them.

A whitewash waiver is a [[corporate law]] concept originating in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].  In some cases an investor will apply to the Executive for the Whitewash Waiver, which, if granted, will be subject to the approval of independent shareholders.
